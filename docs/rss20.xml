	<description>Publication date: February 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Zilong   Qiu&lt;br /&gt;  MECP2 is a critical gene for neural development, mutations or duplication of which led to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: February 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Aaron   Katzman, Cristina M   Alberini&lt;br /&gt; The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for memory formation, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Clinical and animal model studies have shown that changes in PFC excitation and inhibition are important for cognitive functions as well as related disorders. Here, we discuss recent findings revealing the roles of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) and NLGN2 in the PFC in memory formation and modulation of memory strength. We propose that shifts in NLGN1 and NLGN2 expression in specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subpopulations in response to experience regulate the dynamic processes of memory consolidation and strengthening. Because excitatory/inhibitory imbalances accompany neuropsychiatric disorders in which strength and flexibility of representations play important roles, understanding these mechanisms may suggest novel therapies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Guosong   Hong, Xiao   Yang, Tao   Zhou, Charles M   Lieber&lt;br /&gt; Existing implantable neurotechnologies for understanding the brain and treating neurological diseases have intrinsic properties that have limited their capability to achieve chronically-stable brain interfaces with single-neuron spatiotemporal resolution. These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: April 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Christian R   Burgess, Yoav   Livneh, Rohan N   Ramesh, Mark L   Andermann&lt;br /&gt; Physiological need states and associated motivational drives can bias visual processing of cues that help meet these needs. Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: February 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Alexandra   Krol, Guoping   Feng&lt;br /&gt; Developmental processes disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders occur rapidly and with temporal precision. During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Emerging evidence indicates that REST is a master transcriptional regulator of neuron-specific genes not only in neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, but also in differentiated neurons during the critical period in postnatal brain development, where it plays a role in fine-tuning of genes involved in synaptic plasticity, and in normal aging, where it promotes neuroprotection by repressing genes involved in oxidative stress and β-amyloid toxicity. This review focuses on recent findings that dysregulation of REST and REST-dependent epigenetic remodeling provide a central mechanism critical to the progressive neurodegeneration associated with neurologic disorders and diseases including global ischemia, stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

During the first three weeks of postnatal development, immature astrocytes express mGlu5 and expands several fold while undergoing a transition towards their mature phase. Although mGlu5-mediated signalling in astrocyte functions has been extensively studied in the last decades, whether this signalling is implicated in the mechanisms governing their development, as well as the effects of dysregulated astrocytic development on neurodevelopmental disorders, are still unclear. The aim of this review is to examine what is known about the mGlu5-mediated signalling in the developing astrocytes and its possible contribution to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

These functions rely on the computation of the local cerebellar microcircuits and long-range connectivity that relays cerebellar output to various brain areas. In this review, we discuss recent work on two of the circuit elements, which are thought to be fundamental for a wide range of non-sensorimotor behaviors: The role for cerebellar granule cells in multimodal integration in the cerebellar cortex and the long-range connectivity between the deep cerebellar nuclei and the basal ganglia. Lastly, we discuss how studies on synapses and circuits of the cerebellum in rodent models of autism-spectrum disorders might contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of this class of neurodevelopmental disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Studies have found that sensory, prefrontal, hippocampal, cerebellar, and striatal regions, as well as the circuits that connect them, are perturbed in mouse models of ASD and ID. Dissecting the disruptions in morphology and activity in these neural circuits might help us to understand the shared risk between the two disorders as well as their clinical heterogeneity. Treatments that target the balance between excitation and inhibition in these regions are able to reverse pathological phenotypes, elucidating this deficit as a commonality across models and opening new avenues for intervention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Denis   Scaini, Laura   Ballerini&lt;br /&gt; Interfacing the nervous system with devices able to efficiently record or modulate the electrical activity of neuronal cells represents the underlying foundation of future theranostic applications in neurology and of current openings in neuroscience research. These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Low-dimensional yet rich dynamics often emerge in the brain. Examples include
oscillations and chaotic dynamics during sleep, epilepsy, and voluntary
movement. However, a general mechanism for the emergence of low dimensional
dynamics remains elusive. Here, we consider Wilson-Cowan networks and
demonstrate through numerical and analytical work that a type of homeostatic
regulation of the network firing rates can paradoxically lead to a rich
dynamical repertoire. The dynamics include mixed-mode oscillations, mixed-mode
chaos, and chaotic synchronization. This is true for single recurrently coupled
node, pairs of reciprocally coupled nodes without self-coupling, and networks
coupled through experimentally determined weights derived from functional
magnetic resonance imaging data. In all cases, the stability of the homeostatic
set point is analytically determined or approximated. The dynamics at the
network level are directly determined by the behavior of a single node system
through synchronization in both oscillatory and non-oscillatory states. Our
results demonstrate that rich dynamics can be preserved under homeostatic
regulation or even be caused by homeostatic regulation.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09900</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We investigated, by using auditory models, how three perceptual parameters,
loudness, pitch and sharpness, determine human echolocation. We used acoustic
recordings from two previous studies, both from stationary situations, and
their resulting perceptual data as input to our analysis. An initial analysis
was on the room acoustics of the recordings. The parameters of interest were
sound pressure level, autocorrelation and spectral centroid. The auditory
models were used to analyze echolocation resulting from the perceptual
variables, i.e. loudness, pitch and sharpness. Relevant auditory models were
chosen to simulate each variable. Based on these results, we calculated
psychophysical thresholds for detecting a reflecting object with constant
physical size. A non-parametric method was used to determine thresholds for
distance, loudness, pitch and sharpness. Difference thresholds were calculated
for the psychophysical variables, since a 2-Alternative-Forced-Choice Paradigm
had originally been used. We found that (1) blind persons could detect objects
at lower loudness values, lower pitch strength, different sharpness values and
at further distances than sighted persons, (2) detection thresholds based on
repetition pitch, loudness and sharpness varied and depended on room acoustics
and type of sound stimuli, (3) repetition pitch was useful for detection at
shorter distances and was determined from the peaks in the temporal profile of
the autocorrelation function, (4) loudness at shorter distances provides
echolocation information, (5) at longer distances, timbre aspects, such as
sharpness, might be used to detect objects. We also discuss binaural
information, movements and the auditory model approach. Autocorrelation was
assumed as a proper measure for pitch, but the question is raised whether a
mechanism based on strobe integration is a viable possibility.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Decoding specific task states from human fMRI (functional magnetic resonance
imaging) signals constitutes a major goal of neuroimaging. Previous studies of
task-state classification have focused largely on processed fMRI
characteristics (e.g. functional connectivity patterns, activity patterns) or a
single fMRI volume. Here, we assembled a novel deep neural network (DNN) for
classifying directly from 4-D fMRI time series, retaining both spatial and
temporal information of fMRI signals. We trained and tested the DNN classifier
by task fMRI data from human connectome project (HCP) S1200 dataset. Reading
just a single block of fMRI time series of each task for each individual, the
novel classification method identified the seven tasks with 91.75% accuracy in
test. Then we extracted task heatmaps of each time series by a guided
backpropagation approach, and found that the heatmaps had a high similarity
with the group average result of traditional contrast of parameter estimate
(COPE). Furthermore, the DNN could be applied to small dataset. The features
from the intermediate layer of the DNN were trained and used to train a support
vector machine (SVM) to classify four conditions within 300 blocks of task-fMRI
scans, data amount comparable to a usual neuroimaging research, and obtained a
95% accuracy. Our reported findings were the first to demonstrate the ability
of DNN to classify and extract heatmaps from a 4-D fMRI time series, as well as
its ability to be transfer trained by a small dataset. This approach should
enable decoding and mapping subject's task status and furthermore help with
classification and diagnosis of neuropsychiatric diseases.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Availability bias, manifested in the over-representation of extreme
eventualities in decision-making, is a well-known cognitive bias, and is
generally taken as evidence of human irrationality. In this work, we present
the first rational, metacognitive account of the Availability bias, formally
articulated at Marr's algorithmic level of analysis. Concretely, we present a
normative, metacognitive model of how a cognitive system should over-represent
extreme eventualities, depending on the amount of time available at its
disposal for decision-making. Our model also accounts for two well-known
framing effects in human decision-making under risk---the fourfold pattern of
risk preferences in outcome probability (Tversky &amp;amp; Kahneman, 1992) and in
outcome magnitude (Markovitz, 1952)---thereby providing the first
metacognitively-rational basis for those effects. Empirical evidence,
furthermore, confirms an important prediction of our model. Surprisingly, our
model is unimaginably robust with respect to its focal parameter. We discuss
the implications of our work for studies on human decision-making, and conclude
by presenting a counterintuitive prediction of our model, which, if confirmed,
would have intriguing implications for human decision-making under risk. To our
knowledge, our model is the first metacognitive, resource-rational process
model of cognitive biases in decision-making.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: SozRank: A new approach for localizing the epileptic seizure onset zone</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yonathan Murin, Jeremy Kim, Josef Parvizi, Andrea Goldsmith&lt;/p&gt;

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders affecting about 1% of the world population. For patients with focal seizures that cannot be treated with antiepileptic drugs, the common treatment is a surgical procedure for removal of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). In this work we introduce an algorithm for automatic localization of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in epileptic patients based on electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings. The proposed algorithm builds upon the hypothesis that the abnormal excessive (or synchronous) neuronal activity in the brain leading to seizures &lt;i&gt;starts in the SOZ&lt;/i&gt; and then &lt;i&gt;spreads&lt;/i&gt; to other areas in the brain. Thus, when this abnormal activity starts, signals recorded at electrodes close to the SOZ should have a relatively large &lt;i&gt;causal influence&lt;/i&gt; on the rest of the recorded signals. The SOZ localization is executed in two steps. First, the algorithm represents the set of electrodes using a directed graph in which nodes correspond to recording electrodes and the edges’ weights quantify the &lt;i&gt;pair-wise&lt;/i&gt; causal influence between the recorded signals. Then, the algorithm infers the SOZ from the estimated graph using a variant of the &lt;i&gt;PageRank&lt;/i&gt; algorithm followed by a novel post-processing phase. Inference results for 19 patients show a close match between the SOZ inferred by the proposed approach and the SOZ estimated by expert neurologists (success rate of 17 out of 19).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jWjec7d9uT0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The most frequent form of pairwise synthetic lethality (SL) in metabolic networks is known as plasticity synthetic lethality. It occurs when the simultaneous inhibition of paired functional and silent metabolic reactions or genes is lethal, while the default of the functional partner is backed up by the activation of the silent one. Using computational techniques on bacterial genome-scale metabolic reconstructions, we found that the failure of the functional partner triggers a critical reorganization of fluxes to ensure viability in the mutant which not only affects the SL pair but a significant fraction of other interconnected reactions, forming what we call a SL cluster. Interestingly, SL clusters show a strong entanglement both in terms of reactions and genes. This strong overlap mitigates the acquired vulnerabilities and increased structural and functional costs that pay for the robustness provided by essential plasticity. Finally, the participation of coessential reactions and genes in different SL clusters is very heterogeneous and those at the intersection of many SL clusters could serve as supertargets for more efficient drug action in the treatment of complex diseases and to elucidate improved strategies directed to reduce undesired resistance to chemicals in pathogens.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RgV2wA7v53Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a ciliopathy resulting from defects in the BBSome, a conserved protein complex. BBSome mutations affect ciliary membrane composition, impairing cilia-based signaling. The mechanism by which the BBSome regulates ciliary membrane content remains unknown. Chlamydomonas bbs mutants lack phototaxis and accumulate phospholipase D (PLD) in the ciliary...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/CA3Jng6ikIs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Growth/differentiation factor 8 (GDF8), or myostatin, negatively regulates muscle mass. GDF8 is held in a latent state through interactions with its N-terminal prodomain, much like TGF-β. Using a combination of small-angle X-ray scattering and mutagenesis, we characterized the interactions of GDF8 with its prodomain. Our results show that the prodomain:GDF8...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/65dg1KbMkeI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: In Praise of Artifice Reloaded: Caution with subjective image quality databases. (arXiv:1801.09632v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09632</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09632</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Subjective image quality databases are a major source of raw data on how the
visual system works in naturalistic environments. These databases describe the
sensitivity of many observers to a wide range of distortions (of different
nature and with different suprathreshold intensities) seen on top of a variety
of natural images. They seem like a dream for the vision scientist to check the
models in realistic scenarios.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while these natural databases are great benchmarks for models
developed in some other way (e.g. by using the well-controlled artificial
stimuli of traditional psychophysics), they should be carefully used when
trying to fit vision models. Given the high dimensionality of the image space,
it is very likely that some basic phenomenon (e.g. sensitivity to distortions
in certain environments) are under-represented in the database. Therefore, a
model fitted on these large-scale natural databases will not reproduce these
under-represented basic phenomena that could otherwise be easily illustrated
with well selected artificial stimuli.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work we study a specific example of the above statement. A
wavelet+divisive normalization layer of a sensible cascade of linear+nonlinear
layers fitted to maximize the correlation with subjective opinion of observers
on a large image quality database fails to reproduce basic crossmasking. Here
we outline a solution for this problem using artificial stimuli. Then, we show
that the resulting model is also a competitive solution for the large-scale
database. In line with Rust and Movshon (2005), our report (misrepresentation
of basic visual phenomena in subjectively-rated natural image databases) is an
additional argument in praise of artifice.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Coactivated Clique Based Multisource Overlapping Brain Subnetwork Extraction. (arXiv:1801.09589v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09589</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09589</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Subnetwork extraction using community detection methods is commonly used to
study the brain's modular structure. Recent studies indicated that certain
brain regions are known to interact with multiple subnetworks. However, most
existing methods are mainly for non-overlapping subnetwork extraction. In this
paper, we present an approach for overlapping brain subnetwork extraction using
cliques, which we defined as co-activated node groups performing multiple
tasks. We proposed a multisource subnetwork extraction approach based on the
co-activated clique, which (1) uses task co-activation and task connectivity
strength information for clique identification, (2) automatically detects
cliques of different sizes having more neuroscientific justifications, and (3)
shares the subnetwork membership, derived from a fusion of rest and task data,
among the nodes within a clique for overlapping subnetwork extraction. On real
data, compared to the commonly used overlapping community detection techniques,
we showed that our approach improved subnetwork extraction in terms of
group-level and subject-wise reproducibility. We also showed that our
multisource approach identified subnetwork overlaps within brain regions that
matched well with hubs defined using functional and anatomical information,
which enables us to study the interactions between the subnetworks and how hubs
play their role in information flow across different subnetworks. We further
demonstrated that the assignments of interacting/individual nodes using our
approach correspond with the posterior probability derived independently from
our multimodal random walker based approach.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09300</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Olfactory receptor usage is highly non-uniform, with some receptor types
being orders of magnitude more abundant than others. Intriguingly, in mammals
the receptors are replaced regularly and the receptor distribution changes in
response to olfactory experience. We propose a theoretical model that explains
these experimental observations. Our model suggests that the receptor
distribution is tuned to maximize the amount of information about the olfactory
environment, in accordance with the efficient coding hypothesis. The optimal
receptor distribution depends on natural odor statistics, implying that a
change in environment should lead to changes in receptor abundances. The effect
is more pronounced when olfactory receptors respond strongly to a smaller
number of odors. Our model also predicts that, between closely-related species,
those with more neurons in the olfactory epithelium should express more
receptor types. We show that simple dynamical rules for neural birth and death
processes converge to the predicted optimum.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Entropy is a classical measure to quantify the amount of information or
complexity of a system. Various entropy-based measures such as functional and
spectral entropy have been proposed in brain network analysis. However, they
are less widely used than traditional graph theoretic measures such as global
and local efficiencies because they are not well-defined on a graph or
difficult to interpret its biological meaning. In this paper, we propose a new
entropy-based graph invariant, called volume entropy. It measures the
exponential growth rate of the number of graph paths, based on the assumption
that information flows through a graph forever. We model the information
propagation on a brain graph by the generalized Markov system associated to a
new edge transition matrix. The volume entropy is estimated by the stationary
equation of the generalized Markov system. Moreover, its stationary
distribution shows the information capacity of edge and the direction of
information flow on a brain graph. The simulation results show that the volume
entropy distinguishes the underlying graph topology and geometry better than
the existing graph measures. In the clinical application, the volume entropy of
brain graphs was significantly related to healthy normal aging from 20s to 60s.
In addition, the stationary distribution of information propagation gives a new
insight into the information flow of functional brain graph.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Real-time fMRI neurofeedback training of the amygdala activity with simultaneous EEG in veterans with combat-related PTSD. (arXiv:1801.09165v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and disabling
neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by insufficient top-down modulation of
the amygdala activity by the prefrontal cortex. Real-time fMRI neurofeedback
(rtfMRI-nf) is an emerging method with potential for modifying the
amygdala-prefrontal interactions. We report the first controlled emotion
self-regulation study in veterans with combat-related PTSD utilizing rtfMRI-nf
of the amygdala activity. PTSD patients in the experimental group (EG, n=20)
learned to upregulate BOLD activity of the left amygdala (LA) using rtfMRI-nf
during a happy emotion induction task. PTSD patients in the control group (CG,
n=11) were provided with a sham rtfMRI-nf. The study included three rtfMRI-nf
training sessions, and EEG recordings were performed simultaneously with fMRI.
PTSD severity was assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS).
The EG participants showed a significant reduction in total CAPS ratings,
including significant reductions in avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms.
Overall, 80% of the EG participants demonstrated clinically meaningful
reductions in CAPS ratings, compared to 38% in the CG. During the first
session, fMRI connectivity of the LA with the orbitofrontal cortex and the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was progressively enhanced, and this
enhancement significantly and positively correlated with initial CAPS ratings.
Left-lateralized enhancement in upper alpha EEG coherence also exhibited a
significant positive correlation with initial CAPS ratings. Reduction in PTSD
severity between the first and last rtfMRI-nf sessions significantly correlated
with enhancement in functional connectivity between the LA and the left DLPFC.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The availability of technological means to enhance and repair human cognitive
function raises questions about the perceived morality of their use. In this
study, we administered a survey to the public in which subjects were asked to
report how willing they would be to enhance and/or repair specific cognitive
abilities. We found that subjects were more willing to use technologies to
enhance or repair other people than themselves, and especially to repair
functions more &quot;core&quot; to authentic identity in others. Subjects' ratings of
moral acceptability of uses was related to their reported willingness to use
brain stimulation. These findings establish a basis to guide moral
psychological studies of cognitive modification and social processes that guide
attitudes toward and uses of brain stimulation.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Seizure and synchronization are related to each other in complex manner.
Altered synchrony has been implicated in loss of consciousness during partial
seizures. However, the mechanism of altered consciousness following termination
of seizures has not been studied well. In this work we used bivariate mutual
information as a measure of synchronization to understand the neural correlate
of altered consciousness during and after termination of mesial temporal lobe
onset seizures. First, we have compared discrete bivariate mutual information
(MI) measure with amplitude correlation (AC), phase synchronization (PS),
nonlinear correlation and coherence, and established MI as a robust measure of
synchronization. Next, we have extended MI to more than two signals by
principal component method. The extended MI was applied on intracranial
electroencephalogram (iEEG) before, during and after 23 temporal lobe seizures
recorded from 11 patients. The analyses were carried out in delta, theta,
alpha, beta and gamma bands. In 77% of the complex partial seizures MI was
higher towards the seizure offset than in the first half of the seizure in the
seizure onset zone (SOZ) channels in beta and gamma bands, whereas MI remained
higher in the beginning or in the middle of the seizure than towards the offset
across the least involved channels in the same bands. Synchronization seems
built up outside the SOZ, gradually spread and culminated in SOZ and remained
high beyond offset leading to impaired consciousness in 82% of the complex
partial temporal lobe seizures. Consciousness impairment was scored according
to a method previously applied to assess the same in patients with temporal
lobe epilepsy during seizure.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Active Atlas: Combining 3D Anatomical Models with Texture Detectors. (arXiv:1702.08606v3 [cs.CV] CROSS LISTED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While modern imaging technologies such as fMRI have opened exciting new
possibilities for studying the brain in vivo, histological sections remain the
best way to study the anatomy of the brain at the level of single neurons. The
histological atlas changed little since 1909 and localizing brain regions is a
still a labor intensive process performed only by experienced neuro-anatomists.
Existing digital atlases such as the Allen Brain atlas are limited to low
resolution images which cannot identify the detailed structure of the neurons.
We have developed a digital atlas methodology that combines information about
the 3D organization of the brain and the detailed texture of neurons in
different structures. Using the methodology we developed an atlas for the mouse
brainstem and mid-brain, two regions for which there are currently no good
atlases. Our atlas is &quot;active&quot; in that it can be used to automatically align a
histological stack to the atlas, thus reducing the work of the neuroanatomist.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Inhibition of Hsp70 suppresses neuronal hyperexcitability and attenuates seizures by enhancing A-type potassium currents</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256602v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256602v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is upregulated in response to stress and has been implicated as a stress marker in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). However, whether Hsp70 plays a pathologic or protective role in TLE remains unclear. Here we report that Hsp70 exerts an unexpected deleterious role in kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures, and inhibition of Hsp70 suppresses neuronal hyperexcitability and attenuates both acute and chronic seizures via enhancing A-type potassium currents primarily formed by Kv4 -subunits and auxiliary KChIPs. Proteosomal degradation of Kv4-KChIP4a channel complexes is enhanced by Hsp70, which can be reversed by the Hsp70 inhibitors, 2-phenylethynesulfonamide (PES) and VER-155008 (VER). In cultured hippocampal neurons, either PES or VER can increase A-type Kv4 current to suppress neuronal hyperexcitability. Mechanistically, Hsp70-CHIP complexes directly bind to the N-terminus of auxiliary KChIP4a and target Kv4-KChIP4a complexes to the proteasome. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of Hsp70 in mediating degradation of Kv4-KChIP4a complexes and regulating neuronal excitability, thus highlighting a therapeutic potential for hyperexcitability-related neurological disorders through Hsp70 inhibition.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Prospective control of movement in the basal ganglia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256347v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256347v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Neural systems control purposeful movements both within the body of an animal (e.g., pumping blood) and in the environment (e.g., reaching). This is vital for all animals. The movement control functions of globus pallidus (GP), subthalamic nucleus (STN) and zona incerta (ZI) were analyzed in monkeys reaching for seen targets. Temporal profiles of their hand movements and the synchronized pattern of neuropower (rate of flow of electrochemical energy) through the basal ganglia were analyzed in terms of general tau theory of movement control (Lee et al., 2009), using the variable rho (=1/tau). The results suggest: (i) the neuroinformation for controlling movement is the relative-rate-of-change, rho, of neuropower in the nervous system; (ii) GP is involved in creating prescriptive rhos of neuropower to guide movements; (iii) STN is involved in registering perceptual rhos of neuropower to monitor the movement; (iv) ZI is involved in combining the prescriptive and perceptual rhos of neuropower to generate performatory rhos of neuropower to activate the muscles to produce the movement. Possible implications for Parkinsons disease are discussed.</description>

	<description>OBJECTIVE: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is extensively used in basic and clinical neuroscience. Previous work has shown substantial residual variability in TMS effects even despite use of on-line visual feedback monitoring of coil position. Here, we aimed to evaluate if off-line modeling of coil position and orientation deviations can enhance detection of TMS effects. METHODS: Retrospective modeling was used to denoise the impact of common coil position and rotation deviations during TMS experimental sessions on motor evoked potentials (MEP) to single pulse TMS. RESULTS: Offline denoising led to a 26.19% improvement in the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of corticospinal excitability measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Offline modeling enhanced detection of TMS effects by removing variability introduced by coil deviations. SIGNIFICANCE: This approach could allow more accurate determination of TMS effects in cognitive and interventional neuroscience.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256032v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Molecular switches, such as the protein kinase CaMKII, play a fundamental role in cell signalling by decoding inputs into either high or low states of activity; because the high activation state can be turned on and persist after the input ceases, these switches have earned a reputation as digital. Although this binary perspective has been valuable for understanding synaptic plasticity over long timescales, accumulating experimental evidence suggests that molecular switches also control cellular processing on short timescales. To investigate this idea further, a non-autonomous, nonlinear ordinary differential equation, representative of a bistable molecular switch, is analyzed. The existence and uniqueness of model solutions to arbitrary input is proved for both the high and low states of activity. These results suggest that sub-state switch activity is an analog signal that tracks instantaneous input frequency, thereby increasing the capacity for information transfer to downstream cellular targets. Using simple dynamics based on the ubiquitous Hill equation, the model and theory make intriguing predictions about synaptic plasticity and suggest a multiplexed encoding of instantaneous frequency information over short timescales, with integration of total activity over long timescales, helping to reconcile contrasting perspectives presented in the literature.</description>

	<description>Hierarchical processing is pervasive in the brain, but its computational significance for learning is disputed. We show that commonly used paradigms which rely on reports of learned quantities are insufficient to distinguish hierarchical from non-hierarchical models of learning under uncertainty, and present a novel paradigm which uses reports of confidence to arbitrate between the two. Our results provide clear evidence for hierarchical processing, and challenge influential neurocomputational accounts of learning.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/255935v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential for neuronal growth, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity. Although the release and effects of BDNF have been well-studied separately, the transfer of BDNF between cells has not been investigated. Using a four-fluorophore imaging approach to identify both the cell of origin and target cells, we quantified transfer of BDNF. Surprisingly, we found that astrocytes are the main recipient of neuronally expressed BDNF. We further found that astrocytes specifically take up mature (and not pro) BDNF released by neurons. Over-expression of TrkB in neurons redirects released BDNF from astrocytes to neurons, indicating that TrkB level determines neuronal versus astrocytic BDNF uptake. Increased neuronal activity further increased astrocytic (but not neuronal) uptake of neuronally expressed BDNF. Finally, we demonstrate that astrocytes are not simply a sink for excess BDNF, but that BDNF taken up by astrocytes mediates physiological effects on the astrocytic population by increasing astrocytic territory.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/255794v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>As a movement sequence is learned, serially ordered actions get bound together into sets in order to reduce computational complexity during planning and execution. Here we examined how the binding of serial actions alters the cortical representations of individual movements. Across five weeks of practice, healthy human subjects learned either a complex 32-item sequence of finger movements (Trained group, N=9) or randomly ordered actions (Control group, N=9). After five weeks of training, responses during sequence production in the Trained group were correlated, consistent with being bound together under a common command. These behavioral changes, however, did not coincide with plasticity in the multivariate representations of individual finger movements, assessed using fMRI, at any level of the cortical motor hierarchy. This suggests that the representations of individual actions remain stable, even as the execution of those same actions become bound together in the context of producing a well learned sequence.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/255653v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Understanding neuronal mechanisms of learned behaviors requires efficient behavioral assays. We designed a high-throughput automatic training system (HATS) for olfactory behaviors in head-fixed mice. The hardware and software were constructed to enable automatic training with minimal human intervention. The integrated system was composed of customized 3D-printing supporting components, an odor-delivery unit with fast response, Arduino based hardware-controlling and data-acquisition unit. Furthermore, the customized software was designed to enable automatic training in all training phases, including lick-teaching, shaping, and learning. Using HATS, we trained mice to perform delayed non-match to sample (DNMS), delayed paired association (DPA), Go/No-go (GNG), and GNG reversal tasks. These tasks probed cognitive functions including sensory discrimination, working memory, decision making, and cognitive flexibility. Mice reached stable levels of performance within several days in the tasks. HATS enabled an experimenter to train eight mice simultaneously, therefore greatly enhanced the experimental efficiency. Combined with causal perturbation and activity recording techniques, HATS can greatly facilitate our understanding of the neural-circuitry mechanisms underlying learned behaviors.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The emotional valence and features of subliminal priming images impact conscious perception of facial expressions</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/255489v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We investigated, in young healthy subjects, how the affective content of subliminally presented priming images and their specific visual attributes impacted conscious perception of facial expressions. The priming images were broadly categorised as aggressive, pleasant, or neutral and further subcategorised by the presence of a face and by the centricity (egocentric or allocentric vantage-point) of the image content. Subjects responded to the emotion portrayed in a pixelated target-face by indicating via key-press if the expression was angry or neutral. Priming images containing a face compared to those not containing a face significantly impaired performance on neutral or angry target-face evaluation. Recognition of angry target-face expressions was selectively impaired by pleasant prime images which contained a face. For egocentric primes, recognition of neutral target-face expressions was significantly better than of angry expressions. Our results suggest that, first, the affective primacy hypothesis which predicts that affective information can be accessed automatically, preceding conscious cognition, holds true in subliminal priming only when the priming image contains a face. Second, egocentric primes interfere with the perception of angry target-face expressions suggesting that this vantage-point, directly relevant to the viewer, perhaps engages processes involved in action preparation which may weaken the priority of affect processing.</description>

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/255455v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/255455v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Cocaine self-administration causes dephosphorylation of proteins in prelimbic (PL) cortex that mediate excitation-transcription coupling, suggesting that cocaine causes decreased activity in PL neurons. Thus, we used in vivo single-unit extracellular recordings in awake, behaving rats to measure activity in PL neurons before, during, and after cocaine self-administration on the first and last session day (range 12-14 days). On the last day, cocaine suppressed 52% of recorded neurons in the PL cortex when compared to a 20 min baseline, significantly more than the 23% of neurons suppressed on the first day of cocaine. There was no change in the percentage of neurons that were excited on the first vs. the last day of self-administration (14% vs. 13%, respectively). To determine whether the tonic inhibitory shift was induced by the behavior or by the drug itself, rats received a final session in which cocaine availability was delayed for the first 30 min or in which cocaine was administered non-contingently in the absence of levers or cues in a subset of rats. These manipulations indicated that cocaine was both necessary and sufficient to induce a downshift in PL neuronal activity. However, this activity decrease was not observed in rats that received only non-contingent cocaine for 12-14 days, indicating that contingency during self-administration training contributes to the cocaine-induced tonic downshift in PL activity. These data suggest that the session-by-session decrease in PL neuronal activity induced by cocaine is a reflection of learned drug-seeking behavior and, hence, reducing this inhibition may lessen cocaine addiction.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Motion regions are modulated by scene content</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/255406v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Creating a stable perception of the world during pursuit eye movements is one of the everyday roles of visual system. Some motion regions have been shown to differentiate between motion in the external world from that generated by eye movements. However, in most circumstances, perceptual stability is consistently related to content: the surrounding scene is typically stable. However, no prior study has examined to which extent motion responsive regions are modulated by scene content, and whether there is an interaction between content and motion response. In the present study we used a factorial design that has previously been shown to reveal regional involvement in integrating efference copies of eye-movements with retinal motion to mediate perceptual stability and encode real-world motion. We then added scene content as a third factor, which allowed us to examine to which extent real-motion, retinal motion, and static responses were modulated by meaningful scenes versus their Fourier scrambled counterpart. We found that motion responses in human motion responsive regions V3A, V6, V5+/MT+ and cingulate sulcus visual area (CSv) were all modulated by scene content. Depending on the region, these motion-content interactions differentially depended on whether motion was self-induced or not. V3A was the only motion responsive region that also showed responses to still scenes. Our results suggest that contrary to the two-pathway hypothesis, scene responses are not isolated to ventral regions, but also can be found in dorsal areas.</description>

	<description>Background: Sensory abnormalities and sleep disturbances are highly prevalent in children with autism, but the potential relationship between these two domains has rarely been explored. Understanding such relationships is important for identifying children with autism who exhibit more homogeneous symptoms. Methods: Here we examined this relationship using the Caregiver Sensory Profile and the children's sleep habit questionnaires, which were completed by parents of 69 children with autism and 62 frequency age-matched controls. Results: In line with previous studies, children with autism exhibited more severe sensory abnormalities and sleep disturbances than age-matched controls. The sleep disturbance scores were strongly associated with touch and oral sensitivities in the autism group and with touch and vestibular sensitivities in the control group. Hyper sensitivity towards touch, in particular, exhibited the strongest relationship with sleep disturbances in the autism group and single-handedly explained 24% of the variance in sleep disturbance scores. In contrast, sensitivity in other sensory domains such as vision and audition was not associated with sleep quality in either group. Conclusions: While it is often assumed that sensitivities in all sensory domains are similarly associated with sleep problems, our results suggest that hyper sensitivity towards touch exhibits the strongest relationship to sleep disturbances when examining children autism. We speculate that hyper sensitivity towards touch interferes with sleep onset and maintenance in a considerable number of children with autism who exhibit severe sleep disturbances. Studies that examine the effects of tactile sensory therapies/aids on sleep quality and behavioral improvement in these children are, therefore, highly warranted.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Reactivation of neural patterns during memory reinstatement supports encoding specificity</title>

	<description>Encoding specificity or transfer appropriate processing state that memory benefits when items are encoded and retrieved in the same modality compared to when encoding and retrieval is conducted in different modalities. In neural terms, these effects can be expressed by a resonance process between a memory cue and a stored engram; the more the two overlap the better memory performance. We here used temporal pattern analysis in MEG to tap into this resonance process. We predicted that reactivation of sensory patterns established during encoding has opposing effects depending on whether there is a match or mismatch between the memory cue and the encoding modality. To test this prediction items were presented either visually or aurally during encoding and in a recognition test to create match (e.g. &quot;dog&quot; presented aurally during encoding and recognition) and mismatch conditions (e.g. &quot;dog&quot; presented aurally during encoding and shown visually during recognition). Memory performance was better for items in the match compared to the mismatch condition. MEG results showed that memory benefitted from neural pattern reinstatement only in the match condition, but suffered from reinstatement in the mismatch condition. These behavioural and neural effects were asymmetric in that they were only obtained for aurally encoded words but not for visually encoded words. A simple computational model was generated in order to simulate these opposing effects of neural pattern reactivation on memory performance. We argue that these results suggest that reactivation of neural patterns established during encoding underlies encoding specificity or transfer appropriate processing.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Accurate Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease Using Multi-Modal MRI and High-Throughput Brain Phenotyping</title>

	<description>Accurate, reliable prediction of risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for early, disease-modifying therapeutics. Multimodal MRI, such as structural and diffusion MRI, may contain multi-dimensional information neurodegenerative processes in AD. Here we tested the utility of structural MRI and diffusion MRI as imaging markers of AD using high-throughput brain phenotyping including morphometry and white-matter structural connectome (whole-brain tractography), and machine learning analytics for classification. We used a retrospective cohort collected at a dementia clinic (Ilsan Dementia Cohort; N=211; 110 AD, 64 mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 37 subjective memory complaints [SMC]). Multi-modal MRI was collected (T1, T2-FLAIR, and diffusion MRI) and was used for morphometry, structural connectome, and white matter hyperintensity (WHM) segmentation. Our machine learning model trained on the large-scale brain phenotypes (n=34,646) classified AD, MCI, and SMC with unprecedented accuracy (AD/SMC: 97% accuracy, MCI/SMC: 83% accuracy; AD/MCI: 98% accuracy) with strict iterative nested ten-fold cross-validation. Model comparison revealed that white-matter structural connectome was the primary contributor compared with conventional volumetric features (e.g., WHM or hippocampal volume). This study indicates promising utility of multimodal MRI, particularly structural connectome, combined with high-throughput brain phenotyping and machine learning analytics to extract salient features enabling accurate diagnostic prediction.</description>

	<description>Hydrogel scaffolds provide a beneficial microenvironment in transected rat spinal cord. A combinatorial biomaterials based strategy provided a microenvironment that facilitated regeneration while reducing foreign body reaction to the 3-dimensional spinal cord construct. We used poly lactic-co-glycolic acid microspheres to provide sustained release of rapamycin from Schwann cell (SC)-loaded, positively charged oligo-polyethylene glycol fumarate scaffolds. Three dose formulations of rapamycin were compared to controls in 53 rats. We observed a dose-dependent reduction in the fibrotic reaction to the scaffold and improved functional recovery over 6 weeks. Recovery was replicated in a second cohort of 28 animals that included retransection injury. Immunohistochemical and stereological analysis demonstrated that blood vessel number, surface area, vessel diameter, basement membrane collagen, and microvessel phenotype within the regenerated tissue was dependent on the presence of SCs and rapamycin. TRITC-dextran injection demonstrated enhanced perfusion into scaffold channels. Rapamycin also increased the number of descending regenerated axons, as assessed by Fast Blue retrograde axonal tracing. These results demonstrate that normalization of the neovasculature was associated with enhanced axonal regeneration and improved function after spinal cord transection.</description>

Reactome is a free, open-source, open-data, curated and peer-reviewed knowledgebase of biomolecular pathways. One of its main priorities is to provide easy and efficient access to its high quality curated data. At present, biological pathway databases typically store their contents in relational databases. This limits access efficiency because there are performance issues associated with queries traversing highly interconnected data. The same data in a graph database can be queried more efficiently. Here we present the rationale behind the adoption of a graph database (Neo4j) as well as the new ContentService (REST API) that provides access to these data. The Neo4j graph database and its query language, Cypher, provide efficient access to the complex Reactome data model, facilitating easy traversal and knowledge discovery. The adoption of this technology greatly improved query efficiency, reducing the average query time by 93%. The web service built on top of the graph database provides programmatic access to Reactome data by object oriented queries, but also supports more complex queries that take advantage of the new underlying graph-based data storage. By adopting graph database technology we are providing a high performance pathway data resource to the community. The Reactome graph database use case shows the power of NoSQL database engines for complex biological data types.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7RLEkfWxsdM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The extent of ribosome queuing in budding yeast</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005951</guid>

Ribosome queuing is a fundamental phenomenon suggested to be related to topics such as genome evolution, synthetic biology, gene expression regulation, intracellular biophysics, and more. However, this phenomenon hasn't been quantified yet at a genomic level. Nevertheless, methodologies for studying translation (e.g. ribosome footprints) are usually calibrated to capture only single ribosome protected footprints (mRPFs) and thus limited in their ability to detect ribosome queuing. On the other hand, most of the models in the field assume and analyze a certain level of queuing. Here we present an experimental-computational approach for studying ribosome queuing based on sequencing of RNA footprints extracted from pairs of ribosomes (dRPFs) using a modified ribosome profiling protocol. We combine our approach with traditional ribosome profiling to generate a detailed profile of ribosome traffic. The data are analyzed using computational models of translation dynamics. The approach was implemented on the &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; transcriptome. Our data shows that ribosome queuing is more frequent than previously thought: the measured ratio of ribosomes within dRPFs to mRPFs is 0.2–0.35, suggesting that at least one to five translating ribosomes is in a traffic jam; these queued ribosomes cannot be captured by traditional methods. We found that specific regions are enriched with queued ribosomes, such as the 5’-end of ORFs, and regions upstream to mRPF peaks, among others. While queuing is related to higher density of ribosomes on the transcript (characteristic of highly translated genes), we report cases where traffic jams are relatively more severe in lowly expressed genes and possibly even selected for. In addition, our analysis demonstrates that higher adaptation of the coding region to the intracellular tRNA levels and longer genes are associated with lower queuing levels. Our analysis also suggests that the &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; transcriptome undergoes selection for eliminating traffic jams. Thus, our proposed approach is an essential tool for high resolution analysis of ribosome traffic during mRNA translation and understanding its evolution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EGKWmrKeD6Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Identification of allosteric inhibitors of the ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) targeting the dimer interface</title>

The ecto-5’-nucleotidase CD73 plays an important role in the production of immune-suppressive adenosine in tumor micro-environment, and has become a validated drug target in oncology. Indeed, the anticancer immune response involves extracellular ATP to block cell proliferation through T-cell activation. However, in the tumor micro-environment, two extracellular membrane-bound enzymes (CD39 and CD73) are overexpressed and hydrolyze efficiently ATP into AMP then further into immune-suppressive adenosine. To circumvent the impact of CD73-generated adenosine, we applied an original bioinformatics approach to identify new allosteric inhibitors targeting the dimerization interface of CD73, which should impair the large dynamic motions required for its enzymatic function. Several hit compounds issued from virtual screening campaigns showed a potent inhibition of recombinant CD73 with inhibition constants in the low micromolar range and exhibited a non-competitive inhibition mode. The structure-activity relationships studies indicated that several amino acid residues (D366, H456, K471, Y484 and E543 for polar interactions and G453-454, I455, H456, L475, V542 and G544 for hydrophobic contacts) located at the dimerization interface are involved in the tight binding of hit compounds and likely contributed for their inhibitory activity. Overall, the gathered information will guide the upcoming lead optimization phase that may lead to potent and selective CD73 inhibitors, able to restore the anticancer immune response.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MmJFMNHwHpM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Biophysical network modeling of the dLGN circuit: Effects of cortical feedback on spatial response properties of relay cells</title>

Despite half-a-century of research since the seminal work of Hubel and Wiesel, the role of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) in shaping the visual signals is not properly understood. Placed on route from retina to primary visual cortex in the early visual pathway, a striking feature of the dLGN circuit is that both the relay cells (RCs) and interneurons (INs) not only receive feedforward input from retinal ganglion cells, but also a prominent feedback from cells in layer 6 of visual cortex. This feedback has been proposed to affect synchronicity and other temporal properties of the RC firing. It has also been seen to affect spatial properties such as the center-surround antagonism of thalamic receptive fields, i.e., the suppression of the response to very large stimuli compared to smaller, more optimal stimuli. Here we explore the spatial effects of cortical feedback on the RC response by means of a a comprehensive network model with biophysically detailed, single-compartment and multicompartment neuron models of RCs, INs and a population of orientation-selective layer 6 simple cells, consisting of pyramidal cells (PY). We have considered two different arrangements of synaptic feedback from the ON and OFF zones in the visual cortex to the dLGN: phase-reversed (‘push-pull’) and phase-matched (‘push-push’), as well as different spatial extents of the corticothalamic projection pattern. Our simulation results support that a phase-reversed arrangement provides a more effective way for cortical feedback to provide the increased center-surround antagonism seen in experiments both for flashing spots and, even more prominently, for patch gratings. This implies that ON-center RCs receive direct excitation from OFF-dominated cortical cells and indirect inhibitory feedback from ON-dominated cortical cells. The increased center-surround antagonism in the model is accompanied by spatial focusing, i.e., the maximum RC response occurs for smaller stimuli when feedback is present.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2Ye3WzHcxNo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive control researchers aim to describe the processes that support
adaptive cognition to achieve specific goals. Control theorists consider how to
influence the state of systems to reach certain user-defined goals. In brain
networks, some conceptual and lexical similarities between cognitive control
and control theory offer appealing avenues for scientific discovery. However,
these opportunities also come with the risk of conceptual confusion. Here, I
suggest that each field of inquiry continues to produce novel and distinct
insights. Then, I describe opportunities for synergistic research at the
intersection of these subdisciplines with a critical stance that reduces the
risk of conceptual confusion. Through this exercise, we can observe that both
cognitive neuroscience and systems engineering have much to contribute to
cognitive control research in human brain networks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper is an introduction to the membrane potential equation for neurons.
Its properties are described, as well as sample applications. Networks of these
equations can be used for modeling neuronal systems, which also process images
and video sequences, respectively. Specifically, (i) a dynamic retina is
proposed (based on a reaction-diffusion system), which predicts afterimages and
simple visual illusions, (ii) a system for texture segregation (texture
elements are understood as even-symmetric contrast features), and (iii) a
network for detecting object approaches (inspired by the locust visual system).

	<description>The transition from childhood to adolescence is marked by distinct changes in behavior, including how one values waiting for a large reward compared to receiving an immediate, yet smaller, reward. While previous research has emphasized the relationship between this preference and age, it is also proposed that this behavior is related to circuitry between valuation and cognitive control systems. In this study, we examined how age and intrinsic functional connectivity strength within and between these neural systems relate to changes in discounting behavior across the transition into adolescence. We used mixed-effects modeling and linear regression to assess the contributions of age and connectivity strength in predicting discounting behavior. First, we identified relevant connections in a longitudinal sample of 64 individuals who completed MRI scans and behavioral assessments 2-3 times across ages 7-15 years (137 scans). We then repeated the analysis in a separate, cross-sectional, sample of 84 individuals (7-13 years). Both samples showed an age-related increase in preference for waiting for larger rewards. Connectivity strength within and between valuation and cognitive control systems accounted for further variance not explained by age. These results suggest that individual differences in functional neural organization can account for behavioral changes typically associated with age.</description>

	<description>For many animals, the neural activity in early olfactory circuits during a single sniff cycle contains sufficient information for fine odor discrimination. Whilst much is known about the transformations of neural representations in early olfactory circuits, exactly how odorant evoked activity in the main olfactory bulb shapes the perception of odors remains largely unknown. In olfaction, odorant identity is generally conserved over a wide range of conditions, including concentration. We present a theory of identity assignment in the olfactory system that accounts for this invariance with respect to stimulus intensity. We suggest that the identities of relatively few high affinity olfactory receptor types determine an odorant's perceived identity. This set of high-affinity receptors is defined as the primary set and the coding model based on their responses is called the primacy theory. In this study, we explore the impact that primacy coding may have on the evolution of the ensemble of olfactory receptors. A primacy coding mechanism predicts the arrangement of different receptor types in a low-dimensional structure that we call a primacy hull. We present several statistical analyses that can detect the presence of this structure, allowing the predictions of the primacy model to be tested experimentally.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Lost in Space: The Impact of Traditional Neuroimaging Methods on the Spatial Localization of Cortical Areas</title>

	<description>Localizing human brain functions is a long-standing goal in systems neuroscience. Towards this goal, neuroimaging studies have traditionally used volume-based smoothing, registration to volume-based standard spaces, and have reported results relative to volume-based parcellations. A novel 360-area surface-based cortical parcellation was recently generated using multimodal data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), and a volume-based version of this parcellation has been frequently requested for use with traditional volume-based analyses. However, given the major methodological differences between traditional volumetric and HCP-style processing, the utility and interpretability of such a parcellation must first be established. By starting from automatically generated individual-subject parcellations and processing them with different methodological approaches, we show that traditional processing steps, especially volume-based smoothing and registration, substantially degrade cortical area localization when compared to surface-based approaches. We also show that surface-based registration using features closely tied to cortical areas, rather than to folding patterns, improves the alignment of areas, and that the benefits of high resolution acquisitions are largely unexploited by traditional volume-based methods. Quantitatively, we show that the most common version of the traditional approach has spatial localization that is only 35% as good as the best surface-based method as assessed with two objective measures (peak areal probabilities and 'captured area fraction' for maximum probability maps). Finally, we demonstrate that substantial challenges exist when attempting to accurately represent volume-based group analysis results on the surface, which has important implications for the interpretability of studies that use these volume-based methods, both past and future.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neural circuitry of a polycystin-mediated hydrodynamic startle response for predator avoidance</title>

	<description>Startle responses triggered by aversive stimuli including predators are widespread across animals. These coordinated whole-body actions require the rapid and simultaneous activation of a large number of muscles. Here we study a startle response in a planktonic larva to understand the whole-body circuit implementation of the behavior. Upon encountering water vibrations, larvae of the annelid Platynereis close their locomotor cilia and simultaneously contract the body and raise the parapodia. The startle response is mediated by collar receptor neurons expressing the polycystins PKD1-1 and PKD2-1. CRISPR-generated PKD1-1 and PKD2-1 mutant larvae do not startle and fall prey to a copepod predator at a higher rate. Reconstruction of the whole-body connectome of the collar-receptor-cell circuitry revealed converging feedforward circuits to the ciliary bands and muscles. The wiring diagram suggests circuit mechanisms for the intersegmental and left-right coordination of the response. Our results reveal how polycystin-mediated mechanosensation can trigger a coordinated whole-body effector response involved in predator avoidance.</description>

	<description>Olfactory receptor usage is highly non-uniform, with some receptor types being orders of magnitude more abundant than others. Intriguingly, in mammals the receptors are replaced regularly and the receptor distribution changes in response to olfactory experience. We propose a theoretical model that explains these experimental observations. Our model suggests that the receptor distribution is tuned to maximize the amount of information about the olfactory environment, in accordance with the efficient coding hypothesis. The optimal receptor distribution depends on natural odor statistics, implying that a change in environment should lead to changes in receptor abundances. The effect is more pronounced when olfactory receptors respond strongly to a smaller number of odors. Our model also predicts that, between closely-related species, those with more neurons in the olfactory epithelium should express more receptor types. We show that simple dynamical rules for neural birth and death processes converge to the predicted optimum.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Foxg1 Overexpression in Neocortical Pyramids Stimulates Dendrite Elongation Via Hes1 and pCreb1 Upregulation</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The architecture of neocortical projection neurons is subject of a complex gene control. Here we demonstrated that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt;, a transcription factor gene which patterns the early rostral brain and sets the pace of telencephalic neuronogenesis, specifically stimulates dendrite elongation. This phenomenon occurs in vivo like in vitro, and it is detectable even upon moderate changes of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt; expression levels. We found that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt; acts by stimulating &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Hes1&lt;/span&gt;, which in turn upregulates pCreb1, a well-known pro-dendritogenic effector, and downregulates &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Syt&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Ndr1&lt;/span&gt;, namely two established antagonizers of dendrite elongation. Moreover, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt;-driven pCreb1 upregulation requires PKA and AKT, and correlates with reduced PP1 and PP2A phosphatase activity. These findings contribute to clarify normal neurodevelopmental and activity-related regulation of neuritogenesis. They further suggest that an abnormal sizing of the dendritic tree of neocortical projection neurons may occur in West and Rett syndrome patients with anomalous &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;FOXG1&lt;/span&gt; allele dosages and contribute to their neurolopathological profiles.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: MUMmer4: A fast and versatile genome alignment system</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005944</guid>

The MUMmer system and the genome sequence aligner nucmer included within it are among the most widely used alignment packages in genomics. Since the last major release of MUMmer version 3 in 2004, it has been applied to many types of problems including aligning whole genome sequences, aligning reads to a reference genome, and comparing different assemblies of the same genome. Despite its broad utility, MUMmer3 has limitations that can make it difficult to use for large genomes and for the very large sequence data sets that are common today. In this paper we describe MUMmer4, a substantially improved version of MUMmer that addresses genome size constraints by changing the 32-bit suffix tree data structure at the core of MUMmer to a 48-bit suffix array, and that offers improved speed through parallel processing of input query sequences. With a theoretical limit on the input size of 141Tbp, MUMmer4 can now work with input sequences of any biologically realistic length. We show that as a result of these enhancements, the nucmer program in MUMmer4 is easily able to handle alignments of large genomes; we illustrate this with an alignment of the human and chimpanzee genomes, which allows us to compute that the two species are 98% identical across 96% of their length. With the enhancements described here, MUMmer4 can also be used to efficiently align reads to reference genomes, although it is less sensitive and accurate than the dedicated read aligners. The nucmer aligner in MUMmer4 can now be called from scripting languages such as Perl, Python and Ruby. These improvements make MUMer4 one the most versatile genome alignment packages available.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ad66bIHbWNc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Networks of piecewise linear neural mass models. (arXiv:1801.08366v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08366</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural mass models are ubiquitous in large scale brain modelling. At the node
level they are written in terms of a set of ODEs with a nonlinearity that is
typically a sigmoidal shape. Using structural data from brain atlases they may
be connected into a network to investigate the emergence of functional dynamic
states, such as synchrony. With the simple restriction of the classic sigmoidal
nonlinearity to a piecewise linear caricature we show that the famous
Wilson-Cowan neural mass model can be analysed at both the node and network
level. The construction of periodic orbits at the node level is achieved by
patching together matrix exponential solutions, and stability is determined
using Floquet theory. For networks with interactions described by circulant
matrices, we show that the stability of the synchronous state can be determined
in terms of a low-dimensional Floquet problem parameterised by the eigenvalues
of the interaction matrix. This network Floquet problem is readily solved using
linear algebra, to predict the onset of spatio-temporal network patterns
arising from a synchronous instability. We consider the case of a discontinuous
choice for the node nonlinearity, namely the replacement of the sigmoid by a
Heaviside nonlinearity. This gives rise to a continuous-time switching network.
At the node level this allows for the existence of unstable sliding periodic
orbits, which we construct. The stability of a periodic orbit is now treated
with a modification of Floquet theory to treat the evolution of small
perturbations through switching manifolds via saltation matrices. At the
network level the stability analysis of the synchronous state is considerably
more challenging. Here we report on the use of ideas originally developed for
the study of Glass networks to treat the stability of periodic network states
in neural mass models with discontinuous interactions.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The role of spatial heterogeneity in the evolution of local and global infections of viruses</title>

Viruses have two modes spread in a host body, one is to release infectious particles from infected cells (global infection) and the other is to infect directly from an infected cell to an adjacent cell (local infection). Since the mode of spread affects the evolution of life history traits, such as virulence, it is important to reveal what level of global and local infection is selected. Previous studies of the evolution of global and local infection have paid little attention to its dependency on the measures of spatial configuration. Here we show the evolutionarily stable proportion of global and local infection, and how it depends on the distribution of target cells. Using an epidemic model on a regular lattice, we consider the infection dynamics by pair approximation and check the evolutionarily stable strategy. We also conduct the Monte-Carlo simulation to observe evolutionary dynamics. We show that a higher local infection is selected as target cells become clustered. Surprisingly, the selected strategy depends not only on the degree of clustering but also the abundance of target cells per se.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QvuUxAMbOWQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Gamma-glutamyl transferase predicts future stroke: a Korean nationwide study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25158</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Although gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is generally regarded as an alternative biomarker for alcohol consumption, its independent role in vascular diseases emerged recently. However, its role in stroke remains unknown. The aim of this study is to clarify the impact of GGT on stroke in a large-sized, national, standardized population cohort in Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: In Korea, the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) provides full-coverage health insurance service for all citizens. Using data from the NHIS, the NHIS-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) was designed by randomly selecting 2% of Koreans, carefully considering demographic characteristics. We analyzed eligible individuals from this standardized cohort. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for the longitudinal study investigating the relationship between GGT and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Among the 456,100 eligible participants, 7,459 patients (1.64%) developed stroke as follows: 5,789 ischemic strokes, 1,046 intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs), and 624 subarachnoid hemorrhages. GGT was independently correlated with increased risk of stroke after adjustment for alcohol consumption and stroke risk factors (hazard ratio (HR), 1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.29–1.51). The risks of both ischemic stroke (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.32–1.58) and ICH (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.18–1.80) were significantly elevated with increasing GGT. Despite some effect modifications by sex, age and alcohol, the risk of total stroke and ischemic stroke in association with GGT remained significant in all subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: In a standard Korean population, GGT was a novel biomarker predicting stroke risk, independently from alcohol consumption and other risk factors.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pallidal deep brain stimulation modulates cortical excitability and plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25156</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Internal globus pallidus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) relieves symptoms in dystonia patients. However, the physiological effects produced by GPi DBS are not fully understood. In particular, how a single-pulse GPi DBS changes cortical circuits has never been investigated. We studied the modulation of motor cortical excitability and plasticity with single-pulse GPi DBS in dystonia patients with bilateral implantation of GPi DBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: The cortical evoked potentials from DBS were recorded with electroencephalography. Transcranial magnetic stimulation with a conditioning-test paired-pulse paradigm was used to investigate the effect of GPi DBS on the primary motor cortex. How GPi DBS might modulate the motor cortical plasticity was tested using a paired associative stimulation paradigm with repetitive pairs of GPi DBS and motor cortical stimulation at specific time intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: GPi stimulation produced two peaks of cortical evoked potentials with latencies of ∼10 and ∼25 ms in the motor cortical area. Cortical facilitation was observed at ∼10 ms after single-pulse GPi DBS and cortical inhibition was observed at ∼25 ms interval. Repetitive pairs of GPi stimulation with cortical stimulation at these two time intervals produced long term potentiation-like effects in the motor cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Single-pulse DBS modulates cortical excitability and plasticity at specific time intervals. These effects may be related to the mechanism of action of DBS. Combination of DBS with cortical stimulation at appropriate timing has therapeutic potential and could be explored in the future as a method to enhance the effects of neuromodulation for neurological and psychiatric diseases.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the association between incident Parkinson's disease (PD) and subsequent incident epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective cohort study with a nested case-control analysis using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We identified patients aged ≥40 years with an incident diagnosis of PD between 1995 and 2016 and a matched comparison group of PD-free individuals. We calculated crude incidence rates (IRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of epileptic seizures in PD patients and the PD-free comparison group, and corresponding crude incidence rate ratios (IRRs). In the nested case-control analysis, we calculated adjusted odds ratios (adj. ORs) of incident PD among cases with incident epileptic seizures and seizure-free controls overall and stratified by various, seizure-provoking comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 23,086 incident PD patients and 92,343 PD-free individuals, we identified 898 patients with incident epileptic seizures. The crude IR of epileptic seizures in PD patients was 266.7/100,000 person years (95% CI 235.6-297.7), and in PD-free individuals 112.4/100,000 person years (95% CI 103.5-121.3) [IRR: 2.37, 95% CI 2.06-2.37]. The adj. OR of epileptic seizures was 1.68 [95% CI 1.43-1.98]) in PD patients compared with PD-free individuals. PD patients with comorbid brain disorders (adj. OR 12.36 [95% CI 8.74-17.48]) or with &amp;gt;1 seizure-provoking comorbidity (adj. OR 13.24 [95% CI 10.15-17.25]) were at the highest risk of epileptic seizures compared with PD-free individuals with no seizure-provoking comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that incident PD is associated with an increased risk of incident epileptic seizures. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neutrophil hyperactivation correlates with Alzheimer's disease progression</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25159</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25159</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Recent studies have underlined the effect of systemic inflammation on the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Neutrophils are key components of early innate immunity and contribute to uncontrolled systemic inflammation if not tightly regulated. The aim of our study was to fully characterize human circulating neutrophils at different disease stages in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We analyzed neutrophil phenotypes and functions in forty-two patients with Alzheimer's disease (sixteen with mild cognitive impairment and twenty-six with dementia), and compared them with twenty-two age-matched healthy subjects. This study was performed directly in whole blood to avoid issues with data interpretation related to cell isolation procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Blood samples from Alzheimer's diseases patients with dementia revealed neutrophil hyperactivation associated with increased reactive oxygen species production and increased levels of intravascular neutrophil extravascular traps. The homeostasis of circulating neutrophils in these patients also changed: the ratio between the harmful hyperreactive CXCR4&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt;/CD62L&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt; senescent and the CD16&lt;sup&gt;bright&lt;/sup&gt;/CD62L&lt;sup&gt;dim&lt;/sup&gt; immunosuppressive neutrophil subsets rose in the later stage of the disease. These abnormalities were greater in fast-decliner than in slow-decliner patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our results indicate that the inflammatory properties of circulating neutrophils shift as the percentage of aged neutrophils expands in patients with Alzheimer's disease — changes that may play an instrumental role in establishing systemic chronic inflammation. Most important, our data strongly suggest that the neutrophil phenotype may be associated with the rate of cognitive decline and may thus constitute an innovative and prognostic blood biomarker in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Metallothioneins are Neuroprotective Agents in Lysosomal Storage Disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25161</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25161</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs) are a broad class of inherited metabolic diseases caused by the defective activity of lysosomal enzymes. Central nervous system (CNS) manifestations are present in roughly 50% of LSD patients and represent an unmet medical need for them. We explored the therapeutic potential of Metallothioneins (MTs), a newly identified family of proteins with reported neuroprotective roles, in the murine models of two LSDs with CNS involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: MT-1 over-expressing transgenic mice (MTtg) were crossed with the murine models of Batten and Krabbe diseases. Changes in the survival and in the manifestations of the disease in the MTtg setting were assessed. In addition, we analyzed the therapeutic effects of MT-1 CNS gene delivery in one of these LSD models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Constitutive expression of MT-1 exerted favorable phenotypic effects in both LSD models. MT-LSD mice showed a 5-10% increase in survival and slower disease progression as compared to not-transgenic LSD mice. Rescue of Purkinje cells from degeneration and apoptosis was also observed in the MT- LSD models. This phenotypic amelioration was accompanied by a modulation of the disease-associated activated inflammatory microglia phenotype, and by a reduction of oxidative stress. Importantly for the clinical translation of our findings, the very same effects were obtained when MTs were delivered to the brains by systemic AAV gene transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: MTs can be considered novel therapeutic agents (and targets) in LSDs and potentiate the effects of approaches aiming at correction of the disease-causing enzyme deficiency in the CNS.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Expression profiling suggests microglial impairment in HIV neuropathogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25160</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25160</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD163&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages (MΦ)s and microglia accumulate in the brains of patients with HIV encephalitis (HIVE), a neuropathological correlate of the most severe form of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), HIV-associated dementia (HIV-D). Recently, we found that some parenchymal microglia in brain of HIV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; subjects without encephalitis (HIV/noE) but with varying degrees of neurocognitive impairment express CD16 and CD163, even in the absence of detectable virus production. To further our understanding of microglial activation in HIV, we investigated expression of specific genes by profiling parenchymal microglia from archival brain tissue of patients with HIVE, HIV/noE, and HIV&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Single-population microarray analyses were performed on ∼2,500 laser capture microdissected CD163&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MΦs/microglia per case, using terminal continuation (TC) RNA amplification and a custom-designed array platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Several classes of microglial transcripts in HIVE and HIV/noE, were altered, relative to HIV&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; subjects, including factors related to cell stress, immune activation, and apoptosis. Additionally, several neurotrophic factors are reduced in HIV infection, suggesting an additional mechanism of neuropathogenesis. The majority of transcripts altered in HIVE displayed intermediate changes in HIV/noE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our results support the notion that microglia contribute to the maintenance of brain homeostasis and their potential loss of function in the context of chronic inflammation contributes to neuropathogenesis. Furthermore, they indicate the utility of profiling MΦs/microglia to increase our understanding of microglia function, as well as ascertain alterations in specific pathways, genes, and, ostensibly, encoded proteins that may be amenable to targeted treatment modalities in diseases affecting the brain.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Neuromodulation Influences Synchronization and Intrinsic Read-out. (arXiv:q-bio/0507037v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The roles of neuromodulation in a neural network, such as in a cortical
microcolumn, are still incompletely understood. Neuromodulation influences
neural processing by presynaptic and postsynaptic regulation of synaptic
efficacy. Synaptic efficacy modulation can be an effective way to rapidly alter
network density and topology. We show that altering network topology, together
with density, will affect its synchronization. Fast synaptic efficacy
modulation may therefore influence the amount of correlated spiking in a
network. Neuromodulation also affects ion channel regulation for intrinsic
excitability, which alters the neuron's activation function. We show that
synchronization in a network influences the read-out of these intrinsic
properties. Highly synchronous input drives neurons, such that differences in
intrinsic properties disappear, while asynchronous input lets intrinsic
properties determine output behavior. Thus, altering network topology can alter
the balance between intrinsically vs. synaptically driven network activity. We
conclude that neuromodulation may allow a network to shift between a more
synchronized transmission mode and a more asynchronous intrinsic read-out mode.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Psychlab is a simulated psychology laboratory inside the first-person 3D game
world of DeepMind Lab (Beattie et al. 2016). Psychlab enables implementations
of classical laboratory psychological experiments so that they work with both
human and artificial agents. Psychlab has a simple and flexible API that
enables users to easily create their own tasks. As examples, we are releasing
Psychlab implementations of several classical experimental paradigms including
visual search, change detection, random dot motion discrimination, and multiple
object tracking. We also contribute a study of the visual psychophysics of a
specific state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning agent: UNREAL (Jaderberg
et al. 2016). This study leads to the surprising conclusion that UNREAL learns
more quickly about larger target stimuli than it does about smaller stimuli. In
turn, this insight motivates a specific improvement in the form of a simple
model of foveal vision that turns out to significantly boost UNREAL's
performance, both on Psychlab tasks, and on standard DeepMind Lab tasks. By
open-sourcing Psychlab we hope to facilitate a range of future such studies
that simultaneously advance deep reinforcement learning and improve its links
with cognitive science.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the central nervous systems of animals like pigeons and locusts, neurons
were identified which signal objects approaching the animal on a direct
collision course. Unraveling the neural circuitry for collision avoidance, and
identifying the underlying computational principles, is promising for building
vision-based neuromorphic architectures, which in the near future could find
applications in cars or planes. At the present there is no published model
available for robust detection of approaching objects under real-world
conditions. Here we present a computational architecture for signalling
impending collisions, based on known anatomical data of the locust \emph{lobula
giant movement detector} (LGMD) neuron. Our model shows robust performance even
in adverse situations, such as with approaching low-contrast objects, or with
highly textured and moving backgrounds. We furthermore discuss which components
need to be added to our model to convert it into a full-fledged
real-world-environment collision detector. KEYWORDS: Locust, LGMD, collision

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although there is increasing evidence of criticality in the brain, the
processes that guide neuronal networks to reach or maintain criticality remain
unclear. The present research examines the role of neuronal gain plasticity in
time-series of simulated neuronal networks composed of integrate-and-fire
stochastic spiking neurons, and the utility of fractal methods in assessing
network criticality. Simulated time-series were derived from a network model of
fully connected discrete-time stochastic excitable neurons. Monofractal and
multifractal analyses were applied to neuronal gain time-series. Fractal
scaling was greatest in networks with a mid-range of neuronal plasticity,
versus extremely high or low levels of plasticity. Peak fractal scaling
corresponded closely to additional indices of criticality, including average
branching ratio. Networks exhibited multifractal structure, or multiple scaling
relationships. Multifractal spectra around peak criticality exhibited elongated
right tails, suggesting that the fractal structure is relatively insensitive to
high-amplitude local fluctuations. Networks near critical states exhibited
mid-range multifractal spectra width and tail length, which is consistent with
literature suggesting that networks poised at quasi-critical states must be
stable enough to maintain organization but unstable enough to be adaptable.
Lastly, fractal analyses may offer additional information about critical state
dynamics of networks by indicating scales of influence as networks approach
critical states.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Subthreshold Activity Underlying the Diversity and Selectivity of the Primary Auditory Cortex Studied by Intracellular Recordings in Awake Marmosets</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy006</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Extracellular recording studies have revealed diverse and selective neural responses in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake animals. However, we have limited knowledge on subthreshold events that give rise to these responses, especially in non-human primates, as intracellular recordings in awake animals pose substantial technical challenges. We developed a novel intracellular recording technique in awake marmosets to systematically study subthreshold activity of A1 neurons that underlies their diverse and selective spiking responses. Our findings showed that in contrast to predominantly transient depolarization observed in A1 of anesthetized animals, both transient and sustained depolarization (during or beyond the stimulus period) were observed. Comparing with spiking responses, subthreshold responses were often longer lasting in duration and more broadly tuned in frequency, and showed narrower intensity tuning in non-monotonic neurons and lower response threshold in monotonic neurons. These observations demonstrated the enhancement of stimulus selectivity from subthreshold to spiking responses in individual A1 neurons. Furthermore, A1 neurons classified as regular- or fast-spiking subpopulation based on their spike shapes exhibited distinct response properties in frequency and intensity domains. These findings provide valuable insights into cortical integration and transformation of auditory information at the cellular level in auditory cortex of awake non-human primates.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Genetic Influences on the Development of Cerebral Cortical Thickness During Childhood and Adolescence in a Dutch Longitudinal Twin Sample: The Brainscale Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy005</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Previous studies have demonstrated that cortical thickness (CT) is under strong genetic control across the life span. However, little is known about genetic influences that cause changes in cortical thickness (Î”CT) during brain development. We obtained 482 longitudinal MRI scans at ages 9, 12, and 17 years from 215 twins and applied structural equation modeling to estimate genetic influences on (1) cortical thickness between regions and across time, and (2) changes in cortical thickness between ages. Although cortical thickness is largely mediated by the same genetic factor throughout late childhood and adolescence, we found evidence for influences of distinct genetic factors on regions across space and time. In addition, we found genetic influences for cortical thinning during adolescence that is mostly due to fluctuating influences from the same genetic factor, with evidence of local influences from a second emerging genetic factor. This fluctuating core genetic factor and emerging novel genetic factor might be implicated in the rapid cognitive and behavioral development during childhood and adolescence, and could potentially be targets for investigation into the manifestation of psychiatric disorders that have their origin in childhood and adolescence.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Quantifying the genetic architecture of the cerebral cortex is necessary for understanding disease and changes to the brain across the lifespan. Prior work shows that both surface area (SA) and cortical thickness (CT) are heritable. However, we do not yet understand the extent to which region-specific genetic factors (i.e., independent of global effects) play a dominant role in the regional patterning or inter-regional associations across the cortex. Using a population sample of young adult twins (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 923), we show that the heritability of SA and CT varies widely across regions, generally independent of measurement error. When global effects are controlled for, we detected a complex pattern of genetically mediated clusters of inter-regional associations, which varied between hemispheres. There were generally weak associations between the SA of different regions, except within the occipital lobe, whereas CT was positively correlated within lobar divisions and negatively correlated across lobes, mostly due to genetic covariation. These findings were replicated in an independent sample of twins and siblings (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 698) from the Human Connectome Project. The different genetic contributions to SA and CT across regions reveal the value of quantifying sources of covariation to appreciate the genetic complexity of cortical structures.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Vision is the dominant sensory modality in many organisms for foraging, predator avoidance, and social behaviors including mate selection. Vertebrate visual perception is initiated when light strikes rod and cone photoreceptors within the neural retina of the eye. Sensitivity to individual colors, i.e., peak spectral sensitivities (λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of visual pigments, are a function of the type of chromophore and the amino acid sequence of the associated opsin protein in the photoreceptors. Large differences in peak spectral sensitivities can result from minor differences in amino acid sequence of cone opsins. To determine how minor sequence differences could result in large spectral shifts we selected a spectrally-diverse group of 14 teleost Rh2 cone opsins for which sequences and λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; are experimentally known. Classical molecular dynamics simulations were carried out after embedding chromophore-associated homology structures within explicit bilayers and water. These simulations revealed structural features of visual pigments, particularly within the chromophore, that contributed to diverged spectral sensitivities. Statistical tests performed on all the observed structural parameters associated with the chromophore revealed that a two-term, first-order regression model was sufficient to accurately predict λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; over a range of 452–528 nm. The approach was accurate, efficient and simple in that site-by-site molecular modifications or complex quantum mechanics models were not required to predict λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;. These studies identify structural features associated with the chromophore that may explain diverged spectral sensitivities, and provide a platform for future, functionally predictive opsin modeling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zs0zKBCg8z8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Membraneless organelles important to intracellular compartmentalization have recently been shown to comprise assemblies of proteins which undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). However, many proteins involved in this phase separation are at least partially disordered. The molecular mechanism and the sequence determinants of this process are challenging to determine experimentally owing to the disordered nature of the assemblies, motivating the use of theoretical and simulation methods. This work advances a computational framework for conducting simulations of LLPS with residue-level detail, and allows for the determination of phase diagrams and coexistence densities of proteins in the two phases. The model includes a short-range contact potential as well as a simplified treatment of electrostatic energy. Interaction parameters are optimized against experimentally determined radius of gyration data for multiple unfolded or intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). These models are applied to two systems which undergo LLPS: the low complexity domain of the RNA-binding protein FUS and the DEAD-box helicase protein LAF-1. We develop a novel simulation method to determine thermodynamic phase diagrams as a function of the total protein concentration and temperature. We show that the model is capable of capturing qualitative changes in the phase diagram due to phosphomimetic mutations of FUS and to the presence or absence of the large folded domain in LAF-1. We also explore the effects of chain-length, or multivalency, on the phase diagram, and obtain results consistent with Flory-Huggins theory for polymers. Most importantly, the methodology presented here is flexible so that it can be easily extended to other pair potentials, be used with other enhanced sampling methods, and may incorporate additional features for biological systems of interest.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0oaYFiuLVmE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25131-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We performed a population-based comparative study of the incidence and prevalence of autoimmune and infectious encephalitis in Olmsted County, Minnesota. Autoimmune encephalitis diagnosis and subgroups were defined by 2016 diagnostic criteria, and infectious encephalitis diagnosis required a confirmed infectious pathogen. Age- and sex-adjusted prevalence and incidence rates were calculated. Patients with encephalitis of uncertain etiology were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25131-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of autoimmune encephalitis on January 1, 2014 of 13.7/100,000 was not significantly different from that of all infectious encephalitides (11.6/100,000; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.63) or the viral subcategory (8.3/100,000; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.17). The incidence rates (1995–2015) of autoimmune and infectious encephalitis were 0.8/100,000 and 1.0/100,000 person-years, respectively (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.58). The number of relapses or recurrent hospitalizations was higher for autoimmune than infectious encephalitis (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03). The incidence of autoimmune encephalitis increased over time from 0.4/100,000 person-years (1995–2005) to 1.2/100,000 person-years (2006–2015; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02), attributable to increased detection of autoantibody-positive cases. The incidence (2.8 vs 0.7/100,000 person-years, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01) and prevalence (38.3 vs 13.7/100,000, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04) of autoimmune encephalitis was higher among African Americans than Caucasians. The prevalence of specific neural autoantibodies was as follows: myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, 1.9/100,000; glutamic acid decarboxylase 65, 1.9/100,000; unclassified neural autoantibody, 1.4/100,000; leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1, 0.7/100,000; collapsin response-mediator protein 5, 0.7/100,000; N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, 0.6/100,000; antineuronal nuclear antibody type 2, 0.6/100,000; and glial fibrillary acidic protein α, 0.6/100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25122-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glycogen in astrocyte processes contributes to maintenance of low extracellular glutamate and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations around excitatory synapses. Sleep deprivation (SD), a common migraine trigger, induces transcriptional changes in astrocytes, reducing glycogen breakdown. We hypothesize that when glycogen utilization cannot match synaptic energy demand, extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can rise to levels that activate neuronal pannexin-1 channels and downstream inflammatory pathway, which might be one of the mechanisms initiating migraine headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25122-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We suppressed glycogen breakdown by inhibiting glycogen phosphorylation with 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol (DAB) and by SD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25122-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAB caused neuronal pannexin-1 large pore opening and activation of the downstream inflammatory pathway as shown by procaspase-1 cleavage and HMGB1 release from neurons. Six-hour SD induced pannexin-1 mRNA. DAB and SD also lowered the cortical spreading depression (CSD) induction threshold, which was reversed by glucose or lactate supplement, suggesting that glycogen-derived energy substrates are needed to prevent CSD generation. Supporting this, knocking down the neuronal lactate transporter MCT2 with an antisense oligonucleotide or inhibiting glucose transport from vessels to astrocytes with intracerebroventricularly delivered phloretin reduced the CSD threshold. In vivo recordings with a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive/selective fluoroprobe, Asante Potassium Green-4, revealed that DAB treatment or SD caused a significant rise in extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; during whisker stimulation, illustrating the critical role of glycogen in extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25122-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synaptic metabolic stress caused by insufficient glycogen-derived energy substrate supply can activate neuronal pannexin-1 channels as well as lower the CSD threshold. Therefore, conditions that limit energy supply to synapses (eg, SD) may predispose to migraine attacks, as suggested by genetic studies associating glucose or lactate transporter deficiency with migraine.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pathological mechanisms underlying single large-scale mitochondrial DNA deletions</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25127-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single, large-scale deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are a common cause of mitochondrial disease. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the genetic defect and molecular phenotype to improve understanding of pathogenic mechanisms associated with single, large-scale mtDNA deletions in skeletal muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25127-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We investigated 23 muscle biopsies taken from adult patients (6 males/17 females with a mean age of 43 years) with characterized single, large-scale mtDNA deletions. Mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency in skeletal muscle biopsies was quantified by immunoreactivity levels for complex I and complex IV proteins. Single muscle fibers with varying degrees of deficiency were selected from 6 patient biopsies for determination of mtDNA deletion level and copy number by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25127-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have defined 3 “classes” of single, large-scale deletion with distinct patterns of mitochondrial deficiency, determined by the size and location of the deletion. Single fiber analyses showed that fibers with greater respiratory chain deficiency harbored higher levels of mtDNA deletion with an increase in total mtDNA copy number. For the first time, we have demonstrated that threshold levels for complex I and complex IV deficiency differ based on deletion class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25127-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining genetic and immunofluorescent assays, we conclude that thresholds for complex I and complex IV deficiency are modulated by the deletion of complex-specific protein-encoding genes. Furthermore, removal of mt-tRNA genes impacts specific complexes only at high deletion levels, when complex-specific protein-encoding genes remain. These novel findings provide valuable insight into the pathogenic mechanisms associated with these mutations. Ann Neurol 2018;83:115–130&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: High-frequency oscillations are not better biomarkers of epileptogenic tissues than spikes</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25124-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracerebral EEG (stereoelectroencephalography; SEEG) are considered as better biomarkers of epileptogenic tissues than spikes. How this can be applied at the patient level remains poorly understood. We investigated how well HFOs and spikes can predict epileptogenic regions with a large spatial sampling at the patient level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25124-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed non-REM sleep SEEG recordings sampled at 2,048Hz of 30 patients. Ripples (Rs; 80–250Hz), fast ripples (FRs; 250–500Hz), and spikes were automatically detected. Rates of these markers and several combinations—spikes co-occurring with HFOs or FRs and cross-rate (Spk⊗HFO)—were compared to a quantified measure of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) by performing a receiver operating characteristic analysis for each patient individually. We used a Wilcoxon signed-rank test corrected for false-discovery rate to assess whether a marker was better than the others for predicting the SOZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25124-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 2,930 channels was analyzed (median of 100 channels per patient). The HFOs or any of its variants were not statistically better than spikes. Only one feature, the cross-rate, was better than all the other markers. Moreover, fast ripples, even though very specific, were not delineating all epileptogenic tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25124-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the patient level, the performance of HFOs is weakened by the presence of strong physiological HFO generators. Fast ripples are not sensitive enough to be the unique biomarker of epileptogenicity. Nevertheless, combining HFOs and spikes using our proposed measure—the cross-rate—is a better strategy than using only one marker.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antibodies against contactin associated protein-like 2 (Caspr2) are found in some patients with autoimmune encephalitis. To see how these antibodies interact with Caspr2, cultured rat hippocampal neurons were stained with antibodies against the Caspr2 protein on the cell surface (red) and with antibodies against the Caspr2 protein that can penetrate the cell (green). Nearly all of the stained protein is golden colored (overlap of red and green), indicating that it was stained with both antibodies because it was on the surface of the cell. Caspr2 antibodies may cause encephalitis by binding to nerve cells in the brain and blocking their cell surface interactions with other cells.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25126-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has recently been investigated as a new treatment modality for essential tremor (ET), but the durability of the procedure has not yet been evaluated. This study reports results at a 2- year follow-up after MRgFUS thalamotomy for ET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25126-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 76 patients with moderate-to-severe ET, who had not responded to at least two trials of medical therapy, were enrolled in the original randomized study of unilateral thalamotomy and evaluated using the clinical rating scale for tremor. Sixty-seven of the patients continued in the open-label extension phase of the study with monitoring for 2 years. Nine patients were excluded by 2 years, for example, because of alternative therapy such as deep brain stimulation (n = 3) or inadequate thermal lesioning (n = 1). However, all patients in each follow-up period were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25126-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mean hand tremor score at baseline (19.8 ± 4.9; 76 patients) improved by 55% at 6 months (8.6 ± 4.5; 75 patients). The improvement in tremor score from baseline was durable at 1 year (53%; 8.9 ± 4.8; 70 patients) and at 2 years (56%; 8.8 ± 5.0; 67 patients). Similarly, the disability score at baseline (16.4 ± 4.5; 76 patients) improved by 64% at 6 months (5.4 ± 4.7; 75 patients). This improvement was also sustained at 1 year (5.4 ± 5.3; 70 patients) and at 2 years (6.5 ± 5.0; 67 patients). Paresthesias and gait disturbances were the most common adverse effects at 1 year—each observed in 10 patients with an additional 5 patients experiencing neurological adverse effects. None of the adverse events worsened over the period of follow-up, and 2 of these resolved. There were no new delayed complications at 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25126-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tremor suppression after MRgFUS thalamotomy for ET is stably maintained at 2 years. Latent or delayed complications do not develop after treatment. Ann Neurol 2018;83:107–114&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monoclonal antibodies that target CD20 expressing B cells represent an important new treatment option for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). B-cell-depleting therapy is highly effective against relapsing forms of the disease and is also the first treatment approach proven to protect against disability worsening in primary progressive MS. Moreover, evolving clinical experience with B-cell therapy, combined with a more sophisticated understanding of humoral immunity in preclinical models and in patients with MS, has led to major progress in deciphering the immune pathogenesis of MS. Here, we review the nuanced roles of B cells in MS autoimmunity, the clinical data supporting use of ocrelizumab and other anti-CD20 therapies in the treatment of MS, as well as safety and practical considerations for prescribing. Last, we summarize remaining unanswered questions regarding the proper role of anti-CD20 therapy in MS, its limitations, and the future landscape of B-cell-based approaches to treatment.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25134-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate parameters associated with hematoma enlargement in non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC)-related intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25134-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This retrospective cohort study includes individual patient data for 190 patients with NOAC-associated ICH over a 5-year period (2011–2015) at 19 departments of neurology across Germany. Primary outcome was the association of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) administration with hematoma enlargement. Subanalyses were calculated for blood pressure management and its association with the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include associations with in-hospital mortality and functional outcome at 3 months assessed using the modified Rankin Scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25134-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study population for analysis of primary and secondary outcomes consisted of 146 NOAC-ICH patients with available follow-up imaging. Hematoma enlargement occurred in 49/146 (33.6%) patients with NOAC-related ICH. Parameters associated with hematoma enlargement were blood pressure ≥ 160mmHg within 4 hours and—in the case of factor Xa inhibitor ICH—anti-Xa levels on admission. PCC administration prior to follow-up imaging was not significantly associated with a reduced rate of hematoma enlargement either in overall NOAC-related ICH or in patients with factor Xa inhibitor intake (NOAC: risk ratio [RR] = 1.150, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.632–2.090; factor Xa inhibitor: RR = 1.057, 95% CI = 0.565–1.977), regardless of PCC dosage given or time interval until imaging or treatment. Systolic blood pressure levels &amp;lt; 160mmHg within 4 hours after admission were significantly associated with a reduction in the proportion of patients with hematoma enlargement (RR = 0.598, 95% CI = 0.365–0.978). PCC administration had no effect on mortality and functional outcome either at discharge or at 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25134-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to blood pressure control, PCC administration was not associated with a reduced rate of hematoma enlargement in NOAC-related ICH. Our findings support the need of further investigations exploring new hemostatic reversal strategies for patients with factor Xa inhibitor–related ICH.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the visual system, the response to a stimulus in a neuron's receptive field can be modulated by stimulus context, and the strength of these contextual influences vary with stimulus intensity. Recent work has shown how a theoretical model, the stabilized supralinear network (SSN), can account for such modulatory influences, using a small set of computational mechanisms. Although the predictions of the SSN have been confirmed in primary visual cortex (V1), its computational principles apply with equal validity to any cortical structure. We have therefore tested the generality of the SSN by examining modulatory influences in the middle temporal area (MT) of the macaque visual cortex, using electrophysiological recordings and pharmacological manipulations. We developed a novel stimulus that can be adjusted parametrically to be larger or smaller in the space of all possible motion directions. We found, as predicted by the SSN, that MT neurons integrate across motion directions for low-contrast stimuli, but that they exhibit suppression by the same stimuli when they are high in contrast. These results are analogous to those found in visual cortex when stimulus size is varied in the space domain. We further tested the mechanisms of inhibition using pharmacological manipulations of inhibitory efficacy. As predicted by the SSN, local manipulation of inhibitory strength altered firing rates, but did not change the strength of surround suppression. These results are consistent with the idea that the SSN can account for modulatory influences along different stimulus dimensions and in different cortical areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Visual neurons are selective for specific stimulus features in a region of visual space known as the receptive field, but can be modulated by stimuli outside of the receptive field. The SSN model has been proposed to account for these and other modulatory influences, and tested in V1. As this model is not specific to any particular stimulus feature or brain region, we wondered whether similar modulatory influences might be observed for other stimulus dimensions and other regions. We tested for specific patterns of modulatory influences in the domain of motion direction, using electrophysiological recordings from MT. Our data confirm the predictions of the SSN in MT, suggesting that the SSN computations might be a generic feature of sensory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Computational Account of Optimizing Social Predictions Reveals That Adolescents Are Conservative Learners in Social Contexts</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/974?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As adolescents transition to the complex world of adults, optimizing predictions about others' preferences becomes vital for successful social interactions. Mounting evidence suggests that these social learning processes are affected by ongoing brain development across adolescence. A mechanistic understanding of how adolescents optimize social predictions and how these learning strategies are implemented in the brain is lacking. To fill this gap, we combined computational modeling with functional neuroimaging. In a novel social learning task, male and female human adolescents and adults predicted the preferences of peers and could update their predictions based on trial-by-trial feedback about the peers' actual preferences. Participants also rated their own preferences for the task items and similar additional items. To describe how participants optimize their inferences over time, we pitted simple reinforcement learning models against more specific &quot;combination&quot; models, which describe inferences based on a combination of reinforcement learning from past feedback and participants' own preferences. Formal model comparison revealed that, of the tested models, combination models best described how adults and adolescents update predictions of others. Parameter estimates of the best-fitting model differed between age groups, with adolescents showing more conservative updating. This developmental difference was accompanied by a shift in encoding predictions and the errors thereof within the medial prefrontal and fusiform cortices. In the adolescent group, encoding of own preferences and prediction errors scaled with parent-reported social traits, which provides additional external validity for our learning task and the winning computational model. Our findings thus help to specify adolescent-specific social learning processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Adolescence is a unique developmental period of heightened awareness about other people. Here we probe the suitability of various computational models to describe how adolescents update their predictions of others' preferences. Within the tested model space, predictions of adults and adolescents are best described by the same learning model, but adolescents show more conservative updating. Compared with adults, brain activity of adolescents is modulated less by predictions themselves and more by prediction errors per se, and this relationship scales with adolescents' social traits. Our findings help specify social learning across adolescence and generate hypotheses about social dysfunctions in psychiatric populations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Causal Evidence for Learning-Dependent Frontal Lobe Contributions to Cognitive Control</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/962?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) plays a central role in the prioritization of sensory input based on task relevance. Such top-down control of perception is of fundamental importance in goal-directed behavior, but can also be costly when deployed excessively, necessitating a mechanism that regulates control engagement to align it with changing environmental demands. We have recently introduced the &quot;flexible control model&quot; (FCM), which explains this regulation as resulting from a self-adjusting reinforcement-learning mechanism that infers latent statistical structure in dynamic task environments to predict forthcoming states. From this perspective, LPFC-based control is engaged as a function of anticipated cognitive demand, a notion for which we previously obtained correlative neuroimaging evidence. Here, we put this hypothesis to a rigorous, causal test by combining the FCM with a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) intervention that transiently perturbed the LPFC. Human participants (male and female) completed a nonstationary version of the Stroop task with dynamically changing probabilities of conflict between task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimulus features. TMS was given on each trial before stimulus onset either over the LPFC or over a control site. In the control condition, we observed adaptive performance fluctuations consistent with demand predictions that were inferred from recent and remote trial history and effectively captured by our model. Critically, TMS over the LPFC eliminated these fluctuations while leaving basic cognitive and motor functions intact. These results provide causal evidence for a learning-based account of cognitive control and delineate the nature of the signals that regulate top-down biases over stimulus processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A core function of the human prefrontal cortex is to control the signal flow in sensory brain regions to prioritize processing of task-relevant information. Abundant work suggests that such control is flexibly recruited to accommodate dynamically changing environmental demands, yet the nature of the signals that serve to engage control remains unknown. Here, we combined computational modeling with noninvasive brain stimulation to show that changes in control engagement are captured by a self-adjusting reinforcement-learning mechanism that tracks changing environmental statistics to predict forthcoming processing demands and that transient perturbation of the prefrontal cortex abolishes these adjustments. These findings delineate the learning signals that underpin adaptive engagement of prefrontal control functions and provide causal evidence for their relevance in behavioral control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neuronal Glutamate Transporters Control Dopaminergic Signaling and Compulsive Behaviors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/937?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/937?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is an ongoing debate on the contribution of the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1 to the onset of compulsive behaviors. Here, we used behavioral, electrophysiological, molecular, and viral approaches in male and female mice to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which EAAC1 controls the execution of repeated motor behaviors. Our findings show that, in the striatum, a brain region implicated with movement execution, EAAC1 limits group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluRI) activation, facilitates D1 dopamine receptor (D1R) expression, and ensures long-term synaptic plasticity. Blocking mGluRI in slices from mice lacking EAAC1 restores D1R expression and synaptic plasticity. Conversely, activation of intracellular signaling pathways coupled to mGluRI in D1R-containing striatal neurons of mice expressing EAAC1 leads to reduced D1R protein level and increased stereotyped movement execution. These findings identify new molecular mechanisms by which EAAC1 can shape glutamatergic and dopaminergic signals and control repeated movement execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Genetic studies implicate &lt;i&gt;Slc1a1&lt;/i&gt;, a gene encoding the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1, with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). EAAC1 is abundantly expressed in the striatum, a brain region that is hyperactive in OCD. What remains unknown is how EAAC1 shapes synaptic function in the striatum. Our findings show that EAAC1 limits activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRIs) in the striatum and, by doing so, promotes D1 dopamine receptor (D1R) expression. Targeted activation of signaling cascades coupled to mGluRIs in mice expressing EAAC1 reduces D1R expression and triggers repeated motor behaviors. These findings provide new information on the molecular basis of OCD and suggest new avenues for its treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Common Pathophysiology in Multiple Mouse Models of Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/918?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mutations or deletions of the transcription factor &lt;i&gt;TCF4&lt;/i&gt; are linked to Pitt–Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) and schizophrenia, suggesting that the precise pathogenic mutations dictate cellular, synaptic, and behavioral consequences. Here, we generated two novel mouse models of PTHS, one that mimics the most common pathogenic &lt;i&gt;TCF4&lt;/i&gt; point mutation (human R580W, mouse R579W) and one that deletes three pathogenic arginines, and explored phenotypes of these lines alongside models of pan-cellular or CNS-specific heterozygous &lt;i&gt;Tcf4&lt;/i&gt; disruption. We used mice of both sexes to show that impaired &lt;i&gt;Tcf4&lt;/i&gt; function results in consistent microcephaly, hyperactivity, reduced anxiety, and deficient spatial learning. All four PTHS mouse models demonstrated exaggerated hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), consistent with deficits in hippocampus-mediated behaviors. We further examined R579W mutant mice and mice with pan-cellular &lt;i&gt;Tcf4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygosity and found that they exhibited hippocampal NMDA receptor hyperfunction, which likely drives the enhanced LTP. Together, our data pinpoint convergent neurobiological features in PTHS mouse models and provide a foundation for preclinical studies and a rationale for testing whether NMDAR antagonists might be used to treat PTHS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Pitt–Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder associated with &lt;i&gt;TCF4&lt;/i&gt; mutations/deletions. Despite this genetic insight, there is a need to identify the function of TCF4 in the brain. Toward this goal, we developed two mouse lines, including one harboring the most prevalent pathogenic point mutation, and compared them with two existing models that conditionally delete &lt;i&gt;Tcf4&lt;/i&gt;. Our data identify a set of overlapping phenotypes that may serve as outcome measures for preclinical studies of PTHS treatments. We also discovered penetrant enhanced synaptic plasticity across mouse models that may be linked to increased NMDA receptor function. These data reveal convergent neurobiological characteristics of PTHS mouse models and support the further investigation of NMDA receptor antagonists as a possible PTHS treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Proteolytic Processing of Neurexins by Presenilins Sustains Synaptic Vesicle Release</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/901?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Proteolytic processing of synaptic adhesion components can accommodate the function of synapses to activity-dependent changes. The adhesion system formed by neurexins (Nrxns) and neuroligins (Nlgns) bidirectionally orchestrate the function of presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals. Previous studies have shown that presenilins (PS), components of the gamma-secretase complex frequently mutated in familial Alzheimer's disease, clear from glutamatergic terminals the accumulation of Nrxn C-terminal fragments (Nrxn-CTF) generated by ectodomain shedding. Here, we characterized the synaptic consequences of the proteolytic processing of Nrxns in cultured hippocampal neurons from mice and rats of both sexes. We show that activation of presynaptic Nrxns with postsynaptic Nlgn1 or inhibition of ectodomain shedding in axonal Nrxn1-β increases presynaptic release at individual terminals, likely reflecting an increase in the number of functional release sites. Importantly, inactivation of PS inhibits presynaptic release downstream of Nrxn activation, leaving synaptic vesicle recruitment unaltered. Glutamate-receptor signaling initiates the activity-dependent generation of Nrxn-CTF, which accumulate at presynaptic terminals lacking PS function. The sole expression of Nrxn-CTF decreases presynaptic release and calcium flux, recapitulating the deficits due to loss of PS function. Our data indicate that inhibition of Nrxn processing by PS is deleterious to glutamatergic function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To gain insight into the role of presenilins (PS) in excitatory synaptic function, we address the relevance of the proteolytic processing of presynaptic neurexins (Nrxns) in glutamatergic differentiation. Using synaptic fluorescence probes in cultured hippocampal neurons, we report that trans-synaptic activation of Nrxns produces a robust increase in presynaptic calcium levels and neurotransmitter release at individual glutamatergic terminals by a mechanism that depends on normal PS activity. Abnormal accumulation of Nrxn C-terminal fragments resulting from impaired PS activity inhibits presynaptic calcium signal and neurotransmitter release, assigning synaptic defects to Nrxns as a specific PS substrate. These data may provide links into how loss of PS activity inhibits glutamatergic synaptic function in Alzheimer's disease patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Orai1 Plays a Crucial Role in Central Sensitization by Modulating Neuronal Excitability</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/887?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pathological pain is a common and debilitating condition that is often poorly managed. Central sensitization is an important mechanism underlying pathological pain. However, candidate molecules involved in central sensitization remain unclear. Store-operated calcium channels (SOCs) mediate important calcium signals in nonexcitable and excitable cells. SOCs have been implicated in a wide variety of human pathophysiological conditions, including immunodeficiency, occlusive vascular diseases, and cancer. However, the role of SOCs in CNS disorders has been relatively unexplored. Orai1, a key component of SOCs, is expressed in the human and rodent spinal cord dorsal horn, but its functional significance in dorsal horn neurons is poorly understood. Here we sought to explore a potential role of Orai1 in the modulation of neuronal excitability and A-type potassium channels involved in pain plasticity. Using both male and female Orai1 knock-out mice, we found that activation of Orai1 increased neuronal excitability and reduced A-type potassium channels via the protein kinase C–extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (PKC–ERK) pathway in dorsal horn neurons. Orai1 deficiency significantly decreased acute pain induced by noxious stimuli, nearly eliminated the second phase of formalin-induced nociceptive response, markedly attenuated carrageenan-induced ipsilateral pain hypersensitivity and abolished carrageenan-induced contralateral mechanical allodynia. Consistently, carrageenan-induced increase in neuronal excitability was abolished in the dorsal horn from Orai1 mutant mice. These findings uncover a novel signaling pathway involved in the pain process and central sensitization. Our study also reveals a novel link among Orai1, ERK, A-type potassium channels, and neuronal excitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Orai1 is a key component of store-operated calcium channels (SOCs) in many cell types. It has been implicated in such pathological conditions as immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and cancer. However, the role of Orai1 in CNS disorders remains poorly understood. The functional significance of Orai1 in neurons is elusive. Here we demonstrate that activation of Orai1 modulates neuronal excitability and Kv4-containing A-type potassium channels via the protein kinase C–extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (PKC–ERK) pathway. Genetic knock-out of Orai1 nearly eliminates the second phase of formalin-induced pain and markedly attenuates carrageenan-induced pain hypersensitivity and neuronal excitability. These findings reveal a novel link between Orai1 and neuronal excitability and advance our understanding of central sensitization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Early Procedural Pain Is Associated with Regionally-Specific Alterations in Thalamic Development in Preterm Neonates</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/878?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Very preterm human neonates are exposed to numerous invasive procedures as part of life-saving care. Evidence suggests that repetitive neonatal procedural pain precedes long-term alterations in brain development. However, to date the link between pain and brain development has limited temporal and anatomic specificity. We hypothesized that early exposure to painful stimuli during a period of rapid brain development, before pain modulatory systems reach maturity, will predict pronounced changes in thalamic development, and thereby cognitive and motor function. In a prospective cohort study, 155 very preterm neonates (82 males, 73 females) born 24–32 weeks' gestation underwent two MRIs at median postmenstrual ages 32 and 40 weeks that included structural, metabolic, and diffusion imaging. Detailed day-by-day clinical data were collected. Cognitive and motor abilities were assessed at 3 years, corrected age. The association of early (skin breaks, birth–Scan 1) and late pain (skin breaks, Scans 1–2) with thalamic volumes and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylaspartate (NAA)/choline (Cho), and fractional anisotropy of white-matter pathways was assessed. Early pain was associated with slower thalamic macrostructural growth, most pronounced in extremely premature neonates. Deformation-based morphometry analyses confirmed early pain-related volume losses were localized to somatosensory regions. In extremely preterm neonates early pain was associated with decreased thalamic NAA/Cho and microstructural alterations in thalamocortical pathways. Thalamic growth was in turn related to cognitive and motor outcomes. We observed regionally-specific alterations in the lateral thalamus and thalamocortical pathways in extremely preterm neonates exposed to more procedural pain. Findings suggest a sensitive period leading to lasting alterations in somatosensory-system development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Early exposure to repetitive procedural pain in very preterm neonates may disrupt the development of regions involved in somatosensory processing, leading to poor functional outcomes. We demonstrate that early pain is associated with thalamic volume loss in the territory of the somatosensory thalamus and is accompanied by disruptions thalamic metabolic growth and thalamocortical pathway maturation, particularly in extremely preterm neonates. Thalamic growth was associated with cognitive and motor outcome at 3 years corrected age. Findings provide evidence for a developmentally sensitive period whereby subcortical structures in young neonates may be most vulnerable to procedural pain. Furthermore, results suggest that the thalamus may play a key role underlying the association between neonatal pain and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes in these high-risk neonates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Miz1 Controls Schwann Cell Proliferation via H3K36me2 Demethylase Kdm8 to Prevent Peripheral Nerve Demyelination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/858?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/858?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Schwann cell differentiation and myelination depends on chromatin remodeling, histone acetylation, and methylation, which all affect Schwann cell proliferation. We previously reported that the deletion of the POZ (POxvirus and Zinc finger) domain of the transcription factor Miz1 (Myc-interacting zinc finger protein; encoded by &lt;i&gt;Zbtb17&lt;/i&gt;) in mouse Schwann cells (&lt;i&gt;Miz1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;POZ&lt;/i&gt;) causes a neuropathy at 90 d after birth [postnatal day (P) 90], with a subsequent spontaneous regeneration. Here we show that RNA sequencing from &lt;i&gt;Miz1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;POZ&lt;/i&gt; and control animals at P30 revealed a set of upregulated genes with a strong correlation to cell-cycle regulation. Consistently, a subset of Schwann cells did not exit the cell cycle as observed in control animals and the growth fraction increased over time. From the RNAseq gene list, two direct Miz1 target genes were identified, one of which encodes the histone H3K36&lt;sup&gt;me2&lt;/sup&gt; demethylase Kdm8. We show that the expression of &lt;i&gt;Kdm8&lt;/i&gt; is repressed by Miz1 and that its release in &lt;i&gt;Miz1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;POZ&lt;/i&gt; cells induces a decrease of H3K36&lt;sup&gt;me2&lt;/sup&gt;, especially in deregulated cell-cycle-related genes. The linkage between elevated &lt;i&gt;Kdm8&lt;/i&gt; expression, hypomethylation of H3K36 at cell-cycle-relevant genes, and the subsequent re-entering of adult Schwann cells into the cell cycle suggests that the release of &lt;i&gt;Kdm8&lt;/i&gt; repression in the absence of a functional Miz1 is a central issue in the development of the &lt;i&gt;Miz1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;POZ&lt;/i&gt; phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The deletion of the Miz1 (Myc-interacting zinc finger protein 1) POZ (POxvirus and Zinc finger) domain in Schwann cells causes a neuropathy. Here we report sustained Schwann cell proliferation caused by an increased expression of the direct Miz1 target gene &lt;i&gt;Kdm8&lt;/i&gt;, encoding a H3K36me2 demethylase. Hence, the demethylation of H3K36 is linked to the pathogenesis of a neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: ELMOD1 Stimulates ARF6-GTP Hydrolysis to Stabilize Apical Structures in Developing Vestibular Hair Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/843?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory hair cells require control of physical properties of their apical plasma membranes for normal development and function. Members of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) small GTPase family regulate membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal assembly in many cells. We identified ELMO domain-containing protein 1 (ELMOD1), a guanine nucleoside triphosphatase activating protein (GAP) for ARF6, as the most highly enriched ARF regulator in hair cells. To characterize ELMOD1 control of trafficking, we analyzed mice of both sexes from a strain lacking functional ELMOD1 [roundabout (&lt;i&gt;rda&lt;/i&gt;)]. In &lt;i&gt;rda/rda&lt;/i&gt; mice, cuticular plates of utricle hair cells initially formed normally, then degenerated after postnatal day 5; large numbers of vesicles invaded the compromised cuticular plate. Hair bundles initially developed normally, but the cell's apical membrane lifted away from the cuticular plate, and stereocilia elongated and fused. Membrane trafficking in type I hair cells, measured by FM1-43 dye labeling, was altered in &lt;i&gt;rda/rda&lt;/i&gt; mice. Consistent with the proposed GAP role for ELMOD1, the ARF6 GTP/GDP ratio was significantly elevated in &lt;i&gt;rda/rda&lt;/i&gt; utricles compared with controls, and the level of ARF6-GTP was correlated with the severity of the &lt;i&gt;rda/rda&lt;/i&gt; phenotype. These results suggest that conversion of ARF6 to its GDP-bound form is necessary for final stabilization of the hair bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Assembly of the mechanically sensitive hair bundle of sensory hair cells requires growth and reorganization of apical actin and membrane structures. Hair bundles and apical membranes in mice with mutations in the &lt;i&gt;Elmod1&lt;/i&gt; gene degenerate after formation, suggesting that the ELMOD1 protein stabilizes these structures. We show that ELMOD1 is a GTPase-activating protein in hair cells for the small GTP-binding protein ARF6, known to participate in actin assembly and membrane trafficking. We propose that conversion of ARF6 into the GDP-bound form in the apical domain of hair cells is essential for stabilizing apical actin structures like the hair bundle and ensuring that the apical membrane forms appropriately around the stereocilia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Non-Newly Generated, &quot;Immature&quot; Neurons in the Sheep Brain Are Not Restricted to Cerebral Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/826?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/826?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A newly proposed form of brain structural plasticity consists of non-newly generated, &quot;immature&quot; neurons of the adult cerebral cortex. Similar to newly generated neurons, these cells express the cytoskeletal protein Doublecortin (DCX), yet they are generated prenatally and then remain in a state of immaturity for long periods. In rodents, the immature neurons are restricted to the paleocortex, whereas in other mammals, they are also found in neocortex. Here, we analyzed the DCX-expressing cells in the whole sheep brain of both sexes to search for an indicator of structural plasticity at a cellular level in a relatively large-brained, long-living mammal. Brains from adult and newborn sheep (injected with BrdU and analyzed at different survival times) were processed for DCX, cell proliferation markers (Ki-67, BrdU), pallial/subpallial developmental origin (&lt;i&gt;Tbr1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sp8&lt;/i&gt;), and neuronal/glial antigens for phenotype characterization. We found immature-like neurons in the whole sheep cortex and in large populations of DCX-expressing cells within the external capsule and the surrounding gray matter (claustrum and amygdala). BrdU and Ki-67 detection at neonatal and adult ages showed that all of these DCX&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were generated during embryogenesis, not after birth. These results show that the adult sheep, unlike rodents, is largely endowed with non-newly generated neurons retaining immature features, suggesting that such plasticity might be particularly important in large-brained, long-living mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Brain plasticity is important in adaptation and brain repair. Structural changes span from synaptic plasticity to adult neurogenesis, the latter being highly reduced in large-brained, long-living mammals (e.g., humans). The cerebral cortex contains &quot;immature&quot; neurons, which are generated prenatally and then remain in an undifferentiated state for long periods, being detectable with markers of immaturity. We studied the distribution and developmental origin of these cells in the whole brain of sheep, relatively large-brained, long-living mammals. In addition to the expected cortical location, we also found populations of non-newly generated neurons in several subcortical regions (external capsule, claustrum, and amygdala). These results suggests that non-neurogenic, parenchymal structural plasticity might be more important in large mammals with respect to adult neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Synaptic Regulator {alpha}-Synuclein in Dopaminergic Fibers Is Essentially Required for the Maintenance of Subependymal Neural Stem Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/814?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic protein α-synuclein (α-SYN) modulates neurotransmission in a complex and poorly understood manner and aggregates in the cytoplasm of degenerating neurons in Parkinson's disease. Here, we report that α-SYN present in dopaminergic nigral afferents is essential for the normal cycling and maintenance of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the brain subependymal zone of adult male and female mice. We also show that premature senescence of adult NSCs into non-neurogenic astrocytes in mice lacking α-SYN resembles the effects of dopaminergic fiber degeneration resulting from chronic exposure to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetra-hydropyridine or intranigral inoculation of aggregated toxic α-SYN. Interestingly, NSC loss in α-SYN-deficient mice can be prevented by viral delivery of human α-SYN into their sustantia nigra or by treatment with l-DOPA, suggesting that α-SYN regulates dopamine availability to NSCs. Our data indicate that α-SYN, present in dopaminergic nerve terminals supplying the subependymal zone, acts as a niche component to sustain the neurogenic potential of adult NSCs and identify α-SYN and DA as potential targets to ameliorate neurogenic defects in the aging and diseased brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We report an essential role for the protein α-synuclein present in dopaminergic nigral afferents in the regulation of adult neural stem cell maintenance, identifying the first synaptic regulator with an implication in stem cell niche biology. Although the exact role of α-synuclein in neural transmission is not completely clear, our results indicate that it is required for stemness and the preservation of neurogenic potential in concert with dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Overexpression of the Histone Dimethyltransferase G9a in Nucleus Accumbens Shell Increases Cocaine Self-Administration, Stress-Induced Reinstatement, and Anxiety</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/803?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/803?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Repeated exposure to cocaine induces lasting epigenetic changes in neurons that promote the development and persistence of addiction. One epigenetic alteration involves reductions in levels of the histone dimethyltransferase G9a in nucleus accumbens (NAc) after chronic cocaine administration. This reduction in G9a may enhance cocaine reward because overexpressing G9a in the NAc decreases cocaine-conditioned place preference. Therefore, we hypothesized that HSV-mediated G9a overexpression in the NAc shell (NAcSh) would attenuate cocaine self-administration (SA) and cocaine-seeking behavior. Instead, we found that G9a overexpression, and the resulting increase in histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), increases sensitivity to cocaine reinforcement and enhances motivation for cocaine in self-administering male rats. Moreover, when G9a overexpression is limited to the initial 15 d of cocaine SA training, it produces an enduring postexpression enhancement in cocaine SA and prolonged (over 5 weeks) increases in reinstatement of cocaine seeking induced by foot-shock stress, but in the absence of continued global elevations in H3K9me2. The increase in stress-induced reinstatement is paralleled by heightened anxiety measures, suggesting that countering the cocaine-induced decreases in endogenous G9a with ectopic G9a overexpression leads to lasting anxiogenic effects. Finally, we found an enduring reduction in phosphorylated cAMP-response element binding protein levels in the NAcSh that could account for the increased anxiety. These data demonstrate a novel role for G9a in promoting comorbid cocaine addiction and anxiety and suggest that increased epigenetic repression of transcription through H3K9 during cocaine use can have long-lasting and unexpected negative consequences on behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cocaine addiction is a neuropsychiatric disorder that is detrimental to society and currently has no effective treatments. The difficulty in treating drug addiction is compounded by the high comorbidity with other psychiatric illnesses, including anxiety disorders. Here, we demonstrate that G9a, an epigenetic repressor of gene expression, acting in the nucleus accumbens, a brain reward region, is capable of increasing both addiction- and anxiety-like behaviors in rats. These findings are intriguing because repeated cocaine exposure decreases G9a in this region and thereby enhances expression of certain addiction-promoting genes. However, our results suggest that countering this cocaine-induced decrease in G9a activity actually exacerbates addiction and sensitivity to relapse under stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Shp2 Regulates Oligodendrocyte Differentiation and Early Myelination and Contributes to Timely Remyelination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/787?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/4/787?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Shp2 is a nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase that has been shown to influence neurogenesis, oligodendrogenesis, and oligodendrocyte differentiation. Furthermore, Shp2 is a known regulator of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin and ERK signaling pathways in multiple cellular contexts, including oligodendrocytes. Its role during later postnatal CNS development or in response to demyelination injury has not been examined. Based on the current studies, we hypothesize that Shp2 is a negative regulator of CNS myelination. Using transgenic mouse technology, we show that Shp2 is involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation and early myelination, but is not necessary for myelin maintenance. We also show that Shp2 regulates the timely differentiation of oligodendrocytes following lysolecithin-induced demyelination, although apparently normal remyelination occurs at a delayed time point. These data suggest that Shp2 is a relevant therapeutic target in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In the present study, we show that the protein phosphatase Shp2 is an important mediator of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, both during developmental myelination as well as during myelin regeneration. We provide important insight into the signaling mechanisms regulating myelination and propose that Shp2 acts as a transient brake to the developmental myelination process. Furthermore, we show that Shp2 regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation following demyelination and therefore has important therapeutic implications in diseases such as multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Folding of the cerebral cortex is as highly intriguing as poorly understood. At first sight, this may appear as simple tissue crumpling inside an excessively small cranium, but the process is clearly much more complex and developmentally predetermined. Whereas theoretical modeling supports a critical role for biomechanics, experimental evidence demonstrates the fundamental role of specific progenitor cell types, cellular processes, and genetic programs on cortical folding.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Improved understanding of the factors that govern folding of the cerebral cortex is desirable for many reasons. The existence of consistent patterns in folding within and between species suggests a fundamental role in brain function. Abnormal folding patterns found in individuals affected by a diverse array of neurodevelopmental disorders underline the clinical relevance of understanding the folding process. Recent experimental and computational efforts to elucidate the biomechanical forces involved in cerebral cortical folding have converged on a consistent approach. Brain growth is modeled with two components: an expanding outer zone, destined to become the cerebral cortex, is mechanically coupled to an inner zone, destined to become white matter, that grows at a slower rate, perhaps in response to stress induced by expansion from the outer layer. This framework is consistent with experimentally observed internal forces in developing brains, and with observations of the folding process in physical models. In addition, computational simulations based on this foundation can produce folding patterns that recapitulate the characteristics of folding patterns found in gyroencephalic brains. This perspective establishes the importance of mechanical forces in our current understanding of how brains fold, and identifies realistic ranges for specific parameters in biophysical models of developing brain tissue. However, further refinement of this approach is needed. An understanding of mechanical forces that arise during brain development and their cellular-level origins is necessary to interpret the consequences of abnormal brain folding and its role in functional deficits as well as neurodevelopmental disease.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Presynaptic GABAA Receptors Modulate Thalamocortical Inputs in Layer 4 of Rat V1</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Fast inhibitory GABAergic transmission plays a fundamental role in neural circuits. Current theories of cortical function assume that fast GABAergic inhibition acts via GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors on postsynaptic neurons, while presynaptic effects of GABA depend on GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation. Manipulations of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activity in vivo produced different effects on cortical function, which were generally ascribed to the mode of action of a drug, more than its site of action. Here we show that in rodent primary visual cortex, α4-containing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors can be located on subsets of glutamatergic and GABAergic presynaptic terminals and decrease synaptic transmission. Our data provide a novel mechanistic insight into the effects of changes in cortical inhibition; the ability to modulate inputs onto cortical circuits locally, via presynaptic regulation of release by GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Cortical Responses to Input From Distant Areas are Modulated by Local Spontaneous Alpha/Beta Oscillations</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Any given area in human cortex may receive input from multiple, functionally heterogeneous areas, potentially representing different processing threads. Alpha (8–13 Hz) and beta oscillations (13–20 Hz) have been hypothesized by other investigators to gate local cortical processing, but their influence on cortical responses to input from other cortical areas is unknown. To study this, we measured the effect of local oscillatory power and phase on cortical responses elicited by single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) at distant cortical sites, in awake human subjects implanted with intracranial electrodes for epilepsy surgery. In 4 out of 5 subjects, the amplitudes of corticocortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) elicited by distant SPES were reproducibly modulated by the power, but not the phase, of local oscillations in alpha and beta frequencies. Specifically, CCEP amplitudes were higher when average oscillatory power just before distant SPES (−110 to −10 ms) was high. This effect was observed in only a subset (0–33%) of sites with CCEPs and, like the CCEPs themselves, varied with stimulation at different distant sites. Our results suggest that although alpha and beta oscillations may gate local processing, they may also enhance the responsiveness of cortex to input from distant cortical sites.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Rat somatosensory genital cortex contains a large sexually monomorphic representation of the penis in males and the clitoris in females. Genital cortex microstimulation-evoked movements of legs, trunk and genitals, which showed sex-specific differences related to mating behaviors and included thrusting in males and lordosis-like movements in females. Erections/tumescence of penis or clitoris could not be evoked, however. Anterograde tracer injections into penis/clitoris cortex revealed eleven corticocortical and 10 subcortical projection targets, which were qualitatively similar in both sexes. Corticocortical genital-cortex-projections innervated about 3% of the cortical surface and most were analog to other somatosensory projections targeting motor cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, parietal cortex and perirhinal cortex. Corticocortical projections that differed from other parts of somatosensory cortex targeted male scrotum cortex, female vulva cortex, the somatosensory–ear–auditory-cortex-region and the caudal parietal area. Aligning cytoarchitectonic borders with motor topography, sensory genital responses and corticocortical projections identified a candidate region for genital motor cortex. Most subcortical genital-cortex-projections were analog to other thalamic, tectal or pontine projections of somatosensory cortex. Genital-cortex-specific subcortical projections targeted amygdala and nucleus submedius and accumbens. Microstimulation-effects and projections support a sexual function of genital cortex and suggest that genital cortex is a major hub of sexual sensorimotor processing in rodents.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Intertemporal choice requires a dynamic interaction between valuation and deliberation processes. While evidence identifying candidate brain areas for each of these processes is well established, the precise mechanistic role carried out by each brain region is still debated. In this article, we present a computational model that clarifies the unique contribution of frontoparietal cortex regions to intertemporal decision making. The model we develop samples reward and delay information stochastically on a moment-by-moment basis. As preference for the choice alternatives evolves, dynamic inhibitory processes are executed by way of asymmetric lateral inhibition. We find that it is these lateral inhibition processes that best explain the contribution of frontoparietal regions to intertemporal decision making exhibited in our data.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: A Brief History of the Encoding of Hand Position by the Cerebral Cortex: Implications for Motor Control and Cognition</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhx354</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Encoding hand position by the cerebral cortex is essential not only for the neural representation of the body image but also for different actions based on eye–hand coordination. These include reaching for visual objects as well as complex movement sequences, such as tea-making, tool use, and object construction, among many others. All these functions depend on a continuous refreshing of the hand position representation, relying on both predictive signaling and afferent information. The hand position influence on neural activity in the parietofrontal system, together with eye position signals, are the basic elements of an eye–hand matrix from which all the above functions can emerge and could be regarded as key features of a network with several entry points, command nodes and outflow pathways, as confirmed by the discovery of a direct parietospinal projection for the control of hand action. The integrity of this system is crucial for daily life, as testified by the consequences of cortical lesions, spanning from severe paralysis to complex forms of apraxia. In this review, I will sketch my personal understanding of the scientific and conceptual trajectory of a line of investigation with many unexpected influences on cortical function and disease, from motor behavior to cognition.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Fear Extinction Recall Modulates Human Frontomedial Theta and Amygdala Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhx353</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx353/4823217?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) studies, as well as animal studies, indicate that the amygdala and frontomedial brain regions are critically involved in conditioned fear and that frontomedial oscillations in the theta range (4–8 Hz) may support communication between these brain regions. However, few studies have used a multimodal approach to probe interactions among these key regions in humans. Here, our goal was to bridge the gap between prior human fMRI, EEG, and animal findings. Using simultaneous EEG–fMRI recordings 24 h after fear conditioning and extinction, conditioned stimuli presented (CS+E, CS−E) and not presented during extinction (CS+N, CS−N) were compared to identify effects specific to extinction versus fear recall. Differential (CS+ vs. CS−) electrodermal, frontomedial theta (EEG) and amygdala responses (fMRI) were reduced for extinguished versus nonextinguished stimuli. Importantly, effects on theta power covaried with effects on amygdala activation. Fear and extinction recall as indicated by theta explained 60% of the variance for the analogous effect in the right amygdala. Our findings show for the first time the interplay of amygdala and frontomedial theta activity during fear and extinction recall in humans and provide insight into neural circuits consistently linked with top-down amygdala modulation in rodents.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling visual-based pitch, lift and speed control strategies in hoverflies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005894</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Roman Goulard, Jean-Louis Vercher, Stéphane Viollet&lt;/p&gt;

To avoid crashing onto the floor, a free falling fly needs to trigger its wingbeats quickly and control the orientation of its thrust accurately and swiftly to stabilize its pitch and hence its speed. Behavioural data have suggested that the vertical optic flow produced by the fall and crossing the visual field plays a key role in this anti-crash response. Free fall behavior analyses have also suggested that flying insect may not rely on graviception to stabilize their flight. Based on these two assumptions, we have developed a model which accounts for hoverflies´ position and pitch orientation recorded in 3D with a fast stereo camera during experimental free falls. Our dynamic model shows that optic flow-based control combined with closed-loop control of the pitch suffice to stabilize the flight properly. In addition, our model sheds a new light on the visual-based feedback control of fly´s pitch, lift and thrust. Since graviceptive cues are possibly not used by flying insects, the use of a vertical reference to control the pitch is discussed, based on the results obtained on a complete dynamic model of a virtual fly falling in a textured corridor. This model would provide a useful tool for understanding more clearly how insects may or not estimate their absolute attitude.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4F046xHmM_I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jean-François Patri, Pascal Perrier, Jean-Luc Schwartz, Julien Diard&lt;/p&gt;

Shifts in perceptual boundaries resulting from speech motor learning induced by perturbations of the auditory feedback were taken as evidence for the involvement of motor functions in auditory speech perception. Beyond this general statement, the precise mechanisms underlying this involvement are not yet fully understood. In this paper we propose a quantitative evaluation of some hypotheses concerning the motor and auditory updates that could result from motor learning, in the context of various assumptions about the roles of the auditory and somatosensory pathways in speech perception. This analysis was made possible thanks to the use of a Bayesian model that implements these hypotheses by expressing the relationships between speech production and speech perception in a joint probability distribution. The evaluation focuses on how the hypotheses can (1) predict the location of perceptual boundary shifts once the perturbation has been removed, (2) account for the magnitude of the compensation in presence of the perturbation, and (3) describe the correlation between these two behavioral characteristics. Experimental findings about changes in speech perception following adaptation to auditory feedback perturbations serve as reference. Simulations suggest that they are compatible with a framework in which motor adaptation updates both the auditory-motor internal model and the auditory characterization of the perturbed phoneme, and where perception involves both auditory and somatosensory pathways.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/847yCSUjhhw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neonatal Hypoxia–Ischemia Causes Functional Circuit Changes in Subplate Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhx358</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx358/4818253?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neonatal hypoxia–ischemia (HI) in the preterm human results in damage to subcortical developing white matter and cognitive impairments. Subplate neurons (SPNs) are among the first-born cortical neurons and are necessary for normal cerebral development. While moderate or severe HI at P1 in rats leads to SPN loss, it is unclear if HI, esp. forms not associated with overt cell loss lead to altered SPN circuits. Thus, we used two HI models with different severities in P1 rats. Cauterization of the common carotid artery (CCA) causes a largely transient and thus milder ischemia (HI-Caut) while CCA ligation causes more severe ischemia (HI-Lig). While HI-Lig caused subplate damage, HI-Caut did not cause overt histological damage on the light microscopic level. We used laser-scanning photostimulation (LSPS) in acute thalamocortical slices of auditory cortex during P5–10 to study the functional connectivity of SPNs. Both HI categories resulted in hyperconnectivity of excitatory and inhibitory circuits to SPNs. Thus, alterations on the circuit level are present in the absence of cell loss. Our results show that SPN circuits are uniquely susceptible to HI. Given the key developmental role of SPNs, our results suggest that altered SPN circuits might underlie the abnormal development of cortical function after HI.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neural Evidence for the Contribution of Active Suppression During Working Memory Filtering</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In order to efficiently process incoming visual information, selective attention acts as a filter that enhances relevant and suppresses irrelevant information. In this study, we used an event-related potential (ERP) approach with systematic lateralization to investigate enhancement and suppression during encoding of information into visual working memory (WM) separately. We used a change detection task in which observers had to memorize some items while ignoring other items. We found that the to-be-ignored items elicited a PD component in the ERP, suggesting that irrelevant information is actively suppressed from WM. The PD amplitude increased with distractor load and decreased with the ability to group distractors according to Gestalt principles. This suggests that the PD can be used as an indicator of how efficiently items can be suppressed from entering WM. Furthermore, while lateral memory-targets elicited a “traditional” CDA (starting ~300 ms), lateral memory-distractors elicited a sustained positivity contralateral to memory-distractors (CDAp, starting ~400 ms). In sum the results suggest that inhibition of irrelevant information is an important factor for efficient WM and is reflected in spontaneous (PD) and sustained suppression (CDAp).&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Encoding of Auditory Temporal Gestalt in the Human Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhx328</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx328/4818251?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The perception of an acoustic rhythm is invariant to the absolute temporal intervals constituting a sound sequence. It is unknown where in the brain temporal Gestalt, the percept emerging from the relative temporal proximity between acoustic events, is encoded. Two different relative temporal patterns, each induced by three experimental conditions with different absolute temporal patterns as sensory basis, were presented to participants. A linear support vector machine classifier was trained to differentiate activation patterns in functional magnetic resonance imaging data to the 2 different percepts. Across the sensory constituents the classifier decoded which percept was perceived. A searchlight analysis localized activation patterns specific to the temporal Gestalt bilaterally to the temporoparietal junction, including the planum temporale and supramarginal gyrus, and unilaterally to the right inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis). We show that auditory areas not only process absolute temporal intervals, but also integrate them into percepts of Gestalt and that encoding of these percepts persists in high-level associative areas. The findings complement existing knowledge regarding the processing of absolute temporal patterns to the processing of relative temporal patterns relevant to the sequential binding of perceptual elements into Gestalt.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Static length changes of cochlear outer hair cells can tune low-frequency hearing</title>

The cochlea not only transduces sound-induced vibration into neural spikes, it also amplifies weak sound to boost its detection. Actuators of this active process are sensory outer hair cells in the organ of Corti, whereas the inner hair cells transduce the resulting motion into electric signals that propagate via the auditory nerve to the brain. However, how the outer hair cells modulate the stimulus to the inner hair cells remains unclear. Here, we combine theoretical modeling and experimental measurements near the cochlear apex to study the way in which length changes of the outer hair cells deform the organ of Corti. We develop a geometry-based kinematic model of the apical organ of Corti that reproduces salient, yet counter-intuitive features of the organ’s motion. Our analysis further uncovers a mechanism by which a static length change of the outer hair cells can sensitively tune the signal transmitted to the sensory inner hair cells. When the outer hair cells are in an elongated state, stimulation of inner hair cells is largely inhibited, whereas outer hair cell contraction leads to a substantial enhancement of sound-evoked motion near the hair bundles. This novel mechanism for regulating the sensitivity of the hearing organ applies to the low frequencies that are most important for the perception of speech and music. We suggest that the proposed mechanism might underlie frequency discrimination at low auditory frequencies, as well as our ability to selectively attend auditory signals in noisy surroundings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XnGbn1GAfJQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Targeting key regulators of the cancer stem cell phenotype to overcome their critical influence on tumor growth is a promising new strategy for cancer treatment. Here we present a modeling framework that operates at both the cellular and molecular levels, for investigating IL-6 mediated, cancer stem cell driven tumor growth and targeted treatment with anti-IL6 antibodies. Our immediate goal is to quantify the influence of IL-6 on cancer stem cell self-renewal and survival, and to characterize the subsequent impact on tumor growth dynamics. By including the molecular details of IL-6 binding, we are able to quantify the temporal changes in fractional occupancies of bound receptors and their influence on tumor volume. There is a strong correlation between the model output and experimental data for primary tumor xenografts. We also used the model to predict tumor response to administration of the humanized IL-6R monoclonal antibody, tocilizumab (TCZ), and we found that as little as 1mg/kg of TCZ administered weekly for 7 weeks is sufficient to result in tumor reduction and a sustained deceleration of tumor growth.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9hxzc5PneJY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mechanical feedback coordinates cell wall expansion and assembly in yeast mating morphogenesis</title>

The shaping of individual cells requires a tight coordination of cell mechanics and growth. However, it is unclear how information about the mechanical state of the wall is relayed to the molecular processes building it, thereby enabling the coordination of cell wall expansion and assembly during morphogenesis. Combining theoretical and experimental approaches, we show that a mechanical feedback coordinating cell wall assembly and expansion is essential to sustain mating projection growth in budding yeast (&lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;). Our theoretical results indicate that the mechanical feedback provided by the Cell Wall Integrity pathway, with cell wall stress sensors Wsc1 and Mid2 increasingly activating membrane-localized cell wall synthases Fks1/2 upon faster cell wall expansion, stabilizes mating projection growth without affecting cell shape. Experimental perturbation of the osmotic pressure and cell wall mechanics, as well as compromising the mechanical feedback through genetic deletion of the stress sensors, leads to cellular phenotypes that support the theoretical predictions. Our results indicate that while the existence of mechanical feedback is essential to stabilize mating projection growth, the shape and size of the cell are insensitive to the feedback.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HJHfrBF1fQE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The ISCB Student Council Internship Program: Expanding computational biology capacity worldwide</title>

Education and training are two essential ingredients for a successful career. On one hand, universities provide students a curriculum for specializing in one’s field of study, and on the other, internships complement coursework and provide invaluable training experience for a fruitful career. Consequently, undergraduates and graduates are encouraged to undertake an internship during the course of their degree. The opportunity to explore one’s research interests in the early stages of their education is important for students because it improves their skill set and gives their career a boost. In the long term, this helps to close the gap between skills and employability among students across the globe and balance the research capacity in the field of computational biology. However, training opportunities are often scarce for computational biology students, particularly for those who reside in less-privileged regions. Aimed at helping students develop research and academic skills in computational biology and alleviating the divide across countries, the Student Council of the International Society for Computational Biology introduced its Internship Program in 2009. The Internship Program is committed to providing access to computational biology training, especially for students from developing regions, and improving competencies in the field. Here, we present how the Internship Program works and the impact of the internship opportunities so far, along with the challenges associated with this program.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6wQOmQXfI-k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A theory of how active behavior stabilises neural activity: Neural gain modulation by closed-loop environmental feedback</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005926</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Rfk3vZoQIs4/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher L. Buckley, Taro Toyoizumi&lt;/p&gt;

During active behaviours like running, swimming, whisking or sniffing, motor actions shape sensory input and sensory percepts guide future motor commands. Ongoing cycles of sensory and motor processing constitute a closed-loop feedback system which is central to motor control and, it has been argued, for perceptual processes. This closed-loop feedback is mediated by brainwide neural circuits but how the presence of feedback signals impacts on the dynamics and function of neurons is not well understood. Here we present a simple theory suggesting that closed-loop feedback between the brain/body/environment can modulate neural gain and, consequently, change endogenous neural fluctuations and responses to sensory input. We support this theory with modeling and data analysis in two vertebrate systems. First, in a model of rodent whisking we show that negative feedback mediated by whisking vibrissa can suppress coherent neural fluctuations and neural responses to sensory input in the barrel cortex. We argue this suppression provides an appealing account of a &lt;i&gt;brain state transition&lt;/i&gt; (a marked change in global brain activity) coincident with the onset of whisking in rodents. Moreover, this mechanism suggests a novel signal detection mechanism that selectively accentuates &lt;i&gt;active&lt;/i&gt;, rather than &lt;i&gt;passive&lt;/i&gt;, whisker touch signals. This mechanism is consistent with a predictive coding strategy that is sensitive to the consequences of motor actions rather than the difference between the predicted and actual sensory input. We further support the theory by re-analysing previously published two-photon data recorded in zebrafish larvae performing closed-loop optomotor behaviour in a virtual swim simulator. We show, as predicted by this theory, that the degree to which each cell contributes in linking sensory and motor signals well explains how much its neural fluctuations are suppressed by closed-loop optomotor behaviour. More generally we argue that our results demonstrate the dependence of neural fluctuations, across the brain, on closed-loop brain/body/environment interactions strongly supporting the idea that brain function cannot be fully understood through open-loop approaches alone.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Rfk3vZoQIs4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Roles of Left Versus Right Anterior Temporal Lobes in Semantic Memory: A Neuropsychological Comparison of Postsurgical Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhx362</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx362/4812493?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The presence and degree of specialization between the anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) is a key issue in debates about the neural architecture of semantic memory. Here, we comprehensively assessed multiple aspects of semantic cognition in a large group of postsurgical temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with left versus right anterior temporal lobectomy (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 40). Both subgroups showed deficits in expressive and receptive verbal semantic tasks, word and object recognition, naming and recognition of famous faces and perception of faces and emotions. Graded differences in performance between the left and right groups were secondary to the overall mild semantic impairment; primarily, left resected TLE patients showed weaker performance on tasks that required naming or accessing semantic information from a written word. Right resected TLE patients were relatively more impaired at recognizing famous faces as familiar, although this effect was observed less consistently. These findings unify previous partial, inconsistent results and also align directly with fMRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation results in neurologically intact participants. Taken together, these data support a model in which the 2 ATLs act as a coupled bilateral system for the representation of semantic knowledge, and in which graded hemispheric specializations emerge as a consequence of differential connectivity to lateralized speech production and face perception regions.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Lack of Methyl-CpG Binding Protein 2 (MeCP2) Affects Cell Fate Refinement During Embryonic Cortical Development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhx360</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx360/4812492?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;During differentiation, neurons progressively restrict their fate repressing the expression of specific genes. Here we describe the involvement in such developmental steps of the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), an epigenetic factor that participates to chromatin folding and transcriptional regulation. We previously reported that, due to transcriptional impairments, the maturation of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; null neurons is delayed. To evaluate whether this could stem from altered progenitors proliferation and differentiation, we investigated whether lack of Mecp2 affects these features both in vitro and in vivo. We show that in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; null embryonic cortexes the expression of genes defining the identity of proliferating neuroprogenitors is enriched and that their permanence in the G1 phase is prolonged. Moreover, the number of cells transitioning from a stage of maturation to a more mature one is increased in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; null embryonic cortices, in line with the central role of G1 for cell identity refinement. We thus suggest that, possibly due to the lack of proper transcriptional control normally exerted by Mecp2, fate refinement is impaired in developing null cells. We propose that the maturation delay affecting the developing &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; null cortex originates, at least in part, from deranged mechanisms of cell fate refinement.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Core Differences in Synaptic Signaling Between Primary Visual and Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhx357</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx357/4812491?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are more resilient than those in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in aging, schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease. The current study compared glutamate and neuromodulatory actions in macaque V1 to those in dlPFC, and found striking regional differences. V1 neuronal firing to visual stimuli depended on AMPA receptors, with subtle NMDA receptor contributions, while dlPFC depends primarily on NMDA receptors. Neuromodulatory actions also differed between regions. In V1, cAMP signaling increased neuronal firing, and the phosphodiesterase PDE4A was positioned to regulate cAMP effects on glutamate release from axons. HCN channels in V1 were classically located on distal dendrites, and enhanced cell firing. These data contrast with dlPFC, where PDE4A and HCN channels are concentrated in thin spines, and cAMP-HCN signaling gates inputs and weakens firing. These regional differences may explain why V1 neurons are more resilient than dlPFC neurons to the challenges of age and disease.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Giulio Di Minin, Andreas Postlmayr, Anton Wutz&lt;/p&gt;

Haploid cells are increasingly used for screening of complex pathways in animal genomes. Hemizygous mutations introduced through viral insertional mutagenesis can be directly selected for phenotypic changes. Here we present HaSAPPy a tool for analysing sequencing datasets of screens using insertional mutations in large pools of haploid cells. Candidate gene prediction is implemented through identification of enrichment of insertional mutations after selection by simultaneously evaluating several parameters. We have developed HaSAPPy for analysis of genetic screens for silencing factors of X chromosome inactivation in haploid mouse embryonic stem cells. To benchmark the performance, we further analyse several datasets of genetic screens in human haploid cells for which candidates have been validated. Our results support the effective candidate prediction strategy of HaSAPPy. HaSAPPy is implemented in Python, licensed under the MIT license, and is available from https://github.com/gdiminin/HaSAPPy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3K4LRTS9Xj4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The E&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;A mutation disrupts dynamic binding poses of SB269652 at the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005948</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/vUXB3FyjueQ/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Ravi Kumar Verma, Ara M. Abramyan, Mayako Michino, R. Benjamin Free, David R. Sibley, Jonathan A. Javitch, J. Robert Lane, Lei Shi&lt;/p&gt;

The dopamine D2 and D3 receptors (D2R and D3R) are important targets for antipsychotics and for the treatment of drug abuse. SB269652, a bitopic ligand that simultaneously binds both the orthosteric binding site (OBS) and a secondary binding pocket (SBP) in both D2R and D3R, was found to be a negative allosteric modulator. Previous studies identified Glu&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt; in the SBP to be a key determinant of both the affinity of SB269652 and the magnitude of its cooperativity with orthosteric ligands, as the E&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;A mutation decreased both of these parameters. However, the proposed hydrogen bond (H-bond) between Glu&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt; and the indole moiety of SB269652 is not a strong interaction, and a structure activity relationship study of SB269652 indicates that this H-bond may not be the only element that determines its allosteric properties. To understand the structural basis of the observed phenotype of E&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;A, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations with a cumulative length of ~77 μs of D2R and D3R wild-type and their E&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;A mutants bound to SB269652. In combination with Markov state model analysis and by characterizing the equilibria of ligand binding modes in different conditions, we found that in both D2R and D3R, whereas the tetrahydroisoquinoline moiety of SB269652 is stably bound in the OBS, the indole-2-carboxamide moiety is dynamic and only intermittently forms H-bonds with Glu&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;. Our results also indicate that the E&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;A mutation significantly affects the overall shape and size of the SBP, as well as the conformation of the N terminus. Thus, our findings suggest that the key role of Glu&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt; in mediating the allosteric properties of SB269652 extends beyond a direct interaction with SB269652, and provide structural insights for rational design of SB269652 derivatives that may retain its allosteric properties.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vUXB3FyjueQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Gli2 Rescues Delays in Brain Development Induced by Kif3a Dysfunction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhx356</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx356/4802222?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The primary cilium in neural stem cells plays distinct roles in different stages during cortical development. Ciliary dysfunctions in human (i.e., ciliopathy) cause developmental defects in multiple organs, including brain developmental delays, which lead to intellectual disabilities and cognitive deficits. However, effective treatment to this devastating developmental disorder is still lacking. Here, we first investigated the effects of ciliopathy on neural stem cells by knocking down Kif3a, a kinesin II motor required for ciliogenesis, in the neurogenic stage of cortical development by in utero electroporation of mouse embryos. Brains electroporated with Kif3a shRNA showed defects in neuronal migration and differentiation, delays in neural stem cell cycle progression, and failures in interkinetic nuclear migration. Interestingly, introduction of Gli1 and Gli2 both can restore the cell cycle progression by elevating cyclin D1 in neural stem cells. Remarkably, enforced Gli2 expression, but not Gli1, partially restored the ability of Kif3a-knockdown neurons to differentiate and move from the germinal ventricular zone to the cortical plate. Moreover, Cyclin D1 knockdown abolished Gli2’s rescue effect. These findings suggest Gli2 may rescue neural stem cell proliferation, differentiation and migration through Cyclin D1 pathway and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for human ciliopathy syndromes through modulating the progression of neural stem cell cycle.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Rhythmic Spontaneous Activity Mediates the Age-Related Decline in Somatosensory Function</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Sensory gating is a neurophysiological process whereby the response to a second stimulus in a pair of identical stimuli is attenuated, and it is thought to reflect the capacity of the CNS to preserve neural resources for behaviorally relevant stimuli. Such gating is observed across multiple sensory modalities and is modulated by age, but the mechanisms involved are not understood. In this study, we examined somatosensory gating in 68 healthy adults using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and advanced oscillatory and time-domain analysis methods. MEG data underwent source reconstruction and peak voxel time series data were extracted to evaluate the dynamics of somatosensory gating, and the impact of spontaneous neural activity immediately preceding the stimulation. We found that gating declined with increasing age and that older adults had significantly reduced gating relative to younger adults, suggesting impaired local inhibitory function. Most importantly, older adults had significantly elevated spontaneous activity preceding the stimulation, and this effect fully mediated the impact of aging on sensory gating. In conclusion, gating in the somatosensory system declines with advancing age and this effect is directly tied to increased spontaneous neural activity in the primary somatosensory cortices, which is likely secondary to age-related declines in local GABA inhibitory function.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Roles of Subdivisions of Human Insula in Emotion Perception and Auditory Processing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhx334</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx334/4802217?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Previous studies have shown insular activations involving sensory, motor, and affective processing. However, the functional roles of subdivisions within the human insula are still not well understood. In the present study, we used intracranial electroencephalography and electrical cortical stimulation to investigate the causal roles of subdivisions of the insula in auditory emotion perception in epilepsy patients implanted with depth electrodes in this brain region. The posterior and the anterior subdivisions of the human insula, identified based on structural and functional analyses, showed distinct response properties to auditory emotional stimuli. The posterior insula showed auditory responses that resemble those observed in Heschl’s gyrus, whereas the anterior insula (AI) responded to the emotional contents of the auditory stimuli in a similar way as observed in the amygdala. Furthermore, the degree of the differentiation between various emotion types increased from the posterior to the AI. Our findings suggest different roles played by the two regions of the human insula and a transformation from sensory to affective representations in auditory modality along the posterior-to-anterior axis in the human insula.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leptin and the maintenance of elevated body weight&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leptin and the maintenance of elevated body weight, Published online: 11 January 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2017.168&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrn.2017.168&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Although leptin administration decreases food intake and body weight in lean mice, it has no effect in obese mice. In this Review, Pan and Myers discuss how leptin action becomes dysfunctional in obesity and suggest that elevated leptin levels promote processes that limit leptin action.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrn/rss/current/~4/AjBkriQNtY8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Intermittent metabolic switching, neuroplasticity and brain health&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermittent metabolic switching, neuroplasticity and brain health, Published online: 11 January 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2017.156&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrn.2017.156&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Eating patterns in modern societies often preclude the metabolic switch from utilization of glucose to ketones as a cellular energy source. In this Review, Mattson and colleagues discuss how intermittent metabolic switching impacts brain function and vulnerability to injury and disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrn/rss/current/~4/8H9Q5L93JbM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dual function of thalamic low-vigilance state oscillations: rhythm-regulation and plasticity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dual function of thalamic low-vigilance state oscillations: rhythm-regulation and plasticity, Published online: 11 January 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2017.151&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrn.2017.151&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;During low-vigilance states, thalamic neurons exhibit diverse rhythmic activities that contribute to specific parts of the electroencephalogram rhythm. In this perspective, Crunelli and colleagues propose that thalamic oscillations of these low-vigilance states also have a plasticity function that modifies the strength of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in local neuronal assemblies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrn/rss/current/~4/OOC4hJI4h9Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Morphological and Functional Characterization of Non-fast-Spiking GABAergic Interneurons in Layer 4 Microcircuitry of Rat Barrel Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhx352</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx352/4796916?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;GABAergic interneurons are notorious for their heterogeneity, despite constituting a small fraction of the neuronal population in the neocortex. Classification of interneurons is crucial for understanding their widespread cortical functions as they provide a complex and dynamic network, balancing excitation and inhibition. Here, we investigated different types of non-fast-spiking (nFS) interneurons in Layer 4 (L4) of rat barrel cortex using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings with biocytin-filling. Based on a quantitative analysis on a combination of morphological and electrophysiological parameters, we identified 5 distinct types of L4 nFS interneurons: 1) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;trans-columnar projecting interneurons,&lt;/span&gt;2) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;locally projecting non-Martinotti-like interneurons,&lt;/span&gt; 3) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;supra-granular projecting Martinotti-like interneurons,&lt;/span&gt;4) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;intra-columnar projecting VIP-like interneurons&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;5) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;locally projecting neurogliaform-like interneurons.&lt;/span&gt; Trans-columnar projecting interneurons are one of the most striking interneuron types, which have not been described so far in Layer 4. They feature extensive axonal collateralization not only in their home barrel but also in adjacent barrels. Furthermore, we identified that most of the L4 nFS interneurons express somatostatin, while few are positive for the transcription factor Prox1. The morphological and electrophysiological characterization of different L4 nFS interneuron types presented here provides insights into their synaptic connectivity and functional role in cortical information processing.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Mechanisms of Memory Disruption in Depression</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30250-3?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30250-3?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Depressed individuals typically show poor memory for positive events, potentiated memory for negative events, and impaired recollection. These phenomena are clinically important but poorly understood. Compelling links between stress and depression suggest promising candidate mechanisms. Stress can suppress hippocampal neurogenesis, inhibit dopamine neurons, and sensitize the amygdala. We argue that these phenomena may impair pattern separation, disrupt the encoding of positive experiences, and bias retrieval toward negative events, respectively, thus recapitulating core aspects of memory disruption in depression.</description>

This suggests a role for entorhinal grid coding in cognition beyond spatial navigation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/EXuMzRCdLmc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>
