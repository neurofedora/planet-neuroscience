	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Geospatial characteristics of measles transmission in China during 2005−2014</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Wan Yang, Liang Wen, Shen-Long Li, Kai Chen, Wen-Yi Zhang, Jeffrey Shaman&lt;/p&gt;

Measles is a highly contagious and severe disease. Despite mass vaccination, it remains a leading cause of death in children in developing regions, killing 114,900 globally in 2014. In 2006, China committed to eliminating measles by 2012; to this end, the country enhanced its mandatory vaccination programs and achieved vaccination rates reported above 95% by 2008. However, in spite of these efforts, during the last 3 years (2013–2015) China documented 27,695, 52,656, and 42,874 confirmed measles cases. How measles manages to spread in China—the world’s largest population—in the mass vaccination era remains poorly understood. To address this conundrum and provide insights for future public health efforts, we analyze the geospatial pattern of measles transmission across China during 2005–2014. We map measles incidence and incidence rates for each of the 344 cities in mainland China, identify the key socioeconomic and demographic features associated with high disease burden, and identify transmission clusters based on the synchrony of outbreak cycles. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, we identify 21 epidemic clusters, of which 12 were cross-regional. The cross-regional clusters included more underdeveloped cities with large numbers of emigrants than would be expected by chance (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011; bootstrap sampling), indicating that cities in these clusters were likely linked by internal worker migration in response to uneven economic development. In contrast, cities in regional clusters were more likely to have high rates of minorities and high natural growth rates than would be expected by chance (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.074; bootstrap sampling). Our findings suggest that multiple highly connected foci of measles transmission coexist in China and that migrant workers likely facilitate the transmission of measles across regions. This complex connection renders eradication of measles challenging in China despite its high overall vaccination coverage. Future immunization programs should therefore target these transmission foci simultaneously.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/B8oBZkOXAgI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Heteromeric interactions between the catalytically impaired human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER3/ERBB3) and its catalytically active homologs EGFR and HER2 are essential for their signaling. Different ligands can activate these receptor pairs but lead to divergent signaling outcomes through mechanisms that remain largely unknown.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A correlation game for unsupervised learning yields computational interpretations of Hebbian excitation, anti-Hebbian inhibition, and synapse elimination. (arXiv:1704.00646v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00646</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00646</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Much has been learned about plasticity of biological synapses from empirical
studies. Hebbian plasticity is driven by correlated activity of presynaptic and
postsynaptic neurons. Synapses that converge onto the same neuron often behave
as if they compete for a fixed resource; some survive the competition while
others are eliminated. To provide computational interpretations of these
aspects of synaptic plasticity, we formulate unsupervised learning as a
zero-sum game between Hebbian excitation and anti-Hebbian inhibition in a
neural network model. The game formalizes the intuition that Hebbian excitation
tries to maximize correlations of neurons with their inputs, while anti-Hebbian
inhibition tries to decorrelate neurons from each other. We further include a
model of synaptic competition, which enables a neuron to eliminate all
connections except those from its most strongly correlated inputs. Through
empirical studies, we show that this facilitates the learning of sensory
features that resemble parts of objects.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The diffusion weighted images acquired with the multiband sequence or the
Lifespan protocols shows a type of slice distortion artifact. We find that this
artifact is caused by the eddy currents, which can be induced by the diffusion
gradient associated with either current DW image or the previous DW images. The
artifact can be corrected by further tuning the compensation circuit in the MR
hardware, or by a correction algorithm which includes the diffusion gradients
from the current and previous DW images.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Transfer entropy in continuous time, with applications to jump and neural spiking processes. (arXiv:1610.08192v2 [cs.IT] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08192</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08192</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transfer entropy has been used to quantify the directed flow of information
between source and target variables in many complex systems. While transfer
entropy was originally formulated in discrete time, in this paper we provide a
framework for considering transfer entropy in continuous time systems, based on
Radon-Nikodym derivatives between measures of complete path realizations. To
describe the information dynamics of individual path realizations, we introduce
the pathwise transfer entropy, the expectation of which is the transfer entropy
accumulated over a finite time interval. We demonstrate that this formalism
permits an instantaneous transfer entropy rate. These properties are analogous
to the behavior of physical quantities defined along paths such as work and
heat. We use this approach to produce an explicit form for the transfer entropy
for pure jump processes, and highlight the simplified form in the specific case
of point processes (frequently used in neuroscience to model neural spike
trains). Finally, we present two synthetic spiking neuron model examples to
exhibit the pertinent features of our formalism, namely, that the information
flow for point processes consists of discontinuous jump contributions (at
spikes in the target) interrupting a continuously varying contribution
(relating to waiting times between target spikes). Numerical schemes based on
our formalism promise significant benefits over existing strategies based on
discrete time formalisms.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autonomous neural systems must efficiently process information in a wide
range of novel environments, which may have very different statistical
properties. We consider the problem of how to optimally distribute receptors
along a one-dimensional continuum consistent with the following design
principles. First, neural representations of the world should obey a neural
uncertainty principle---making as few assumptions as possible about the
statistical structure of the world. Second, neural representations should
convey, as much as possible, equivalent information about environments with
different statistics. The results of these arguments resemble the structure of
the visual system and provide a natural explanation of the behavioral
Weber-Fechner law, a foundational result in psychology. Because the derivation
is extremely general, this suggests that similar scaling relationships should
be observed not only in sensory continua, but also in neural representations of
``cognitive' one-dimensional quantities such as time or numerosity.

	<description>The thrombin-induced polymerisation of fibrinogen to form fibrin is well established as a late stage of blood clotting. In recent work, we showed that the presence of tiny amounts of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) could cause these clots to adopt an amyloid form, that could be observed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or via the fluorescence of thioflavin-T. This could be prevented by the prior addition of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP). We had also observed by SEM this unusual clotting in the blood of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We here show that this too can be prevented by LBP, thereby implicating such inflammatory microbial cell wall products in the aetiology of the disease. This may lead to novel treatment strategies in PD designed to target microbes and their products.</description>

	<description>Cognitive control is a construct that refers to the set of functions that enable decision-making and task performance through the representation of task states, goals, and rules. The neural correlates of cognitive control have been studied in humans using a wide variety of neuroimaging modalities, including structural MRI, resting-state fMRI, and task-based fMRI. The results from each of these modalities independently have implicated the involvement of a number of brain regions in cognitive control, including dorsal prefrontal cortex, and frontal parietal and cingulo-opercular brain networks. However, it is not clear how the results from a single modality relate to results in other modalities. Recent developments in multimodal image analysis methods provide an avenue for answering such questions and could yield more integrated models of the neural correlates of cognitive control. In this study, we used multiset canonical correlation analysis with joint independent component analysis (mCCA+jICA) to identify multimodal patterns of variation related to cognitive control. We used two independent cohorts of participants from the Human Connectome Project, each of which had data from four imaging modalities. We replicated the findings from the first cohort in the second cohort using both independent and predictive analyses. The independent analyses identified a component in each cohort that was highly similar to the other and significantly correlated with cognitive control performance. The replication by prediction analyses identified two independent components that were significantly correlated with cognitive control performance in the first cohort and significantly predictive of performance in the second cohort. These components identified positive relationships across the modalities in neural regions related to both dynamic and stable aspects of task control, including regions in both the frontal-parietal and cingulo-opercular networks, as well as regions hypothesized to be modulated by cognitive control signaling, such as visual cortex. Taken together, these results illustrate the potential utility of multi-modal analyses in identifying the neural correlates of cognitive control across different indicators of brain structure and function.</description>

	<description>Recent advances in brain imaging techniques, measurement approaches, and storage capacities have provided an unprecedented supply of high temporal resolution neural data. These data present a remarkable opportunity to gain a mechanistic understanding not just of circuit structure, but also of circuit dynamics, and its role in cognition and disease. Such understanding necessitates a description of the raw observations, and a delineation of computational models and mathematical theories that accurately capture fundamental principles behind the observations. Here, we review recent advances in a range of modeling approaches that embrace the temporally-evolving, interconnected structure of the brain and summarize that structure in a dynamic graph. We describe recent efforts to model dynamic patterns of connectivity, dynamic patterns of activity, and patterns of activity atop connectivity. In the context of these models, we review important considerations in statistical testing, including parametric and non-parametric approaches. Finally, we offer thoughts on careful and accurate interpretation of dynamic graph architecture, and outline important future directions for method development.</description>

	<description>Sex differences in human brain structure and function are of substantial scientific interest because of sex-differential susceptibility to psychiatric disorders and because of the potential to explain sex differences in psychological traits. Males are known to have larger brain volumes, though the patterns of differences across brain subregions have typically only been examined in small, inconsistent studies. In addition, despite common findings of greater male variability in traits like intelligence, personality, and physical performance, variance differences in the brain have received little attention. Here we report the largest single-sample study of structural and functional sex differences in the human brain to date (2,750 female and 2,466 male participants aged 44-77 years). Males had higher cortical and sub-cortical volumes, cortical surface areas, and white matter diffusion directionality; females had thicker cortices and higher white matter tract complexity. Considerable overlap between the distributions for males and females was common, and subregional differences were smaller after accounting for global differences. There was generally greater male variance across structural measures. The modestly higher male score on two cognitive tests was partly mediated via structural differences. Functional connectome organization showed stronger connectivity for males in unimodal sensorimotor cortices, and stronger connectivity for females in the default mode network. This large-scale characterisation of neurobiological sex differences provides a foundation for attempts to understand the causes of sex differences in brain structure and function, and their associated psychological and psychiatric consequences.</description>

	<description>Most preparations for making neural recordings degrade over time and eventually fail due to insertion trauma and reactive tissue response. The magnitudes of these responses are thought to be related to the electrode size (specifically, the cross-sectional area) and the relative stiffness of the electrode material. Carbon fiber ultra-microelectrodes have a much smaller cross-section than traditional electrodes and thus may enable improved longevity of neural recordings in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Only two carbon fiber array designs have been described previously, each with limited channel densities due to limitations of the fabrication processes or interconnect strategies. Here, we describe a method for assembling carbon fiber electrodes on a flexible polyimide substrate that will facilitate the construction of high-density recording and stimulating arrays for acute use in peripheral nerves. Fibers were aligned using an alignment tool that was 3D-printed with sub-micron resolution using direct laser writing. Indium deposition on the carbon fibers provided a robust and reliable method of electrical connection to the polyimide traces. Spontaneous action potentials and stimulation-evoked compound responses with SNR &amp;gt; 10 and &amp;gt; 120, respectively, were recorded from a small (125 m) peripheral nerve. We also improved the typically poor charge injection capacity of small diameter carbon fibers can be improved by electrodepositing 100 nm thick iridium oxide films, making the carbon fiber arrays suitable for electrical stimulation as well as recording.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Quantifying the roles of host movement and vector dispersal in the transmission of vector-borne diseases of livestock</title>

The role of host movement in the spread of vector-borne diseases of livestock has been little studied. Here we develop a mathematical framework that allows us to disentangle and quantify the roles of vector dispersal and livestock movement in transmission between farms. We apply this framework to outbreaks of bluetongue virus (BTV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in Great Britain, both of which are spread by &lt;i&gt;Culicoides&lt;/i&gt; biting midges and have recently emerged in northern Europe. For BTV we estimate parameters by fitting the model to outbreak data using approximate Bayesian computation, while for SBV we use previously derived estimates. We find that around 90% of transmission of BTV between farms is a result of vector dispersal, while for SBV this proportion is 98%. This difference is a consequence of higher vector competence and shorter duration of viraemia for SBV compared with BTV. For both viruses we estimate that the mean number of secondary infections per infected farm is greater than one for vector dispersal, but below one for livestock movements. Although livestock movements account for a small proportion of transmission and cannot sustain an outbreak on their own, they play an important role in establishing new foci of infection. However, the impact of restricting livestock movements on the spread of both viruses depends critically on assumptions made about the distances over which vector dispersal occurs. If vector dispersal occurs primarily at a local scale (99% of transmission occurs &amp;lt;25 km), movement restrictions are predicted to be effective at reducing spread, but if dispersal occurs frequently over longer distances (99% of transmission occurs &amp;lt;50 km) they are not.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4WGE8yqxvg0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Chromatin organization can be probed by Chromosomal Capture (5C) data, from which the encounter probability (EP) between genomic sites is presented in a large matrix. This matrix is averaged over a large cell population, revealing diagonal blocks called Topological Associating Domains (TADs) that represent a sub-chromatin organization. To study the relation between chromatin organization and gene regulation, we introduce a computational procedure to construct a bead-spring polymer model based on the EP matrix. The model permits exploring transient properties constrained by the statistics of the 5C data. To construct the polymer model, we proceed in two steps: first, we introduce a minimal number of random connectors inside restricted regions to account for diagonal blocks. Second, we account for long-range frequent specific genomic interactions. Using the constructed polymer, we compute the first encounter time distribution and the conditional probability of three key genomic sites. By simulating single particle trajectories of loci located on the constructed polymers from 5C data, we found a large variability of the anomalous exponent, used to interpret live cell imaging trajectories. The present polymer construction provides a generic tool to study steady-state and transient properties of chromatin constrained by some physical properties embedded in 5C data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v-IqqU6Nek4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Role of non-native electrostatic interactions in the coupled folding and binding of PUMA with Mcl-1</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Wen-Ting Chu, Jane Clarke, Sarah L. Shammas, Jin Wang&lt;/p&gt;

PUMA, which belongs to the BH3-only protein family, is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP). It binds to its cellular partner Mcl-1 through its BH3 motif, which folds upon binding into an &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; helix. We have applied a structure-based coarse-grained model, with an explicit &lt;i&gt;Debye&lt;/i&gt;—&lt;i&gt;Hückel&lt;/i&gt; charge model, to probe the importance of electrostatic interactions both in the early and the later stages of this model coupled folding and binding process. This model was carefully calibrated with the experimental data on helical content and affinity, and shown to be consistent with previously published experimental data on binding rate changes with respect to ion strength. We find that intramolecular electrostatic interactions influence the unbound states of PUMA only marginally. Our results further suggest that intermolecular electrostatic interactions, and in particular non-native electrostatic interactions, are involved in formation of the initial encounter complex. We are able to reveal the binding mechanism in more detail than is possible using experimental data alone however, and in particular we uncover the role of non-native electrostatic interactions. We highlight the potential importance of such electrostatic interactions for describing the binding reactions of IDPs. Such approaches could be used to provide predictions for the results of mutational studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mrIhXG100PA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Sequence dependency of canonical base pair opening in the DNA double helix</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Viveca Lindahl, Alessandra Villa, Berk Hess&lt;/p&gt;

The flipping-out of a DNA base from the double helical structure is a key step of many cellular processes, such as DNA replication, modification and repair. Base pair opening is the first step of base flipping and the exact mechanism is still not well understood. We investigate sequence effects on base pair opening using extensive classical molecular dynamics simulations targeting the opening of 11 different canonical base pairs in two DNA sequences. Two popular biomolecular force fields are applied. To enhance sampling and calculate free energies, we bias the simulation along a simple distance coordinate using a newly developed adaptive sampling algorithm. The simulation is guided back and forth along the coordinate, allowing for multiple opening pathways. We compare the calculated free energies with those from an NMR study and check assumptions of the model used for interpreting the NMR data. Our results further show that the neighboring sequence is an important factor for the opening free energy, but also indicates that other sequence effects may play a role. All base pairs are observed to have a propensity for opening toward the major groove. The preferred opening base is cytosine for GC base pairs, while for AT there is sequence dependent competition between the two bases. For AT opening, we identify two non-canonical base pair interactions contributing to a local minimum in the free energy profile. For both AT and CG we observe long-lived interactions with water and with sodium ions at specific sites on the open base pair.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nWKsoR_wUx0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The promiscuous enzyme medium-chain 3-keto-acyl-CoA thiolase triggers a vicious cycle in fatty-acid beta-oxidation</title>

Mitochondrial fatty-acid beta-oxidation (mFAO) plays a central role in mammalian energy metabolism. Multiple severe diseases are associated with defects in this pathway. Its kinetic structure is characterized by a complex wiring of which the functional implications have hardly been explored. Repetitive cycles of reversible reactions, each cycle shortening the fatty acid by two carbon atoms, evoke competition between intermediates of different chain lengths for a common set of ‘promiscuous’ enzymes (enzymes with activity towards multiple substrates). In our validated kinetic model of the pathway, substrate overload causes a steep and detrimental flux decline. Here, we unravel the underlying mechanism and the role of enzyme promiscuity in it. Comparison of alternative model versions elucidated the role of promiscuity of individual enzymes. Promiscuity of the last enzyme of the pathway, medium-chain ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (MCKAT), was both necessary and sufficient to elicit the flux decline. Subsequently, Metabolic Control Analysis revealed that MCKAT had insufficient capacity to cope with high substrate influx. Next, we quantified the internal metabolic regulation, revealing a vicious cycle around MCKAT. Upon substrate overload, MCKAT’s ketoacyl-CoA substrates started to accumulate. The unfavourable equilibrium constant of the preceding enzyme, medium/short-chain hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, worked as an amplifier, leading to accumulation of upstream CoA esters, including acyl-CoA esters. These acyl-CoA esters are at the same time products of MCKAT and inhibited its already low activity further. Finally, the accumulation of CoA esters led to a sequestration of free CoA. CoA being a cofactor for MCKAT, its sequestration limited the MCKAT activity even further, thus completing the vicious cycle. Since CoA is also a substrate for distant enzymes, it efficiently communicated the ‘traffic jam’ at MCKAT to the entire pathway. This novel mechanism provides a basis to explore the role of mFAO in disease and elucidate similar principles in other pathways of lipid metabolism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ttEPt-zv1rA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Irene Otero-Muras, Pencho Yordanov, Joerg Stelling&lt;/p&gt;

Bistability has important implications in signaling pathways, since it indicates a potential cell decision between alternative outcomes. We present two approaches developed in the framework of the Chemical Reaction Network Theory for easy and efficient search of multiple steady state behavior in signaling networks (both with and without mass conservation), and apply them to search for sources of bistability at different levels of the interferon signaling pathway. Different type I interferon subtypes and/or doses are known to elicit differential bioactivities (ranging from antiviral, antiproliferative to immunomodulatory activities). How different signaling outcomes can be generated through the same receptor and activating the same JAK/STAT pathway is still an open question. Here, we detect bistability at the level of early STAT signaling, showing how two different cell outcomes are achieved under or above a threshold in ligand dose or ligand-receptor affinity. This finding could contribute to explain the differential signaling (antiviral vs apoptotic) depending on interferon dose and subtype (&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; vs &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;) observed in type I interferons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4T4nKSvd4-w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Collective cell migration plays an important role in development. Here, we study the posterior lateral line primordium (PLLP) a group of about 100 cells, destined to form sensory structures, that migrates from head to tail in the zebrafish embryo. We model mutually inhibitory FGF-Wnt signalling network in the PLLP and link tissue subdivision (Wnt receptor and FGF receptor activity domains) to receptor-ligand parameters. We then use a 3D cell-based simulation with realistic cell-cell adhesion, interaction forces, and chemotaxis. Our model is able to reproduce experimentally observed motility with leading cells migrating up a gradient of CXCL12a, and trailing (FGF receptor active) cells moving actively by chemotaxis towards FGF ligand secreted by the leading cells. The 3D simulation framework, combined with experiments, allows an investigation of the role of cell division, chemotaxis, adhesion, and other parameters on the shape and speed of the PLLP. The 3D model demonstrates reasonable behaviour of control as well as mutant phenotypes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-2xErWNi25c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

They are also frequently observed after acute ischemic stroke (AIS), indicating poor functional outcome and increased mortality. However, recent evidence showed that, in most AIS patients, myocardial injury is not caused by coronary ischemia. Instead, stroke lesion location has been suggested to precipitate myocardial injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Of these, 228 had a second troponin measurement during the acute phase. The absolute hs-cTnT levels above the 99th percentile of a healthy reference population (≥14ng/l) as well as their relative temporal changes were used as continuous variables of interest in the VLSM model, including a multiple regression analysis adjusted for confounding variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Autoantibodies recognizing cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase 1A (cN1A) were found in plasma and serum from sIBM patients. However, whether anti-cN1A autoantibodies play a pathogenic role in sIBM is controversial. This study investigated the pathogenic properties of anti-cN1A autoantibodies in sIBM pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

We also investigated the clinicopathological differences between sIBM patients with and without the autoantibodies. We used passive in vitro and in vivo immunization models to evaluate the pathogenic role of the autoantibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In the anti-cN1A–positive group, the percentage of patients with hepatitis C virus antibodies was significantly lower and the mean area of type 2 myofibers was significantly smaller compared with the autoantibody-negative group. In the in vitro passive immunization model, p62/SQSTM1 significantly increased in anti-cN1A–positive sIBM immunoglobulin G (IgG)-supplemented cells. In the in vivo passive immunization model, anti-cN1A–positive sIBM IgG-injected mice demonstrated p62/SQSTM1-positive sarcoplasmic aggregates in myofibers, associated with macrophage infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper describes an approach of using dynamic Structural Equation
Modeling (SEM) analysis to estimate the connectivity networks from
resting-state fMRI data measured by a multiband EPI sequence. Two structural
equation models were estimated at each voxel with respect to the sensory-motor
network and default-mode network. The resulting connectivity maps indicate that
supplementary motor area has significant connections to left/right primary
motor areas, and medial prefrontal cortex link significantly with posterior
cingulate cortex and inferior parietal lobules. The results imply that high
temporal resolution images obtained with multiband fMRI data can provide
dynamic and directional information on the neural connectivity.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has begun to narrow down the
neural correlates of self-generated forms of thought, with current evidence
pointing toward central roles for the default, frontoparietal, and visual
networks. Recent work has linked the arising of thoughts more specifically to
default network activity, but the limited temporal resolution of fMRI has
precluded more detailed conclusions about where in the brain self-created
mental content is generated and how this is achieved. Here I argue that the
unparalleled spatiotemporal resolution of intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG)
in human epilepsy patients can begin to provide answers to questions about the
specific neural origins of self-generated thought. I review the extensive body
of literature from iEEG studies over the past few decades and show that many
studies involving passive recording or direct electrical stimulation throughout
the brain all point to the medial temporal lobe as a key site of
thought-generation. At the same time, null effects from other brain regions
suggest that various other default network hubs, such as the posterior
cingulate cortex and inferior parietal lobule, might have only a marginal role
(if any) in the self-generation or initiation of mental content like dreams,
visual imagery, memories, and prospective simulations. Ultimately, combining a
variety of neuroscientific methods that compensate for each other's weaknesses
and complement each other's strengths may prove to be the most effective way to
understand the brain's remarkable ability to decouple from the immediate
environment and generate its own experiences.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;At present, multi-electrode array (MEA) approach and optical recording allow
us to acquire plant electrical activity with higher spatio-temporal resolution.
To understand the dynamic information flow of the electrical signaling system
and estimate the effective connectivity, we proposed a solution to combine the
two casualty analysis approaches, i.e. Granger causality and transfer entropy,
which they complement each other to measure dynamics effective connectivity of
the complex system. Our findings in three qualitatively different levels of
plant bioelectrical activities revealed direction of information flow and
dynamic complex causal connectives by using the two causal analysis approaches,
especially indicated that the direction of information flow is not only along
the longitudinal section but also spreading in transection.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The central nervous system is composed of many individual units -- from cells
to areas -- that are connected with one another in a complex pattern of
functional interactions that supports perception, action, and cognition. One
natural and parsimonious representation of such a system is a graph in which
nodes (units) are connected by edges (interactions). While applicable across
spatiotemporal scales, species, and cohorts, the traditional graph approach is
unable to address the complexity of time-varying connectivity patterns that may
be critically important for an understanding of emotional and cognitive state,
task-switching, adaptation and development, or aging and disease progression.
Here we survey a set of tools from applied mathematics that offer measures to
characterize dynamic graphs. Along with this survey, we offer suggestions for
visualization and a publicly-available MATLAB toolbox to facilitate the
application of these metrics to existing or yet-to-be acquired neuroimaging
data. We illustrate the toolbox by applying it to a previously published data
set of time-varying functional graphs, but note that the tools can also be
applied to time-varying structural graphs or to other sorts of relational data
entirely. Our aim is to provide the neuroimaging community with a useful set of
tools, and an intuition regarding how to use them, for addressing emerging
questions that hinge on accurate and creative analyses of dynamic graphs.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multi-electrode arrays (MEA) are increasingly used to investigate spontaneous
neuronal network activity. The recorded signals comprise several distinct
components: Apart from artefacts without biological significance, one can
distinguish between spikes (action potentials) and subthreshold fluctuations
(local fields potentials). Here we aim to develop a theoretical model that
allows for a compact and robust characterization of subthreshold fluctuations
in terms of a Gaussian statistical field theory in two spatial and one temporal
dimension. What is usually referred to as the driving noise in the context of
statistical physics is here interpreted as a representation of the neural
activity. Spatial and temporal correlations of this activity give valuable
information about the connectivity in the neural tissue. We apply our methods
on a dataset obtained from MEA-measurements in an acute hippocampal brain slice
from a rat. Our main finding is that the empirical correlation functions indeed
obey the logarithmic behaviour that is a general feature of theoretical models
of this kind. We also find a clear correlation between the activity and the
occurence of spikes. Another important insight is the importance of correcly
separating out certain artefacts from the data before proceeding with the
analysis.

	<description>Olfactory sensory input is detected by receptor neurons in the nose which then send information to the olfactory bulb, the first brain region for processing olfactory information. Within the olfactory bulb, many local circuit interneurons, including axonless granule cells, function to facilitate fine odor discrimination. How interneurons interact with principal cells to affect bulbar processing is not known though the mechanism is likely to be different than in sensory cortical regions since the olfactory bulb lacks an obvious topographical organization; neighboring glomerular columns, representing inputs from different receptor neuron subtypes, typically have different odor tuning. Determining the spatial scale over which interneurons such as granule cells can affect principal cells is a critical step towards understanding how the olfactory bulb operates. We addressed this question by assaying inhibitory synchrony using intracellular recordings from pairs of principal cells with different inter-somatic spacing. We find that in acute rat olfactory bulb slices, inhibitory synchrony is evident in the spontaneous synaptic input in mitral cells separated up to 300 m. At all inter-somatic spacing assayed, inhibitory synchrony was dependent on fast Na+ channels, suggesting that action potentials in granule cells function to coordinate GABA release at relatively distant dendrodendritic synapses formed throughout the the dendritic arbor. Our results suggest that individual granule cells are able to influence relatively large groups of mitral and tufted cells belonging to clusters of at least 15 glomerular modules, providing a potential mechanism to integrate signals reflecting a wide variety of odorants.</description>

	<description>Adaptation to environmental insults is an evolutionary mechanism essential for survival. The hippocampus participates in controlling adaptive responses to stress and emotional state through the modulation of neuroplasticity events, which are dysregulated in stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) has been proposed as a pivotal player in hippocampal neuroplasticity in both normal and neuropsychiatric conditions though its role remains still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the impact of 5-HT deficiency on hippocampal activity combining RNA-seq, in vivo neuroimaging, neuroanatomical, biochemical and behavioral experiments on 5-HT depleted mice. We unveil that serotonin is required for appropriate activation of neuroplasticity adaptive mechanisms to environmental insults. Bidirectional deregulation of these programs in serotonin depleted mice is associated with opposite behavioral traits that model core symptoms of bipolar disorder. These findings delineate a previously unreported buffering role of 5-HT in instructing hippocampal activity and emotional responses to environmental demands.</description>

	<description>Measuring functional connectivity between cortical regions of the human brain has become an important area of research. Modern theory suggests that brain networks exhibit non-stationarity, constantly forming and reforming depending on task demands. A robust means of determining effective connectivity in the short-lived neural responses that occur in event related paradigms would allow the investigation of event related cortico-cortical dynamics. We present such a mathematical model of wave propagation, motivated by current neuroscience literature, and demonstrate the utility of the method in a clinical sample of schizophrenia patients. MEG data were acquired in 10 patients with schizophrenia and 12 healthy controls during a relevance modulation task. Data were filtered into the theta band (4-8Hz) and source localised using a beamformer. The model was implemented using Fourier analysis methods which uncovered an event related travelling wave moving from the visual to frontal cortices. The model was validated using Monte Carlo phase randomisation and compared with another plausible model of wave propagation in the cortex. Results from the clinical sample revealed that wave speed was modulated by task condition and patients were found to have less difference between conditions (ANOVA revealing a significant interaction between group and condition, p&amp;lt;0.05). In conclusion, our method provides a simple and robust means to investigate event related cortico-cortical brain dynamics in individuals and groups in the task positive state.</description>

	<description>Connectome-based modeling of large-scale brain network dynamics enables causal in silico interrogation of the brain's structure-function relationship, necessitating the close integration of diverse neuroinformatics fields. Here we extend the open-source simulation software The Virtual Brain to whole mouse brain network modeling based on individual diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI)-based or tracer-based detailed mouse connectomes. We provide practical examples on how to use The Virtual Mouse Brain to simulate brain activity, such as seizure propagation and the switching behavior of the resting state dynamics in health and disease. The Virtual Mouse Brain enables theoretically driven experimental planning and ways to test predictions in the numerous strains of mice available to study brain function in normal and pathological conditions.</description>

	<description>Serotonergic transmission affects behaviours and neuro-physiological functions via the orchestrated recruitment of distributed neural systems. It is however unclear whether serotonin's modulatory effect entails a global regulation of brainwide neural activity, or is relayed and encoded by a set of primary functional substrates. Here we combine DREADD-based chemogenetics and mouse fMRI, an approach we term ''chemo-fMRI', to causally probe the brainwide substrates modulated by phasic serotonergic activity. We describe the generation of a conditional knock-in mouse line that, crossed with serotonin-specific cre-recombinase mice, allowed us to remotely stimulate serotonergic neurons during fMRI scans. We show that chemogenetic stimulation of the serotonin system does not affect global brain activity, but results in region-specific activation of a set of primary target regions encompassing parieto-cortical, hippocampal, and midbrain structures, as well as ventro-striatal components of the mesolimbic reward systems. Many of the activated regions also exhibit increased c-Fos immunostaining upon chemogenetic stimulation in freely-behaving mice, corroborating a neural origin for the observed functional signals. These results identify a set of regional substrates that act as primary functional targets of endogenous serotonergic stimulation, and establish causation between phasic activation of serotonergic neurons and regional fMRI signals. They further highlight a functional cross-talk between serotonin and mesolimbic dopamine systems hence providing a novel framework for understanding serotonin dependent functions and interpreting data obtained from human fMRI studies of serotonin modulating agents.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: PTSD Blood Transcriptome Mega-Analysis: Shared Inflammatory Pathways Across Genders And Modes Of Traumas</title>

	<description>Transcriptome-wide screens of peripheral blood during the onset and development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) indicate widespread immune dysregulation. However, little is known as to whether gender and the type of traumatic event influence shared or distinct biological pathways in PTSD. We performed a combined analysis of five independent PTSD blood transcriptome studies covering seven types of trauma in 229 PTSD and 311 comparison individuals to synthesize the extant data. Analyses by trauma type revealed a clear pattern of PTSD gene signatures distinguishing interpersonal (IP)-related traumas from combat-related traumas. Co-expression network analyses integrated all data and identified distinct gene expression perturbations across gender and modes of trauma in PTSD, including one wound-healing module down-regulated in men exposed to combat traumas, one IL12-mediated signaling module up-regulated in men exposed to IP-related traumas, and two modules associated with lipid metabolism and MAPK-activity up-regulated in women exposed to IP-related traumas. Remarkably, a high degree of sharing of transcriptional dysregulation across genders and modes of trauma in PTSD was also observed converging on common signaling cascades, including cytokine, innate immune and type-I-interferon pathways. Collectively, these findings provide a broad view of immune dysregulation in PTSD and demonstrate inflammatory pathways of molecular convergence and specificity, which may inform mechanisms and diagnostic biomarkers for the disorder.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The preferred nucleotide contexts of the AID/APOBEC cytidine deaminases have differential effects when mutating retrotransposon and virus sequences compared to host genes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jeffrey Chen, Thomas MacCarthy&lt;/p&gt;

The AID / APOBEC genes are a family of cytidine deaminases that have evolved in vertebrates, and particularly mammals, to mutate RNA and DNA at distinct preferred nucleotide contexts (or “hotspots”) on foreign genomes such as viruses and retrotransposons. These enzymes play a pivotal role in intrinsic immunity defense mechanisms, often deleteriously mutating invading retroviruses or retrotransposons and, in the case of AID, changing antibody sequences to drive affinity maturation. We investigate the strength of various hotspots on their known biological targets by evaluating the potential impact of mutations on the DNA coding sequences of these targets, and compare these results to hypothetical hotspots that did not evolve. We find that the existing AID / APOBEC hotspots have a large impact on retrotransposons and non-mammalian viruses while having a much smaller effect on vital mammalian genes, suggesting co-evolution with AID / APOBECs may have had an impact on the genomes of the viruses we analyzed. We determine that GC content appears to be a significant, but not sole, factor in resistance to deaminase activity. We discuss possible mechanisms AID and APOBEC viral targets have adopted to escape the impacts of deamination activity, including changing the GC content of the genome.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ycQwEhXP4SQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Creating and running realistic models of neural networks has hitherto been a task for computing professionals rather than experimental neuroscientists. This is mainly because such networks usually engage substantial computational resources, the handling of which requires specific programing skills. Here we put forward a newly developed simulation environment ARACHNE: it enables an investigator to build and explore cellular networks of arbitrary biophysical and architectural complexity using the logic of NEURON and a simple interface on a local computer or a mobile device. The interface can control, through the internet, an optimized computational kernel installed on a remote computer cluster. ARACHNE can combine neuronal (wired) and astroglial (extracellular volume-transmission driven) network types and adopt realistic cell models from the NEURON library. The program and documentation (current version) are available at GitHub repository https://github.com/LeonidSavtchenko/Arachne under the MIT License (MIT).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/P5jJ4rRYC8w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Interrogating the topological robustness of gene regulatory circuits by randomization</title>

One of the most important roles of cells is performing their cellular tasks properly for survival. Cells usually achieve robust functionality, for example, cell-fate decision-making and signal transduction, through multiple layers of regulation involving many genes. Despite the combinatorial complexity of gene regulation, its quantitative behavior has been typically studied on the basis of experimentally verified core gene regulatory circuitry, composed of a small set of important elements. It is still unclear how such a core circuit operates in the presence of many other regulatory molecules and in a crowded and noisy cellular environment. Here we report a new computational method, named random circuit perturbation (RACIPE), for interrogating the robust dynamical behavior of a gene regulatory circuit even without accurate measurements of circuit kinetic parameters. RACIPE generates an ensemble of random kinetic models corresponding to a fixed circuit topology, and utilizes statistical tools to identify generic properties of the circuit. By applying RACIPE to simple toggle-switch-like motifs, we observed that the stable states of all models converge to experimentally observed gene state clusters even when the parameters are strongly perturbed. RACIPE was further applied to a proposed 22-gene network of the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), from which we identified four experimentally observed gene states, including the states that are associated with two different types of hybrid Epithelial/Mesenchymal phenotypes. Our results suggest that dynamics of a gene circuit is mainly determined by its topology, not by detailed circuit parameters. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for circuit-based systems biology modeling. We anticipate RACIPE to be a powerful tool to predict and decode circuit design principles in an unbiased manner, and to quantitatively evaluate the robustness and heterogeneity of gene expression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/95I6HbX7yKs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Effects of contact structure on the transient evolution of HIV virulence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005453</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Sang Woo Park, Benjamin M. Bolker&lt;/p&gt;

Early in an epidemic, high densities of susceptible hosts select for relatively high parasite virulence; later in the epidemic, lower susceptible densities select for lower virulence. Thus over the course of a typical epidemic the average virulence of parasite strains increases initially, peaks partway through the epidemic, then declines again. However, precise quantitative outcomes, such as the peak virulence reached and its timing, may depend sensitively on epidemiological details. Fraser &lt;i&gt;et al.&lt;/i&gt; proposed a model for the eco-evolutionary dynamics of HIV that incorporates the tradeoffs between transmission and virulence (mediated by set-point viral load, SPVL) and their heritability between hosts. Their model used implicit equations to capture the effects of partnership dynamics that are at the core of epidemics of sexually transmitted diseases. Our models combine HIV virulence tradeoffs with a range of contact models, explicitly modeling partnership formation and dissolution and allowing for individuals to transmit disease outside of partnerships. We assess summary statistics such as the peak virulence (corresponding to the maximum value of population mean log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; SPVL achieved throughout the epidemic) across models for a range of parameters applicable to the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Although virulence trajectories are broadly similar across models, the timing and magnitude of the virulence peak vary considerably. Previously developed implicit models predicted lower virulence and slower progression at the peak (a maximum of 3.5 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; SPVL) compared both to more realistic models and to simple random-mixing models with no partnership structure at all (both with a maximum of ≈ 4.7 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; SPVL). In this range of models, the simplest random-mixing structure best approximates the most realistic model; this surprising outcome occurs because the dominance of extra-pair contact in the realistic model swamps the effects of partnership structure.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1iEZGtJW3rA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Neural Networks Approach to Predicting How Things Might Have Turned Out Had I Mustered the Nerve to Ask Barry Cottonfield to the Junior Prom Back in 1997. (arXiv:1703.10449v1 [physics.pop-ph])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10449</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We use a feed-forward artificial neural network with back-propagation through
a single hidden layer to predict Barry Cottonfield's likely reply to this
author's invitation to the &quot;Once Upon a Daydream&quot; junior prom at the Conard
High School gymnasium back in 1997. To examine the network's ability to
generalize to such a situation beyond specific training scenarios, we use a L2
regularization term in the cost function and examine performance over a range
of regularization strengths. In addition, we examine the nonsensical
decision-making strategies that emerge in Barry at times when he has recently
engaged in a fight with his annoying kid sister Janice. To simulate Barry's
inability to learn efficiently from large mistakes (an observation well
documented by his algebra teacher during sophomore year), we choose a simple
quadratic form for the cost function, so that the weight update magnitude is
not necessary correlated with the magnitude of output error.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network performance on test data indicates that this author would have
received an 87.2 (1)% chance of &quot;Yes&quot; given a particular set of environmental
input parameters. Most critically, the optimal method of question delivery is
found to be Secret Note rather than Verbal Speech. There also exists mild
evidence that wearing a burgundy mini-dress might have helped. The network
performs comparably for all values of regularization strength, which suggests
that the nature of noise in a high school hallway during passing time does not
affect much of anything. We comment on possible biases inherent in the output,
implications regarding the functionality of a real biological network, and
future directions. Over-training is also discussed, although the linear algebra
teacher assures us that in Barry's case this is not possible.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Contemporary neuroscience has embraced network science to study the complex
and self-organized structure of the human brain; one of the main outstanding
issues is that of inferring from measure data, chiefly functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (fMRI), the so-called effective connectivity in brain
networks, that is the existing interactions among neuronal populations. This
inverse problem is complicated by the fact that the BOLD (Blood Oxygenation
Level Dependent) signal measured by fMRI represent a dynamic and nonlinear
transformation (the hemodynamic response) of neuronal activity. In this paper,
we consider resting state (rs) fMRI data; building upon a linear population
model of the BOLD signal and a stochastic linear DCM model, the model
parameters are estimated through an EM-type iterative procedure, which
alternately estimates the neuronal activity by means of the Rauch-Tung-Striebel
(RTS) smoother, updates the connections among neuronal states and refines the
parameters of the hemodynamic model; sparsity in the interconnection structure
is favoured using an iteratively reweighting scheme. Experimental results using
rs-fMRI data are shown demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and
comparison with state of the art routines (SPM12 toolbox) is provided.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Exact Spike Train Inference Via $\ell_0$ Optimization. (arXiv:1703.08644v1 [stat.AP] CROSS LISTED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, new technologies in neuroscience have made it possible to
measure the activities of large numbers of neurons in behaving animals. For
each neuron, a fluorescence trace is measured; this can be seen as a
first-order approximation of the neuron's activity over time. Determining the
exact time at which a neuron spikes on the basis of its fluorescence trace is
an important open problem in the field of computational neuroscience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, a convex optimization problem involving an $\ell_1$ penalty was
proposed for this task. In this paper, we slightly modify that recent proposal
by replacing the $\ell_1$ penalty with an $\ell_0$ penalty. In stark contrast
to the conventional wisdom that $\ell_0$ optimization problems are
computationally intractable, we show that the resulting optimization problem
can be efficiently solved for the global optimum using an extremely simple and
efficient dynamic programming algorithm. Our R-language implementation of the
proposed algorithm runs in a few minutes on fluorescence traces of $100,000$
timesteps. Furthermore, our proposal leads to substantially better results than
the previous $\ell_1$ proposal, on synthetic data as well as on two calcium
imaging data sets.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R-language software for our proposal is now available at
https://github.com/jewellsean/LZeroSpikeInference and will be available soon on
CRAN in the package LZeroSpikeInference.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Surround suppression explained by long-range recruitment of local competition, in a columnar V1 model. (arXiv:1611.00945v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although neurons in columns of visual cortex of adult carnivores and primates
share similar orientation tuning preferences, responses of nearby neurons are
surprisingly sparse and temporally uncorrelated, especially in response to
complex visual scenes. The mechanisms underlying this counter-intuitive
combination of response properties are still unknown. Here we present a
computational model of columnar visual cortex which explains experimentally
observed integration of complex features across the visual field, and which is
consistent with anatomical and physiological profiles of cortical excitation
and inhibition. In this model, sparse local excitatory connections within
columns, coupled with strong unspecific local inhibition and
functionally-specific long-range excitatory connections across columns, give
rise to competitive dynamics that reproduce experimental observations. Our
results explain surround modulation of responses to simple and complex visual
stimuli, including reduced correlation of nearby excitatory neurons, increased
excitatory response selectivity, increased inhibitory selectivity, and complex
orientation-tuning of surround modulation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Breakdown of local information processing may underlie isoflurane anesthesia effects. (arXiv:1608.08387v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08387</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08387</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The disruption of coupling between brain areas has been suggested as the
mechanism underlying loss of consciousness in anesthesia. This hypothesis has
been tested previously by measuring the information transfer between brain
areas, and by taking reduced information transfer as a proxy for decoupling.
Yet, information transfer is a function of the amount of information available
in the information source-such that transfer decreases even for unchanged
coupling when less source information is available. Therefore, we asked whether
impaired local information processing leads to a loss of information transfer.
An important prediction of this alternative hypothesis is that changes in
locally available information (signal entropy) should be at least as pronounced
as changes in information transfer. We tested this prediction by recording
local field potentials in two ferrets after administration of isoflurane in
concentrations of 0.0 %, 0.5 %, and 1.0 %.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found strong decreases in the source entropy under isoflurane in area V1
and the prefrontal cortex (PFC)-as predicted by our alternative hypothesis. The
decrease in source entropy was stronger in PFC. Information transfer between V1
and PFC was reduced bidirectionally, but with a stronger decrease from PFC to
V1. This links the stronger decrease in information transfer to the stronger
decrease in source entropy, suggesting reduced source entropy reduces
information transfer. This conclusion fits the observation that the synaptic
targets of isoflurane are located in local cortical circuits rather than on the
synapses formed by interareal axonal projections. Thus, changes in information
transfer under isoflurane seem to be a consequence of changes in local
processing more than of decoupling between brain areas. We suggest that source
entropy changes must be considered whenever interpreting changes in information
transfer as decoupling.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Automated point-neuron simplification of data-driven microcircuit models. (arXiv:1604.00087v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00087</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00087</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A method is presented for the reduction of morphologically detailed
microcircuit models to a point-neuron representation without human
intervention. The simplification occurs in a modular workflow, in the
neighborhood of a user specified network activity state for the reference
model, the &quot;operating point&quot;. First, synapses are moved to the soma, correcting
for dendritic filtering by low-pass filtering the delivered synaptic current.
Filter parameters are computed numerically and independently for inhibitory and
excitatory input using a Green's function approach. Next, point-neuron models
for each neuron in the microcircuit are fit to their respective morphologically
detailed counterparts. Here, generalized integrate-and-fire point neuron models
are used, leveraging a recently published fitting toolbox. The fits are
constrained by currents and voltages computed in the morphologically detailed
partner neurons with soma corrected synapses at three depolarizations about the
user specified operating point. The result is a simplified circuit which is
well constrained by the reference circuit, and can be continuously updated as
the latter iteratively integrates new data. The modularity of the approach
makes it applicable also for other point-neuron and synapse models. The
approach is demonstrated on a recently reported reconstruction of a neocortical
microcircuit around an in vivo-like working point. The resulting simplified
network model is benchmarked to the reference morphologically detailed
microcircuit model for a range of simulated network protocols. The simplified
network is found to be slightly more sub-critical than the reference, with
otherwise good agreement for both quantitative and qualitative validations.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Altered allostatic regulation of wakefulness and slow-wave-sleep spectral quality in mice with hypocretin (orexin) receptor 1 inactivation in noradrenergic cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/123075v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/123075v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The neuromodulators noradrenaline (NA) and hypocretins (Hcrt) both have major, but distinct, roles in implementing the brain circuit processing modes that define wakefulness and waking behaviors. The A6 NA cell group in the locus coeruleus (LC-NA) receives dense projections from the Hcrt cells of the hypothalamus, and acts as critical mediator of Hcrt-induced arousal. The range of behaviors relying on the Hcrt-to-LC-NA neuronal connection however remains undefined. We generated a conditionally inactivated allele of Hcrtr1, the Hcrt receptor gene expressed by LC-NA cells, and used a Dbh-Cre transgene to create mice with NA-specific Hcrtr1 inactivation (Hcrtr1Dbh-CKO mice). Electrocortical activity (ECoG) of these mice was analyzed in distinct behavioral contexts, and contrasted to the one of Cre-less control littermates. While baseline waking was grossly normal albeit for enhanced activity in the slow-{delta} range, upon exposure to a novel environment, Hcrtr1Dbh-CKO mice displayed (i) a slowing of the waking ECoG, with enhanced {delta} and inter-{delta};{theta} band activity, (ii) blunting of the {theta} rhythm and fast-{gamma} activity, while (iii) {beta} and slow-{gamma} activities were enhanced. Moreover, locomotor and ECoG responses to sleep deprivation (SD) were markedly reduced. Surprisingly, while deficits in manually-enforced wakefulness resembled those following cage change (CC), spontaneous dark phase waking, and after providing nest material, were enhanced in {theta} and fast-{gamma} oscillatory activities. Our data suggest that Hcrtr1Dbh-CKO mice are deficient in adaptive regulation of wakefulness in stress-associated conditions with electrocortical signs of decreased alertness and hippocampal {theta} activation. Furthermore, their waking {theta} and fast-{gamma} ECoG power show concerted, but opposite, trends in stressful versus rewarding contexts. Finally, slow-wave-sleep (SWS) following SD and CC both showed a profound deficit in slow-{delta} activity, suggesting that Hcrt-to-NA signalling is critical in active waking to induce the homeostatic slow-{delta} rebound that characterizes ensuing SWS.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Local Connectome Phenotypes Predict Social, Health, and Cognitive Factors</title>

	<description>The unique architecture of the human connectome is defined initially by genetics and subsequently sculpted over time with experience. Thus similarities in predisposition and experience that lead to similarities in social, biological, and cognitive attributes should also be reflected in the local architecture of white matter fascicles. Here we employ a method known as local connectome fingerprinting that uses diffusion MRI to measure the fiber-wise characteristics of macroscopic white matter pathways throughout the brain. This fingerprinting approach was applied to a large sample (N=841) of subjects from the Human Connectome Project, revealing a reliable degree of between-subject correlation in the local connectome fingerprints, with a relatively complex, low-dimensional substructure. Using a cross-validated, high-dimensional regression analysis approach, we derived local connectome phenotype (LCP) maps that could reliably predict 14 out of 36 subject attributes measured, including a large set of health and cognitive measures. These LCP maps were highly specific to the attribute being predicted but also sensitive to correlations between attributes. Collectively, these results indicate the sensitivity of the local connectome to predict both individualized and shared structural variability between subjects related to genetic and experiential factors.</description>

	<description>The world around us is replete with stimuli that unfold over time. When we hear an auditory stream like music or speech or scan a texture with our fingertip, physical features in the stimulus are concatenated in a particular order, and this temporal patterning is critical to interpreting the stimulus. To explore the capacity of mice and humans to learn tactile sequences, we developed a task in which subjects had to recognise a continuous modulated noise sequence delivered to whiskers or fingertips, defined by its temporal patterning over hundreds of milliseconds. GO and NO-GO sequences differed only in that the order of their constituent noise modulation segments was temporally scrambled. Both mice and humans efficiently performed tactile sequence learning. Mouse performance relied mainly on detecting relative changes in noise amplitude over time, whereas humans appeared to have access to more cues, including the duration of noise modulation segments.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Concurrent tACS-fMRI Reveals Causal Influence Of Power Synchronized Neural Activity On Resting State fMRI Connectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/122820v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/122820v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is commonly used to study the brain's intrinsic neural coupling, which reveals specific spatiotemporal patterns in the form of resting state networks (RSN). It has been hypothesized that slow rs-fMRI oscillations (&amp;lt;0.1 Hz) are driven by underlying electrophysiological rhythms that typically occur at much faster timescales (&amp;gt;5 Hz); however, causal evidence for this relationship is currently lacking. Here we measured rs-fMRI in humans while applying transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to entrain brain rhythms in left and right sensorimotor cortices. The two driving tACS signals were tailored to the individual's alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz) and fluctuated in amplitude according to a 1 Hz power envelope. We entrained the left versus right hemisphere in accordance to two different coupling modes where either alpha oscillations were synchronized between hemispheres (phase-synchronized tACS) or the slower oscillating power envelopes (power-synchronized tACS). Power-synchronized tACS significantly increased rs-fMRI connectivity within the stimulated RSN compared to phase-synchronized or no tACS. This effect outlasted the stimulation period and tended to be more effective in individuals who exhibited a naturally weak interhemispheric coupling. Using this novel approach, our data provide causal evidence that synchronized power fluctuations contribute to the formation of fMRI-based RSNs. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that the brain's intrinsic coupling at rest can be selectively modulated by choosing appropriate tACS signals, which could lead to new interventions for patients with altered rs-fMRI connectivity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The 100 Euro Lab: A 3-D Printable Open Source Platform For Fluorescence Microscopy, Optogenetics And Accurate Temperature Control During Behaviour Of Zebrafish, Drosophila And C. elegans</title>

	<description>Small, genetically tractable species such as larval zebrafish, Drosophila or C. elegans have become key model organisms in modern neuroscience. In addition to their low maintenance costs and easy sharing of strains across labs, one key appeal is the possibility to monitor single or groups of animals in a behavioural arena while controlling the activity of select neurons using optogenetic or thermogenetic tools. However, the purchase of a commercial solution for these types of experiments, including an appropriate camera system as well as a controlled behavioural arena can be costly. Here, we present a low-cost and modular open-source alternative called FlyPi. Our design is based on a 3-D printed mainframe, a Raspberry Pi computer and high-definition camera system as well as Arduino-based optical and thermal control circuits. Depending on the configuration, FlyPi can be assembled for well under 100 Euros and features optional modules for LED-based fluorescence microscopy and optogenetic stimulation as well as a Peltier-based temperature stimulator for thermogenetics. The complete version with all modules costs ~200 Euros, or substantially less if the user is prepared to shop around. All functions of FlyPi can be controlled through a custom-written graphical user interface. To demonstrate FlyPis capabilities we present its use in a series of state-of-the-art neurogenetics experiments. In addition, we demonstrate FlyPis utility as a medical diagnostic tool as well as a teaching aid at Neurogenetics courses held at several African universities. Taken together, the low cost and modular nature as well as fully open design of FlyPi make it a highly versatile tool in a range of applications, including the classroom, diagnostic centres and research labs.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Inflated False Negative Rates Undermine Reproducibility In Task-Based fMRI</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/122788v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Reproducibility is generally regarded as a hallmark of scientific validity. It can be undermined by two very different factors, namely inflated false positive rates or inflated false negative rates. Here we investigate the role of the second factor, i.e. the degree to which true effects are not detected reliably. The availability of large public databases and also supercomputing allows us to tackle this problem quantitatively. Specifically, we estimated the reproducibility in task-based fMRI data over different samples randomly drawn from a large cohort of subjects obtained from the Human Connectome Project. We use the full cohort as a standard of reference to approximate true positive effects, and compute the fraction of those effects that was detected reliably using standard software packages at various smaller sample sizes. We found that with standard sample sizes this fraction was less than 25 percent. We conclude that inflated false negative rates are a major factor that undermine reproducibility. We introduce a new statistical inference algorithm based on a novel test statistic and show that it improves reproducibility without inflating false positive rates.</description>

	<description>Visual memory for faces has been extensively researched, especially regarding the main factors that influence face memorability. However, what we remember exactly about a face, namely, the pictorial content of visual memory, remains largely unclear. The current work aims to elucidate this issue by reconstructing face images from both perceptual and memory-based behavioural data. Specifically, our work builds upon and further validates the hypothesis that visual memory and perception share a common representational basis underlying facial identity recognition. To this end, we derived facial features directly from perceptual data and then used such features for image reconstruction separately from perception and memory data. Successful levels of reconstruction were achieved in both cases for newly-learned faces as well as for familiar faces retrieved from long-term memory. Theoretically, this work provides insights into the content of memory-based representations while, practically, it opens the path to novel applications, such as computer-based sketch artists.</description>

	<description>Working memory (WM) activity is not as stationary or sustained as previously thought. There are brief bursts of gamma (55 to 120 Hz) and beta (20 to 35 Hz) oscillations, the former linked to stimulus information in spiking. We examine these dynamics in relation to read-out from WM, which is still not well understood. Monkeys held a sequence of two objects and had to decide if they matched a subsequent sequence. Changes in the balance of beta/gamma suggested their role in WM control. In anticipation of having to use an object for the match decision, there was an increase in spiking information about that object along with an increase in gamma and a decrease in beta. When an object was no longer needed, beta increased and gamma as well as spiking information about that object decreased. Deviations from these dynamics predicted behavioral errors. Thus, turning up or down beta could regulate gamma and the information in working memory.</description>

Metabolic cross-feeding interactions between microbial strains are common in nature, and emerge during evolution experiments in the laboratory, even in homogeneous environments providing a single carbon source. In sympatry, when the environment is well-mixed, the reasons why emerging cross-feeding interactions may sometimes become stable and lead to monophyletic genotypic clusters occupying specific niches, named ecotypes, remain unclear. As an alternative to evolution experiments in the laboratory, we developed Evo&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Sim, a multi-scale model of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; experimental evolution, equipped with the whole tool case of experimental setups, competition assays, phylogenetic analysis, and, most importantly, allowing for evolvable ecological interactions. Digital organisms with an evolvable genome structure encoding an evolvable metabolic network evolved for tens of thousands of generations in environments mimicking the dynamics of real controlled environments, including chemostat or batch culture providing a single limiting resource. We show here that the evolution of stable cross-feeding interactions requires seasonal batch conditions. In this case, adaptive diversification events result in two stably co-existing ecotypes, with one feeding on the primary resource and the other on by-products. We show that the regularity of serial transfers is essential for the maintenance of the polymorphism, as it allows for at least two stable seasons and thus two temporal niches. A first season is externally generated by the transfer into fresh medium, while a second one is internally generated by niche construction as the provided nutrient is replaced by secreted by-products derived from bacterial growth. In chemostat conditions, even if cross-feeding interactions emerge, they are not stable on the long-term because fitter mutants eventually invade the whole population. We also show that the long-term evolution of the two stable ecotypes leads to character displacement, at the level of the metabolic network but also of the genome structure. This difference of genome structure between both ecotypes impacts the stability of the cross-feeding interaction, when the population is propagated in chemostat conditions. This study shows the crucial role played by seasonality in temporal niche partitioning and in promoting cross-feeding subgroups into stable ecotypes, a premise to sympatric speciation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gSkplsbz0Ow&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In heme proteins, the efficient transport of ligands such as NO or O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the binding site is achieved via ligand migration networks. A quantitative assessment of ligand diffusion in these networks is thus essential for a better understanding of the function of these proteins. For this, Xe migration in truncated hemoglobin N (trHbN) of &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium Tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; was studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Transitions between pockets of the migration network and intra-pocket relaxation occur on similar time scales (10 ps and 20 ps), consistent with low free energy barriers (1-2 kcal/mol). Depending on the pocket from where Xe enters a particular transition, the conformation of the side chains lining the transition region differs which highlights the coupling between ligand and protein degrees of freedom. Furthermore, comparison of transition probabilities shows that Xe migration in trHbN is a non-Markovian process.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Learning about and from others' prudence, impatience or laziness: The computational bases of attitude alignment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005422</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Marie Devaine, Jean Daunizeau&lt;/p&gt;

Peoples' subjective attitude towards costs such as, e.g., risk, delay or effort are key determinants of inter-individual differences in goal-directed behaviour. Thus, the ability to learn about others' prudent, impatient or lazy attitudes is likely to be critical for social interactions. Conversely, how adaptive such attitudes are in a given environment is highly uncertain. Thus, the brain may be tuned to garner information about how such costs ought to be arbitrated. In particular, observing others' attitude may change one's uncertain belief about how to best behave in related difficult decision contexts. In turn, learning &lt;i&gt;from&lt;/i&gt; others' attitudes is determined by one's ability to learn &lt;i&gt;about&lt;/i&gt; others' attitudes. We first derive, from basic optimality principles, the computational properties of such a learning mechanism. In particular, we predict two apparent cognitive biases that would arise when individuals are learning about others’ attitudes: (i) people should overestimate the degree to which they resemble others (false-consensus bias), and (ii) they should align their own attitudes with others’ (social influence bias). We show how these two biases non-trivially interact with each other. We then validate these predictions experimentally by profiling people's attitudes both before and after guessing a series of cost-benefit arbitrages performed by calibrated artificial agents (which are impersonating human individuals).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CVyw4j6Kwb8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Dysfunctions of the basal ganglia-cerebellar-thalamo-cortical system produce motor tics in Tourette syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005395</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/63dyLJTXb2g/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniele Caligiore, Francesco Mannella, Michael A. Arbib, Gianluca Baldassarre&lt;/p&gt;

Motor tics are a cardinal feature of Tourette syndrome and are traditionally associated with an excess of striatal dopamine in the basal ganglia. Recent evidence increasingly supports a more articulated view where cerebellum and cortex, working closely in concert with basal ganglia, are also involved in tic production. Building on such evidence, this article proposes a computational model of the basal ganglia-cerebellar-thalamo-cortical system to study how motor tics are generated in Tourette syndrome. In particular, the model: (i) reproduces the main results of recent experiments about the involvement of the basal ganglia-cerebellar-thalamo-cortical system in tic generation; (ii) suggests an explanation of the system-level mechanisms underlying motor tic production: in this respect, the model predicts that the interplay between dopaminergic signal and cortical activity contributes to triggering the tic event and that the recently discovered basal ganglia-cerebellar anatomical pathway may support the involvement of the cerebellum in tic production; (iii) furnishes predictions on the amount of tics generated when striatal dopamine increases and when the cortex is externally stimulated. These predictions could be important in identifying new brain target areas for future therapies. Finally, the model represents the first computational attempt to study the role of the recently discovered basal ganglia-cerebellar anatomical links. Studying this non-cortex-mediated basal ganglia-cerebellar interaction could radically change our perspective about how these areas interact with each other and with the cortex. Overall, the model also shows the utility of casting Tourette syndrome within a system-level perspective rather than viewing it as related to the dysfunction of a single brain area.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/63dyLJTXb2g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A critical analysis of computational protein design with sparse residue interaction graphs</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005346</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Swati Jain, Jonathan D. Jou, Ivelin S. Georgiev, Bruce R. Donald&lt;/p&gt;

Protein design algorithms enumerate a combinatorial number of candidate structures to compute the Global Minimum Energy Conformation (GMEC). To efficiently find the GMEC, protein design algorithms must methodically reduce the conformational search space. By applying distance and energy cutoffs, the protein system to be designed can thus be represented using a &lt;i&gt;sparse residue interaction graph&lt;/i&gt;, where the number of interacting residue pairs is less than all pairs of mutable residues, and the corresponding GMEC is called the &lt;i&gt;sparse GMEC&lt;/i&gt;. However, ignoring some pairwise residue interactions can lead to a change in the energy, conformation, or sequence of the sparse GMEC vs. the original or the &lt;i&gt;full GMEC&lt;/i&gt;. Despite the widespread use of sparse residue interaction graphs in protein design, the above mentioned effects of their use have not been previously analyzed. To analyze the costs and benefits of designing with sparse residue interaction graphs, we computed the GMECs for 136 different protein design problems both with and without distance and energy cutoffs, and compared their energies, conformations, and sequences. Our analysis shows that the differences between the GMECs depend critically on whether or not the design includes core, boundary, or surface residues. Moreover, neglecting long-range interactions can alter local interactions and introduce large sequence differences, both of which can result in significant structural and functional changes. Designs on proteins with experimentally measured thermostability show it is beneficial to compute both the full and the sparse GMEC accurately and efficiently. To this end, we show that a provable, ensemble-based algorithm can efficiently compute both GMECs by enumerating a small number of conformations, usually fewer than 1000. This provides a novel way to combine sparse residue interaction graphs with provable, ensemble-based algorithms to reap the benefits of sparse residue interaction graphs while avoiding their potential inaccuracies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HrKodN5CDiY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Data-driven brain parcellations aim to provide a more accurate representation
of an individual's functional connectivity, since they are able to capture
individual variability that arises due to development or disease. This renders
comparisons between the emerging brain connectivity networks more challenging,
since correspondences between their elements are not preserved. Unveiling these
correspondences is of major importance to keep track of local functional
connectivity changes. We propose a novel method based on graph edit distance
for the comparison of brain graphs directly in their domain, that can
accurately reflect similarities between individual networks while providing the
network element correspondences. This method is validated on a dataset of 116
twin subjects provided by the Human Connectome Project.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human visual system contains a hierarchical sequence of modules that take
part in visual perception at different levels of abstraction, i.e.,
superordinate, basic, and subordinate levels. One important question is to
identify the &quot;entry&quot; level at which the visual representation is commenced in
the process of object recognition. For a long time, it was believed that the
basic level had advantage over two others; a claim that has been challenged
recently. Here we used a series of psychophysics experiments, based on a rapid
presentation paradigm, as well as two computational models, with bandpass
filtered images to study the processing order of the categorization levels. In
these experiments, we investigated the type of visual information required for
categorizing objects in each level by varying the spatial frequency bands of
the input image. The results of our psychophysics experiments and computational
models are consistent. They indicate that the different spatial frequency
information had different effects on object categorization in each level. In
the absence of high frequency information, subordinate and basic level
categorization are performed inaccurately, while superordinate level is
performed well. This means that, low frequency information is sufficient for
superordinate level, but not for the basic and subordinate levels. These finer
levels require high frequency information, which appears to take longer to be
processed, leading to longer reaction times. Finally, to avoid the ceiling
effect, we evaluated the robustness of the results by adding different amounts
of noise to the input images and repeating the experiments. As expected, the
categorization accuracy decreased and the reaction time increased
significantly, but the trends were the same.This shows that our results are not
due to a ceiling effect.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Agreement between measurements of stance width using motion capture and center of pressure in individuals with and without Parkinson's disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/122523v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/122523v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Many individuals with Parkinson's disease exhibit narrow stance width during balance and gait. Because of this, stance width is an important biomechanical variable in many studies. Measuring stance width accurately using kinematic markers in parkinsonian patients can be problematic due to occlusions by research staff who must closely guard patients to prevent falls. Methods: We investigated whether a measure of stance width based on the mediolateral distance between the center of pressure under each foot could approximate stance width measured with kinematic data. We assessed the agreement between estimates of stance width obtained from simultaneous kinematic and center of pressure measures during quiet standing in 15 individuals (n=9 parkinsonian, n=6 age-similar neurotypical). The source data (1363 unique trials) contained observations of stance width varying between 75-384 mm ({approx} 25-150% of hip width). Findings: Stance width estimates using the two measures were strongly correlated (r = 0.98). Center of pressure estimates of stance width were 48 mm wider on average than kinematic measures, and did not vary across study groups (F2,12=1.81, P&amp;lt;0.21). The expected range of differences between the center of pressure and kinematic methods was 14-83 mm. Agreement increased as stance width increased (P&amp;lt;0.02). Interpretation: It is appropriate to define stance width based on center of pressure when it is convenient to do so in studies of individuals with and without Parkinson's disease. When comparing results across studies with the two methodologies, it is reasonable to assume a bias of 48 mm.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: High GC content causes orphan proteins to be intrinsically disordered</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005375</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Walter Basile, Oxana Sachenkova, Sara Light, Arne Elofsson&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;De novo&lt;/i&gt; creation of protein coding genes involves the formation of short ORFs from noncoding regions; some of these ORFs might then become fixed in the populationThese orphan proteins need to, at the bare minimum, not cause serious harm to the organism, meaning that they should for instance not aggregate. Therefore, although the creation of short ORFs could be truly random, the fixation should be subjected to some selective pressure. The selective forces acting on orphan proteins have been elusive, and contradictory results have been reported. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; young proteins are more disordered than ancient ones, while the opposite trend is present in yeast. To the best of our knowledge no valid explanation for this difference has been proposed. To solve this riddle we studied structural properties and age of proteins in 187 eukaryotic organisms. We find that, with the exception of length, there are only small differences in the properties between proteins of different ages. However, when we take the GC content into account we noted that it could explain the opposite trends observed for orphans in yeast (low GC) and &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; (high GC). GC content is correlated with codons coding for disorder promoting amino acids. This leads us to propose that intrinsic disorder is not a strong determining factor for fixation of orphan proteins. Instead these proteins largely resemble random proteins given a particular GC level. During evolution the properties of a protein change faster than the GC level causing the relationship between disorder and GC to gradually weaken.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/McY16cW9RcQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Thalamic Control of Dorsomedial Striatum Regulates Internal State to Guide Goal-Directed Action Selection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/13/3721?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/13/3721?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We (Bradfield et al., 2013) have demonstrated previously that parafascicular thalamic nucleus (PF)-controlled neurons in the posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS) are critical for interlacing new and existing action–outcome contingencies to control goal-directed action. Based on these findings, it was suggested that animals with a dysfunctional PF–pDMS pathway might suffer a deficit in creating or retrieving internal contexts or &quot;states&quot; on which such information could become conditional. To assess this hypothesis more directly, rats were given a disconnection treatment using contralateral cytotoxic lesions of the PF and pDMS (Group CONTRA) or ipsilateral control lesions (Group IPSI) and trained to press a right and left lever for sucrose and pellet outcomes, after which these contingencies were reversed. The rats were then given an outcome devaluation test (all experiments) and a test of outcome-specific reinstatement (Experiments 1 and 3). We found that devaluation performance was intact for both groups after training of initial contingencies, but impaired for Group CONTRA after reversal. However, performance was restored by additional reversal training. Furthermore, when tested a second time after reversal training, rats in both groups demonstrated responding in accordance with the original contingencies, providing direct evidence of modulation of action selection by state. Finally, we found that external context could substitute for internal state and so could rescue responding in Group CONTRA, but only in the reinstatement test. Together, these findings suggest that animals use internal state information to guide action selection and that this information is modulated by the PF–pDMS pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Individuals with Parkinson's disease dementia often suffer a characteristic deficit in &quot;cognitive flexibility.&quot; It has been suggested that neurodegeneration in the pathway between the centromedian/parafascicular thalalmic nucleus (PF) and striatum might underlie such deficits (Smith et al., 2014). In rats, we have similarly observed that a functional disconnection of the PF–posterior dorsomedial striatal pathway produces a specific impairment in the ability to alter goal-directed actions (Bradfield et al., 2013). It was suggested that this impairment could be a result of a deficit in state modulation. Here, we present four experiments that provide evidence for this hypothesis and suggest several ways (e.g., extended practice, providing external cues) in which this state modulation can be rescued.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dopamine Inhibition Differentially Controls Excitability of Substantia Nigra Dopamine Neuron Subpopulations through T-Type Calcium Channels</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/13/3704?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/13/3704?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;While there is growing appreciation for diversity among ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons, much less is known regarding functional heterogeneity among the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) neurons. Here, we show that calbindin-positive dorsal tier and calbindin-negative ventral tier SNc dopaminergic neurons in mice comprise functionally distinct subpopulations distinguished by their dendritic calcium signaling, rebound excitation, and physiological responses to dopamine D2-receptor (D2) autoinhibition. While dopamine is known to inhibit action potential backpropagation, our experiments revealed an unexpected enhancement of excitatory responses and dendritic calcium signals in the presence of D2-receptor inhibition. Specifically, dopamine inhibition and direct hyperpolarization enabled the generation of low-threshold depolarizations that occurred in an all-or-none or graded manner, due to recruitment of T-type calcium channels. Interestingly, these effects occurred selectively in calbindin-negative dopaminergic neurons within the SNc. Thus, calbindin-positive and calbindin-negative SNc neurons differ substantially in their calcium channel composition and efficacy of excitatory inputs in the presence of dopamine inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons can be divided into two populations: the calbindin-negative ventral tier, which is vulnerable to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease, and the calbindin-positive dorsal tier, which is relatively resilient. Although tonic firing is similar in these subpopulations, we find that their responses to dopamine-mediated inhibition are strikingly different. During inhibition, calbindin-negative neurons exhibit increased sensitivity to excitatory inputs, which can then trigger large dendritic calcium transients due to strong expression of T-type calcium channels. Therefore, SNc neurons differ substantially in their calcium channel composition, which may contribute to their differential vulnerability. Furthermore, T-currents increase excitation efficacy onto calbindin-negative cells during dopamine inhibition, suggesting that shared inputs are differentially processed in subpopulations resulting in distinct downstream dopamine signals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Lateral Occipital Cortex Is Selective for Object Shape, Not Texture/Color, at Six Months</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding how the human visual system develops is crucial to understanding the nature and organization of our complex and varied visual representations. However, previous investigations of the development of the visual system using fMRI are primarily confined to a subset of the visual system (high-level vision: faces, scenes) and relatively late in visual development (starting at 4–5 years of age). The current study extends our understanding of human visual development by presenting the first systematic investigation of a mid-level visual region [the lateral occipital cortex (LOC)] in a population much younger than has been investigated in the past: 6 month olds. We use functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), an emerging optical method for recording cortical hemodynamics, to perform neuroimaging with this very young population. Whereas previous fNIRS studies have suffered from imprecise neuroanatomical localization, we rely on the most rigorous MR coregistration of fNIRS data to date to image the infant LOC. We find surprising evidence that at 6 months the LOC has functional specialization that is highly similar to adults. Following Cant and Goodale (2007), we investigate whether the LOC tracks shape information and not other cues to object identity (e.g., texture/material). This finding extends evidence of LOC specialization from early childhood into infancy and earlier than developmental trajectories of high-level visual regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Understanding visual development is crucial to understanding the nature of visual representations in the human brain. Previous studies of visual development have investigated children (4 years and older) and high-level visual areas. This study expands our knowledge of visual development by investigating the functional development of mid-level vision [lateral occipital cortex (LOC)] early in infancy. We find surprisingly adult-like functional specialization of the LOC by 6 months of age: infants exhibit shape selectivity, but not object selectivity, in this region.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: BAF53b, a Neuron-Specific Nucleosome Remodeling Factor, Is Induced after Learning and Facilitates Long-Term Memory Consolidation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/13/3686?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/13/3686?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although epigenetic mechanisms of gene expression regulation have recently been implicated in memory consolidation and persistence, the role of nucleosome-remodeling is largely unexplored. Recent studies show that the functional loss of BAF53b, a postmitotic neuron-specific subunit of the BAF nucleosome-remodeling complex, results in the deficit of consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory and cocaine-associated memory in the rodent brain. However, it is unclear whether BAF53b expression is regulated during memory formation and how BAF53b regulates fear memory in the amygdala, a key brain site for fear memory encoding and storage. To address these questions, we used viral vector approaches to either decrease or increase BAF53b function specifically in the lateral amygdala of adult mice in auditory fear conditioning paradigm. Knockdown of &lt;i&gt;Baf53b&lt;/i&gt; before training disrupted long-term memory formation with no effect on short-term memory, basal synaptic transmission, and spine structures. We observed in our qPCR analysis that BAF53b was induced in the lateral amygdala neurons at the late consolidation phase after fear conditioning. Moreover, transient BAF53b overexpression led to persistently enhanced memory formation, which was accompanied by increase in thin-type spine density. Together, our results provide the evidence that BAF53b is induced after learning, and show that such increase of BAF53b level facilitates memory consolidation likely by regulating learning-related spine structural plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent works in the rodent brain begin to link nucleosome remodeling-dependent epigenetic mechanism to memory consolidation. Here we show that BAF53b, an epigenetic factor involved in nucleosome remodeling, is induced in the lateral amygdala neurons at the late phase of consolidation after fear conditioning. Using specific gene knockdown or overexpression approaches, we identify the critical role of BAF53b in the lateral amygdala neurons for memory consolidation during long-term memory formation. Our results thus provide an idea about how nucleosome remodeling can be regulated during long-term memory formation and contributes to the permanent storage of associative fear memory in the lateral amygdala, which is relevant to fear and anxiety-related mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: CREB Signaling Is Involved in Rett Syndrome Pathogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/13/3671?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rett syndrome (RTT) is a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt; gene. To facilitate the study of cellular mechanisms in human cells, we established several human stem cell lines: human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line carrying the common T158M mutation (&lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;sup&gt;T158M/T158M&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;), hESC line expressing no MECP2 (&lt;i&gt;MECP2-KO&lt;/i&gt;), congenic pair of wild-type and mutant RTT patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line carrying the V247fs mutation (V247fs-WT and V247fs-MT), and iPSC line in which the V247fs mutation was corrected by CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing (V247fs-MT-correction). Detailed analyses of forebrain neurons differentiated from these human stem cell lines revealed genotype-dependent quantitative phenotypes in neurite growth, dendritic complexity, and mitochondrial function. At the molecular level, we found a significant reduction in the level of CREB and phosphorylated CREB in forebrain neurons differentiated from &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;sup&gt;T158M/T158M&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;MECP2-KO&lt;/i&gt;, and V247fs-MT stem cell lines. Importantly, overexpression of CREB or pharmacological activation of CREB signaling in those forebrain neurons rescued the phenotypes in neurite growth, dendritic complexity, and mitochondrial function. Finally, pharmacological activation of CREB in the female &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice rescued several behavioral defects. Together, our study establishes a robust &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; platform for consistent quantitative evaluation of genotype-dependent RTT phenotypes, reveals a previously unappreciated role of CREB signaling in RTT pathogenesis, and identifies a potential therapeutic target for RTT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our study establishes a robust human stem cell-based platform for consistent quantitative evaluation of genotype-dependent Rett syndrome (RTT) phenotypes at the cellular level. By providing the first evidence that enhancing cAMP response element binding protein signaling can alleviate RTT phenotypes both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we reveal a previously unappreciated role of cAMP response element binding protein signaling in RTT pathogenesis, and identify a potential therapeutic target for RTT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Saccadic Suppression Is Embedded Within Extended Oscillatory Modulation of Sensitivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/13/3661?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/13/3661?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Action and perception are intimately coupled systems. One clear case is saccadic suppression, the reduced visibility around the time of saccades, which is important in mediating visual stability; another is the oscillatory modulation of visibility synchronized with hand action. To suppress effectively the spurious retinal motion generated by the eye movements, it is crucial that saccadic suppression and saccadic onset be temporally synchronous. However, the mechanisms that determine this temporal synchrony are unknown. We investigated the effect of saccades on contrast discrimination sensitivity over a long period stretching over &amp;gt;1 s before and after saccade execution. Human subjects made horizontal saccades at will to two stationary saccadic targets separated by 20°. At a random interval, a brief Gabor patch was displayed between the two fixations in either the upper or lower visual field and the subject had to detect its location. Strong saccadic suppression was measured between –50 and 50 ms from saccadic onset. However, the suppression was systematically embedded in a trough of oscillations of contrast sensitivity that fluctuated rhythmically in the delta range (at ~3 Hz), commencing ~1 s before saccade execution and lasting for up to 1 s after the saccade. The results show that saccadic preparation and visual sensitivity oscillations are coupled and the coupling might be instrumental in temporally aligning the initiation of the saccade with the visual suppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Saccades are known to produce a suppression of contrast sensitivity at saccadic onset and an enhancement after saccadic offset. Here, we show that these dynamics are systematically embedded in visual oscillations of contrast sensitivity that fluctuate rhythmically in the delta range (at ~3 Hz), commencing ~1 s before saccade execution and lasting for up to 1 s after the saccade. The results show that saccadic preparation and visual sensitivity oscillations are coupled and the coupling might be instrumental in aligning temporally the initiation of the saccade with the visual suppression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Orbitofrontal Neuroadaptations and Cross-Species Synaptic Biomarkers in Heavy-Drinking Macaques</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/13/3646?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairments, uncontrolled drinking, and neuropathological cortical changes characterize alcohol use disorder. Dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a critical cortical subregion that controls learning, decision-making, and prediction of reward outcomes, contributes to executive cognitive function deficits in alcoholic individuals. Electrophysiological and quantitative synaptomics techniques were used to test the hypothesis that heavy drinking produces neuroadaptations in the macaque OFC. Integrative bioinformatics and reverse genetic approaches were used to identify and validate synaptic proteins with novel links to heavy drinking in BXD mice. In drinking monkeys, evoked firing of OFC pyramidal neurons was reduced, whereas the amplitude and frequency of postsynaptic currents were enhanced compared with controls. Bath application of alcohol reduced evoked firing in neurons from control monkeys, but not drinking monkeys. Profiling of the OFC synaptome identified alcohol-sensitive proteins that control glutamate release (e.g., SV2A, synaptogyrin-1) and postsynaptic signaling (e.g., GluA1, PRRT2) with no changes in synaptic GABAergic proteins. Western blot analysis confirmed the increase in GluA1 expression in drinking monkeys. An exploratory analysis of the OFC synaptome found cross-species genetic links to alcohol intake in discrete proteins (e.g., C2CD2L, DIRAS2) that discriminated between low- and heavy-drinking monkeys. Validation studies revealed that BXD mouse strains with the &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; allele at the &lt;i&gt;C2cd2l&lt;/i&gt; interval drank less alcohol than &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; allele strains. Thus, by profiling of the OFC synaptome, we identified changes in proteins controlling glutamate release and postsynaptic signaling and discovered several proteins related to heavy drinking that have potential as novel targets for treating alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Clinical research identified cognitive deficits in alcoholic individuals as a risk factor for relapse, and alcoholic individuals display deficits on cognitive tasks that are dependent upon the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). To identify neurobiological mechanisms that underpin OFC dysfunction, this study used electrophysiology and integrative synaptomics in a translational nonhuman primate model of heavy alcohol consumption. We found adaptations in synaptic proteins that control glutamatergic signaling in chronically drinking monkeys. Our functional genomic exploratory analyses identified proteins with genetic links to alcohol and cocaine intake across mice, monkeys, and humans. Future work is necessary to determine whether targeting these novel targets reduces excessive and harmful levels of alcohol drinking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Coupled Decision Processes Update and Maintain Saccadic Priors in a Dynamic Environment</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Much of what we know about how the brain forms decisions comes from studies of saccadic eye movements. However, saccadic decisions are often studied in isolation, which limits the insights that they can provide about real-world decisions with complex interdependencies. Here, we used a serial reaction time (RT) task to show that prior expectations affect RTs via interdependent, normative decision processes that operate within and across saccades. We found that human subjects performing the task generated saccades that were governed by a rise-to-threshold decision process with a starting point that reflected expected state-dependent transition probabilities. These probabilities depended on decisions about the current state (the correct target) that, under some conditions, required the accumulation of information across saccades. Without additional feedback, this information was provided by each saccadic decision threshold, which represented the total evidence in favor of the chosen target. Therefore, the output of the within-saccade process was used, not only to generate the saccade, but also to provide input to the across-saccade process. This across-saccade process, in turn, helped to set the starting point of the next within-saccade process. These results imply a novel role for functional information-processing loops in optimizing saccade generation in dynamic environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Saccades are the rapid, ballistic eye movements that we make approximately three times every second to scan the visual scene for interesting things to look at. The apparent ease with which we produce saccades belies their computational sophistication, which can be studied quantitatively in the laboratory to provide insights into how our brain manages the interplay between sensory input and motor output. The present work is important because we show for the first time how this interplay operates both within and across saccades to ensure that these eye movements are guided effectively by learned expectations in dynamic environments. More generally, this study shows how sensory-motor decision processes, typically studied in isolation, interact via functional information-processing loops in the brain to produce complex, adaptive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Frontal-Brainstem Pathways Mediating Placebo Effects on Social Rejection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/13/3621?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Placebo treatments can strongly affect clinical outcomes, but research on how they shape other life experiences and emotional well-being is in its infancy. We used fMRI in humans to examine placebo effects on a particularly impactful life experience, social pain elicited by a recent romantic rejection. We compared these effects with placebo effects on physical (heat) pain, which are thought to depend on pathways connecting prefrontal cortex and periaqueductal gray (PAG). Placebo treatment, compared with control, reduced both social and physical pain, and increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in both modalities. Placebo further altered the relationship between affect and both dlPFC and PAG activity during social pain, and effects on behavior were mediated by a pathway connecting dlPFC to the PAG, building on recent work implicating opioidergic PAG activity in the regulation of social pain. These findings suggest that placebo treatments reduce emotional distress by altering affective representations in frontal-brainstem systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Placebo effects are improvements due to expectations and the socio-medical context in which treatment takes place. Whereas they have been extensively studied in the context of somatic conditions such as pain, much less is known of how treatment expectations shape the emotional experience of other important stressors and life events. Here, we use brain imaging to show that placebo treatment reduces the painful feelings associated with a recent romantic rejection by recruiting a prefrontal-brainstem network and by shifting the relationship between brain activity and affect. Our findings suggest that this brain network may be important for nonspecific treatment effects across a wide range of therapeutic approaches and mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is recognized as a transitional phase in the progression toward more severe forms of dementia and is an early precursor to Alzheimer's disease. Previous neuroimaging studies reveal that MCI is associated with aberrant sensory–perceptual processing in cortical brain regions subserving auditory and language function. However, whether the pathophysiology of MCI extends to speech processing before conscious awareness (brainstem) is unknown. Using a novel electrophysiological approach, we recorded both brainstem and cortical speech-evoked brain event-related potentials (ERPs) in older, hearing-matched human listeners who did and did not present with subtle cognitive impairment revealed through behavioral neuropsychological testing. We found that MCI was associated with changes in neural speech processing characterized as hypersensitivity (larger) brainstem and cortical speech encoding in MCI compared with controls in the absence of any perceptual speech deficits. Group differences also interacted with age differentially across the auditory pathway; brainstem responses became larger and cortical ERPs smaller with advancing age. Multivariate classification revealed that dual brainstem–cortical speech activity correctly identified MCI listeners with 80% accuracy, suggesting its application as a biomarker of early cognitive decline. Brainstem responses were also a more robust predictor of individuals' MCI severity than cortical activity. Our findings suggest that MCI is associated with poorer encoding and transfer of speech signals between functional levels of the auditory system and advance the pathophysiological understanding of cognitive aging by identifying subcortical deficits in auditory sensory processing mere milliseconds (&amp;lt;10 ms) after sound onset and before the emergence of perceptual speech deficits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a precursor to dementia marked by declines in communication skills. Whether MCI pathophysiology extends below cerebral cortex to affect speech processing before conscious awareness (brainstem) is unknown. By recording neuroelectric brain activity to speech from brainstem and cortex, we show that MCI hypersensitizes the normal encoding of speech information across the hearing brain. Deficient neural responses to speech (particularly those generated from the brainstem) predicted the presence of MCI with high accuracy and before behavioral deficits. Our findings advance the neurological understanding of MCI by identifying a subcortical biomarker in auditory–sensory processing before conscious awareness, which may be a precursor to declines in speech understanding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: HIV-1 Tat Primes and Activates Microglial NLRP3 Inflammasome-Mediated Neuroinflammation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/13/3599?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation associated with HIV-1 infection is a problem affecting ~50% of HIV-infected individuals. NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been implicated in HIV-induced microglial activation, but the mechanism(s) remain unclear. Because HIV-1 Transactivator of Transcription (Tat) protein continues to be present despite antiretroviral therapy and activates NF-kB, we hypothesized that Tat could prime the NLRP3 inflammasome. We found a dose- and time-dependent induction of NLRP3 expression in microglia exposed to Tat compared with control. Tat exposure also time-dependently increased the mature caspase-1 and IL-1β levels and enhanced the IL-1β secretion. These &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; findings were validated in archival brain tissues from Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV)-infected and uninfected rhesus macaques. Further validation of NLRP3 priming &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; involved administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to HIV transgenic (Tg) rats followed by assessment of IL-1β mRNA expression and inflammasome activation (ASC oligomers and mature IL-1β). Intriguingly, LPS potentiated upregulation of IL-1β mRNA and inflammasome activation in HIV-Tg rats compared with the wild-type controls. Interestingly, we found an inverse relationship in the expression of NLRP3 and its negative regulator, miR-223, suggesting a miR-223-mediated mechanism for Tat-induced NLRP3 priming. Furthermore, blockade of NLRP3 resulted in decreased IL-1β secretion. Collectively, these findings suggest a novel role of Tat in priming and activating the NLRP3 inflammasome. Therefore, NLRP3 can be envisioned as a therapeutic target for ameliorating Tat-mediated neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite successful suppression of viremia with increased longevity in the era of combined antiretroviral therapy, chronic inflammation with underlying neurocognitive impairment continues to afflict almost 50% of infected individuals. Viral, bacterial, and cellular products have all been implicated in promoting the chronic inflammation found in these individuals. Understanding the molecular mechanism(s) by which viral proteins such as HIV-1 Transactivator of Transcription (Tat) protein can activate microglia is thus of paramount importance. Herein, we demonstrate a novel role of Tat in priming and activating NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes in microglial cells and in HIV-Tg rats administered lipopolysaccharide. Targeting NLRP3 inflammasome pathway mediators could thus be developed as therapeutic interventions to alleviate or prevent neuroinflammation and subsequent cognitive impairment in HIV-positive patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Reason's Enemy Is Not Emotion: Engagement of Cognitive Control Networks Explains Biases in Gain/Loss Framing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/13/3588?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/13/3588?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the classic gain/loss framing effect, describing a gamble as a potential gain or loss biases people to make risk-averse or risk-seeking decisions, respectively. The canonical explanation for this effect is that frames differentially modulate emotional processes, which in turn leads to irrational choice behavior. Here, we evaluate the source of framing biases by integrating functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 143 human participants performing a gain/loss framing task with meta-analytic data from &amp;gt;8000 neuroimaging studies. We found that activation during choices consistent with the framing effect were most correlated with activation associated with the resting or default brain, while activation during choices inconsistent with the framing effect was most correlated with the task-engaged brain. Our findings argue against the common interpretation of gain/loss framing as a competition between emotion and control. Instead, our study indicates that this effect results from differential cognitive engagement across decision frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The biases frequently exhibited by human decision makers have often been attributed to the presence of emotion. Using a large fMRI sample and analysis of whole-brain networks defined with the meta-analytic tool Neurosynth, we find that neural activity during frame-biased decisions was more significantly associated with default behaviors (and the absence of executive control) than with emotion. These findings point to a role for neuroscience in shaping long-standing psychological theories in decision science.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Deletion of the Fractalkine Receptor, CX3CR1, Improves Endogenous Repair, Axon Sprouting, and Synaptogenesis after Spinal Cord Injury in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/13/3568?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Impaired signaling via CX3CR1, the fractalkine receptor, promotes recovery after traumatic spinal contusion injury in mice, a benefit achieved in part by reducing macrophage-mediated injury at the lesion epicenter. Here, we tested the hypothesis that CX3CR1-dependent changes in microglia and macrophage functions also will enhance neuroplasticity, at and several segments below the injury epicenter. New data show that in the presence of inflammatory stimuli, CX3CR1-deficient (CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) microglia and macrophages adopt a reparative phenotype and increase expression of genes that encode neurotrophic and gliogenic proteins. At the lesion epicenter (mid-thoracic spinal cord), the microenvironment created by CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; microglia/macrophages enhances NG2 cell responses, axon sparing, and sprouting of serotonergic axons. In lumbar spinal cord, inflammatory signaling is reduced in CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; microglia. This is associated with reduced dendritic pathology and improved axonal and synaptic plasticity on ventral horn motor neurons. Together, these data indicate that CX3CR1, a microglia-specific chemokine receptor, is a novel therapeutic target for enhancing neuroplasticity and recovery after SCI. Interventions that specifically target CX3CR1 could reduce the adverse effects of inflammation and augment activity-dependent plasticity and restoration of function. Indeed, limiting CX3CR1-dependent signaling could improve rehabilitation and spinal learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Published data show that genetic deletion of CX3CR1, a microglia-specific chemokine receptor, promotes recovery after traumatic spinal cord injury in mice, a benefit achieved in part by reducing macrophage-mediated injury at the lesion epicenter. Data in the current manuscript indicate that CX3CR1 deletion changes microglia and macrophage function, creating a tissue microenvironment that enhances endogenous repair and indices of neuroplasticity, at and several segments below the injury epicenter. Interventions that specifically target CX3CR1 might be used in the future to reduce the adverse effects of intraspinal inflammation and augment activity-dependent plasticity (e.g., rehabilitation) and restoration of function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Constant Light Desynchronizes Olfactory versus Object and Visuospatial Recognition Memory Performance</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Circadian rhythms optimize physiology and behavior to the varying demands of the 24 h day. The master circadian clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus and it regulates circadian oscillators in tissues throughout the body to prevent internal desynchrony. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that, under standard 12 h:12 h light/dark (LD) cycles, object, visuospatial, and olfactory recognition performance in C57BL/6J mice is consistently better at midday relative to midnight. However, under repeated exposure to constant light (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;LL), recognition performance becomes desynchronized, with object and visuospatial performance better at subjective midday and olfactory performance better at subjective midnight. This desynchrony in behavioral performance is mirrored by changes in expression of the canonical clock genes &lt;i&gt;Period1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Period2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Per1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt;), as well as the immediate-early gene &lt;i&gt;Fos&lt;/i&gt; in the SCN, dorsal hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. Under &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;LL, rhythmic &lt;i&gt;Per1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fos&lt;/i&gt; expression is attenuated in the SCN. In contrast, hippocampal gene expression remains rhythmic, mirroring object and visuospatial performance. Strikingly, &lt;i&gt;Per1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fos&lt;/i&gt; expression in the olfactory bulb is reversed, mirroring the inverted olfactory performance. Temporal desynchrony among these regions does not result in arrhythmicity because core body temperature and exploratory activity rhythms persist under &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;LL. Our data provide the first demonstration that abnormal lighting conditions can give rise to temporal desynchrony between autonomous circadian oscillators in different regions, with different consequences for performance across different sensory domains. Such a dispersed network of dissociable circadian oscillators may provide greater flexibility when faced with conflicting environmental signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A master circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus regulates physiology and behavior across the 24 h day by synchronizing peripheral clocks throughout the brain and body. Without the SCN, these peripheral clocks rapidly become desynchronized. Here, we provide a unique demonstration that, under lighting conditions in which the central clock in the SCN is dampened, peripheral oscillators in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb become desynchronized, along with the behavioral processes mediated by these clocks. Multiple clocks that adopt different phase relationships may enable processes occurring in different brain regions to be optimized to specific phases of the 24 h day. Moreover, such a dispersed network of dissociable circadian clocks may provide greater flexibility when faced with conflicting environmental signals (e.g., seasonal changes in photoperiod).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Novel Focal Seizure Pattern Generated in Superficial Layers of the Olfactory Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Seizure patterns identified in focal epilepsies caused by diverse etiologies are likely due to different pathogenic mechanisms. We describe here a novel, region-specific focal seizure pattern that mimics seizure activity observed in a subpopulation of patients submitted to presurgical monitoring with intracerebral electrodes. Distinctive seizure-like events (SLEs) are induced in the olfactory regions by acute treatment of both tangential brain slices and the isolated guinea pig brain with the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine. Analysis of field potentials, intracellular activities, and extracellular potassium changes demonstrates that SLEs in the piriform cortex initiate in the superficial layer 1 lacking principal neurons with an activity-dependent increase of extracellular potassium. SLE progression (but not onset) does not require the participation of synaptic transmission and is mediated by diffusion of potassium to deep cortical layers. The novel seizure pattern here described is not observed in other cortical regions; it is proposed to rely on the peculiar organization of the superficial piriform cortex layers, which are characterized by unmyelinated axons and perisynaptic astroglial envelopes. This study reveals a sequence of ictogenic events in the olfactory cortex that were never described before in other cortical structures and supports the notion that altered potassium homeostasis and unmyelinated fibers may represent a potential vehicle for focal ictogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We describe a novel seizure pattern peculiar of the olfactory cortex that resembles focal seizures with low-voltage fast activity at onset observed in humans. The findings suggest that network mechanisms responsible for seizure onset can be region specific.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Locomotion Induces Stimulus-Specific Response Enhancement in Adult Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/13/3532?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The responses of neurons in the visual cortex (V1) of adult mammals have long been thought to be stable over long periods. Here, we investigated whether repeated exposure to specific stimuli would enhance V1 visual responses in mice using intrinsic signal imaging through the intact skull and two-photon imaging of calcium signals in single neurons. Mice ran on Styrofoam balls floating on air while viewing one of three different, high-contrast visual stimuli. V1 responses to the stimuli that were viewed by the animal were specifically enhanced, while responses to other stimuli were unaffected. Similar exposure in stationary mice or in mice in which NMDA receptors were partially blocked did not significantly enhance responses. These findings indicate that stimulus-specific plasticity in the adult visual cortex depends on concurrent locomotion, presumably as a result of the high-gain state of the visual cortex induced by locomotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We report a rapid and persistent increase in visual cortical responses to visual stimuli presented during locomotion in intact mice. We first used a method that is completely noninvasive to image intrinsic signals through the intact skull. We then measured the same effects on single neurons using two-photon calcium imaging and found that the increase in response to a particular stimulus produced by locomotion depends on how well the neuron is initially driven by the stimulus. To our knowledge, this is the first time such enhancement has been described in single neurons or using noninvasive measurements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We report 2 families with undiagnosed recessive presynaptic congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). Whole exome or genome sequencing identified segregating homozygous variants in &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt;: c.51_64delAGGTGGGGGTCCCC in a Kuwaiti family and c.146G&amp;gt;C in an Israeli family. &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt; is crucial for vesicle fusion at presynaptic neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Electrodiagnostic examination showed severely low compound muscle action potentials and presynaptic impairment. We assessed the effect of the nonsense mutation on mRNA levels and evaluated the NMJ transmission in &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;lew/lew&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice, observing neurophysiological features of presynaptic impairment, similar to the patients. Taken together, our findings highlight &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt; homozygous mutations as a cause of presynaptic CMS. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Control of a hair bundle's mechanosensory function by its mechanical load. (arXiv:1703.09637v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hair cells, the sensory receptors of the internal ear, subserve different
functions in various receptor organs: they detect oscillatory stimuli in the
auditory system, but transduce constant and step stimuli in the vestibular and
lateral-line systems. We show that a hair cell's function can be controlled
experimentally by adjusting its mechanical load. By making bundles from a
single organ operate as any of four distinct types of signal detector, we
demonstrate that altering only a few key parameters can fundamentally change a
sensory cell's role. The motions of a single hair bundle can resemble those of
a bundle from the amphibian vestibular system, the reptilian auditory system,
or the mammalian auditory system, demonstrating an essential similarity of
bundles across species and receptor organs.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: LFP beta amplitude is predictive of mesoscopic spatio-temporal phase patterns. (arXiv:1703.09488v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09488</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09488</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Beta oscillations observed in motor cortical local field potentials (LFPs)
recorded on separate electrodes of a multi-electrode array have been shown to
exhibit non-zero phase shifts that organize into a planar wave propagation.
Here, we generalize this concept by introducing additional classes of patterns
that fully describe the spatial organization of beta oscillations. During a
delayed reach-to-grasp task in monkey primary motor and dorsal premotor
cortices we distinguish planar, synchronized, random, circular, and radial
phase patterns. We observe that specific patterns correlate with the beta
amplitude (envelope). In particular, wave propagation accelerates with growing
amplitude, and culminates at maximum amplitude in a synchronized pattern.
Furthermore, the occurrence probability of a particular pattern is modulated
with behavioral epochs: Planar waves and synchronized patterns are more present
during movement preparation where beta amplitudes are large, whereas random
phase patterns are dominant during movement execution where beta amplitudes are
small.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Adaptive Scales of Spatial Integration and Response Latencies in a Critically-Balanced Model of the Primary Visual Cortex. (arXiv:1703.09347v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09347</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09347</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain processes visual inputs having structure over a large range of
spatial scales. The precise mechanisms or algorithms used by the brain to
achieve this feat are largely unknown and an open problem in visual
neuroscience. In particular, the spatial extent in visual space over which
primary visual cortex (V1) performs evidence integration has been shown to
change as a function of contrast and other visual parameters, thus adapting
scale in visual space in an input-dependent manner. We demonstrate that a
simple dynamical mechanism---dynamical criticality---can simultaneously account
for the well-documented input-dependence characteristics of three properties of
V1: scales of integration in visuotopic space, extents of lateral integration
on the cortical surface, and response latencies.

	<description>A growing body of work is investigating the use of mental maps during decision-making. Here we discuss how decision-making organizes experiences according to an internal model of the current task, thereby structuring memory. Likewise, we consider how the structure of mental maps contributes to decision-making.</description>

	<description>Early sensory cortex is typically investigated in response to sensory stimulation, masking the contribution of internal signals. Recently, van Kerkoerle and colleagues reported that attention and memory signals segregate from sensory signals within specific layers of primary visual cortex, providing insight into the role of internal signals in sensory processing.</description>

	<description>Immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecules are among the most abundant proteins in vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems. Prominent family members are the neural cell adhesion molecules NCAM and L1, which were the first to be shown to be essential not only in development but also in synaptic function and as key regulators of synapse formation, synaptic activity, plasticity, and synaptic vesicle recycling at distinct developmental and activity stages. In addition to interacting with each other, adhesion molecules interact with ion channels and cytokine and neurotransmitter receptors.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Genetic variation at 16q24.2 is associated with small vessel stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24840</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24840-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful at identifying associations with stroke and stroke subtypes, but have not yet identified any associations solely with small vessel stroke (SVS). SVS comprises one quarter of all ischemic stroke and is a major manifestation of cerebral small vessel disease, the primary cause of vascular cognitive impairment. Studies across neurological traits have shown that younger-onset cases have an increased genetic burden. We leveraged this increased genetic burden by performing an age-at-onset informed GWAS meta-analysis, including a large younger-onset SVS population, to identify novel associations with stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24840-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a three-stage age-at-onset informed GWAS to identify novel genetic variants associated with stroke. On identifying a novel locus associated with SVS, we assessed its influence on other small vessel disease phenotypes, as well as on messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of nearby genes, and on DNA methylation of nearby CpG sites in whole blood and in the fetal brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24840-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified an association with SVS in 4,203 cases and 50,728 controls on chromosome 16q24.2 (odds ratio [OR; 95% confidence interval {CI}] = 1.16 [1.10–1.22]; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 3.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;). The lead single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs12445022) was also associated with cerebral white matter hyperintensities (OR [95% CI] = 1.10 [1.05–1.16]; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 5.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;; N = 3,670), but not intracerebral hemorrhage (OR [95% CI] = 0.97 [0.84–1.12]; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.71; 1,545 cases, 1,481 controls). rs12445022 is associated with mRNA expression of &lt;em&gt;ZCCHC14&lt;/em&gt; in arterial tissues (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 9.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;) and DNA methylation at probe cg16596957 in whole blood (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 5.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24840-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;16q24.2 is associated with SVS. Associations of the locus with expression of &lt;em&gt;ZCCHC14&lt;/em&gt; and DNA methylation suggest the locus acts through changes to regulatory elements.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24886-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine whether common polymorphisms in &lt;em&gt;CACNA1G, CACNA1H, CACNA1I&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;ABCB1&lt;/em&gt; are associated with differential short-term seizure outcome in childhood absence epilepsy (CAE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24886-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four hundred forty-six CAE children in a randomized double-blind trial of ethosuximide, lamotrigine, and valproate had short-term seizure outcome determined. Associations between polymorphisms (minor allele frequency ≥ 15%) in 4 genes and seizure outcomes were assessed. In vitro electrophysiology on transfected &lt;em&gt;CACNA1H&lt;/em&gt; channels determined impact of 1 variant on T-type calcium channel responsiveness to ethosuximide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24886-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighty percent (357 of 446) of subjects had informative short-term seizure status (242 seizure free, 115 not seizure free). In ethosuximide subjects, 2 polymorphisms (&lt;em&gt;CACNA1H&lt;/em&gt; rs61734410/P640L, &lt;em&gt;CACNA1I&lt;/em&gt; rs3747178) appeared more commonly among not–seizure-free participants (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.011, odds ratio [OR] = 2.63, 95% confidence limits [CL] = 1.25–5.56; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.026, OR = 2.38, 95% CL = 1.11–5.00). In lamotrigine subjects, 1 &lt;em&gt;ABCB1&lt;/em&gt; missense polymorphism (rs2032582/S893A; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.015, OR = 2.22, 95% CL = 1.16–4.17) was more common in not–seizure-free participants, and 2 &lt;em&gt;CACNA1H&lt;/em&gt; polymorphisms (rs2753326, rs2753325) were more common in seizure-free participants (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.038, OR = 0.52, 95% CL = 0.28–0.96). In valproate subjects, no common polymorphisms were associated with seizure status. In vitro electrophysiological studies showed no effect of the P640L polymorphism on channel physiology in the absence of ethosuximide. Ethosuximide's effect on rate of decay of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.2 was significantly less for P640L channel compared to wild-type channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24886-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four T-type calcium channel variants and 1 &lt;em&gt;ABCB1&lt;/em&gt; transporter variant were associated with differential drug response in CAE. The in vivo P640L variant's ethosuximide effect was confirmed by in vitro electrophysiological studies. This suggests that genetic variation plays a role in differential CAE drug response.

	<title>Neuron: Selective Entrainment of Theta Oscillations in the Dorsal Stream Causally Enhances Auditory Working Memory Performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30198-8?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30198-8?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Albouy et al. show that driving brain oscillations with rhythmic stimulation can specifically improve auditory working memory performance and modulate brain activity and connectivity patterns. These findings suggest that oscillations can serve as targets for controlled interventions into brain function.</description>

	<description>Dumitru and colleagues demonstrate that the endozepine DBI is expressed in stem cells in all neurogenic niches in the adult. The negative modulation of GABAA receptors in hippocampal stem cells translates to an expansion of the stem cell pool, providing an adaptive mechanism in response to changes in the environment.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Language functional MRI and direct cortical stimulation in epilepsy preoperative planning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24899</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24899</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24899-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presurgical language assessment can help minimize damage to eloquent cortex during resective epilepsy surgery. Two methods for presurgical language mapping are functional MRI (fMRI) and direct cortical stimulation (DCS) of implanted subdural electrodes. We compared fMRI results to DCS to help optimize noninvasive language localization and assess its validity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24899-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We studied 19 patients referred for presurgical evaluation of drug-resistant epilepsy. Patients completed four language tasks during preoperative fMRI. After subdural electrode implantation, we used DCS to localize language areas. For each stimulation site, we determined whether language positive electrode pairs intersected with significant fMRI activity clusters for language tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24899-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensitivity and specificity depended on electrode region of interest radii and statistical thresholding. For patients with at least one language positive stimulation site, an auditory description decision task provided the best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. For patients with no language positive stimulation sites, fMRI was a dependable method of excluding eloquent language processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24899-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language fMRI is an effective tool for determining language lateralization before electrode implantation and is especially useful for excluding unexpected critical language areas. It can help guide subdural electrode implantation and narrow the search for eloquent cortical areas by DCS. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Outcomes after diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment in a large autopsy series</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24903</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24903-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine clinical and neuropathological outcomes following a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24903-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data were drawn from a large autopsy series (N = 1,337) of individuals followed longitudinally from normal or MCI status to death, derived from 4 Alzheimer Disease (AD) Centers in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24903-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mean follow-up was 7.9 years. Of the 874 individuals ever diagnosed with MCI, final clinical diagnoses were varied: 39.2% died with an MCI diagnosis, 46.8% with a dementia diagnosis, and 13.9% with a diagnosis of intact cognition. The latter group had pathological features resembling those with a final clinical diagnosis of MCI. In terms of non-AD pathologies, both primary age-related tauopathy (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) and brain arteriolosclerosis pathology (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) were more severe in MCI than cognitively intact controls. Among the group that remained MCI until death, mixed AD neuropathologic changes (ADNC; ≥1 comorbid pathology) were more frequent than “pure” ADNC pathology (55% vs 22%); suspected non-Alzheimer pathology comprised the remaining 22% of cases. A majority (74%) of subjects who died with MCI were without “high”-level ADNC, Lewy body disease, or hippocampal sclerosis pathologies; this group was enriched in cerebrovascular pathologies. Subjects who died with dementia and were without severe neurodegenerative pathologies tended to have cerebrovascular pathology and carry the MCI diagnosis for a longer interval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24903-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MCI diagnosis usually was associated with comorbid neuropathologies; less than one-quarter of MCI cases showed “pure” AD at autopsy. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>In this issue of Neuron, Gantz and Bean (2017) show that the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) can directly alter the properties of native ion-channel Kv4.3 and accelerate the pacemaker activity of rodent dopamine neurons. These findings are one of the first demonstrations of postsynaptic, cell-autonomous actions of endocannabinoids in the mammalian brain.</description>

	<description>Kanter et al. show that depolarization, but not hyperpolarization, of MECII neurons produces hippocampal remapping and impairs memory. Since MEC neurons do not change firing location, these results are likely due to changes in firing rate of individual grid fields.</description>

	<description>Chow and Gu characterized the spatio-temporal development of functional blood-retinal barrier formation and demonstrated that immature vessel leakage is entirely due to bulk transcytosis and not via tight junctions. Gradual suppression of transcytosis determines functional blood-retinal barrier formation.</description>

	<description>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies in humans have shown that many behaviors engage processes that suppress excitability within the corticospinal tract. Inhibition of the motor output pathway has been extensively studied in the context of action stopping, where a planned movement needs to be abruptly aborted. Recent TMS work has also revealed markers of motor inhibition during the preparation of movement. Here, we review the evidence for motor inhibition during action stopping and action preparation, focusing on studies that have used TMS to monitor changes in the excitability of the corticospinal pathway.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Low normal CSF Aβ42 levels predict clinical progression in non-demented subjects</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We studied whether continuous lower normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid β 1-42 (≥640 pg/ml) levels related with rate of clinical progression in a sample of 393 non-demented memory clinic patients. Lower normal levels were associated with faster clinical progression and this depended on baseline cognitive status (subjective cognitive decline: HR = 0.59, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt;.05; mild cognitive impairment: HR=0.12, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt;.001), indicating that normal CSF amyloid levels do not exclude incident Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest that research on preclinical markers for Alzheimer's disease should take the continuum of CSF amyloid β 1-42 levels within the normal range into account.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Deoxycytidine and deoxythymidine treatment for thymidine kinase 2 deficiency</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24922</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Thymidine kinase 2 (TK2), a critical enzyme in the mitochondrial pyrimidine salvage pathway, is essential for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance. Mutations in the nuclear gene &lt;em&gt;TK2&lt;/em&gt; cause TK2 deficiency, which manifests predominantly in children as myopathy with mtDNA depletion. Molecular bypass therapy with the TK2 products, dCMP and dTMP, prolongs the lifespan of Tk2-deficient (Tk2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) mice by 2-3 fold. Because we observed rapid catabolism of the deoxynucleoside monophosphates to deoxythymidine (dT) and deoxycytidine (dC), we hypothesized that: 1) deoxynucleosides might be the major active agents and 2) inhibition of deoxycytidine deamination might enhance dTMP+dCMP therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: To test these hypotheses, we assessed two therapies in Tk2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice: 1) dT+dC and 2) co-administration of the deaminase inhibitor, tetrahydrouridine (THU), with dTMP+dCMP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We observed that dC+dT delayed disease onset, prolonged lifespan of Tk2-deficient mice, and restored mtDNA copy number as well as respiratory chain enzyme activities and levels. In contrast, dCMP+dTMP+THU therapy decreased lifespan of Tk2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; animals compared to dCMP+dTMP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our studies demonstrate that deoxynucleoside substrate enhancement is a novel therapy, which may ameliorate TK2 deficiency in patients.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congenital myopathies are phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous. We describe homozygous truncating mutations in &lt;em&gt;MYPN&lt;/em&gt; in 2 unrelated families with a slowly progressive congenital cap myopathy. &lt;em&gt;MYPN&lt;/em&gt; encodes the Z-line protein myopalladin implicated in sarcomere integrity. Functional experiments demonstrate that the mutations lead to mRNA defects and to a strong reduction in full-length protein expression. Myopalladin signals accumulate in the caps together with alpha-actinin. Dominant &lt;em&gt;MYPN&lt;/em&gt; mutations were previously reported in cardiomyopathies. Our data uncover that mutations in &lt;em&gt;MYPN&lt;/em&gt; cause either a cardiac or a congenital skeletal muscle disorder through different modes of inheritance.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Blood–brain barrier breakdown in reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome: Implications for pathophysiology and diagnosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24891</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24891</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24891-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is currently based on luminographic findings of vasoconstriction. In addition to vasoconstriction, the blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown has been postulated as a central mechanism of RCVS. Our aim was to document BBB breakdown in patients with RCVS and its role for the pathophysiology-based diagnosis of RCVS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24891-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We prospectively recruited 72 consecutive patients with thunderclap headache who did not have aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage from April 2015 to July 2016 at the Samsung Medical Center. Based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders–3 beta criteria and neuroimaging, patients were classified as having RCVS (n = 41; “definite” in 29 imaging-proven patients and “probable” in 12 imaging-negative patients), other secondary causes (n = 7), and thunderclap headache of undetermined cause (n = 24). BBB breakdown was evaluated using contrast-enhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

BBB breakdown was present in RCVS patients with (n = 4) and without (n = 19) concomitant posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. In patients with RCVS, the extent of BBB breakdown was independently associated with neurological complications (multivariate odds ratio = 1.48 per 1 territorial increase, 95% confidence interval = 1.04–2.12, adjusted &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.032). Three (12.5%) patients with thunderclap headache of undetermined cause were newly classified as having RCVS by the presence of BBB breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>Obesity is now a worldwide health issue. Far from being limited to weight gain, obesity is generally associated with low-grade inflammation and with a cluster of disorders collectively known as the ‘metabolic syndrome’. When considering obesity and the subsequent neuroinflammation, the focus was long set on the hypothalamus. More recently, obesity-derived neuroinflammation has been shown to affect other brain structures such as the hippocampus, cortex, brainstem, or amygdala. Furthermore, obesity has been associated with increased occurrence of central disorders such as depression and impaired cognitive function.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Monoamine Transporters as Ionotropic Receptors</title>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30023-1?rss=yes</link>
	<description>It is well established that glutamate and GABA signal through both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Conversely, it is thought that, with one exception, monoamines (dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine) signal via metabotropic receptors. Given their capacity to generate fast-acting currents, I suggest that the monoamine transporters should be considered as ionotropic receptors.</description>

&lt;p&gt;NMDA receptors are preeminent neurotransmitter-gated channels in the CNS, which respond to glutamate in a manner that integrates multiple external and internal cues. They belong to the ionotropic glutamate receptor family and fulfil unique and crucial roles in neuronal development and function. These roles depend &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern optogenetics can be tuned to evoke activity that corresponds to naturally occurring local or global activity in timing, magnitude or individual-cell patterning. This outcome has been facilitated not only by the development of core features of optogenetics over the past 10 years (microbial-opsin variants, &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Electroencephalography (EEG) has been instrumental in making discoveries about cognition, brain function, and dysfunction. However, where do EEG signals come from and what do they mean? The purpose of this paper is to argue that we know shockingly little about the answer to this question, to highlight what we do know, how important the answers are, and how modern neuroscience technologies that allow us to measure and manipulate neural circuits with high spatiotemporal accuracy might finally bring us some answers.</description>

	<description>Supported by recent human neuroimaging studies, the insula is re-emerging as an important brain area not only in the physiological understanding of the brain, but also in pathological contexts in clinical research. In this opinion article, we briefly introduce the anatomical and histological features of the human insula. We then summarize the physiological functions of the insula and underscore its pathological roles in psychiatric and neurological disorders that have long been underestimated. We finally propose possible strategies through which the role of the insula may be further understood for both basic and clinical neuroscience.</description>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30016-4?rss=yes</link>
	<description>The more advanced our understanding of the brain of an animal is, the less likely that this animal is a conscious being. This provocative logical paradox is explained and analyzed, leading to the conclusion that to advance understanding of animal consciousness it is necessary to resolve first how our consciousness is produced by our brain.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Classical synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) requires NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation, which drives AMPA receptor (AMPAR) insertion into the postsynaptic membrane. Here, activation of kainate receptors (KARs) in rat CA1 neurons triggered an increase in postsynaptic AMPAR surface expression and potentiated AMPAR-mediated CA1 excitatory postsynaptic responses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that synaptic weakening occurs during sleep to counterbalance daytime synaptic strengthening. The authors found that sleep was associated with a reduction in the level of postsynaptic AMPA receptors compared with awake periods, indicating homeostatic scaling down. The mechanism involves expression of &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specification of the motor neuron subtypes that innervate digits is not well understood. Limb-innervating motor neuron specification is influenced by retinoic acid, the synthesis of which is regulated by specific expression patterns of homeobox (HOX) transcription factors and their cofactor FOXP1 (forkhead box protein &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direction selectivity is an important part of motion detection. Direction-selective cells have been found both in the retina and in their projection target, the superior colliculus (SC), but precisely where and how direction selectivity arises is not well understood. By optogenetically manipulating specific direction-selective retinal &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In adult life, people normally know what they are doing. This experience of controlling one's own actions and, through them, the course of events in the outside world is called 'sense of agency'. It forms a central feature of human experience; however, the brain mechanisms &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CA3 region of the hippocampus is important for rapid encoding of memory. Computational theories have proposed specific roles in hippocampal function and memory for the sparse inputs from the dentate gyrus to CA3 and for the extended local recurrent connectivity that gives rise to &lt;/p&gt;
