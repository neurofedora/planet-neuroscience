Here we formulate a mechanistic mathematical model to describe the growth dynamics of &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; in the presence of the &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-lactam antibiotic meropenem. The model is mechanistic in the sense that carrying capacity is taken into account through the dynamics of nutrient availability rather than via logistic growth. In accordance with our experimental results we incorporate a sub-population of cells, differing in morphology from the normal bacillary shape of &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; bacteria, which we assume have immunity from direct antibiotic action. By fitting this model to experimental data we obtain parameter values that give insight into the growth of a bacterial population that includes different cell morphologies. The analysis of two parameters sets, that produce different long term behaviour, allows us to manipulate the system theoretically in order to explore the advantages of a shape transition that may potentially be a mechanism that allows &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; to withstand antibiotic effects. Our results suggest that inhibition of this shape transition may be detrimental to bacterial growth and thus suggest that the transition may be a defensive mechanism implemented by bacterial machinery. In addition to this we provide strong theoretical evidence for the potential therapeutic strategy of using antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in combination with meropenem. This proposed combination therapy exploits the shape transition as AMPs induce cell lysis by forming pores in the cytoplasmic membrane, which becomes exposed in the spherical cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BjL-m6ALghY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Multiscale modeling of layer formation in epidermis</title>

The mammalian skin epidermis is a stratified epithelium composed of multiple layers of epithelial cells that exist in appropriate sizes and proportions, and with distinct boundaries separating each other. How the epidermis develops from a single layer of committed precursor cells to form a complex multilayered structure of multiple cell types remains elusive. Here, we construct stochastic, three-dimensional, and multiscale models consisting of a lineage of multiple cell types to study the control of epidermal development. Symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions, stochastic cell fate transitions within the lineage, extracellular morphogens, cell-to-cell adhesion forces, and cell signaling are included in model. A GPU algorithm was developed and implemented to accelerate the simulations. These simulations show that a balance between cell proliferation and differentiation during lineage progression is crucial for the development and maintenance of the epidermal tissue. We also find that selective intercellular adhesion is critical to sharpening the boundary between layers and to the formation of a highly ordered structure. The long-range action of a morphogen provides additional feedback regulations, enhancing the robustness of overall layer formation. Our model is built upon previous experimental findings revealing the role of Ovol transcription factors in regulating epidermal development. Direct comparisons of experimental and simulation perturbations show remarkable consistency. Taken together, our results highlight the major determinants of a well-stratified epidermis: balanced proliferation and differentiation, and a combination of both short- (symmetric/asymmetric division and selective cell adhesion) and long-range (morphogen) regulations. These underlying principles have broad implications for other developmental or regenerative processes leading to the formation of multilayered tissue structures, as well as for pathological processes such as epidermal wound healing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pNAuW3tTk3A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

From gastrulation to late organogenesis animal development involves many genetic and bio-mechanical interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal tissues. Ectodermal organs, such as hairs, feathers and teeth are well studied examples of organs whose development is based on epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. These develop from a similar primordium through an epithelial folding and its interaction with the mesenchyme. Despite extensive knowledge on the molecular pathways involved, little is known about the role of bio-mechanical processes in the morphogenesis of these organs. We propose a simple computational model for the biomechanics of one such organ, the tooth, and contrast its predictions against cell-tracking experiments, mechanical relaxation experiments and the observed tooth shape changes over developmental time. We found that two biomechanical processes, differential tissue growth and differential cell adhesion, were enough, in the model, for the development of the 3D morphology of the early tooth germ. This was largely determined by the length and direction of growth of the cervical loops, lateral folds of the enamel epithelium. The formation of these cervical loops was found to require accelerated epithelial growth relative to other tissues and their direction of growth depended on specific differential adhesion between the three tooth tissues. These two processes and geometrical constraints in early tooth bud also explained the shape asymmetry between the lateral cervical loops and those forming in the anterior and posterior of the tooth. By performing mechanical perturbations &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; we inferred the distribution and direction of tensile stresses in the mesenchyme that restricted cervical loop lateral growth and forced them to grow downwards. Overall our study suggests detailed quantitative explanations for how bio-mechanical processes lead to specific morphological 3D changes over developmental time.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Zf3yG1dZ4nA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: MeCP2 Deficiency Leads to Loss of Glial Kir4.1</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder usually caused by mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). RTT is typified by apparently normal development until 6–18 mo of age, when motor and communicative skills regress and hand stereotypies, autonomic symptoms, and seizures present. Restoration of MeCP2 function selectively to astrocytes reversed several deficits in a murine model of RTT, but the mechanism of this rescue is unknown. Astrocytes carry out many essential functions required for normal brain functioning, including extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; buffering. Kir4.1, an inwardly rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel, is largely responsible for the channel-mediated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; regulation by astrocytes. Loss-of-function mutations in Kir4.1 in human patients result in a severe neurodevelopmental disorder termed EAST or SESAME syndrome. Here, we evaluated astrocytic Kir4.1 expression in a murine model of Rett syndrome. We demonstrate by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis that Kir4.1 is a direct molecular target of MeCP2. Astrocytes from &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice express significantly less Kir4.1 mRNA and protein, which translates into a &amp;gt;50% deficiency in Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive Kir4.1-mediated currents, and impaired extracellular potassium dynamics. By examining astrocytes in isolation, we demonstrate that loss of Kir4.1 is cell autonomous. Assessment through postnatal development revealed that Kir4.1 expression in &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt;-deficient animals never reaches adult, wild-type levels, consistent with a neurodevelopmental disorder. These are the first data implicating a direct MeCP2 molecular target in astrocytes and provide novel mechanistic insight explaining a potential mechanism by which astrocytic dysfunction may contribute to RTT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Uncovering the neural dynamics of facial identity processing along with its representational basis outlines a major endeavor in the study of visual processing. To this end, here, we record human electroencephalography (EEG) data associated with viewing face stimuli; then, we exploit spatiotemporal EEG information to determine the neural correlates of facial identity representations and to reconstruct the appearance of the corresponding stimuli. Our findings indicate that multiple temporal intervals support: facial identity classification, face space estimation, visual feature extraction and image reconstruction. In particular, we note that both classification and reconstruction accuracy peak in the proximity of the N170 component. Further, aggregate data from a larger interval (50–650 ms after stimulus onset) support robust reconstruction results, consistent with the availability of distinct visual information over time. Thus, theoretically, our findings shed light on the time course of face processing while, methodologically, they demonstrate the feasibility of EEG-based image reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Cytosolic ATP Relieves Voltage-Dependent Inactivation of T-Type Calcium Channels and Facilitates Excitability of Neurons in the Rat Central Medial Thalamus</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The central medial nucleus (CeM) is a part of the intralaminar thalamus, which is involved in the control of arousal and sensory processing. However, ionic conductances and mechanisms that regulate the activity of the CeM are not well studied. Here, we used &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiology in acute brain slices from adolescent rats to demonstrate that T-type calcium currents (T-currents) are prominent in the majority of the studied CeM neurons and are critical determinants of low-threshold calcium spikes (LTSs), which in turn regulate excitability of these neurons. Using an ATP-free internal solution decreased T-current density and induced a profound hyperpolarizing shift in steady-state inactivation curves while voltage-dependent activation kinetics were spared. Furthermore, selective pharmacological blockade of T-channels or use of an ATP-free solution reduced both tonic action potential (AP) frequency and rebound burst firing in CeM neurons. Our results indicate that T-channels are critical regulators of a thalamocortical circuit output and suggest that cytosolic ATP could be an endogenous regulatory mechanism in which T-channels may functionally gate sensory transmission and arousal &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Implementing Goal-Directed Foraging Decisions of a Simpler Nervous System in Simulation</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Economic decisions arise from evaluation of alternative actions in contexts of motivation and memory. In the predatory sea-slug &lt;i&gt;Pleurobranchaea&lt;/i&gt; the economic decisions of foraging are found to occur by the workings of a simple, affectively controlled homeostat with learning abilities. Here, the neuronal circuit relations for approach-avoidance choice of &lt;i&gt;Pleurobranchaea&lt;/i&gt; are expressed and tested in the foraging simulation Cyberslug™. Choice is organized around appetitive state as a moment-to-moment integration of sensation, motivation (satiation/hunger), and memory. Appetitive state controls a switch for approach vs. avoidance turn responses to sensation. Sensory stimuli are separately integrated for incentive value into appetitive state, and for prey location (stimulus place) into mapping motor response. Learning interacts with satiation to regulate prey choice affectively. The virtual predator realistically reproduces the decisions of the real one in varying circumstances and satisfies optimal foraging criteria. The basic relations are open to experimental embellishment toward enhanced neural and behavioral complexity in simulation, as was the ancestral bilaterian nervous system in evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Contemporary artificial intelligence lacks the attributes of natural intelligence, in particular the abilities to relate information affectively. Accordingly, it is notable that the most complex animal behaviors serve primitive homeostatic goals, and emerge from the primitive mechanisms generating motivation and reward learning. Here is shown in simulation the function of a basic neuronal circuit for cost-benefit decision, derived from studies of a predatory generalist, the sea-slug &lt;i&gt;Pleurobranchaea&lt;/i&gt;, and based on affective integration of information. Its simplicity may reflect distant ancestral qualities on which complexities in economic, cognitive, and social behaviors were built. The simulation validates experimental data and provides a basic module on which complexity in economic, cognitive, and social behaviors could be built.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Inhibition of a Descending Prefrontal Circuit Prevents Ketamine-Induced Stress Resilience in Females</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Stress is a potent etiological factor in the onset of major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Therefore, significant efforts have been made to identify factors that produce resilience to the outcomes of a later stressor, in hopes of preventing untoward clinical outcomes. The NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine has recently emerged as a prophylactic capable of preventing neurochemical and behavioral outcomes of a future stressor. Despite promising results of preclinical studies performed in male rats, the effects of proactive ketamine in female rats remains unknown. This is alarming given that stress-related disorders affect females at nearly twice the rate of males. Here we explore the prophylactic effects of ketamine on stress-induced anxiety-like behavior and the neural circuit-level processes that mediate these effects in female rats. Ketamine given 1 week prior to an uncontrollable stressor (inescapable tailshock, IS) reduced typical stress-induced activation of the serotonergic (5-HT) dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and eliminated DRN-dependent juvenile social exploration (JSE) deficits 24 hours after the stressor. Proactive ketamine altered prelimbic cortex (PL) neural ensembles so that a later experience with IS now activated these cells, which it ordinarily would not. Ketamine acutely activated a prelimbic cortex (PL) to DRN (PL-DRN) circuit and inhibition of this circuit with Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) at the time of IS 1 week later prevented stress prophylaxis, suggesting that persistent changes in PL-DRN circuit activity are responsible, at least in part, for mediating long term effects associated with ketamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Stress-related disorders affect females at twice the rate of males, and so identifying factors capable of producing resilience in females is critically important. Recent efforts to identify neural mechanisms underlying the prophylactic effects of ketamine on the behavioral and neural impact of a later stressor have focused solely on male rodents. Here we show that ketamine administered to female rats 1 week before an uncontrollable stressor prevents stress-induced anxiety-like behavioral effects. The mechanisms by which ketamine exerts prophylactic effects were explored, and ketamine was found to activate an inhibitory prelimbic cortex-dorsal raphe nucleus circuit and that this circuit activation is required for the stress-buffering effects of ketamine. These data provide a basis for prophylactic use of ketamine in females.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: April 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Christian R   Burgess, Yoav   Livneh, Rohan N   Ramesh, Mark L   Andermann&lt;br /&gt; Physiological need states and associated motivational drives can bias visual processing of cues that help meet these needs. Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

By probing how activity patterns in different types of neurons and circuits contribute to behavior, these tools can help inform mechanistic models of brain function and explain the roles of distinct circuit elements. However, in systems where functions are distributed over large networks, interpreting causality experiments can be challenging. Here we review common assumptions underlying circuit manipulations in behaving animals and discuss the strengths and limitations of different approaches. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

To be effective, these systems must be able to simultaneously record and stimulate neural activity, a task made difficult by persistent stimulation artifacts that distort and obscure underlying biomarkers. To enable simultaneous stimulation and recording, several techniques have been proposed. These techniques involve artifact-preventing system configurations, resilient recording front-ends, and back-end signal processing for removing recorded artifacts. Co-designing and integrating these artifact cancellation techniques will be key to enabling neuromodulation systems to stimulate and record at the same time. Here, we review the state-of-the-art for these techniques and their role in achieving artifact-free neuromodulation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Microelectrode arrays based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, such as Neuropixels probes, look set to transform these methods. Neuropixels probes provide ∼1000 recording sites on an extremely narrow shank, with on-board amplification, digitization, and multiplexing. They deliver low-noise recordings from hundreds of neurons, providing a step change in the type of data available to neuroscientists. Here we discuss the opportunities afforded by these probes for large-scale electrophysiology, the challenges associated with data processing and anatomical localization, and avenues for further improvements of the technology. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Studies have found that sensory, prefrontal, hippocampal, cerebellar, and striatal regions, as well as the circuits that connect them, are perturbed in mouse models of ASD and ID. Dissecting the disruptions in morphology and activity in these neural circuits might help us to understand the shared risk between the two disorders as well as their clinical heterogeneity. Treatments that target the balance between excitation and inhibition in these regions are able to reverse pathological phenotypes, elucidating this deficit as a commonality across models and opening new avenues for intervention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

With vast cell number and diversity, mammalian nervous systems present a daunting challenge for achieving specific and comprehensive cell type access—prerequisite to circuit analysis. Genetic approaches in the mouse have relied on germline engineering to access marker-defined cell populations. Combinatorial strategies that engage marker intersection, anatomy and projection pattern (e.g. antero-grade and retro-grade viral vectors), and developmental lineage substantially increase the specificity of cell type targeting. While increasing number of mouse cell types are becoming experimentally accessible, comprehensive coverage requires larger coordinated efforts with strategic infrastructural and fiscal planning. CRISPR-based genome editing may enable cell type access in other species, but issues of time, cost and ethics remain, especially for primates. Novel approaches that bypass the germline, such as somatic cell engineering and cell surface-based gene delivery, may reduce the barrier of genetic access to mammalian cell types. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Despite extensive characterization of individual brain areas involved in parental care, we do not fully understand how discrete aspects of this behavior are orchestrated at the neural circuit level. Recent progress in identifying genetically specified neuronal populations critical for parenting, and the use of genetic and viral tools for circuit-cracking now allow us to deconstruct the underlying circuitry and, thus, to elucidate how different aspects of parental care are controlled. Here we review the latest advances, outline possible organizational principles of parental circuits and discuss future challenges. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Designing behavioral paradigms that provide a solid foundation to ask questions about decision-making computations and mechanisms is a difficult and often underestimated challenge. Here, we propose three dimensions on which we can consider rodent decision-making tasks: ethological validity, task complexity, and stimulus-response compatibility. We review recent research through this lens, and provide practical guidance for researchers in the decision-making field. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Remyelination therapy for multiple sclerosis(MS) is a rapidly emerging research area despite the fact that only limited success has been achieved so far in clinical trials. The extracellular matrix(ECM) is significantly altered in chronic MS lesions, which is believed to be an important remyelination-inhibiting factor. However, the ECM components have not been specifically targeted in current MS remyelinating trials. Qin et al. described the role of a major ECM protein, fibronectin, in de/remyelination. Exogenous ganglioside GD1a was demonstrated to overcome the remyelination-inhibiting effects of aggregated fibronectin during later stages of oligodendrocyte maturation. Thus, GD1a could potentially be used as a novel remyelinating compound or as combination therapy in conjunction with other drugs to enhance different stages of remyelination in MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Remyelination therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS) is a rapidly emerging research area despite the fact that only limited success has been achieved so far in clinical trials.

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Greater emphasis on the study of intact cellular networks in their physiological environment has led to rapid advances in intravital imaging in the central nervous system, while the peripheral system remains largely unexplored. To assess large networks of sensory neurons we selectively label primary afferents with GCaMP6s in male and female C57bl/6 mice and visualise their functional responses to peripheral stimulation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We show that we are able to monitor the activity of hundreds of sensory neurons simultaneously, with sufficient sensitivity to detect, in most cases, single action potentials with a typical rise time of around 200 milliseconds, and an exponential decay with a time constant of approximately 700 milliseconds. With this technique we are able to characterise the responses of large populations of sensory neurones to innocuous and noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli under normal and inflammatory conditions. We demonstrate that the majority of primary afferents are polymodal with between 50-80% of thermally sensitive DRG neurons responding also to noxious mechanical stimulation. We also specifically assess the small population of peripheral cold neurons and demonstrate significant sensitisation to cooling after a model of sterile and persistent inflammation, with significantly increased sensitivity already at decreases of 5°C when compared to uninflamed responses. This not only reveals interesting new insights into the (patho)physiology of the peripheral nervous system but also demonstrates the sensitivity of this imaging technique to physiological changes in primary afferents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Most of our functional understanding of the peripheral nervous system has come from single unit recordings. However, the acquisition of such data are labor-intensive and usually ‘low yield’. Moreover, some questions are best addressed by studying populations of neurons. To this end we report on a system that monitors activity in hundreds of single sensory neurons simultaneously, with sufficient sensitivity to detect in most cases single action potentials. We use this technique to characterize response properties to natural and electrical stimuli and to demonstrate polymodality in the majority of neurons as well as their sensitization under inflammatory conditions. We therefore believe this approach will be very useful for the study of the somatosensory system in general, and pain in particular.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Collateral Projections Innervate the Mammillary Bodies and Retrosplenial Cortex: A New Category of Hippocampal Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0383-17.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;To understand the hippocampus it is necessary to understand the subiculum. Unlike other hippocampal subfields, the subiculum projects to almost all distal hippocampal targets, highlighting its critical importance for external networks. The present studies, in male rats and mice, reveal a new category of dorsal subiculum neurons that innervate both the mammillary bodies and the retrosplenial cortex. These bifurcating neurons comprise almost half of the hippocampal cells that project to retrosplenial cortex. The termination of these numerous collateral projections was visualized within the medial mammillary nucleus and the granular retrosplenial cortex (area 29). These collateral projections included subiculum efferents that cross to the contralateral mammillary bodies. Within the granular retrosplenial cortex, the collateral projections form a particularly dense plexus in deep layer II and layer III. This retrosplenial termination site co-localized with markers for VGluT2 and neurotensin. While efferents from the hippocampal CA fields standardly collateralize, subiculum projections often have only one target site. Consequently, the many collateral projections involving the retrosplenial cortex and the mammillary bodies present a relatively unusual pattern for the subiculum, which presumably relates to how both targets have complementary roles in spatial processing. Furthermore, along with the anterior thalamic nuclei, the mammillary bodies and retrosplenial cortex are key members of a memory circuit, which is usually described as both starting and finishing in the hippocampus. The present findings reveal how the hippocampus simultaneously engages different parts of this circuit, so forcing an important revision of this network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The hippocampus has both cortical and subcortical connections that are critical for spatial learning in rodents and episodic memory in humans. Chief among these connections are the dense hippocampal inputs to the retrosplenial cortex and mammillary bodies, both of which originate in the subiculum. The present experiments reveal that in rodents approximately half of these retrosplenial projections have collaterals that also innervate the mammillary bodies. Consequently, these two areas share common hippocampal information, despite playing different roles in cognition. These same collateral projections contradict longstanding ideas about extended, serial hippocampal networks for memory. As these networks are affected from the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease, when memory disorders first appear, there is added significance in understanding their precise connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Losing Control in Social Situations: how the Presence of Others Affects Neural Processes Related to Sense of Agency</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Social contexts substantially influence individual behaviour, but little is known about how they affect cognitive processes related to voluntary action. Previously it has been shown that social context reduces participants’ sense of agency over the outcomes of their actions and outcome monitoring. In this fMRI study on human volunteers, we investigated the neural mechanisms by which social context alters sense of agency. Participants made costly actions to stop inflating a balloon before it burst. On ‘social’ trials, another player could act in their stead, but we analysed only trials where the other player remained passive. We hypothesized that mentalizing processes during social trials would affect decision-making fluency and lead to a decrease sense of agency. In line with this hypothesis, we found increased activity in bilateral temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), precuneus and middle frontal gyrus during social trials, compared to non-social trials. Activity in the precuneus was, in turn, negatively related to sense of agency at single-trial level. We further found a double dissociation between TPJ and angular gyrus (AG): activity in the left AG was not sensitive to social context, but was negatively related to sense of agency. In contrast, activity in the TPJ was modulated by social context, but was not sensitive to sense of agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The presence of other people can have substantial influence on how individuals act. Understanding the cognitive and neural processes underlying such behavioural changes would allow for better prediction of social context effects on individual actions, and ultimately support the development of optimized learning environments and interventions aimed at improving social behavior. The work presented here on the neural processes underlying social context effects on sense of agency is an important contribution to research on human cognition, voluntary action and social psychology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The same concept can mean different things or be instantiated in different
forms depending on context, suggesting a degree of flexibility within the
conceptual system. We propose that a compositional network model can be used to
capture and predict this flexibility. We modeled individual concepts (e.g.,
BANANA, BOTTLE) as graph-theoretical networks, in which properties (e.g.,
YELLOW, SWEET) were represented as nodes and their associations as edges. In
this framework, networks capture the within-concept statistics that reflect how
properties correlate with each other across instances of a concept. We ran a
classification analysis using the Graph Fourier Transform technique to validate
these models, and find that these models can successfully discriminate between
object concepts. We then computed formal measures from these concept networks
and explored their relationship to conceptual structure. We find that diversity
coefficients and core-periphery structure can be interpreted as network-based
measures of conceptual flexibility and stability, respectively. These results
support the feasibility of a concept network framework and highlight its
ability to formally capture important characteristics of the conceptual system.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Task errors contribute to implicit remapping in sensorimotor adaptation</title>

	<description>Perturbations of sensory feedback can evoke sensory prediction errors (discrepancies between predicted and actual sensory outcomes of movements), and reward prediction errors (discrepancies between predicted rewards and actual rewards). Sensory prediction errors result in obligatory remapping of the relationship between motor commands and predicted sensory outcomes. The role of reward prediction errors in sensorimotor adaptation tasks is less clear. Assuming that successfully accomplishing our task goals is intrinsically rewarding, a failure to hit targets during target-reaching should result in negative reward prediction errors in sensorimotor adaptation. When moving towards a target, we expect to obtain the reward of hitting the target, and so we experience a reward prediction error if the perturbation causes us to miss it. These discrepancies between desired task outcomes and actual task outcomes, or task errors, are thought to drive the use of strategic processes to restore success, although their role is not fully understood. Here, we investigated the role of task errors in sensorimotor adaptation: during target-reaching, we either removed task errors by moving the target mid-movement to align with cursor feedback of hand position, or enforced task error by moving the target away from the cursor feedback of hand position. Removing task errors not only reduced the rate and extent of adaptation during exposure to the perturbation, but also reduced the amount of post-adaptation implicit remapping. Hence, task errors contribute to implicit remapping resulting from sensory prediction errors. This suggests that the system which implicitly acquires new sensorimotor maps via exposure to sensory prediction errors is also sensitive to reward prediction errors.</description>

	<description>Cannabinoids can cross the placenta, thus may interfere with fetal endocannabinoid signaling during neurodevelopment, causing long-lasting deficits. Despite increasing cannabis consumption during pregnancy, the protracted consequences of prenatal cannabinoid exposure (PCE) remain incompletely understood. Here we report sex-specific differences in behavioral and neuronal deficits in the adult progeny of rat dams exposed to low doses of cannabinoids during gestation. In males, PCE reduced social interaction, ablated endocannabinoid long-term depression (LTD) and heightened excitability of prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons, while females were spared. Group 1 mGluR and endocannabinoid signaling regulate emotional behavior and synaptic plasticity. Notably, sex-differences following PCE included levels of mGluR1/5 and TRPV1R mRNA. Finally, positive allosteric modulation of mGlu5 and enhancement of anandamide levels restored LTD and social interaction in PCE adult males. Together, these results highlight marked sexual differences in the effects of PCE and introduce strategies for reversing detrimental effects of PCE.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: On variational solutions for whole brain serial-section histology using the computational anatomy random orbit model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/271692v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>This paper presents a variational framework for dense diffeomorphic atlas-mapping onto high-throughput histology stacks at the 20 um meso-scale. The observed sections are modelled as Gaussian random fields conditioned on a sequence of unknown section by section rigid motions and unknown diffeomorphic transformation of a three-dimensional atlas. To regularize over the high-dimensionality of our parameter space (which is a product space of the rigid motion dimensions and the diffeomorphism dimensions), the histology stacks are modelled as arising from a first order Sobolev space smoothness prior. We show that the joint maximum a-posteriori, penalized-likelihood estimator of our high dimensional parameter space emerges as a joint optimization interleaving rigid motion estimation for histology restacking and large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping to atlas coordinates. We show that joint optimization in this parameter space solves the classical curvature non-identifiability of the histology stacking problem. The algorithms are demonstrated on a collection of whole-brain histological image stacks from the Mouse Brain Architecture Project.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dbx1 pre-Bötzinger complex interneurons comprise the core inspiratory oscillator for breathing in adult mice</title>

	<description>The brainstem pre-Botzinger complex (preBotC) generates inspiratory breathing rhythms, but which neurons comprise its rhythmogenic core? Dbx1-derived neurons may play the preeminent role in rhythm generation, an idea well founded at perinatal stages of development but not in adulthood. We expressed archaerhodopsin or channelrhodopsin in Dbx1 preBotC neurons in intact adult mice to interrogate their function. Prolonged photoinhibition slowed down or stopped breathing, whereas prolonged photostimulation sped up breathing. Brief inspiratory-phase photoinhibition evoked the next breath earlier than expected, whereas brief expiratory-phase photoinhibition delayed the subsequent breath. Conversely, brief inspiratory-phase photostimulation increased inspiratory duration and delayed the subsequent breath, whereas brief expiratory-phase photostimulation evoked the next breath earlier than expected. Because they govern the frequency and precise timing of breaths in awake adult mice with sensorimotor feedback intact, Dbx1 preBotC neurons constitute an essential core component of the inspiratory oscillator, knowledge directly relevant to human health and physiology.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Generating perfusion maps from structural optical coherence tomography with artificial intelligence</title>

	<description>Despite significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI) for computer vision, its application in medical imaging has been limited by the burden and limits of expert-generated labels. We used images from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), a relatively new imaging modality that measures perfusion of the retinal vasculature, to train an AI algorithm to generate vasculature maps from standard structural optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of the same retinae, both exceeding the ability and bypassing the need for expert labeling. Deep learning was able to infer perfusion of microvasculature from structural OCT images with similar fidelity to OCTA and significantly better than expert clinicians (P &amp;lt; 0.00001). OCTA suffers from need of specialized hardware, laborious acquisition protocols, and motion artifacts; whereas our model works directly from standard OCT which are ubiquitous and quick to obtain, and allows unlocking of large volumes of previously collected standard OCT data both in existing clinical trials and clinical practice. This finding demonstrates a novel application of AI to medical imaging, whereby subtle regularities between different modalities are used to image the same body part and AI is used to generate detailed and accurate inferences of tissue function from structure imaging.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Systematic differences between visually-relevant global and local image statistics of brain MRI and natural scenes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/271338v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>An important heuristic in developing image processing technologies is to mimic the computational strategies used by humans. Relevant to this, recent studies have shown that the human brain's processing strategy is closely matched to the characteristics of natural scenes, both in terms of global and local image statistics. However, structural MRI images and natural scenes have fundamental differences: the former are two-dimensional sections through a volume, the latter are projections. MRI image formation is also radically different from natural image formation, involving acquisition in Fourier space, followed by several filtering and processing steps that all have the potential to alter image statistics. As a consequence, aspects of the human visual system that are finely-tuned to processing natural scenes may not be equally well-suited for MRI images, and identification of the differences between MRI images and natural scenes may lead to improved machine analysis of MRI. With these considerations in mind, we analyzed spectra and local image statistics of MRI images in several databases including T1 and FLAIR sequence types and of simulated MRI images, and compared this analysis to a parallel analysis of natural images and visual sensitivity. We found substantial differences between the statistical features of MRI images and natural images. Power spectra of MRI images had a steeper slope than that of natural images, indicating a lack of scale invariance. Independent of this, local image statistics of MRI and natural images differed: compared to natural images, MRI images had smaller variations in their local two-point statistics and larger variations in their local three-point statistics, to which the human visual system is relatively insensitive. Our findings were consistent across MRI databases and simulated MRI images, suggesting that they result from brain geometry at the scale of MRI resolution, rather than characteristics of specific imaging and reconstruction methods.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Top-down inputs drive neuronal network rewiring and context-enhanced sensory processing in olfaction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/271197v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/271197v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Much of the computational power of the mammalian brain arises from its extensive top-down projections. To enable neuron-specific information processing these projections have to be precisely targeted. How such a specific connectivity emerges and what functions it supports is still poorly understood. We addressed these questions in silico in the context of the profound structural plasticity of the olfactory system. At the core of this plasticity are the granule cells of the olfactory bulb, which integrate bottom-up sensory inputs and top-down inputs delivered by vast top-down projections from cortical and other brain areas. We developed a biophysically supported computational model for the rewiring of the top-down projections and the intra-bulbar network via adult neurogenesis. The model captures various previous physiological and behavioral observations and makes specific predictions for the cortico-bulbar network connectivity that is learned by odor exposure and environmental contexts. Specifically, it predicts that after learning the granule-cell receptive fields with respect to sensory and with respect to cortical inputs are highly correlated. This enables cortical cells that respond to a learned odor to enact disynaptic inhibitory control specifically of bulbar principal cells that respond to that odor. Functionally, the model predicts context-enhanced stimulus discrimination in cluttered environments ('olfactory cocktail parties') and the ability of the system to adapt to its tasks by rapidly switching between different odor-processing modes. These predictions are experimentally testable. At the same time they provide guidance for future experiments aimed at unraveling the cortico-bulbar connectivity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Interhemispheric Integration for Complex Behaviors, Absent the Corpus Callosum in Normal Ontogeny</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/271072v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/271072v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Functional homotopy, or synchronous spontaneous activity between symmetric, contralateral brain regions, is a fundamental characteristic of the mammalian brain's functional architecture(1-6). In mammals, functional homotopy may be predominantly mediated by the corpus callosum (CC), a white matter structure thought to balance the interhemispheric coordination and hemispheric specialization critical for many complex brain functions, including lateralized human language abilities(7, 8). The CC first emerged with the Eutherian (placental) mammals ~160 MYA and is not found in other vertebrates(9, 10). Despite this, other vertebrates also exhibit complex brain functions requiring bilateral integration and lateralization(11). For example, much as humans acquire speech, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) songbird learns to sing from tutors and must balance hemispheric specialization(12) with interhemispheric coordination to successfully learn and produce song(13). We therefore tested whether the zebra finch brain also exhibits functional homotopy despite lacking the CC. Implementing custom resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) functional connectivity (FC) analyses, we demonstrate widespread functional homotopy between pairs of contralateral brain regions required for learned song but which lack direct anatomical projections (i.e., structural connectivity; SC). We believe this is the first demonstration of functional homotopy in a non-Eutherian vertebrate; however, it is unlikely to be the only instance of it. The remarkable congruence between functional homotopy in the zebra finch and Eutherian brains indicates that alternative mechanisms must exist for balanced interhemispheric coordination in the absence of a CC. This insight may have broad implications for understanding complex, bilateral neural processing across phylogeny and how information is integrated between hemispheres.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Confidence as a diagnostic tool for perceptual aftereffects</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/270280v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/270280v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Much of what we know about how our sensory systems operate comes from studying aftereffects. Prolonged and repeated exposure to a constant stimulus (adaptation) can impact responses to subsequent test stimuli, compared to a non-adapted test stimulus. Researchers often infer, based on changes to response patterns, that sensory encoding has been changed by adaptation. However, it can be ambiguous whether a given aftereffect changes sensory encoding, decision processes, or both. We propose that confidence estimates can be used as a diagnostic tool to identify whether aftereffects arise either partially or entirely from post-perceptual processes. In three experiments, we demonstrate the utility of confidence judgements in determining whether an aftereffect results from sensory or criterion changes. Given the simplicity of our approach, this tool could readily be applied to resolve contemporary controversies regarding the origins of aftereffects and the penetration of perception by cognition.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Serial Dependence in Position Perception Occurs at the Time of Perception</title>

	<description>Observers perceive objects in the world as stable over space and time, even though the visual experience of those objects is often discontinuous and distorted due to masking, occlusion, camouflage, noise, etc. How are we able to easily and quickly achieve stable perception in spite of this constantly changing visual input? It was previously shown that observers experience serial dependence in the perception of features and objects, an effect that extends up to 15 seconds back in time. Here, we asked whether the visual system utilizes an object's prior physical location to inform future position assignments in order to maximize location stability of an object over time. To test this, we presented subjects with small targets at random angular locations relative to central fixation in the peripheral visual field. Subjects reported the perceived location of the target on each trial by adjusting a cursor's position to match its location. Subjects made consistent errors when reporting the perceived position of the target on the current trial, mislocalizing it toward the position of the target in the preceding two trials (Experiment 1). This pull in position perception occurred even when a response was not required on the previous trial (Experiment 2). In addition, we show that serial dependence in perceived position occurs immediately after stimulus presentation, and is a fast stabilization mechanism that does not require a delay (Experiment 3). This indicates that serial dependence occurs for position representations and facilitates the stable perception of objects in space. Taken together with previous work, our results show that serial dependence occurs at many stages of visual processing, from initial position assignment to object categorization.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Nicotinic cholinergic receptors in VTA glutamate neurons modulate excitatory transmission</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/271205v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Ventral tegmental area (VTA) glutamate neurons are important components of brain reward circuitry, but whether they are subject to cholinergic modulation is unknown. To study this, we used an array of molecular, physiological, and photostimulation techniques to examine nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in VTA glutamate neurons. VTA neurons positive for the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2+) are responsive to acetylcholine (ACh) released from mesopontine cholinergic axons. VTA VGLUT2+ neurons express mRNA and protein subunits known to comprise typical heteromeric nAChRs. Electrophysiology, coupled with 2-photon microscopy and laser flash photolysis of a photoactivatable nicotine probe, was used to demonstrate nAChR functional activity in the somatodendritic subcellular compartment of VTA VGLUT2+ neurons. Finally, optogenetic isolation of intrinsic VTA glutamatergic microcircuits demonstrated that nicotine potently modulates excitatory transmission within the VTA. These results indicate that VTA glutamate neurons are modulated by cholinergic mechanisms and participate in the cascade of physiological responses to nicotine exposure.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dynamic interplay of innate and adaptive immunity during sterile retinal inflammation: Insights from the transcriptome</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/267757v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The pathogenesis of many retinal degenerations, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is punctuated by an ill-defined network of sterile inflammatory responses. The delineation of innate and adaptive immune milieu amongst the broad leukocyte infiltrate, and the gene networks which construct these responses, are poorly described in the eye. Using photo-oxidative damage in a rodent model of subretinal inflammation, we employed a novel RNA-sequencing framework to map the global gene network signature of retinal leukocytes. This revealed a previously uncharted interplay of adaptive immunity during subretinal inflammation, including prolonged enrichment of myeloid and lymphocyte migration, antigen presentation, and the alternative arm of the complement cascade involving Factor B. We demonstrate Factor B-deficient mice are protected against macrophage infiltration and subretinal inflammation. Suppressing the drivers of retinal leukocyte proliferation, or their capacity to elicit complement responses, may help preserve retinal structure and function during sterile inflammation in diseases such as AMD.</description>

Over long timescales, neuronal dynamics can be robust to quite large perturbations, such as changes in white matter connectivity and grey matter structure through processes including learning, aging, development and certain disease processes. One possible explanation is that robust dynamics are facilitated by homeostatic mechanisms that can dynamically rebalance brain networks. In this study, we simulate a cortical brain network using the Wilson-Cowan neural mass model with conduction delays and noise, and use inhibitory synaptic plasticity (ISP) to dynamically achieve a spatially local balance between excitation and inhibition. Using MEG data from 55 subjects we find that ISP enables us to simultaneously achieve high correlation with multiple measures of functional connectivity, including amplitude envelope correlation and phase locking. Further, we find that ISP successfully achieves local E/I balance, and can consistently predict the functional connectivity computed from real MEG data, for a much wider range of model parameters than is possible with a model without ISP.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mQ67YVpwOP4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Many multicellular systems problems can only be understood by studying how cells move, grow, divide, interact, and die. Tissue-scale dynamics emerge from systems of many interacting cells as they respond to and influence their microenvironment. The ideal “virtual laboratory” for such multicellular systems simulates both the biochemical microenvironment (the “stage”) and many mechanically and biochemically interacting cells (the “players” upon the stage). PhysiCell—physics-based multicellular simulator—is an open source agent-based simulator that provides both the stage and the players for studying many interacting cells in dynamic tissue microenvironments. It builds upon a multi-substrate biotransport solver to link cell phenotype to multiple diffusing substrates and signaling factors. It includes biologically-driven sub-models for cell cycling, apoptosis, necrosis, solid and fluid volume changes, mechanics, and motility “out of the box.” The C++ code has minimal dependencies, making it simple to maintain and deploy across platforms. PhysiCell has been parallelized with OpenMP, and its performance scales linearly with the number of cells. Simulations up to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells are feasible on quad-core desktop workstations; larger simulations are attainable on single HPC compute nodes. We demonstrate PhysiCell by simulating the impact of necrotic core biomechanics, 3-D geometry, and stochasticity on the dynamics of hanging drop tumor spheroids and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. We demonstrate stochastic motility, chemical and contact-based interaction of multiple cell types, and the extensibility of PhysiCell with examples in synthetic multicellular systems (a “cellular cargo delivery” system, with application to anti-cancer treatments), cancer heterogeneity, and cancer immunology. PhysiCell is a powerful multicellular systems simulator that will be continually improved with new capabilities and performance improvements. It also represents a significant independent code base for replicating results from other simulation platforms. The PhysiCell source code, examples, documentation, and support are available under the BSD license at http://PhysiCell.MathCancer.org and http://PhysiCell.sf.net.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ta9GZSoWLAs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Systems-level computational modeling demonstrates fuel selection switching in high capacity running and low capacity running rats</title>

High capacity and low capacity running rats, HCR and LCR respectively, have been bred to represent two extremes of running endurance and have recently demonstrated disparities in fuel usage during transient aerobic exercise. HCR rats can maintain fatty acid (FA) utilization throughout the course of transient aerobic exercise whereas LCR rats rely predominantly on glucose utilization. We hypothesized that the difference between HCR and LCR fuel utilization could be explained by a difference in mitochondrial density. To test this hypothesis and to investigate mechanisms of fuel selection, we used a constraint-based kinetic analysis of whole-body metabolism to analyze transient exercise data from these rats. Our model analysis used a thermodynamically constrained kinetic framework that accounts for glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and mitochondrial FA transport and oxidation. The model can effectively match the observed relative rates of oxidation of glucose versus FA, as a function of ATP demand. In searching for the minimal differences required to explain metabolic function in HCR versus LCR rats, it was determined that the whole-body metabolic phenotype of LCR, compared to the HCR, could be explained by a ~50% reduction in total mitochondrial activity with an additional 5-fold reduction in mitochondrial FA transport activity. Finally, we postulate that over sustained periods of exercise that LCR can partly overcome the initial deficit in FA catabolic activity by upregulating FA transport and/or oxidation processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jtybMRRdUC8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The standard state space model is widely believed to account for the
cerebellar computation in motor adaptation tasks [1]. Here we show that several
recent experiments [2-4] where the visual feedback is irrelevant to the motor
response challenge the standard model. Furthermore, we propose a new model that
accounts for the the results presented in [2-4]. According to this new model,
learning and forgetting are coupled and are error size dependent. We also show
that under reasonable assumptions, our proposed model is the only model that
accounts for both the classical adaptation paradigm as well as the recent
experiments [2-4].

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Adversarial Examples that Fool both Human and Computer Vision. (arXiv:1802.08195v1 [cs.LG])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples: small changes
to images can cause computer vision models to make mistakes such as identifying
a school bus as an ostrich. However, it is still an open question whether
humans are prone to similar mistakes. Here, we create the first adversarial
examples designed to fool humans, by leveraging recent techniques that transfer
adversarial examples from computer vision models with known parameters and
architecture to other models with unknown parameters and architecture, and by
modifying models to more closely match the initial processing of the human
visual system. We find that adversarial examples that strongly transfer across
computer vision models influence the classifications made by time-limited human
observers.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural networks modularity is a major challenge for the development of
control circuits of neural activity. Under physiological limitations, the
accessible regions for external stimulation are possibly different from the
functionally relevant ones, requiring complex indirect control designs.
Moreover, control over one region might affect activity of other downstream
networks, once sparse connections exist. We address these questions by
developing a hybrid device of a cortical culture functionally integrated with a
biomimetic hardware neural network. This design enables the study of modular
networks controllability, while connectivity is well-defined and key features
of cortical networks are accessible. Using a closed-loop control to monitor the
activity of the coupled hybrid, we show that both modules are congruently
modified, in the macroscopic as well as the microscopic activity levels.
Control impacts efficiently the activity on both sides whether the control
circuit is an indirect series one, or implemented independently only on one of
the modules. Hence, these results present global functional impacts of a local
control intervention. Overall, this strategy provides an experimental access to
the controllability of neural activity irregularities, when embedded in a
modular organization.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Terminal Arbors of Callosal Axons Undergo Plastic Changes in Early-Amputated Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Sensory information is processed in specific brain regions, and shared between the cerebral hemispheres by axons that cross the midline through the corpus callosum. However, sensory deprivation usually causes sensory losses and/or functional changes. This is the case of people who suffered limb amputation and show changes of body map organization within the somatosensory cortex (S1) of the deafferented cerebral hemisphere (contralateral to the amputated limb), as well as in the afferented hemisphere (ipsilateral to the amputated limb). Although several studies have approached these functional changes, the possible finer morphological alterations, such as those occurring in callosal axons, still remain unknown. The present work combined histochemistry, single-axon tracing and 3D microscopy to analyze the fine morphological changes that occur in callosal axons of the forepaw representation in early amputated rats. We showed that the forepaw representation in S1 was reduced in the deafferented hemisphere and expanded in the afferented side. Accordingly, after amputation, callosal axons originating from the deafferented cortex undergo an expansion of their terminal arbors with increased number of terminal boutons within the homotopic representation at the afferented cerebral hemisphere. Similar microscale structural changes may underpin the macroscale morphological and functional phenomena that characterize limb amputation in humans.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a form of activity-dependent remodeling of synaptic strength that underlies memory formation. Despite its key role in dictating learning rules in the brain circuits, the molecular mechanisms mediating STDP are still poorly understood. Here, we show that spike timing-dependent long-term depression (tLTD) and A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents are modulated by pharmacological agents affecting the levels of active glycogen-synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and by GSK3β knockdown in layer 2/3 of the mouse somatosensory cortex. Moreover, the blockade of A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents mimics the effects of GSK3 up-regulation on tLTD and occludes further changes in synaptic strength. Pharmacological, immunohistochemical and biochemical experiments revealed that GSK3β influence over tLTD induction is mediated by direct phosphorylation at Ser-616 of the Kv4.2 subunit, a molecular determinant of A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents. Collectively, these results identify the functional interaction between GSK3β and Kv4.2 channel as a novel mechanism for tLTD modulation providing exciting insight into the understanding of GSK3β role in synaptic plasticity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Low-Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound Attenuates LPS-Induced Neuroinflammation and Memory Impairment by Modulation of TLR4/NF-κB Signaling and CREB/BDNF Expression</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The purpose of this study was to investigate the restorative role of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation and memory impairments in a simulation of Alzheimer’s disease. Mice subjected to LPS administration (250 μg/kg, i.p.) were treated with LIPUS daily for 7 days. The levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and inflammatory markers were estimated in brain tissue using western blot. After LIPUS treatment, the neuroprotective effects of LIPUS in mice were assessed by behavioral tests. LPS plus LIPUS-treated mice exhibited a significant increase in the average time spent in the target quadrant compared to the LPS-treated group. Compared with the LPS-treated group, LPS plus LIPUS-treated mice revealed a preference for the novel object. LIPUS treatment significantly attenuated LPS-induced increases in the expression of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the hippocampus region of LPS-treated mice. Furthermore, LIPUS significantly reduced the protein levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the mice brain induced by LPS. LIPUS treatment induces neuroprotection by inhibiting the LPS-induced activation of TLR4/NF-κB inflammatory signaling and by enhancing the associated CREB/BDNF expression in LPS-treated mice. Our data showed that LIPUS attenuated LPS-induced memory impairment as well as amyloidogenesis via the suppression of neuroinflammatory activity and BDNF decline.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Preterm Birth Changes Networks of Newborn Cortical Activity</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Preterm birth is the greatest risk factor for lifelong neurocognitive deficits, globally. The effect of prematurity on early cortical network function has, however, remained poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel methodology that allows reliable assessment of functional connectivity in neonatal brain activity at millisecond and multisecond scales in terms of cortical phase and amplitude correlations, respectively. We measured scalp electroencephalography at term-equivalent age in infants exposed to very early prematurity as well as in healthy controls. We found that newborn cortical activity organizes into multiplex networks that differ significantly between vigilance states. As compared with healthy control infants, prematurity was found to cause frequency-specific patterns of dysconnectivity in cortical network, changes that were distinct for networks of phase and amplitude correlations. Neuroanatomically, the most prominent markers of prematurity were found in connections involving the frontal regions. Phase synchrony in frontally connected networks was correlated with newborn neurological performance, suggesting the first measure of cortical functional coupling that correlates with neurological performance in human infant.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Enhancer RNAs are necessary and sufficient for activity-dependent neuronal gene transcription</title>

	<description>Distal enhancer elements in DNA enable higher-order chromatin interactions that facilitate gene expression programs and thus contribute to cellular phenotype and function. In the brain, enhancer-promoter interactions help to ensure cell- and tissue-specific gene expression profiles, defining which genes are active during neuronal specification and which genes remain accessible in adult neurons. In addition to their close links to gene activation, enhancer elements themselves are subject to widespread, bidirectional transcription that yield non-coding enhancer RNA (eRNA). However, although eRNAs are correlated with overall enhancer activity, the precise function of eRNAs remains controversial. Here, we examined the function of eRNAs arising from multiple enhancers near the well-characterized immediate early gene Fos (also known as c-Fos). We show that eRNA transcription from Fos enhancers is dynamically modulated by various forms of neuronal activity, requires RNA polymerase II, and precedes activity-dependent induction of Fos mRNA. Visualization of Fos eRNA transcripts on a single cell level using single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed localization within the cell nucleus. Anti-sense based Fos eRNA knockdown decreased Fos mRNA expression, whereas mRNA knockdown did not affect eRNA levels. Targeted stimulation of eRNA synthesis from Fos enhancers using CRISPR-dCas9 fusion proteins produced corresponding increases in Fos mRNA expression, with limited cross-talk between enhancers. Similarly, CRISPR-targeted delivery of eRNA to a Fos enhancer elevated mRNA induction following neuronal depolarization. Finally, we show that anti-sense based knockdown of a single Fos eRNA is sufficient to alter neuronal physiology. Together, these results suggest that RNAs transcribed from neuronal enhancers are important regulators of enhancer-driven gene regulatory programs and neuronal function.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Brainstem control of urethral sphincter relaxation and scent marking behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/270801v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Urination may occur either reflexively in response to a full bladder or deliberately irrespective of immediate need. Voluntary control is desired because it ensures that waste is expelled when consciously desired and socially appropriate. Urine release requires two primary components: bladder pressure and urethral relaxation. Although the bladder contracts during urination, its slow smooth muscle is not under direct voluntary control and its contraction alone is not sufficient for voiding. The decisive action of urination is at the urethral sphincter, where striated muscle permits fast control. This sphincter is normally constricted, but relaxes to enable urine flow. Barringtons nucleus (Bar, or pontine micturition center) in the brainstem is known to be essential for the switch from urine storage to elimination, and a subset of Bar neurons expressing corticotropin releasing hormone (BarCRH) have recently been shown to promote bladder contraction. However, Bar neurons that relax the urethral sphincter to enable urination behavior have not been identified. Here we describe novel brainstem neurons that control the external urethral sphincter. We find that scent marking behavior in male mice depends upon a subpopulation of spatially clustered Bar neurons that express high levels of estrogen receptor 1 (BarESR1). These neurons are glutamatergic, project to urinary nuclei in the spinal cord with a bias towards sphincter-inhibiting interneurons, and their activity correlates with natural urination. Optogenetic stimulation of BarESR1 neurons rapidly initiates sphincter bursting and efficient voiding in absence of sensory cues in anesthetized and behaving animals. Conversely, inhibiting the activity of these neurons prevents olfactory cues from promoting scent marking behavior. The identification of BarESR1 cells provides an expanded model for the supraspinal control of urination and its dysfunction.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Amplification and Suppression of Distinct Brain-wide Activity Patterns by Catecholamines</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/270645v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The widely projecting catecholaminergic (norepinephrine and dopamine) neurotransmitter systems profoundly shape the state of neuronal networks in the forebrain. Current models posit that the effects of catecholaminergic modulation on network dynamics are homogenous across the brain. However, the brain is equipped with a variety of catecholamine receptors with distinct functional effects and heterogeneous density across brain regions. Consequently, catecholaminergic effects on brain-wide network dynamics might be more spatially specific than assumed. We tested this idea through the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements performed in humans at 'rest' under pharmacological (atomoxetine-induced) elevation of catecholamine levels. We used a linear decomposition technique to identify spatial patterns of correlated fMRI signal fluctuations that were either increased or decreased by atomoxetine. This yielded two distinct spatial patterns, each expressing reliable and specific drug effects. The spatial structure of both fluctuation patterns resembled the spatial distribution of the expression of catecholamine receptor genes: adrenergic alpha1-receptors (for the fluctuation pattern: placebo &amp;gt; atomoxetine), dopaminergic 'D2-like' receptors (pattern: atomoxetine &amp;gt; placebo), and adrenergic beta-receptors (for both patterns, with correlations of opposite sign). We conclude that catecholaminergic effects on the forebrain are spatially more structured than traditionally assumed and at least in part explained by the heterogeneous distribution of various catecholamine receptors. Our findings link catecholaminergic effects on large-scale brain networks to low-level characteristics of the underlying neurotransmitter systems. They also provide key constraints for the development of realistic models of neuromodulatory effects on large-scale brain network dynamics.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Muscarinic M1 receptor modulation of synaptic plasticity in nucleus accumbens of wild-type and fragile X mice</title>

	<description>We investigated how metabotropic Acetylcholine receptors control excitatory synaptic plasticity in the mouse nucleus accumbens core. Pharmacological and genetic approaches revealed that M1 mAChRs trigger multiple and interacting forms of synaptic plasticity. As previously described in the dorsal striatum, moderate pharmacological activation of M1 mAChR potentiated postsynaptic NMDARs. The M1-potentiation of NMDAR masked a previously unknown coincident TRPV1-mediated long-term depression (LTD). In addition, strong pharmacological activation of M1 mAChR induced canonical retrograde LTD, mediated by presynaptic CB1R. In the fmr1-/y mouse model of Fragile X, we found that CB1R but not TRPV1 M1-LTD was impaired. Finally, pharmacological blockade of the degradation of anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol, the two principal eCBs restored fmr1-/y LTD to wild type levels. These findings shed new lights on the complex influence of Acetylcholine on excitatory synapses in the nucleus accumbens core and identify new substrates of the synaptic deficits of Fragile X.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Does impedance matter when recording spikes with polytrodes?</title>

	<description>Extracellular microelectrodes have been widely used to measure brain activity, yet there are still basic questions about the requirements for a good extracellular microelectrode. One common source of confusion is how an electrode's impedance affects the amplitude of extracellular spikes and background noise. Here we discuss how an electrode's impedance affects data quality in extracellular recordings, which is crucial for both the detection of spikes and their assignment to the correct neurons. This study employs commercial polytrodes containing 32 electrodes (177 m2) arranged in a dense array. This allowed us to directly compare, side-by-side, the same extracellular signals measured by modified low impedance (~100 kOhm) microelectrodes with unmodified high impedance (~1 MOhm) microelectrodes. We begin with an evaluation of existing protocols to lower the impedance of the electrodes. The poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT-PSS) electrodeposition protocol is a simple, stable, and reliable method for decreasing the impedance of a microelectrode up to tenfold. We next record in vivo using polytrodes that are modified in a 'chess board' pattern, such that the signal of one neuron is detected by multiple coated and non-coated electrodes. The performance of the coated and non-coated electrodes is then compared on measures of background noise and amplitude of the detected action potentials. If the proper recording system is used, then the impedance of a microelectrode within the range of standard polytrodes (~ 0.1 to 2 MOhm) does not significantly affect data quality and spike sorting. This study should encourage neuroscientists to stop worrying about one more unknown.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Huge intrinsic correlation between developmental prosopagnosia questionnaires: A comment on Shah et al. (2015)</title>

	<description>This paper complements the 20-item prosopagnosia index (PI20), which is a self-report measure of developmental prosopagnosia (DP) developed by Shah et al. (2015, R. Soc. Open. Sci. 2, 150305. [doi: 10.1098/rsos.140343]). Although they validated PI20 in several ways and it can serve as a quick and cost-effective measure for estimating DP risk, they did not formally evaluate its validity against a pre-existing alternative questionnaire (Kennerknecht et al., Am. J. Med. Genet. A 146A, 2863-2870. [doi: 10.1002/ajmg.a.32552]). Thus, we administered the questionnaires to a large population (N = 855) and found a very strong correlation (r = 0.82 [95% confidence interval: 0.80, 0.84]), a principal component that accounted for more than 90% of the variance, and comparable reliability between the questionnaires. These results suggest unidimensionality and equivalence between the two questionnaires, or at least, a very strong common latent factor underlying them.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Association between expression of random gene sets and survival is evident in multiple cancer types and may be explained by sub-classification</title>

One of the goals of cancer research is to identify a set of genes that cause or control disease progression. However, although multiple such gene sets were published, these are usually in very poor agreement with each other, and very few of the genes proved to be functional therapeutic targets. Furthermore, recent findings from a breast cancer gene-expression cohort showed that sets of genes selected randomly can be used to predict survival with a much higher probability than expected. These results imply that many of the genes identified in breast cancer gene expression analysis may not be causal of cancer progression, even though they can still be highly predictive of prognosis. We performed a similar analysis on all the cancer types available in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), namely, estimating the predictive power of random gene sets for survival. Our work shows that most cancer types exhibit the property that random selections of genes are more predictive of survival than expected. In contrast to previous work, this property is not removed by using a proliferation signature, which implies that proliferation may not always be the confounder that drives this property. We suggest one possible solution in the form of data-driven sub-classification to reduce this property significantly. Our results suggest that the predictive power of random gene sets may be used to identify the existence of sub-classes in the data, and thus may allow better understanding of patient stratification. Furthermore, by reducing the observed bias this may allow more direct identification of biologically relevant, and potentially causal, genes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gtOsLoPmiak&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) control cellular function and decision making during tissue development and homeostasis. Mathematical tools based on dynamical systems theory are often used to model these networks, but the size and complexity of these models mean that their behaviour is not always intuitive and the underlying mechanisms can be difficult to decipher. For this reason, methods that simplify and aid exploration of complex networks are necessary. To this end we develop a broadly applicable form of the Zwanzig-Mori projection. By first converting a thermodynamic state ensemble model of gene regulation into mass action reactions we derive a general method that produces a set of time evolution equations for a subset of components of a network. The influence of the rest of the network, the bulk, is captured by memory functions that describe how the subnetwork reacts to its own past state via components in the bulk. These memory functions provide probes of near-steady state dynamics, revealing information not easily accessible otherwise. We illustrate the method on a simple cross-repressive transcriptional motif to show that memory functions not only simplify the analysis of the subnetwork but also have a natural interpretation. We then apply the approach to a GRN from the vertebrate neural tube, a well characterised developmental transcriptional network composed of four interacting transcription factors. The memory functions reveal the function of specific links within the neural tube network and identify features of the regulatory structure that specifically increase the robustness of the network to initial conditions. Taken together, the study provides evidence that Zwanzig-Mori projections offer powerful and effective tools for simplifying and exploring the behaviour of GRNs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JzP6-9Uz0N0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sulcal Polymorphisms of the IFC and ACC Contribute to Inhibitory Control Variability in Children and Adults</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory control (IC) is a core executive function that enables humans to resist habits, temptations or distractions. IC efficiency in childhood is a strong predictor of academic and professional success later in life. Based on analysis of the sulcal pattern, a qualitative feature of cortex anatomy determined during fetal life and stable during development, we searched for evidence that inter-individual differences in IC partly trace back to prenatal processes. Using anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (aMRI), we analyzed the sulcal pattern of two key regions of the IC neural network, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the inferior frontal cortex (IFC), which limits the inferior frontal gyrus. We found that the sulcal pattern asymmetry of both the ACC and IFC contributes to IC (Stroop score) in children and adults: participants with asymmetrical ACC or IFC sulcal patterns had better IC efficiency than participants with symmetrical ACC or IFC sulcal patterns. Such additive effects of IFC and ACC sulcal patterns on IC efficiency suggest that distinct early neurodevelopmental mechanisms targeting different brain regions likely contribute to IC efficiency. This view shares some analogies with the ‘common variant – small effect’ model in genetics, which states that frequent genetic polymorphisms have small effects but collectively account for a large portion of the variance. Similarly, each sulcal polymorphism has a small but additive effect: IFC and ACC sulcal patterns respectively explained 3% and 14% of the variance of the Stroop interference scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Inhibitory control (IC) is a cognitive function that plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of several psychiatric conditions and in academic and professional success. Using anatomic magnetic resonance imaging (aMRI) of healthy children and adults, we found that IC efficiency is constrained by the morphology (sulcal pattern) of two key regions of the neural network underlying IC. Because the sulcal pattern is a morphologic feature of cortical anatomy that is determined during fetal life and stable during development, our findings provide evidence that interindividual differences in IC partly trace back to prenatal processes and that distinct early neurodevelopmental mechanisms targeting different brain regions likely contribute to IC efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwannomatosis and neurofibromatosis type 2 are hereditary tumor syndromes and peripheral neuropathy has been reported in both. We prospectively applied &lt;em&gt;in-vivo&lt;/em&gt; morphometric measurement of dorsal root ganglia volume in 16 schwannomatosis, 14 neurofibromatosis type 2 patients, and 26 healthy controls by MR-Neurography. Compared to healthy controls, dorsal root ganglia hypertrophy was a consistent finding in neurofibromatosis type 2 (L3: +267%, L4: +235%, L5: +241%, S1: +300% and S2: +242%, Bonferroni-adjusted p&amp;lt;0.001) but not in schwannomatosis. Dorsal root ganglia may be a vulnerable site in origination of areflexia and sensory loss and a useful diagnostic marker in neurofibromatosis type 2. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Continual Lifelong Learning with Neural Networks: A Review. (arXiv:1802.07569v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07569</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07569</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans and animals have the ability to continually acquire and fine-tune
knowledge throughout their lifespan. This ability is mediated by a rich set of
neurocognitive functions that together contribute to the early development and
experience-driven specialization of our sensorimotor skills. Consequently, the
ability to learn from continuous streams of information is crucial for
computational learning systems and autonomous agents (inter)acting in the real
world. However, continual lifelong learning remains a long-standing challenge
for machine learning and neural network models since the incremental
acquisition of new skills from non-stationary data distributions generally
leads to catastrophic forgetting or interference. This limitation represents a
major drawback also for state-of-the-art deep neural network models that
typically learn representations from stationary batches of training data, thus
without accounting for situations in which the number of tasks is not known a
priori and the information becomes incrementally available over time. In this
review, we critically summarize the main challenges linked to continual
lifelong learning for artificial learning systems and compare existing neural
network approaches that alleviate, to different extents, catastrophic
interference. Although significant advances have been made in domain-specific
continual lifelong learning with neural networks, extensive research efforts
are required for the development of general-purpose artificial intelligence and
autonomous agents. We discuss well-established research and recent
methodological trends motivated by experimentally observed lifelong learning
factors in biological systems. Such factors include principles of neurosynaptic
stability-plasticity, critical developmental stages, intrinsically motivated
exploration, transfer learning, and crossmodal integration.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fast Nonconvex Deconvolution of Calcium Imaging Data. (arXiv:1802.07380v1 [stat.ME])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07380</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07380</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Calcium imaging data promises to transform the field of neuroscience by
making it possible to record from large populations of neurons simultaneously.
However, determining the exact moment in time at which a neuron spikes, from a
calcium imaging data set, amounts to a non-trivial deconvolution problem which
is of critical importance for downstream analyses. While a number of
formulations have been proposed for this task in the recent literature, in this
paper we focus on a formulation recently proposed in Jewell and Witten (2017)
which has shown initial promising results. However, this proposal is slow to
run on fluorescence traces of hundreds of thousands of timesteps.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we develop a much faster online algorithm for solving the optimization
problem of Jewell and Witten (2017) that can be used to deconvolve a
fluorescence trace of 100,000 timesteps in less than a second. Furthermore,
this algorithm overcomes a technical challenge of Jewell and Witten (2017) by
avoiding the occurrence of so-called &quot;negative&quot; spikes. We demonstrate that
this algorithm has superior performance relative to existing methods for spike
deconvolution on calcium imaging datasets that were recently released as part
of the spikefinder challenge (&lt;a href=&quot;http://spikefinder.codeneuro.org/&quot;&gt;this http URL&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our C++ implementation, along with R and python wrappers, is publicly
available on Github at https://github.com/jewellsean/FastLZeroSpikeInference.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Subset of Cortical Layer 6b Neurons Selectively Innervates Higher Order Thalamic Nuclei in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy036</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy036/4897996?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The thalamus receives input from 3 distinct cortical layers, but input from only 2 of these has been well characterized. We therefore investigated whether the third input, derived from layer 6b, is more similar to the projections from layer 6a or layer 5. We studied the projections of a restricted population of deep layer 6 cells (“layer 6b cells”) taking advantage of the transgenic mouse Tg(Drd1a-cre)FK164Gsat/Mmucd (Drd1a-Cre), that selectively expresses Cre-recombinase in a subpopulation of layer 6b neurons across the entire cortical mantle. At P8, 18% of layer 6b neurons are labeled with Drd1a-Cre::tdTomato in somatosensory cortex (SS), and some co-express known layer 6b markers. Using Cre-dependent viral tracing, we identified topographical projections to higher order thalamic nuclei. VGluT1+ synapses formed by labeled layer 6b projections were found in posterior thalamic nucleus (Po) but not in the (pre)thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). The lack of TRN collaterals was confirmed with single-cell tracing from SS. Transmission electron microscopy comparison of terminal varicosities from layer 5 and layer 6b axons in Po showed that L6b varicosities are markedly smaller and simpler than the majority from L5. Our results suggest that L6b projections to the thalamus are distinct from both L5 and L6a projections.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Directed Interaction Between Monkey Premotor and Posterior Parietal Cortex During Motor-Goal Retrieval from Working Memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy035</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy035/4897995?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Goal-directed behavior requires cognitive control of action, putatively by means of frontal-lobe impact on posterior brain areas. We investigated frontoparietal directed interaction (DI) in monkeys during memory-guided rule-based reaches, to test if DI supports motor-goal selection or working memory (WM) processes. We computed DI between the parietal reach region (PRR) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) with a Granger-causality measure of intracortical local field potentials (LFP). LFP mostly in the beta (12–32 Hz) and low-frequency (f≤10Hz) ranges contributed to DI. During movement withholding, beta-band activity in PRR had a Granger-causal effect on PMd independent of WM content. Complementary, low-frequency PMd activity had a transient Granger-causing effect on PRR specifically during WM retrieval of spatial motor goals, while no DI was associated with preliminary motor-goal selection. Our results support the idea that premotor and posterior parietal cortices interact functionally to achieve cognitive control during goal-directed behavior, in particular, that frontal-to-parietal interaction occurs during retrieval of motor-goal information from spatial WM.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Inhibitory and late errors in the antisaccade task: Influence of task design</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/270165v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/270165v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In the antisaccade task, participants are instructed to saccade in the opposite direction of a peripheral visual cue (PVC). Interestingly, several psychiatric disorders are associated with increased error rates in this paradigm. Despite this observation, there is no consensus about the mechanism behind antisaccade errors: while often explained as inhibition failures, some studies have suggested that errors are caused by deficits in the ability to initiate voluntary saccades. Using a computational model, we recently showed that under some conditions high latency errors can be explained by a race process between voluntary pro- and antisaccades. A limitation of our findings is that in our previous experiment the PVC signaled the trial type (pro- or antisaccade), whereas in most studies, subjects are informed about the trial type before the PVC is presented. We refer to these task designs as asynchronous (AC) and synchronous cues (SC) conditions. Here, we investigated to which extent differences in design affect the type and frequency of errors in the antisaccade task. Twenty-four subjects participated in mixed blocks of pro- and antisaccade trials in both conditions. Our results demonstrate that antisaccade error rates were highly correlated across conditions and a non-negligible fraction of them were classified as late errors in both conditions. In summary, our findings indicate that errors in the AC task are the result of both inhibition failures and voluntary action initiation.</description>

	<description>Motor behaviour is most efficiently controlled by only correcting disturbances or deviations that influence task success. It has been proposed that such sophisticated control is computed within a transcortical feedback pathway. Here we show that even the fastest spinal feedback pathway can produce corrective responses that adhere to this control scheme. We first applied small mechanical perturbations that flexed the elbow joint - stretching the triceps muscle - and simultaneously flexed or extended the wrist joint, displacing the hand various distances away from a central target. We then changed the arm's orientation and applied the same joint perturbations, which reversed the mapping between joint motion and hand displacement. In all cases, we found that the triceps' spinal stretch reflex was tuned to the hand's displacement relative to the target, and not how the triceps muscle was stretched. Our findings reveal that the fastest spinal feedback pathway is capable of integrating and modulating feedback from multiple muscles to produce efficient corrective responses, forcing a re-evaluation of the how the nervous system derives the sophisticated control laws that support natural motor behaviour.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Seizures and disturbed brain potassium dynamics in the leukodystrophy MLC</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Loss of function of the astrocyte-specific protein MLC1 leads to the childhood onset leukodystrophy “megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts” (MLC). Studies on isolated cells show a role for MLC1 in astrocyte volume regulation and suggest that disturbed brain ion and water homeostasis is central to the disease. Excitability of neuronal networks is particularly sensitive to ion and water homeostasis. In line with this, reports of seizures and epilepsy in MLC patients exist. However, systematic assessment and mechanistic understanding of seizures in MLC are lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We analyzed an MLC patient inventory to study occurrence of seizures in MLC. We used two distinct genetic mouse models of MLC to further study epileptiform activity and seizure threshold through wireless extracellular field potential recordings. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive electrode recordings in mouse brain slices were used to explore the underlying mechanisms of epilepsy in MLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: An early onset of seizures is common in MLC. Similarly, in MLC mice we uncovered spontaneous epileptiform brain activity and a lowered threshold for induced seizures. At the cellular level, we found that although passive and active properties of individual pyramidal neurons are unchanged, extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics and neuronal network activity are abnormal in MLC mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Disturbed astrocyte regulation of ion and water homeostasis in MLC causes hyperexcitability of neuronal networks and seizures. These findings suggest a role for defective astrocyte volume regulation in epilepsy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Voltage-gated sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) channels underlie action potential generation and propagation and hence are central to the regulation of excitability in the nervous system. Mutations in the genes &lt;em&gt;SCN1A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;SCN2A&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;SCN8A&lt;/em&gt;, encoding the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel pore-forming (α) subunits Nav1.1, 1.2, and 1.6, respectively, and &lt;em&gt;SCN1B&lt;/em&gt;, encoding the accessory subunit β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, are established causes of genetic epilepsies. &lt;em&gt;SCN3A&lt;/em&gt;, encoding Nav1.3, is known to be highly expressed in brain, but has not previously been linked to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy. Here, we describe a cohort of four patients with epileptic encephalopathy and heterozygous &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; missense variants in &lt;em&gt;SCN3A&lt;/em&gt; (p.Ile875Thr in two cases, p.Pro1333Leu, and p.Val1769Ala).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: All patients presented with treatment-resistant epilepsy in the first year of life, severe to profound intellectual disability, and, in two cases (both with the variant p.Ile875Thr), diffuse polymicrogyria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Electrophysiological recordings of mutant channels revealed prominent gain of channel function, with a markedly increased amplitude of the slowly inactivating current component, and, for two of three mutants (p.Ile875Thr and p.Pro1333Leu), a left-shift in the voltage dependence of activation to more hyperpolarized potentials. Gain of function was not observed for Nav1.3 variants known or presumed to be inherited (p.Arg1642Cys and p.Lys1799Gln). The anti-seizure medications phenytoin and lacosamide selectively blocked slowly inactivating over transient current in wild-type and mutant Nav1.3 channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: These findings establish &lt;em&gt;SCN3A&lt;/em&gt; as a new gene for infantile epileptic encephalopathy and suggest a potential pharmacologic intervention. These findings also reinforce the role of Nav1.3 as an important regulator of neuronal excitability in the developing brain while providing additional insight into mechanisms of slow inactivation of Nav1.3.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Memory Complaints, Dementia, and Neuropathology in Older Blacks and Whites</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To determine relationships of memory complaints to cognitive function and decline, incident dementia, and neurodegenerative and other neuropathologies, as well as the population-attributable risk for dementia in older black and white persons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: 4015 community-based persons (28% black; 74% women; mean baseline age 78 years), were enrolled in one of four longitudinal cohort studies, and another 2937 in a population-based cohort. Memory scores, assessed using two questions (5-point Likert scales) were categorized as complaints present or absent. Global cognition and five cognitive domains were derived from annual neuropsychological tests. Dementia was assessed from these tests and additional data. Neuropathologic data were available for 1350 deceased with brain autopsies. Regression and mixed effects models were used to examine relationships of memory complaints to cognition and neuropathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Baseline memory complaints (n=1310; 33% of 4015) were associated with lower cognition and faster decline in all domains (global score estimate = -0.032 [SE=0.004], &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), during a mean follow-up of 6 (SD=2) years. Persons with memory complaints had higher dementia risk (HR=1.64; 95%CI: 1.42-1.89) and odds of pathologic Alzheimer's disease (OR=1.96; 95%CI: 1.51-2.54), neocortical Lewy bodies (OR=2.47, 95%CI: 1.54-3.96), and other neurodegenerative pathologies. Results for dementia risk were similar among blacks and whites. Among 2937 older persons in a population-based cohort with similar data, the population-attributable risk for incident dementia due to memory complaints was 14.0% (95%CI: 2.6-23.0), and did not vary between the black and white groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Memory complaints are common in older black and white persons, and relate to cognitive decline, dementia risk, and neurodegenerative pathologies.

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Optogenetic Activation of Non-Nociceptive A{beta} Fibers Induces Neuropathic Pain-Like Sensory and Emotional Behaviors after Nerve Injury in Rats</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Neuropathic pain is caused by peripheral nerve injury (PNI). One hallmark symptom is allodynia (pain caused by normally innocuous stimuli), but its mechanistic underpinning remains elusive. Notably, whether selective stimulation of non-nociceptive primary afferent Aβ fibers indeed evokes neuropathic pain-like sensory and emotional behaviors after PNI is unknown, because of the lack of tools to manipulate Aβ fiber function in awake, freely moving animals. In this study, we used a transgenic rat line that enables stimulation of non-nociceptive Aβ fibers by a light-activated channel (channelrhodopsin-2; ChR2). We found that illuminating light to the plantar skin of these rats with PNI elicited pain-like withdrawal behaviors that were resistant to morphine. Light illumination to the skin of PNI rats increased the number of spinal dorsal horn (SDH) Lamina I neurons positive to activity markers (c-Fos and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; pERK). Whole-cell recording revealed that optogenetic Aβ fiber stimulation after PNI caused excitation of Lamina I neurons, which were normally silent by this stimulation. Moreover, illuminating the hindpaw of PNI rats resulted in activation of central amygdaloid neurons and produced an aversion to illumination. Thus, these findings provide the first evidence that optogenetic activation of primary afferent Aβ fibers in PNI rats produces excitation of Lamina I neurons and neuropathic pain-like behaviors that were resistant to morphine treatment. This approach may provide a new path for investigating circuits and behaviors of Aβ fiber-mediated neuropathic allodynia with sensory and emotional aspects after PNI and for discovering novel drugs to treat neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Short-Term Depression of Axonal Spikes at the Mouse Hippocampal Mossy Fibers and Sodium Channel-Dependent Modulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0415-17.2018?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Axonal spike is an important upstream process of transmitter release, which directly impacts on release probability from the presynaptic terminals. Despite the functional significance, possible activity-dependent modulation of axonal spikes has not been studied extensively, partly due to inaccessibility of the small structures of axons for electrophysiological recordings. In this study, we tested the possibility of use-dependent changes in axonal spikes at the hippocampal mossy fibers, where direct recordings from the axon terminals are readily feasible. Hippocampal slices were made from mice of either sex, and loose-patch clamp recordings were obtained from the visually identified giant mossy fiber boutons located in the stratum lucidum of the CA3 region. Stimulation of the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus elicited axonal spikes at the single bouton which occurred in all or none fashion. Unexpected from the digital nature of spike signaling, the peak amplitude of the second spikes in response to paired stimuli at a 50-ms interval was slightly but reproducibly smaller than the first spikes. Repetitive stimuli at 20 or 100 Hz also caused progressive use-dependent depression during the train. Notably, veratridine, an inhibitor of inactivation of sodium channels, significantly accelerated the depression with minimal effect on the initial spikes. These results suggest that sodium channels contribute to use-dependent depression of axonal spikes at the hippocampal mossy fibers, possibly by shaping the afterdepolarization (ADP) following axonal spikes. Prolonged depolarization during ADP may inactivate a fraction of sodium channels and thereby suppresses the subsequent spikes at the hippocampal mossy fibers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Danger Changes the Way the Mammalian Brain Stores Information About Innocuous Events: A Study of Sensory Preconditioning in Rats</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The amygdala is a critical substrate for learning about cues that signal danger. Less is known about its role in processing innocuous or background information. The present study addressed this question using a sensory preconditioning protocol in male rats. In each experiment, rats were exposed to pairings of two innocuous stimuli in stage 1, S2 and S1, and then to pairings of S1 and shock in stage 2. As a consequence of this training, control rats displayed defensive reactions (freezing) when tested with both S2 and S1. The freezing to S2 is a product of two associations formed in training: an S2-S1 association in stage 1 and an S1-shock association in stage 2. We examined the roles of two medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures in consolidation of the S2-S1 association: the perirhinal cortex (PRh) and basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA). When the S2-S1 association formed in a safe context, its consolidation required neuronal activity in the PRh (but not BLA), including activation of AMPA receptors and MAPK signaling. In contrast, when the S2-S1 association formed in a dangerous context, or when the context was rendered dangerous immediately after the association had formed, its consolidation required neuronal activity in the BLA (but not PRh), including activation of AMPA receptors and MAPK signaling. These roles of the PRh and BLA show that danger changes the way the mammalian brain stores information about innocuous events. They are discussed with respect to danger-induced changes in stimulus processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;GCaMP is an optogenetic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor widely used for monitoring neuronal activities but the precise physiological implications of GCaMP signals remain to be further delineated among functionally distinct synapses. The &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a powerful genetic system for studying synaptic function and plasticity, consists of tonic and phasic glutamatergic and modulatory aminergic motor terminals of distinct properties. We report a first simultaneous imaging and electric recording study to directly contrast the frequency characteristics of GCaMP signals of the three synapses for physiological implications. Different GCaMP variants were applied in genetic and pharmacological perturbation experiments to examine the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and clearance processes underlying the GCaMP signal. Distinct mutational and drug effects on GCaMP signals indicate differential roles of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, encoded by genes including &lt;i&gt;paralytic&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;Shaker&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Sh&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;Shab&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;ether-a-go-go&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;eag&lt;/i&gt;), in excitability control of different motor terminals. Moreover, the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; handling properties reflected by the characteristic frequency dependence of the synaptic GCaMP signals were determined to a large extent by differential capacity of mitochondria-powered Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; clearance mechanisms. Simultaneous focal recordings of synaptic activities further revealed that GCaMPs were ineffective in tracking the rapid dynamics of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx that triggers transmitter release, especially during low-frequency activities, but more adequately reflected cytosolic residual Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; accumulation, a major factor governing activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. These results highlight the vast range of GCaMP response patterns in functionally distinct synaptic types and provide relevant information for establishing basic guidelines for the physiological interpretations of presynaptic GCaMP signals from in situ imaging studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Specific Relationship between the Shape of the Readiness Potential, Subjective Decision Time, and Waiting Time Predicted by an Accumulator Model with Temporally Autocorrelated Input Noise</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Self-initiated movements are reliably preceded by a gradual buildup of neuronal activity known as the readiness potential (RP). Recent evidence suggests that the RP may reflect subthreshold stochastic fluctuations in neural activity that can be modeled as a process of accumulation to bound. One element of accumulator models that has been largely overlooked in the literature is the stochastic term, which is traditionally modeled as Gaussian white noise. While there may be practical reasons for this choice, we have long known that noise in neural systems is not white – it is long-term correlated with spectral density of the form 1/&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt;(with roughly 1 &amp;lt; β &amp;lt; 3) across a broad range of spatial scales. I explored the behavior of a leaky stochastic accumulator when the noise over which it accumulates is temporally autocorrelated. I also allowed for the possibility that the RP, as measured at the scalp, might reflect the input to the accumulator (i.e., its stochastic noise component) rather than its output. These two premises led to two novel predictions that I empirically confirmed on behavioral and electroencephalography data from human subjects performing a self-initiated movement task. In addition to generating these two predictions, the model also suggested biologically plausible levels of autocorrelation, consistent with the degree of autocorrelation in our empirical data and in prior reports. These results expose new perspectives for accumulator models by suggesting that the spectral properties of the stochastic input should be allowed to vary, consistent with the nature of biological neural noise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Working memory (WM) is an important cognitive domain for everyday life functioning and is often disturbed in neuropsychiatric disorders. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in humans show that distributed brain areas typically described as fronto-parietal regions are implicated in WM tasks. Based on data from a large sample of healthy young adults (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 1369), we applied independent component analysis (ICA) to the WM-fMRI signal and identified two distinct networks that were relevant for differences in individual WM task performance. A parietally-centered network was particularly relevant for individual differences in task measures related to WM performance (&quot;WM dependent&quot;) and a frontally-centered network was relevant for differences in attention-dependent task performance. Importantly, frontal areas that are typically considered as key regions for WM were either involved in both WM-dependent and attention-dependent performance, or in attention-dependent performance only. The networks identified here are provided as publicly available datasets. These networks can be applied in future studies to derive a low-dimensional representation of the overall WM brain activation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) induces plasticity in normal and abnormal neural circuitries, an effect that may be influenced by intrinsic brain activity during treatment. Here, we study potential synergistic effects between low-intensity rTMS (LI-rTMS) and concurrent neural activity in promoting circuit reorganization and enhancing visual behavior. We used ephrin-A2A5&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, which are known to possess visuotopic mapping errors that are ameliorated by LI-rTMS, and assessed the impact of stimulation when mice were engaged in a visual learning task. A detachable coil was affixed to each mouse, and animals underwent 2 wk of 10-min daily training in a two-choice visual discrimination task with concurrent LI-rTMS or sham stimulation. No-task controls (+LI-rTMS/sham) were placed in the task arena without visual task training. At the end of the experiment, visuomotor tracking behavior was assessed, and corticotectal and geniculocortical pathway organization was mapped by injections of fluorescent tracers into the primary visual cortex. Consistent with previous results, LI-rTMS alone improved geniculocortical and corticotectal topography, but combining LI-rTMS with the visual learning task prevented beneficial corticotectal reorganization and had no additional effect on geniculocortical topography or visuomotor tracking performance. Unexpectedly, there was a significant increase in the total number of trials completed by task + LI-rTMS mice in the visual learning task. Comparison with wild-type mice revealed that ephrin-A2A5&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice had reduced accuracy and response rates, suggesting a goal-directed behavioral deficit, which was improved by LI-rTMS. Our results suggest that concurrent brain activity during behavior interacts with LI-rTMS, altering behavior and different visual circuits in an abnormal system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Sequences Flanking the Gephyrin-Binding Site of GlyR{beta} Tune Receptor Stabilization at Synapses</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of synaptic transmission is determined by the number of neurotransmitter receptors at synapses. Their recruitment depends upon the availability of postsynaptic scaffolding molecules that interact with specific binding sequences of the receptor. At inhibitory synapses, gephyrin is the major scaffold protein that mediates the accumulation of heteromeric glycine receptors (GlyRs) via the cytoplasmic loop in the β-subunit (β-loop). This binding involves high- and low-affinity interactions, but the molecular mechanism of this bimodal binding and its implication in GlyR stabilization at synapses remain unknown. We have approached this question using a combination of quantitative biochemical tools and high-density single molecule tracking in cultured rat spinal cord neurons. The high-affinity binding site could be identified and was shown to rely on the formation of a 3&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;-helix C-terminal to the β-loop core gephyrin-binding motif. This site plays a structural role in shaping the core motif and represents the major contributor to the synaptic confinement of GlyRs by gephyrin. The N-terminal flanking sequence promotes lower affinity interactions by occupying newly identified binding sites on gephyrin. Despite its low affinity, this binding site plays a modulatory role in tuning the mobility of the receptor. Together, the GlyR β-loop sequences flanking the core-binding site differentially regulate the affinity of the receptor for gephyrin and its trapping at synapses. Our experimental approach thus bridges the gap between thermodynamic aspects of receptor-scaffold interactions and functional receptor stabilization at synapses in living cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine has been suggested to be crucially involved in effort-related choices. Key findings are that dopamine depletion (i) changed preference for a high-cost, large-reward option to a low-cost, small-reward option, (ii) but not when the large-reward option was also low-cost or the small-reward option gave no reward, (iii) while increasing the latency in all the cases but only transiently, and (iv) that antagonism of either dopamine D1 or D2 receptors also specifically impaired selection of the high-cost, large-reward option. The underlying neural circuit mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that findings i–iii can be explained by the dopaminergic representation of temporal-difference reward-prediction error (TD-RPE), whose mechanisms have now become clarified, if (1) the synaptic strengths storing the values of actions mildly decay in time and (2) the obtained-reward-representing excitatory input to dopamine neurons increases after dopamine depletion. The former is potentially caused by background neural activity–induced weak synaptic plasticity, and the latter is assumed to occur through post-depletion increase of neural activity in the pedunculopontine nucleus, where neurons representing obtained reward exist and presumably send excitatory projections to dopamine neurons. We further show that finding iv, which is nontrivial given the suggested distinct functions of the D1 and D2 corticostriatal pathways, can also be explained if we additionally assume a proposed mechanism of TD-RPE calculation, in which the D1 and D2 pathways encode the values of actions with a temporal difference. These results suggest a possible circuit mechanism for the involvements of dopamine in effort-related choices and, simultaneously, provide implications for the mechanisms of TD-RPE calculation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Loss of eIF4E Phosphorylation Engenders Depression-like Behaviors via Selective mRNA Translation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The MAPK/ERK (mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway is a cardinal regulator of synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory in the hippocampus. One of major endpoints of this signaling cascade is the 5' mRNA cap binding protein eIF4E (eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4E), which is phosphorylated on Ser 209 by MNK (MAPK-interacting protein kinases) and controls mRNA translation. The precise role of phospho-eIF4E in the brain is yet to be determined. Herein, we demonstrate that ablation of eIF4E phosphorylation in male mice (&lt;i&gt;4Eki&lt;/i&gt; mice) does not impair long-term spatial or contextual fear memory, or the late phase of LTP. Using unbiased translational profiling in mouse brain, we show that phospho-eIF4E differentially regulates the translation of a subset of mRNAs linked to inflammation, the extracellular matrix, pituitary hormones, and the serotonin pathway. Consequently, &lt;i&gt;4Eki&lt;/i&gt; male mice display exaggerated inflammatory responses and reduced levels of serotonin, concomitant with depression and anxiety-like behaviors. Remarkably, eIF4E phosphorylation is required for the chronic antidepressant action of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. Finally, we propose a novel phospho-eIF4E-dependent translational control mechanism in the brain, via the GAIT complex (gamma IFN activated inhibitor of translation). In summary, our work proposes a novel translational control mechanism involved in the regulation of inflammation and depression, which could be exploited to design novel therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We demonstrate that downstream of the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway, eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4E (eIF4E) Ser209 phosphorylation is not required for classical forms of hippocampal LTP and memory. We reveal a novel role for eIF4E phosphorylation in inflammatory responses and depression-like behaviors. eIF4E phosphorylation is required for the chronic action of antidepressants, such as fluoxetine in mice. These phenotypes are accompanied by selective translation of extracellular matrix, pituitary hormones, and serotonin pathway genes, in eIF4E phospho-mutant mice. We also describe a previously unidentified translational control mechanism in the brain, whereby eIF4E phosphorylation is required for inhibiting the translation of gamma IFN activated inhibitor of translation element-containing mRNAs. These findings can be used to design novel therapeutics for depression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Functional Segmentation of the Anterior Limb of the Internal Capsule: Linking White Matter Abnormalities to Specific Connections</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) carries thalamic and brainstem fibers from prefrontal cortical regions that are associated with different aspects of emotion, motivation, cognition processing, and decision-making. This large fiber bundle is abnormal in several psychiatric illnesses and a major target for deep brain stimulation. Yet, we have very little information about where specific prefrontal fibers travel within the bundle. Using a combination of tracing studies and diffusion MRI in male nonhuman primates, as well as diffusion MRI in male and female human subjects, we segmented the human ALIC into five regions based on the positions of axons from different cortical regions within the capsule. Fractional anisotropy (FA) abnormalities in patients with bipolar disorder were detected when FA was averaged in the ALIC segment that carries ventrolateral prefrontal cortical connections. Together, the results set the stage for linking abnormalities within the ALIC to specific connections and demonstrate the utility of applying connectivity profiles of large white matter bundles based on animal anatomic studies to human connections and associating disease abnormalities in those pathways with specific connections. The ability to functionally segment large white matter bundles into their components begins a new era of refining how we think about white matter organization and use that information in understanding abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) connects prefrontal cortex with the thalamus and brainstem and is abnormal in psychiatric illnesses. However, we know little about the location of specific prefrontal fibers within the bundle. Using a combination of animal tracing studies and diffusion MRI in animals and human subjects, we segmented the human ALIC into five regions based on the positions of axons from different cortical regions. We then demonstrated that differences in FA values between bipolar disorder patients and healthy control subjects were specific to a given segment. Together, the results set the stage for linking abnormalities within the ALIC to specific connections and for refining how we think about white matter organization in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cortical Neural Activity Predicts Sensory Acuity Under Optogenetic Manipulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/8/2094?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the mammalian sensory cortex form interconnected circuits that control cortical stimulus selectivity and sensory acuity. Theoretical studies have predicted that suppression of inhibition in such excitatory–inhibitory networks can lead to either an increase or, paradoxically, a decrease in excitatory neuronal firing, with consequent effects on stimulus selectivity. We tested whether modulation of inhibition or excitation in the auditory cortex of male mice could evoke such a variety of effects in tone-evoked responses and in behavioral frequency discrimination acuity. We found that, indeed, the effects of optogenetic manipulation on stimulus selectivity and behavior varied in both magnitude and sign across subjects, possibly reflecting differences in circuitry or expression of optogenetic factors. Changes in neural population responses consistently predicted behavioral changes for individuals separately, including improvement and impairment in acuity. This correlation between cortical and behavioral change demonstrates that, despite the complex and varied effects that these manipulations can have on neuronal dynamics, the resulting changes in cortical activity account for accompanying changes in behavioral acuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Excitatory and inhibitory interactions determine stimulus specificity and tuning in sensory cortex, thereby controlling perceptual discrimination acuity. Modeling has predicted that suppressing the activity of inhibitory neurons can lead to increased or, paradoxically, decreased excitatory activity depending on the architecture of the network. Here, we capitalized on differences between subjects to test whether suppressing/activating inhibition and excitation can in fact exhibit such paradoxical effects for both stimulus sensitivity and behavioral discriminability. Indeed, the same optogenetic manipulation in the auditory cortex of different mice could improve or impair frequency discrimination acuity, predictable from the effects on cortical responses to tones. The same manipulations sometimes produced opposite changes in the behavior of different individuals, supporting theoretical predictions for inhibition-stabilized networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Diversity of Internal Sensory Neuron Axon Projection Patterns Is Controlled by the POU-Domain Protein Pdm3 in Drosophila Larvae</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Internal sensory neurons innervate body organs and provide information about internal state to the CNS to maintain physiological homeostasis. Despite their conservation across species, the anatomy, circuitry, and development of internal sensory systems are still relatively poorly understood. A largely unstudied population of larval &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; sensory neurons, termed tracheal dendrite (td) neurons, innervate internal respiratory organs and may serve as a model for understanding the sensing of internal states. Here, we characterize the peripheral anatomy, central axon projection, and diversity of td sensory neurons. We provide evidence for prominent expression of specific gustatory receptor genes in distinct populations of td neurons, suggesting novel chemosensory functions. We identify two anatomically distinct classes of td neurons. The axons of one class project to the subesophageal zone (SEZ) in the brain, whereas the other terminates in the ventral nerve cord (VNC). We identify expression and a developmental role of the POU-homeodomain transcription factor Pdm3 in regulating the axon extension and terminal targeting of SEZ-projecting td neurons. Remarkably, ectopic Pdm3 expression is alone sufficient to switch VNC-targeting axons to SEZ targets, and to induce the formation of putative synapses in these ectopic target zones. Our data thus define distinct classes of td neurons, and identify a molecular factor that contributes to diversification of axon targeting. These results introduce a tractable model to elucidate molecular and circuit mechanisms underlying sensory processing of internal body status and physiological homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; How interoceptive sensory circuits develop, including how sensory neurons diversify and target distinct central regions, is still poorly understood, despite the importance of these sensory systems for maintaining physiological homeostasis. Here, we characterize classes of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; internal sensory neurons (td neurons) and uncover diverse axonal projections and expression of chemosensory receptor genes. We categorize td neurons into two classes based on dichotomous axon target regions, and identify the expression and role of the transcription factor Pdm3 in mediating td axon targeting to one of these target regions. Our results provide an entry point into studying internal sensory circuit development and function, and establish Pdm3 as a regulator of interoceptive axon targeting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Serotonin Disinhibits a Caenorhabditis elegans Sensory Neuron by Suppressing Ca2+-Dependent Negative Feedback</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulators, such as serotonin (5-HT), alter neuronal excitability and synaptic strengths, and define different behavioral states. Neuromodulator-dependent changes in neuronal activity patterns are frequently measured using calcium reporters because calcium imaging can easily be performed on intact functioning nervous systems. With only 302 neurons, the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; provides a relatively simple, yet powerful, system to understand neuromodulation at the level of individual neurons. &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; hermaphrodites are repelled by 1-octanol, and the initiation of these aversive responses is potentiated by 5-HT. 5-HT acts on the ASH polymodal nociceptors that sense the 1-octanol stimulus. Surprisingly, 5-HT suppresses ASH Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients while simultaneously potentiating 1-octanol-dependent ASH depolarization. Here we further explore this seemingly inverse relationship. Our results show the following (1) 5-HT acts downstream of depolarization, through Gα&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated signaling and calcineurin, to inhibit L-type voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels; (2) the 1-octanol-evoked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in ASHs inhibit depolarization; and (3) the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel, SLO-1, acts downstream of 5-HT and is a critical regulator of ASH response dynamics. These findings define a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent inhibitory feedback loop that can be modulated by 5-HT to increase neuronal excitability and regulate behavior, and highlight the possibility that neuromodulator-induced changes in the amplitudes of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients do not necessarily predict corresponding changes in depolarization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuromodulators, such as 5-HT, modify behavior by regulating excitability and synaptic efficiency in neurons. Neuromodulation is often studied using Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging, whereby neuromodulator-dependent changes in neuronal activity levels can be detected in intact, functioning circuits. Here we show that 5-HT reduces the amplitude of depolarization-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in a &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; nociceptive neuron, through Gα&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; signaling and calcineurin but that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; itself inhibits depolarization, likely through Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. The net effect of 5-HT, therefore, is to increase neuronal excitability through disinhibition. These results establish a novel 5-HT signal transduction pathway, and demonstrate that neuromodulators can change Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals and depolarization amplitudes in opposite directions, simultaneously, within a single neuron.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Single-Cell Stimulation in Barrel Cortex Influences Psychophysical Detection Performance</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A single whisker stimulus elicits action potentials in a sparse subset of neurons in somatosensory cortex. The precise contribution of these neurons to the animal's perception of a whisker stimulus is unknown. Here we show that single-cell stimulation in rat barrel cortex of both sexes influences the psychophysical detection of a near-threshold whisker stimulus in a cell type–dependent manner, without affecting false alarm rate. Counterintuitively, stimulation of single fast-spiking putative inhibitory neurons increased detection performance. Single-cell stimulation of putative excitatory neurons failed to change detection performance, except for a small subset of deep-layer neurons that were highly sensitive to whisker stimulation and that had an unexpectedly strong impact on detection performance. These findings indicate that the perceptual impact of excitatory barrel cortical neurons relates to their firing response to whisker stimulation and that strong activity in a single highly sensitive neuron in barrel cortex can already enhance sensory detection. Our data suggest that sensory detection is based on a decoding mechanism that lends a disproportionally large weight to interneurons and to deep-layer neurons showing a strong response to sensory stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Rat whisker somatosensory cortex contains a variety of neuronal cell types with distinct anatomical and physiological characteristics. How each of these different cell types contribute to the animal's perception of whisker stimuli is unknown. We explored this question by using a powerful electrophysiological stimulation technique that allowed us to target and stimulate single neurons with different sensory response types in whisker cortex. In awake, behaving animals, trained to detect whisker stimulation, only costimulation of single fast-spiking inhibitory neurons or single deep-layer excitatory neurons with strong responses to whisker stimulation enhanced detection performance. Our data demonstrate that single cortical neurons can have measurable impact on the detection of sensory stimuli and suggest a decoding mechanism based on select cell types.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ephexin1 Is Required for Eph-Mediated Limb Trajectory of Spinal Motor Axons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The precise assembly of a functional nervous system relies on the guided migration of axonal growth cones, which is made possible by signals transmitted to the cytoskeleton by cell surface-expressed guidance receptors. We investigated the function of ephexin1, a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, as an essential growth-cone guidance intermediary in the context of spinal lateral motor column (LMC) motor axon trajectory selection in the limb mesenchyme. Using &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; mRNA detection, we first show that ephexin1 is expressed in LMC neurons of chick and mouse embryos at the time of spinal motor axon extension into the limb. Ephexin1 loss of function and gain of function using &lt;i&gt;in ovo&lt;/i&gt; electroporation in chick LMC neurons, of either sex, perturbed LMC axon trajectory selection, demonstrating an essential role of ephexin1 in motor axon guidance. In addition, ephexin1 loss in mice of either sex led to LMC axon trajectory selection errors. We also show that ephexin1 knockdown attenuates the growth preference of LMC neurites against ephrins &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and Eph receptor-mediated retargeting of LMC axons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting that ephexin1 is required in Eph-mediated LMC motor axon guidance. Finally, both ephexin1 knockdown and ectopic expression of nonphosphorylatable ephexin1 mutant attenuated the retargeting of LMC axons caused by Src overexpression, implicating ephexin1 as an Src target in Eph signal relay in this context. In summary, our findings demonstrate that ephexin1 is essential for motor axon guidance and suggest an important role in relaying ephrin:Eph signals that mediate motor axon trajectory selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The proper development of functioning neural circuits requires precise nerve connections among neurons or between neurons and their muscle targets. The Eph tyrosine kinase receptors expressed in neurons are important in many contexts during neural-circuit formation, such as axon outgrowth, axon guidance, and synaptic formation, and have been suggested to be involved in neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. To dissect the mechanism of Eph signal relay, we studied ephexin1 gain of function and loss of function and found ephexin1 essential for the development of limb nerves toward their muscle targets, concluding that it functions as an intermediary to relay Eph signaling in this context. Our work could thus shed new light on the molecular mechanisms controlling neuromuscular connectivity during embryonic development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neurogenesis during Abstinence Is Necessary for Context-Driven Methamphetamine-Related Memory</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Abstinence from methamphetamine addiction enhances proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitors and increases adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG). We hypothesized that neurogenesis during abstinence contributes to context-driven drug-seeking behaviors. To test this hypothesis, the pharmacogenetic rat model (GFAP-TK rats) was used to conditionally and specifically ablate neurogenesis in the DG. Male GFAP-TK rats were trained to self-administer methamphetamine or sucrose and were administered the antiviral drug valganciclovir (Valcyte) to produce apoptosis of actively dividing GFAP type 1 stem-like cells to inhibit neurogenesis during abstinence. Hippocampus tissue was stained for Ki-67, NeuroD, and DCX to measure levels of neural progenitors and immature neurons, and was stained for synaptoporin to determine alterations in mossy fiber tracts. DG-enriched tissue punches were probed for CaMKII to measure alterations in plasticity-related proteins. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed in acute brain slices from methamphetamine naive (controls) and methamphetamine experienced animals (+/–Valcyte). Spontaneous EPSCs and intrinsic excitability were recorded from granule cell neurons (GCNs). Reinstatement of methamphetamine seeking enhanced autophosphorylation of CaMKII, reduced mossy fiber density, and induced hyperexcitability of GCNs. Inhibition of neurogenesis during abstinence prevented context-driven methamphetamine seeking, and these effects correlated with reduced autophosphorylation of CaMKII, increased mossy fiber density, and reduced the excitability of GCNs. Context-driven sucrose seeking was unaffected. Together, the loss-of-neurogenesis data demonstrate that neurogenesis during abstinence assists with methamphetamine context-driven memory in rats, and that neurogenesis during abstinence is essential for the expression of synaptic proteins and plasticity promoting context-driven drug memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our work uncovers a mechanistic relationship between neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and drug seeking. We report that the suppression of excessive neurogenesis during abstinence from methamphetamine addiction by a confirmed phamacogenetic approach blocked context-driven methamphetamine reinstatement and prevented maladaptive changes in expression and activation of synaptic proteins and basal synaptic function associated with learning and memory in the dentate gyrus. Our study is the first to demonstrate an interesting and dysfunctional role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis during abstinence to drug-seeking behavior in animals self-administering escalating amounts of methamphetamine. Together, these results support a direct role for the importance of adult neurogenesis during abstinence in compulsive-like drug reinstatement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Eliminating Glutamatergic Input onto Horizontal Cells Changes the Dynamic Range and Receptive Field Organization of Mouse Retinal Ganglion Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/8/2015?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the mammalian retina, horizontal cells receive glutamatergic inputs from many rod and cone photoreceptors and return feedback signals to them, thereby changing photoreceptor glutamate release in a light-dependent manner. Horizontal cells also provide feedforward signals to bipolar cells. It is unclear, however, how horizontal cell signals also affect the temporal, spatial, and contrast tuning in retinal output neurons, the ganglion cells. To study this, we generated a genetically modified mouse line in which we eliminated the light dependency of feedback by deleting glutamate receptors from mouse horizontal cells. This genetic modification allowed us to investigate the impact of horizontal cells on ganglion cell signaling independent of the actual mode of feedback in the outer retina and without pharmacological manipulation of signal transmission. In control and genetically modified mice (both sexes), we recorded the light responses of transient OFF-α retinal ganglion cells in the intact retina. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were reduced and the cells were tuned to lower temporal frequencies and higher contrasts, presumably because photoreceptor output was attenuated. Moreover, receptive fields of recorded cells showed a significantly altered surround structure. Our data thus suggest that horizontal cells are responsible for adjusting the dynamic range of retinal ganglion cells and, together with amacrine cells, contribute to the center/surround organization of ganglion cell receptive fields in the mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Horizontal cells represent a major neuronal class in the mammalian retina and provide lateral feedback and feedforward signals to photoreceptors and bipolar cells, respectively. The mode of signal transmission remains controversial and, moreover, the contribution of horizontal cells to visual processing is still elusive. To address the question of how horizontal cells affect retinal output signals, we recorded the light responses of transient OFF-α retinal ganglion cells in a newly generated mouse line. In this mouse line, horizontal cell signals were no longer modulated by light. With light response recordings, we show that horizontal cells increase the dynamic range of retinal ganglion cells for contrast and temporal changes and contribute to the center/surround organization of their receptive fields.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Visual Experience Facilitates BDNF-Dependent Adaptive Recruitment of New Neurons in the Postembryonic Optic Tectum</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/8/2000?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Postembryonic brain development is sensitive to environmental input and sensory experience, but the mechanisms underlying healthy adaptive brain growth are poorly understood. Here, we tested the importance of visual experience on larval zebrafish (&lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt;) postembryonic development of the optic tectum (OT), a midbrain structure involved in visually guided behavior. We first characterized postembryonic neurogenic growth in OT, in which new neurons are generated along the caudal tectal surface and contribute appositionally to anatomical growth. Restricting visual experience during development by rearing larvae in dim light impaired OT anatomical and neurogenic growth, specifically by reducing the survival of new neurons in the medial periventricular gray zone. Neuronal survival in the OT was reduced only when visual experience was restricted for the first 5 d following new neuron generation, suggesting that tectal neurons exhibit an early sensitive period in which visual experience protects these cells from subsequent neuronal loss. The effect of dim rearing on neuronal survival was mimicked by treatment with an NMDA receptor antagonist early, but not later, in a new neuron's life. Both dim rearing and antagonist treatment reduced BDNF production in the OT, and supplementing larvae with exogenous BDNF during dim rearing prevented neuronal loss, suggesting that visual experience protects new tectal neurons through neural activity-dependent BDNF expression. Collectively, we present evidence for a sensitive period of neurogenic adaptive growth in the larval zebrafish OT that relies on visual experience-dependent mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Early brain development is shaped by environmental factors via sensory input; however, this form of experience-dependent neuroplasticity is traditionally studied as structural and functional changes within preexisting neurons. Here, we found that restricting visual experience affects development of the larval zebrafish optic tectum, a midbrain structure involved in visually guided behavior, by limiting the survival of newly generated neurons. We found that new tectal neurons exhibit a sensitive period soon after cell birth in which adequate visual experience, likely mediated by neuronal activity driving BDNF production within the tectum, would protect them from subsequent neuronal loss over the following week. Collectively, we present evidence for neurogenic adaptive tectal growth under different environmental lighting conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Aging Affects Adaptation to Sound-Level Statistics in Human Auditory Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Optimal perception requires efficient and adaptive neural processing of sensory input. Neurons in nonhuman mammals adapt to the statistical properties of acoustic feature distributions such that they become sensitive to sounds that are most likely to occur in the environment. However, whether human auditory responses adapt to stimulus statistical distributions and how aging affects adaptation to stimulus statistics is unknown. We used MEG to study how exposure to different distributions of sound levels affects adaptation in auditory cortex of younger (mean: 25 years; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 19) and older (mean: 64 years; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) adults (male and female). Participants passively listened to two sound-level distributions with different modes (either 15 or 45 dB sensation level). In a control block with long interstimulus intervals, allowing neural populations to recover from adaptation, neural response magnitudes were similar between younger and older adults. Critically, both age groups demonstrated adaptation to sound-level stimulus statistics, but adaptation was altered for older compared with younger people: in the older group, neural responses continued to be sensitive to sound level under conditions in which responses were fully adapted in the younger group. The lack of full adaptation to the statistics of the sensory environment may be a physiological mechanism underlying the known difficulty that older adults have with filtering out irrelevant sensory information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Behavior requires efficient processing of acoustic stimulation. Animal work suggests that neurons accomplish efficient processing by adjusting their response sensitivity depending on statistical properties of the acoustic environment. Little is known about the extent to which this adaptation to stimulus statistics generalizes to humans, particularly to older humans. We used MEG to investigate how aging influences adaptation to sound-level statistics. Listeners were presented with sounds drawn from sound-level distributions with different modes (15 vs 45 dB). Auditory cortex neurons adapted to sound-level statistics in younger and older adults, but adaptation was incomplete in older people. The data suggest that the aging auditory system does not fully capitalize on the statistics available in sound environments to tune the perceptual system dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Deficient Surveillance and Phagocytic Activity of Myeloid Cells Within Demyelinated Lesions in Aging Mice Visualized by Ex Vivo Live Multiphoton Imaging</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging impairs regenerative processes including remyelination, the synthesis of a new myelin sheath. Microglia and other infiltrating myeloid cells such as macrophages are essential for remyelination through mechanisms that include the clearance of inhibitory molecules within the lesion. Prior studies have shown that the quantity of myeloid cells and the clearance of inhibitory myelin debris are deficient in aging, contributing to the decline in remyelination efficiency with senescence. It is unknown, however, whether the impaired clearance of debris is simply the result of the reduced number of phagocytes or if the dynamic activity of myeloid cells within the demyelinating plaque also declines with aging and this question is relevant to the proper design of therapeutics to mobilize myeloid cells for repair. Herein, we describe a high-resolution multiphoton &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; live imaging protocol that visualizes individual myelinated/demyelinated axons and lipid-containing myeloid cells to investigate the demyelinated lesion of aging female mice. We found that aging lesions have fewer myeloid cells and that these have reduced phagocytosis of myelin. Although the myeloid cells are actively migratory within the lesion of young mice and have protrusions that seem to survey the environment, this motility and surveillance is significantly reduced in aging mice. Our results emphasize the necessity of not only increasing the number of phagocytes, but also enhancing their activity once they are within demyelinated lesions. The high-resolution live imaging of demyelinated lesions can serve as a platform with which to discover pharmacological agents that rejuvenate intralesional remodeling that promotes the repair of plaques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The repair of myelin after injury depends on myeloid cells that clear debris and release growth factors. As organisms age, remyelination becomes less efficient correspondent with fewer myeloid cells that populate the lesions. It is unknown whether the dynamic activity of cells within lesions is also altered with age. Herein, using high-resolution multiphoton &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; live imaging with several novel features, we report that myeloid cells within demyelinated lesions of aging mice have reduced motility, surveillance, and phagocytic activity, suggesting an intralesional impairment that may contribute to the age-related decline in remyelination efficiency. Medications to stimulate deficient aging myeloid cells should not only increase their representation, but also enter into lesions to stimulate their activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Pronounced Hyperactivity, Cognitive Dysfunctions, and BDNF Dysregulation in Dopamine Transporter Knock-out Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine (DA) controls many vital physiological functions and is critically involved in several neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The major function of the plasma membrane dopamine transporter (DAT) is the rapid uptake of released DA into presynaptic nerve terminals leading to control of both the extracellular levels of DA and the intracellular stores of DA. Here, we present a newly developed strain of rats in which the gene encoding DAT knockout Rats (DAT-KO) has been disrupted by using zinc finger nuclease technology. Male and female DAT-KO rats develop normally but weigh less than heterozygote and wild-type rats and demonstrate pronounced spontaneous locomotor hyperactivity. While striatal extracellular DA lifetime and concentrations are significantly increased, the total tissue content of DA is markedly decreased demonstrating the key role of DAT in the control of DA neurotransmission. Hyperactivity of DAT-KO rats can be counteracted by amphetamine, methylphenidate, the partial Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1 (TAAR1) agonist RO5203648 ((S)-4-(3,4-Dichloro-phenyl)-4,5-dihydro-oxazol-2-ylamine) and haloperidol. DAT-KO rats also demonstrate a deficit in working memory and sensorimotor gating tests, less propensity to develop obsessive behaviors and show strong dysregulation in frontostriatal BDNF function. DAT-KO rats could provide a novel translational model for human diseases involving aberrant DA function and/or mutations affecting DAT or related regulatory mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here, we present a newly developed strain of rats in which the gene encoding the dopamine transporter (DAT) has been disrupted (Dopamine Transporter Knockout rats [DAT-KO rats]). DAT-KO rats display functional hyperdopaminergia accompanied by pronounced spontaneous locomotor hyperactivity. Hyperactivity of DAT-KO rats can be counteracted by amphetamine, methylphenidate, and a few other compounds exerting inhibitory action on dopamine-dependent hyperactivity. DAT-KO rats also demonstrate cognitive deficits in working memory and sensorimotor gating tests, less propensity to develop compulsive behaviors, and strong dysregulation in frontostriatal BDNF function. These observations highlight the key role of DAT in the control of brain dopaminergic transmission. DAT-KO rats could provide a novel translational model for human diseases involving aberrant dopamine functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Multimodal Encoding of Novelty, Reward, and Learning in the Primate Nucleus Basalis of Meynert</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/8/1942?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Associative learning is crucial for daily function, involving a complex network of brain regions. One region, the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM), is a highly interconnected, largely cholinergic structure implicated in multiple aspects of learning. We show that single neurons in the NBM of nonhuman primates (NHPs; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 2 males; &lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;) encode learning a new association through spike rate modulation. However, the power of low-frequency local field potential (LFP) oscillations decreases in response to novel, not-yet-learned stimuli but then increase as learning progresses. Both NBM and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex encode confidence in novel associations by increasing low- and high-frequency LFP power in anticipation of expected rewards. Finally, NBM high-frequency power dynamics are anticorrelated with spike rate modulations. Therefore, novelty, learning, and reward anticipation are separately encoded through differentiable NBM signals. By signaling both the need to learn and confidence in newly acquired associations, NBM may play a key role in coordinating cortical activity throughout the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Degradation of cells in a key brain region, the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM), correlates with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease progression. To better understand the role of this brain structure in learning and memory, we examined neural activity in the NBM in behaving nonhuman primates while they performed a learning and memory task. We found that single neurons in NBM encoded both salience and an early learning, or cognitive state, whereas populations of neurons in the NBM and prefrontal cortex encode learned state and reward anticipation. The NBM may thus encode multiple stages of learning. These multimodal signals might be leveraged in future studies to develop neural stimulation to facilitate different stages of learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Commonalities and Differences in the Substrates Underlying Consolidation of First- and Second-Order Conditioned Fear</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/8/1926?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/8/1926?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Consolidation of newly formed fear memories requires a series of molecular events within the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA). Once consolidated, new information can be assimilated into these established associative networks to form higher-order associations. Much is known about the molecular events involved in consolidating newly acquired fear memories but little is known about the events that consolidate a secondary fear memory. Here, we show that, within the male rat BLA, DNA methylation and gene transcription are crucial for consolidating both the primary and secondary fear memories. We also show that consolidation of the primary, but not the secondary, fear memory requires &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; protein synthesis in the BLA. These findings show that consolidation of a fear memory and its updating to incorporate new information recruit distinct processes in the BLA, and suggest that DNA methylation in the BLA is fundamental to consolidation of both types of conditioned fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our data provide clear evidence that a different set of mechanisms mediate consolidation of learning about cues that signal learned sources of danger (i.e., second-order conditioned fear) compared with those involved in consolidation of learning about cues that signal innate sources of danger (i.e., first-order conditioned fear). These findings carry important implications because second-order learning could underlie aberrant fear-related behaviors (e.g., in anxiety disorders) as a consequence of neutral secondary cues being integrated into associative fear networks established through first-order pairings, and thereby becoming potent conditioned reinforcers and predictors of fear. Therefore, our data suggest that targeting such second-order conditioned triggers of fear may require pharmacological intervention different to that typically used for first-order conditioned cues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dorsal Raphe Serotonin Neurons Mediate CO2-Induced Arousal from Sleep</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/8/1915?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/8/1915?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Arousal from sleep in response to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a critical protective phenomenon. Dysregulation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced arousal contributes to morbidity and mortality from prevalent diseases, such as obstructive sleep apnea and sudden infant death syndrome. Despite the critical nature of this protective reflex, the precise mechanism for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced arousal is unknown. Because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a major regulator of breathing, prevailing theories suggest that activation of respiratory chemo- and mechano-sensors is required for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced arousal. However, populations of neurons that are not involved in the regulation of breathing are also chemosensitive. Among these are serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) that comprise a component of the ascending arousal system. We hypothesized that direct stimulation of these neurons with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could cause arousal from sleep independently of enhancing breathing. Dialysis of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-rich acidified solution into DRN, but not medullary raphe responsible for modulating breathing, caused arousal from sleep. Arousal was lost in mice with a genetic absence of 5-HT neurons, and with acute pharmacological or optogenetic inactivation of DRN 5-HT neurons. Here we demonstrate that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can cause arousal from sleep directly, without requiring enhancement of breathing, and that chemosensitive 5-HT neurons in the DRN critically mediate this arousal. Better understanding mechanisms underlying this protective reflex may lead to interventions to reduce disease-associated morbidity and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced arousal is critical to a number of diseases, the specific mechanism is not well understood. We previously demonstrated that serotonin (5-HT) neurons are important for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced arousal, as mice without 5-HT neurons do not arouse to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Many have interpreted this to mean that medullary 5-HT neurons that regulate breathing are important in this arousal mechanism. Here we found that direct application of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-rich aCSF to the dorsal raphe nucleus, but not the medullary raphe, causes arousal from sleep, and that this arousal was lost with genetic ablation or acute inhibition of 5-HT neurons. We propose that 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus can be activated directly by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to cause arousal independently of respiratory activation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Differential Contributions of Nucleus Accumbens Subregions to Cue-Guided Risk/Reward Decision Making and Implementation of Conditional Rules</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/8/1901?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/8/1901?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key node within corticolimbic circuitry for guiding action selection and cost/benefit decision making in situations involving reward uncertainty. Preclinical studies have typically assessed risk/reward decision making using assays where decisions are guided by internally generated representations of choice-outcome contingencies. Yet, real-life decisions are often influenced by external stimuli that inform about likelihoods of obtaining rewards. How different subregions of the NAc mediate decision making in such situations is unclear. Here, we used a novel assay colloquially termed the &quot;Blackjack&quot; task that models these types of situations. Male Long–Evans rats were trained to choose between one lever that always delivered a one-pellet reward and another that delivered four pellets with different probabilities [either 50% (good-odds) or 12.5% (poor-odds)], which were signaled by one of two auditory cues. Under control conditions, rats selected the large/risky option more often on good-odds versus poor-odds trials. Inactivation of the NAc core caused indiscriminate choice patterns. In contrast, NAc shell inactivation increased risky choice, more prominently on poor-odds trials. Additional experiments revealed that both subregions contribute to auditory conditional discrimination. NAc core or shell inactivation reduced Pavlovian approach elicited by an auditory CS+, yet shell inactivation also increased responding during presentation of a CS–. These data highlight distinct contributions for NAc subregions in decision making and reward seeking guided by discriminative stimuli. The core is crucial for implementation of conditional rules, whereas the shell refines reward seeking by mitigating the allure of larger, unlikely rewards and reducing expression of inappropriate or non-rewarded actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Using external cues to guide decision making is crucial for adaptive behavior. Deficits in cue-guided behavior have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia, which in turn has been linked to aberrant processing in the nucleus accumbens. However, many preclinical studies have often assessed risk/reward decision making in the absence of explicit cues. The current study fills that gap by using a novel task that allows for the assessment of cue-guided risk/reward decision making in rodents. Our findings identified distinct yet complementary roles for the medial versus lateral portions of this nucleus that provide a broader understanding of the differential contributions it makes to decision making and reward seeking guided by discriminative stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation over Left Inferior Frontal and Posterior Temporal Cortex Disrupts Gesture-Speech Integration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/8/1891?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/8/1891?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Language and action naturally occur together in the form of cospeech gestures, and there is now convincing evidence that listeners display a strong tendency to integrate semantic information from both domains during comprehension. A contentious question, however, has been which brain areas are causally involved in this integration process. In previous neuroimaging studies, left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) have emerged as candidate areas; however, it is currently not clear whether these areas are causally or merely epiphenomenally involved in gesture-speech integration. In the present series of experiments, we directly tested for a potential critical role of IFG and pMTG by observing the effect of disrupting activity in these areas using transcranial magnetic stimulation in a mixed gender sample of healthy human volunteers. The outcome measure was performance on a Stroop-like gesture task (Kelly et al., 2010a), which provides a behavioral index of gesture-speech integration. Our results provide clear evidence that disrupting activity in IFG and pMTG selectively impairs gesture-speech integration, suggesting that both areas are causally involved in the process. These findings are consistent with the idea that these areas play a joint role in gesture-speech integration, with IFG regulating strategic semantic access via top-down signals acting upon temporal storage areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Previous neuroimaging studies suggest an involvement of inferior frontal gyrus and posterior middle temporal gyrus in gesture-speech integration, but findings have been mixed and due to methodological constraints did not allow inferences of causality. By adopting a virtual lesion approach involving transcranial magnetic stimulation, the present study provides clear evidence that both areas are causally involved in combining semantic information arising from gesture and speech. These findings support the view that, rather than being separate entities, gesture and speech are part of an integrated multimodal language system, with inferior frontal gyrus and posterior middle temporal gyrus serving as critical nodes of the cortical network underpinning this system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Local Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Signaling in the Hypothalamic Paraventricular Nucleus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) initiate hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activity through the release of CRF into the portal system as part of a coordinated neuroendocrine, autonomic, and behavioral response to stress. The recent discovery of neurons expressing CRF receptor type 1 (CRFR1), the primary receptor for CRF, adjacent to CRF neurons within the PVN, suggests that CRF also signals within the hypothalamus to coordinate aspects of the stress response. Here, we characterize the electrophysiological and molecular properties of PVN-CRFR1 neurons and interrogate their monosynaptic connectivity using rabies virus-based tracing and optogenetic circuit mapping in male and female mice. We provide evidence that CRF neurons in the PVN form synapses on neighboring CRFR1 neurons and activate them by releasing CRF. CRFR1 neurons receive the majority of monosynaptic input from within the hypothalamus, mainly from the PVN itself. Locally, CRFR1 neurons make GABAergic synapses on parvocellular and magnocellular cells within the PVN. CRFR1 neurons resident in the PVN also make long-range glutamatergic synapses in autonomic nuclei such as the nucleus of the solitary tract. Selective ablation of PVN-CRFR1 neurons in male mice elevates corticosterone release during a stress response and slows the decrease in circulating corticosterone levels after the cessation of stress. Our experiments provide evidence for a novel intra-PVN neural circuit that is activated by local CRF release and coordinates autonomic and endocrine function during stress responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) coordinates concomitant changes in autonomic and neuroendocrine function to organize the response to stress. This manuscript maps intra-PVN circuitry that signals via CRF, delineates CRF receptor type 1 neuron synaptic targets both within the PVN and at distal targets, and establishes the role of this microcircuit in regulating hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, the physiological effects produced by GPi DBS are not fully understood. In particular, how a single-pulse GPi DBS changes cortical circuits has never been investigated. We studied the modulation of motor cortical excitability and plasticity with single-pulse GPi DBS in dystonia patients with bilateral implantation of GPi DBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25156-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cortical evoked potentials from DBS were recorded with electroencephalography. Transcranial magnetic stimulation with a conditioning test paired-pulse paradigm was used to investigate the effect of GPi DBS on the primary motor cortex. How GPi DBS might modulate the motor cortical plasticity was tested using a paired associative stimulation paradigm with repetitive pairs of GPi DBS and motor cortical stimulation at specific time intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25156-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPi stimulation produced 2 peaks of cortical evoked potentials with latencies of ∼10 and ∼25 milliseconds in the motor cortical area. Cortical facilitation was observed at ∼10 milliseconds after single-pulse GPi DBS, and cortical inhibition was observed after a ∼25-millisecond interval. Repetitive pairs of GPi stimulation with cortical stimulation at these 2 time intervals produced long-term potentiation-like effects in the motor cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25156-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single-pulse DBS modulates cortical excitability and plasticity at specific time intervals. These effects may be related to the mechanism of action of DBS. Combination of DBS with cortical stimulation with appropriate timing has therapeutic potential and could be explored in the future as a method to enhance the effects of neuromodulation for neurological and psychiatric diseases.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neutrophil hyperactivation correlates with Alzheimer's disease progression</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25159-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have underlined the effect of systemic inflammation on the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neutrophils are key components of early innate immunity and contribute to uncontrolled systemic inflammation if not tightly regulated. The aim of our study was to fully characterize human circulating neutrophils at different disease stages in AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25159-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed neutrophil phenotypes and functions in 42 patients with AD (16 with mild cognitive impairment and 26 with dementia), and compared them to 22 age-matched healthy subjects. This study was performed directly in whole blood to avoid issues with data interpretation related to cell isolation procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25159-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood samples from AD patients with dementia revealed neutrophil hyperactivation associated with increased reactive oxygen species production and increased levels of intravascular neutrophil extravascular traps. The homeostasis of circulating neutrophils in these patients also changed: The ratio between the harmful hyperreactive CXCR4&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt;/CD62L&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt; senescent and the CD16&lt;sup&gt;bright&lt;/sup&gt;/CD62L&lt;sup&gt;dim&lt;/sup&gt; immunosuppressive neutrophil subsets rose in the later stage of the disease. These abnormalities were greater in fast-decliner than in slow-decliner patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25159-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results indicate that the inflammatory properties of circulating neutrophils shift as the percentage of aged neutrophils expands in patients with AD—changes that may play an instrumental role in establishing systemic chronic inflammation. Most important, our data strongly suggest that the neutrophil phenotype may be associated with the rate of cognitive decline and may thus constitute an innovative and prognostic blood biomarker in patients with AD.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: ElasticPath2Path: Automated morphological classification of neurons by elastic path matching. (arXiv:1802.06913v1 [eess.IV])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06913</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06913</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the study of neurons, morphology influences function. The complexity in
the structure of neurons poses a challenge in the identification and analysis
of similar and dissimilar neuronal cells. Existing methodologies carry out
structural and geometrical simplifications, which substantially change the
morphological statistics. Using digitally-reconstructed neurons, we extend the
work of Path2Path as ElasticPath2Path, which seamlessly integrates the
graph-theoretic and differential-geometric frameworks. By decomposing a neuron
into a set of paths, we derive graph metrics, which are path concurrence and
path hierarchy. Next, we model each path as an elastic string to compute the
geodesic distance between the paths of a pair of neurons. Later, we formulate
the problem of finding the distance between two neurons as a path assignment
problem with a cost function combining the graph metrics and the geodesic
deformation of paths. ElasticPath2Path is shown to have superior performance
over the state of the art.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Connectivity-Driven Parcellation Methods for the Human Cerebral Cortex. (arXiv:1802.06772v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06772</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06772</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this thesis, we present robust and fully-automated methods for the
subdivision of the entire human cerebral cortex based on connectivity
information. Our contributions are four-fold: First, we propose a clustering
approach to delineate a cortical parcellation that provides a reliable
abstraction of the brain's functional organisation. Second, we cast the
parcellation problem as a feature reduction problem and make use of manifold
learning and image segmentation techniques to identify cortical regions with
distinct structural connectivity patterns. Third, we present a multi-layer
graphical model that combines within- and between-subject connectivity, which
is then decomposed into a cortical parcellation that can represent the whole
population, while accounting for the variability across subjects. Finally, we
conduct a large-scale, systematic comparison of existing parcellation methods,
with a focus on providing some insight into the reliability of brain
parcellations in terms of reflecting the underlying connectivity, as well as,
revealing their impact on network analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We evaluate the proposed parcellation methods on publicly available data from
the Human Connectome Project and a plethora of quantitative and qualitative
evaluation techniques investigated in the literature. Experiments across
multiple resolutions demonstrate the accuracy of the presented methods at both
subject and group levels with regards to reproducibility and fidelity to the
data. The neuro-biological interpretation of the proposed parcellations is also
investigated by comparing parcel boundaries with well-structured properties of
the cerebral cortex. Results show the advantage of connectivity-driven
parcellations over traditional approaches in terms of better fitting the
underlying connectivity.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhaoran Zhang, Dena Guo, Meghan E. Huber, Se-Woong Park, Dagmar Sternad&lt;/p&gt;

Throwing is a uniquely human skill that requires a high degree of coordination to successfully hit a target. Timing of ball release appears crucial as previous studies report required timing accuracies as short as 1-2ms, which however appear physiologically challenging. This study mathematically and experimentally demonstrates that humans can overcome these seemingly stringent timing requirements by shaping their hand trajectories to create extended timing windows, where ball releases achieve target hits despite temporal imprecision. Subjects practiced four task variations in a virtual environment, each with a distinct geometry of the solution space. Model-based analyses of arm trajectories revealed that subjects first decreased timing error, followed by lengthening timing windows in their hand trajectories. This pattern was invariant across solution spaces, except a control case. Hence, the exquisite skill that humans evolved for throwing is achieved by developing strategies that are less sensitive to temporal variability arising from neuromotor noise. This analysis also provides an explanation why coaches emphasize the “follow-through” in many ball sports.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mMkLuA7cjXs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Many cell functions rely on the ability of microtubules to self-organize as complex networks. In plants, cortical microtubules are essential to determine cell shape as they guide the deposition of cellulose microfibrils, and thus control mechanical anisotropy of the cell wall. Here we analyze how, in turn, cell shape may influence microtubule behavior. Buidling upon previous models that confined microtubules to the cell surface, we introduce an agent model of microtubules enclosed in a three-dimensional volume. We show that the microtubule network has spontaneous aligned configurations that could explain many experimental observations without resorting to specific regulation. In particular, we find that the preferred cortical localization of microtubules emerges from directional persistence of the microtubules, and their interactions with each other and with the stiff wall. We also identify microtubule parameters that seem relatively insensitive to cell shape, such as length or number. In contrast, microtubule array anisotropy depends on local curvature of the cell surface and global orientation follows robustly the longest axis of the cell. Lastly, we find that geometric cues may be overcome, as network is capable of reorienting toward weak external directional cues. Altogether our simulations show that the microtubule network is a good transducer of weak external polarity, while at the same time, easily reaching stable global configurations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8WlSYkzzWV0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Prediction of infectious disease epidemics via weighted density ensembles</title>

Accurate and reliable predictions of infectious disease dynamics can be valuable to public health organizations that plan interventions to decrease or prevent disease transmission. A great variety of models have been developed for this task, using different model structures, covariates, and targets for prediction. Experience has shown that the performance of these models varies; some tend to do better or worse in different seasons or at different points within a season. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to obtain a single prediction that leverages the strengths of each model. We considered a range of ensemble methods that each form a predictive density for a target of interest as a weighted sum of the predictive densities from component models. In the simplest case, equal weight is assigned to each component model; in the most complex case, the weights vary with the region, prediction target, week of the season when the predictions are made, a measure of component model uncertainty, and recent observations of disease incidence. We applied these methods to predict measures of influenza season timing and severity in the United States, both at the national and regional levels, using three component models. We trained the models on retrospective predictions from 14 seasons (1997/1998–2010/2011) and evaluated each model’s prospective, out-of-sample performance in the five subsequent influenza seasons. In this test phase, the ensemble methods showed average performance that was similar to the best of the component models, but offered more consistent performance across seasons than the component models. Ensemble methods offer the potential to deliver more reliable predictions to public health decision makers.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JbP-DeXrCH0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>A major unresolved issue is how the uterus influences infertility and subfertility in cattle. Serial embryo transfer was previously used to classify heifers as high-fertile (HF), subfertile (SF), or infertile (IF). To assess pregnancy loss, two in vivo-produced embryos were transferred into HF, SF, and IF heifers on day 7,...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/T5aJ6ERL4II&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dysregulation of NEUROG2 plays a key role in focal cortical dysplasia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25187</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25187</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs) are an important cause of drug-resistant epilepsy. In this work we aimed to investigate whether abnormal gene regulation, mediated by microRNA, could be involved in FCD type II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We used total RNA from the brain tissue of 16 patients with FCD type II and 28 controls. MicroRNA expression was initially assessed by microarray. Quantitative PCR (qPCR), &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; hybridization, luciferase reporter assays and deep sequencing for genes in the mTOR pathway were performed to validate and further explore our initial study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: hsa-let-7f (p=0.039), hsa-miR-31 (p=0.0078) and hsa-miR34a (p=0.021) were downregulated in FCD type II, whereas a transcription factor involved in neuronal and glial fate specification, &lt;em&gt;NEUROG2&lt;/em&gt; (p&amp;lt;0.05), was upregulated. We also found that the &lt;em&gt;RND2&lt;/em&gt; gene, a &lt;em&gt;NEUROG2-&lt;/em&gt;target, is upregulated (p&amp;lt;0.001). &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments showed that hsa-miR-34a downregulates &lt;em&gt;NEUROG2&lt;/em&gt; by binding to its 5'-untranslated region. Moreover, we observed strong nuclear expression of &lt;em&gt;NEUROG2&lt;/em&gt; in balloon cells and dysmorphic neurons and found that 28.5% of our patients presented brain somatic mutations in genes of the mTOR pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our findings suggest a new molecular mechanism, in which &lt;em&gt;NEUROG2&lt;/em&gt; has a pivotal and central role in the pathogenesis of FCD type II. In this way, we found that the downregulation of hsa-miR-34a leads to upregulation of &lt;em&gt;NEUROG2,&lt;/em&gt; and consequently to overexpression of the &lt;em&gt;RND2&lt;/em&gt; gene. These findings indicate that a faulty coupling in neuronal differentiation and migration mechanisms may explain the presence of aberrant cells and complete dyslamination in FCD type II.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Small inhibitory neuronal circuits have long been identified as key neuronal
motifs to generate and modulate the coexisting rhythms of various motor
functions. Our paper highlights the role of a cellular switching mechanism to
orchestrate such circuits. The cellular switch makes the circuits
reconfigurable, robust, adaptable, and externally controllable. Without this
cellular mechanism, the circuits rhythms entirely rely on specific tunings of
the synaptic connectivity, which makes them rigid, fragile, and difficult to
control externally. We illustrate those properties on the much studied
architecture of a small network controlling both the pyloric and gastric
rhythms of crabs. The cellular switch is provided by a slow negative
conductance often neglected in mathematical modeling of central pattern
generators. We propose that this conductance is simple to model and key to
computational studies of rhythmic circuit neuromodulation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Closing the loop on multisensory interactions: A neural architecture for multisensory causal inference and recalibration. (arXiv:1802.06591v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06591</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06591</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When the brain receives input from multiple sensory systems, it is faced with
the question of whether it is appropriate to process the inputs in combination,
as if they originated from the same event, or separately, as if they originated
from distinct events. Furthermore, it must also have a mechanism through which
it can keep sensory inputs calibrated to maintain the accuracy of its internal
representations. We have developed a neural network architecture capable of i)
approximating optimal multisensory spatial integration, based on Bayesian
causal inference, and ii) recalibrating the spatial encoding of sensory
systems. The architecture is based on features of the dorsal processing
hierarchy, including the spatial tuning properties of unisensory neurons and
the convergence of different sensory inputs onto multisensory neurons.
Furthermore, we propose that these unisensory and multisensory neurons play
dual roles in i) encoding spatial location as separate or integrated estimates
and ii) accumulating evidence for the independence or relatedness of
multisensory stimuli. We further propose that top-down feedback connections
spanning the dorsal pathway play key a role in recalibrating spatial encoding
at the level of early unisensory cortices. Our proposed architecture provides
possible explanations for a number of human electrophysiological and
neuroimaging results and generates testable predictions linking neurophysiology
with behaviour.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The synchronous dynamics of an array of excitable oscillators, coupled via a
generic graph, is studied. Non homogeneous perturbations can grow and destroy
synchrony, via a self-consistent instability which is solely instigated by the
intrinsic network dynamics. By acting on the characteristic time-scale of the
network modulation, one can make the examined system to behave as its
(partially) averaged analog. This result if formally obtained by proving an
extended version of the averaging theorem, which allows for partial averages to
be carried out. Oscillation death are reported to follow the onset of the
network driven instability.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Communication processes within the human brain at different cognitive states
are neither well understood nor completely characterized. We assess
communication processes in the human connectome using ant colony-inspired
cooperative learning algorithm, starting from a source with no a priori
information about the network topology, and cooperatively searching for the
target through a pheromone-inspired model. This framework relies on two
parameters, namely pheromone perception and edge perception, to define the
cognizance and subsequent behaviour of the ants on the network and, overall,
the communication processes happening between source and target nodes.
Simulations obtained through different configurations allow the identification
of path-ensembles that are involved in the communication between node pairs.
These path-ensembles may contain different number of paths depending on the
perception parameters and the node pair. In order to assess the different
communication regimes displayed on the simulations and their associations with
functional connectivity, we introduce two network measurements, effective
path-length and arrival rate. These communication features are tested as
individual as well as combined predictors of functional connectivity during
different tasks. Finally, different communication regimes are found in
different specialized functional networks. Overall, this framework may be used
as a test-bed for different communication regimes on top of an underlaying
topology.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Optimal allocation of attentional resource to multiple items with unequal relevance. (arXiv:1802.06456v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In natural perception, different items (objects) in a scene are rarely
equally relevant to the observer. The brain improves performance by directing
attention to the most relevant items, for example the ones most likely to be
probed. For a general set of probing probabilities, it is not known how
attentional resources should be allocated to maximize performance. Here, we
investigate the optimal strategy for allocating a fixed resource budget E among
N items when on each trial, only one item gets probed. We develop an efficient
algorithm that, for any concave utility function, reduces the N-dimensional
problem to a set of N one-dimensional problems that the brain could plausibly
solve. We find that the intuitive strategy of allocating resource in proportion
to the probing probabilities is in general not optimal. In particular, in some
tasks, if resource is low, the optimal strategy involves allocating zero
resource to items with a nonzero probability of being probed. Our work opens
the door to normatively guided studies of attentional allocation.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06426</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Natural learners must compute an estimate of future outcomes that follow from
a stimulus in continuous time. Critically, the learner cannot in general know a
priori the relevant time scale over which meaningful relationships will be
observed. Widely used reinforcement learning algorithms discretize continuous
time and use the Bellman equation to estimate exponentially-discounted future
reward. However, exponential discounting introduces a time scale to the
computation of value. Scaling is a serious problem in continuous time:
efficient learning with scaled algorithms requires prior knowledge of the
relevant scale. That is, with scaled algorithms one must know at least part of
the solution to a problem prior to attempting a solution. We present a
computational mechanism, developed based on work in psychology and
neuroscience, for computing a scale-invariant timeline of future events. This
mechanism efficiently computes a model for future time on a
logarithmically-compressed scale, and can be used to generate a scale-invariant
power-law-discounted estimate of expected future reward. Moreover, the
representation of future time retains information about what will happen when,
enabling flexible decision making based on future events. The entire timeline
can be constructed in a single parallel operation.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding information processing in the brain requires the ability to
determine the functional connectivity between the different regions of the
brain. We present a method using transfer entropy to extract this flow of
information between brain regions from spike-train data commonly taken in
neurological experiments. Transfer entropy is a statistical measure based in
information theory that attempts to quantify the information flow from one
process to another, and has been applied to find connectivity in simulated
spike train data. Due to statistical error in the estimator, inferring
functional connectivity requires a method for determining significance in the
transfer entropy values. We discuss the issues with numerical estimation of
transfer entropy and resulting challenges in determining significance before
presenting the trial-shuffle method as a viable option. The trial-shuffle
method, for spike train data that is split into multiple trials, determines
significant transfer entropy values independently for each individual pair of
neurons, rather than globally comparing all neuron transfer entropy values. We
establish the viability of this method by showing that it performs comparably
or better to a previous approach in the literature based on the false positive
detection rate. We then investigate the performance of the trial-shuffle method
in terms of information flow within a network as we vary model parameters.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06108</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06108</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In order to understand the formation of social conventions we need to know
the specific role of control and learning in multi-agent systems. To advance in
this direction, we propose, within the framework of the Distributed Adaptive
Control (DAC) theory, a novel Control-based Reinforcement Learning architecture
(CRL) that can account for the acquisition of social conventions in multi-agent
populations that are solving a benchmark social decision-making problem. Our
new CRL architecture, as a concrete realization of DAC multi-agent theory,
implements a low-level sensorimotor control loop handling the agent's reactive
behaviors (pre-wired reflexes), along with a layer based on model-free
reinforcement learning that maximizes long-term reward. We apply CRL in a
multi-agent game-theoretic task in which coordination must be achieved in order
to find an optimal solution. We show that our CRL architecture is able to both
find optimal solutions in discrete and continuous time and reproduce human
experimental data on standard game-theoretic metrics such as efficiency in
acquiring rewards, fairness in reward distribution and stability of convention
formation.

	<description>It has been known for decades that degeneration of the locus coeruleus (LC), the major noradrenergic nucleus in the brain, occurs in both Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), but it was given scant attention. It is now recognized that hyperphosphorylated tau in the LC is the first detectable AD-like neuropathology in the human brain, α-synuclein inclusions in the LC represent an early step in PD, and experimental LC lesions exacerbate neuropathology and cognitive/behavioral deficits in animal models.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence shows that cognitive deficits in Alzheimer disease (AD) are
associated with disruptions in brain functional connectivity. Thus, the
identification of alterations in AD functional networks has become a topic of
increasing interest. However, to what extent AD induces disruption of the
balance of local and global information processing in the human brain remains
elusive. The main objective of this study is to explore the dynamic topological
changes of AD networks in terms of brain network segregation and integration.
We used electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded from 20 participants (10 AD
patients and 10 healthy controls) during resting state. Functional brain
networks were reconstructed using EEG source connectivity computed in different
frequency bands. Graph theoretical analyses were performed assess differences
between both groups. Results revealed that AD networks, compared to networks of
age matched healthy controls, are characterized by lower global information
processing (integration) and higher local information processing (segregation).
Results showed also significant correlation between the alterations in the AD
patients functional brain networks and their cognitive scores. These findings
may contribute to the development of EEG network-based test that could
strengthen results obtained from currently used neurophysiological tests in
neurodegenerative diseases.

The intuitive response to an invading pathogen is to start disease management as rapidly as possible, since this would be expected to minimise the future impacts of disease. However, since more spread data become available as an outbreak unfolds, processes underpinning pathogen transmission can almost always be characterised more precisely later in epidemics. This allows the future progression of any outbreak to be forecast more accurately, and so enables control interventions to be targeted more precisely. There is also the chance that the outbreak might die out without any intervention whatsoever, making prophylactic control unnecessary. Optimal decision-making involves continuously balancing these potential benefits of waiting against the possible costs of further spread. We introduce a generic, extensible data-driven algorithm based on parameter estimation and outbreak simulation for making decisions in real-time concerning when and how to control an invading pathogen. The Control Smart Algorithm (CSA) resolves the trade-off between the competing advantages of controlling as soon as possible and controlling later when more information has become available. We show–using a generic mathematical model representing the transmission of a pathogen of agricultural animals or plants through a population of farms or fields–how the CSA allows the timing and level of deployment of vaccination or chemical control to be optimised. In particular, the algorithm outperforms simpler strategies such as intervening when the outbreak size reaches a pre-specified threshold, or controlling when the outbreak has persisted for a threshold length of time. This remains the case even if the simpler methods are fully optimised in advance. Our work highlights the potential benefits of giving careful consideration to the question of when to start disease management during emerging outbreaks, and provides a concrete framework to allow policy-makers to make this decision.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eHGUKYlmuFA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Microbes may maximize the number of daughter cells per time or per amount of nutrients consumed. These two strategies correspond, respectively, to the use of enzyme-efficient or substrate-efficient metabolic pathways. In reality, fast growth is often associated with wasteful, yield-inefficient metabolism, and a general thermodynamic trade-off between growth rate and biomass yield has been proposed to explain this. We studied growth rate/yield trade-offs by using a novel modeling framework, Enzyme-Flux Cost Minimization (EFCM) and by assuming that the growth rate depends directly on the enzyme investment per rate of biomass production. In a comprehensive mathematical model of core metabolism in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, we screened all elementary flux modes leading to cell synthesis, characterized them by the growth rates and yields they provide, and studied the shape of the resulting rate/yield Pareto front. By varying the model parameters, we found that the rate/yield trade-off is not universal, but depends on metabolic kinetics and environmental conditions. A prominent trade-off emerges under oxygen-limited growth, where yield-inefficient pathways support a 2-to-3 times higher growth rate than yield-efficient pathways. EFCM can be widely used to predict optimal metabolic states and growth rates under varying nutrient levels, perturbations of enzyme parameters, and single or multiple gene knockouts.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PF2X5U7oHsI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Trade-off between synergy and efficacy in combinations of HIV-1 latency-reversing agents</title>

Eradicating HIV-1 infection is difficult because of the reservoir of latently infected cells that gets established soon after infection, remains hidden from antiretroviral drugs and host immune responses, and retains the capacity to reignite infection following the cessation of treatment. Drugs called latency-reversing agents (LRAs) are being developed to reactivate latently infected cells and render them susceptible to viral cytopathicity or immune killing. Whereas individual LRAs have failed to induce adequate reactivation, pairs of LRAs have been identified recently that act synergistically and hugely increase reactivation levels compared to individual LRAs. The maximum synergy achievable with LRA pairs is of clinical importance, as it would allow latency-reversal with minimal drug exposure. Here, we employed stochastic simulations of HIV-1 transcription and translation in latently infected cells to estimate this maximum synergy. We incorporated the predominant mechanisms of action of the two most promising classes of LRAs, namely, protein kinase C agonists and histone deacetylase inhibitors, and quantified the activity of individual LRAs in the two classes by mapping our simulations to corresponding &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments. Without any adjustable parameters, our simulations then quantitatively captured experimental observations of latency-reversal when the LRAs were used in pairs. Performing simulations representing a wide range of drug concentrations, we estimated the maximum synergy achievable with these LRA pairs. Importantly, we found with all the LRA pairs we considered that concentrations yielding the maximum synergy did not yield the maximum latency-reversal. Increasing concentrations to increase latency-reversal compromised synergy, unravelling a trade-off between synergy and efficacy in LRA combinations. The maximum synergy realizable with LRA pairs would thus be restricted by the desired level of latency-reversal, a constrained optimum we elucidated with our simulations. We expect this trade-off to be important in defining optimal LRA combinations that would maximize synergy while ensuring adequate latency-reversal.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/phsH7ykbW1M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In this paper we study antibiotic-induced &lt;i&gt;C. difficile&lt;/i&gt; infection (CDI), caused by the toxin-producing &lt;i&gt;C. difficile&lt;/i&gt; (CD), and implement clinically-inspired simulated treatments in a computational framework that synthesizes a generalized Lotka-Volterra (gLV) model with SIR modeling techniques. The gLV model uses parameters derived from an experimental mouse model, in which the mice are administered antibiotics and subsequently dosed with CD. We numerically identify which of the experimentally measured initial conditions are vulnerable to CD colonization, then formalize the notion of &lt;i&gt;CD susceptibility&lt;/i&gt; analytically. We simulate fecal transplantation, a clinically successful treatment for CDI, and discover that both the transplant timing and transplant donor are relevant to the the efficacy of the treatment, a result which has clinical implications. We incorporate two nongeneric yet dangerous attributes of CD into the gLV model, sporulation and antibiotic-resistant mutation, and for each identify relevant SIR techniques that describe the desired attribute. Finally, we rely on the results of our framework to analyze an experimental study of fecal transplants in mice, and are able to explain observed experimental results, validate our simulated results, and suggest model-motivated experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qSm7F3mpZsc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A stochastic and dynamical view of pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells</title>

Pluripotent embryonic stem cells are of paramount importance for biomedical sciences because of their innate ability for self-renewal and differentiation into all major cell lines. The fateful decision to exit or remain in the pluripotent state is regulated by complex genetic regulatory networks. The rapid growth of single-cell sequencing data has greatly stimulated applications of statistical and machine learning methods for inferring topologies of pluripotency regulating genetic networks. The inferred network topologies, however, often only encode Boolean information while remaining silent about the roles of dynamics and molecular stochasticity inherent in gene expression. Herein we develop a framework for systematically extending Boolean-level network topologies into higher resolution models of networks which explicitly account for the promoter architectures and gene state switching dynamics. We show the framework to be useful for disentangling the various contributions that gene switching, external signaling, and network topology make to the global heterogeneity and dynamics of transcription factor populations. We find the pluripotent state of the network to be a steady state which is robust to global variations of gene switching rates which we argue are a good proxy for epigenetic states of individual promoters. The temporal dynamics of exiting the pluripotent state, on the other hand, is significantly influenced by the rates of genetic switching which makes cells more responsive to changes in extracellular signals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MLPDGaz5bYY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Computational protein design has been successful in modeling fixed backbone proteins in a single conformation. However, when modeling large ensembles of flexible proteins, current methods in protein design have been insufficient. Large barriers in the energy landscape are difficult to traverse while redesigning a protein sequence, and as a result current design methods only sample a fraction of available sequence space. We propose a new computational approach that combines traditional structure-based modeling using the Rosetta software suite with machine learning and integer linear programming to overcome limitations in the Rosetta sampling methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, which we call BROAD, by benchmarking the performance on increasing predicted breadth of anti-HIV antibodies. We use this novel method to increase predicted breadth of naturally-occurring antibody VRC23 against a panel of 180 divergent HIV viral strains and achieve 100% predicted binding against the panel. In addition, we compare the performance of this method to state-of-the-art multistate design in Rosetta and show that we can outperform the existing method significantly. We further demonstrate that sequences recovered by this method recover known binding motifs of broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies. Finally, our approach is general and can be extended easily to other protein systems. Although our modeled antibodies were not tested &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, we predict that these variants would have greatly increased breadth compared to the wild-type antibody.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/B8PVMHDaU0E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Predicting Recovery in Acute Post-stroke Aphasia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25184</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25184</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Many stroke patients show remarkable recovery of language after initial severe impairment, but it is difficult to predict which patients will show good recovery. We aimed to identify patient and lesion characteristics that together predict the best naming outcome in four studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We report two longitudinal studies that identified two variables at onset that were strongly associated with good recovery of naming (the most common residual deficit in aphasia) in the first six months after stroke: damage to left posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) and/or superior longitudinal fasciculus/arcuate fasciculus (SLF/AF) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use. We then tested these variables in two independent cohorts of chronic left hemisphere stroke patients, using chi squared tests and multivariable logistic regression for dichotomous outcomes and t-tests for continuous outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Lesion load in left pSTG and SLF/AF was associated with poorer naming outcome. Preservation of these areas and use of SSRIs were associated with naming recovery, independent of lesion volume, time since stroke, and depression. Patients with damage to these critical areas showed better naming outcome if they took SSRIs for three months after stroke. Those with preservation of these critical areas achieved good recovery of naming regardless of SSRI use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Lesion load in left pSTG and SLF/AF at onset predicts later naming performance. Although based on a small number of patients, our preliminary results suggest outcome might be modulated by SSRIs, but these associations need to be confirmed in a larger randomized controlled trial.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objectives&lt;/b&gt;: To assess [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 tau-PET uptake patterns across the primary progressive aphasia (PPA) variants (logopenic, semantic and agrammatic), examine regional uptake patterns of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 independent of clinical diagnosis, and compare the diagnostic utility of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451, [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-fluorodeoxygluclose (FDG)-PET and MRI to differentiate the PPA variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We performed statistical parametric mapping of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 across 40 PPA patients (logopenic-PPA=14, semantic-PPA=13 and agrammatic-PPA=13) compared to 80 cognitively normal, PiB-negative controls, age and gender matched 2:1. Principal component analysis of regional [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 tau-PET SUVR was performed to understand underlying patterns of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 uptake independent of clinical diagnosis. Penalized multinomial regression analyses were utilized to assess diagnostic utility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Logopenic-PPA showed striking uptake throughout neocortex, particularly temporoparietal, compared to controls, semantic-PPA and agrammatic-PPA. Semantic-PPA and agrammatic-PPA showed milder patterns of focal [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 uptake. Semantic-PPA showed elevated uptake (left&amp;gt;right) in anteromedial temporal lobes, compared to controls and agrammatic-PPA. Agrammatic-PPA showed elevated uptake (left&amp;gt;right) throughout prefrontal white matter and in subcortical grey matter structures, compared to controls and semantic-PPA. The principal component analysis of regional [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 indicated two primary dimensions, a severity dimension that distinguished logopenic-PPA from agrammatic-PPA and semantic-PPA, and a frontal-versus-temporal contrast that distinguishes agrammatic-PPA and semantic-PPA cases. Diagnostic utility of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451was superior to MRI and at least equal to FDG-PET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451binding characteristics differ across the PPA variants, and were excellent at distinguishing between the variants. [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451binding characteristics were as good or better than other brain imaging modalities utilized in clinical practice, suggesting that [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 may have clinical diagnostic utility in PPA.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The role of noise modeling in the estimation of resting-state brain effective connectivity. (arXiv:1802.05533v1 [cs.SY])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Causal relations among neuronal populations of the brain are studied through
the so-called effective connectivity (EC) network. The latter is estimated from
EEG or fMRI measurements, by inverting a generative model of the corresponding
data. It is clear that the goodness of the estimated network heavily depends on
the underlying modeling assumptions. In this present paper we consider the EC
estimation problem using fMRI data in resting-state condition. Specifically, we
investigate on how to model endogenous fluctuations driving the neuronal
activity.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Putting a bug in ML: The moth olfactory network learns to read MNIST. (arXiv:1802.05405v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05405</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05405</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We seek to (i) characterize the learning architectures exploited in
biological neural networks for training on very few samples, and (ii) port
these algorithmic structures to a machine learning context. The Moth Olfactory
Network is among the simplest biological neural systems that can learn, and its
architecture includes key structural elements widespread in biological neural
nets, such as cascaded networks, competitive inhibition, high intrinsic noise,
sparsity, reward mechanisms, and Hebbian plasticity. The interactions of these
structural elements play a critical enabling role in rapid learning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assign a computational model of the Moth Olfactory Network the task of
learning to read the MNIST digits. This model, MothNet, is closely aligned with
the moth's known biophysics and with in vivo electrode data, including data
collected from moths learning new odors. We show that MothNet successfully
learns to read given very few training samples (1 to 20 samples per class). In
this few-samples regime, it substantially outperforms standard machine learning
methods such as nearest-neighbors, support-vector machines, and convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). The MothNet architecture illustrates how our proposed
algorithmic structures, derived from biological brains, can be used to build
alternative deep neural nets (DNNs) that may potentially avoid some of DNNs
current learning rate limitations. This novel, bio-inspired neural network
architecture offers a valuable complementary approach to DNN design.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neonatal Ethanol Disturbs the Normal Maturation of Parvalbumin Interneurons Surrounded by Subsets of Perineuronal Nets in the Cerebral Cortex: Partial Reversal by Lithium</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Reduction in parvalbumin-positive (PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) interneurons is observed in adult mice exposed to ethanol at postnatal day 7 (P7), a late gestation fetal alcohol spectrum disorder model. To evaluate whether PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells are lost, or PV expression is reduced, we quantified PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and associated perineuronal net (PNN)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell densities in barrel cortex. While PNN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell density was not reduced by P7 ethanol, PV cell density decreased by 25% at P90 with no decrease at P14. PNN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in controls were virtually all PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, whereas more than 20% lacked PV in ethanol-treated adult animals. P7 ethanol caused immediate apoptosis in 10% of GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in G42 mice, which express GFP in a subset of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells, and GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell density decreased by 60% at P90 without reduction at P14. The ethanol effect on PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell density was attenuated by lithium treatment at P7 or at P14–28. Thus, reduced PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell density may be caused by disrupted cell maturation, in addition to acute apoptosis. This effect may be regionally specific: in the dentate gyrus, P7 ethanol reduced PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell density by 70% at P14 and both PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and PNN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell densities by 50% at P90, and delayed lithium did not alleviate ethanol’s effect.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neural progenitor proliferation and cell fate decision from self-renewal to differentiation are crucial factors in determining brain size and morphology. The cytoskeletal dependent regulation of these processes is not entirely known. The actin-binding filamin A (FlnA) was shown to regulate proliferation of progenitors by directing changes in cell cycles proteins such as Cdk1 during G2/M phase. Here we report that functional loss of FlnA not only affects the rate of proliferation by altering cell cycle length but also causes a defect in early differentiation through changes in cell fate specification. FlnA interacts with Rho GTPase RhoA, and FlnA loss impairs RhoA activation. Disruption of either of these cytoskeletal associated proteins delays neurogenesis and promotes neural progenitors to remain in proliferative states. Aurora kinase B (Aurkb) has been implicated in cytokinesis, and peaks in expression during the G2/M phase. Inhibition of FlnA or RhoA impairs Aurkb degradation and alters its localization during mitosis. Overexpression of Aurkb replicates the same delay in neurogenesis seen with loss of FlnA or RhoA. Our findings suggest that shared cytoskeletal processes can direct neural progenitor proliferation by regulating the expression and localization of proteins that are implicated in the cell cycle progression and cell fate specification.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Excitation of Cortical nNOS/NK1R Neurons by Hypocretin 1 is Independent of Sleep Homeostasis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy015</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy015/4864331?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We have proposed that cortical nNOS/NK1R interneurons have a role in sleep homeostasis. The hypocretins (orexins) are wake-promoting neuropeptides and hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt) neurons project to the cortex. Hcrt peptides affect deep layer cortical neurons, and Hcrt receptor 1 (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Hcrtr1; Ox1r&lt;/span&gt;) mRNA is expressed in cortical nNOS/NK1R cells. Therefore, we investigated whether Hcrt neuron stimulation affects cingulate cortex nNOS/NK1R neurons. Bath application of HCRT1/orexin-A evoked an inward current and membrane depolarization in most nNOS/NK1R cells which persisted in tetrodotoxin; optogenetic stimulation of Hcrt terminals expressing channelrhodopsin-2 confirmed these results, and pharmacological studies determined that HCRTR1 mediated these responses. Single-cell RT-PCR found &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Hcrtr1&lt;/span&gt; mRNA in 31% of nNOS/NK1R cells without any &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Hcrtr2&lt;/span&gt; mRNA expression; immunohistochemical studies of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Hcrtr1-EGFP&lt;/span&gt; mice confirmed that a minority of nNOS/NK1R cells express HCRTR1. When Hcrt neurons degenerated in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;orexin-tTA;TetO DTA&lt;/span&gt; mice, the increased EEG delta power during NREM sleep produced in response to 4 h sleep deprivation and c-FOS expression in cortical nNOS/NK1R cells during recovery sleep were indistinguishable from that of controls. We conclude that Hcrt excitatory input to these deep layer cells is mediated through HCRTR1 but is unlikely to be involved in the putative role of cortical nNOS/NK1R neurons in sleep homeostasis.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The capacity of the liver to convert the metabolic input received from the incoming portal and arterial blood into the metabolic output of the outgoing venous blood has three major determinants: The intra-hepatic blood flow, the transport of metabolites between blood vessels (sinusoids) and hepatocytes and the metabolic capacity of hepatocytes. These determinants are not constant across the organ: Even in the normal organ, but much more pronounced in the fibrotic and cirrhotic liver, regional variability of the capillary blood pressure, tissue architecture and the expression level of metabolic enzymes (zonation) have been reported. Understanding how this variability may affect the regional metabolic capacity of the liver is important for the interpretation of functional liver tests and planning of pharmacological and surgical interventions. Here we present a mathematical model of the sinusoidal tissue unit (STU) that is composed of a single sinusoid surrounded by the space of Disse and a monolayer of hepatocytes. The total metabolic output of the liver (arterio-venous glucose difference) is obtained by integration across the metabolic output of a representative number of STUs. Application of the model to the hepatic glucose metabolism provided the following insights: (i) At portal glucose concentrations between 6–8 mM, an intra-sinusoidal glucose cycle may occur which is constituted by glucose producing periportal hepatocytes and glucose consuming pericentral hepatocytes, (ii) Regional variability of hepatic blood flow is higher than the corresponding regional variability of the metabolic output, (iii) a spatially resolved metabolic functiogram of the liver is constructed. Variations of tissue parameters are equally important as variations of enzyme activities for the control of the arterio-venous glucose difference.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AgA-qivk3lY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Optimizing homeostatic cell renewal in hierarchical tissues</title>

In order to maintain homeostasis, mature cells removed from the top compartment of hierarchical tissues have to be replenished by means of differentiation and self-renewal events happening in the more primitive compartments. As each cell division is associated with a risk of mutation, cell division patterns have to be optimized, in order to minimize or delay the risk of malignancy generation. Here we study this optimization problem, focusing on the role of division tree length, that is, the number of layers of cells activated in response to the loss of terminally differentiated cells, which is related to the balance between differentiation and self-renewal events in the compartments. Using both analytical methods and stochastic simulations in a metapopulation-style model, we find that shorter division trees are advantageous if the objective is to minimize the total number of one-hit mutants in the cell population. Longer division trees on the other hand minimize the accumulation of two-hit mutants, which is a more likely evolutionary goal given the key role played by tumor suppressor genes in cancer initiation. While division tree length is the most important property determining mutant accumulation, we also find that increasing the size of primitive compartments helps to delay two-hit mutant generation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/q-YEQltn26I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Across academia and industry, text mining has become a popular strategy for keeping up with the rapid growth of the scientific literature. Text mining of the scientific literature has mostly been carried out on collections of abstracts, due to their availability. Here we present an analysis of 15 million English scientific full-text articles published during the period 1823–2016. We describe the development in article length and publication sub-topics during these nearly 250 years. We showcase the potential of text mining by extracting published protein–protein, disease–gene, and protein subcellular associations using a named entity recognition system, and quantitatively report on their accuracy using gold standard benchmark data sets. We subsequently compare the findings to corresponding results obtained on 16.5 million abstracts included in MEDLINE and show that text mining of full-text articles consistently outperforms using abstracts only.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aiRwNvO1kfc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25147-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restoring the circulation is the primary goal in emergency treatment of cerebral ischemia. However, better understanding of how the brain responds to energy depletion could help predict the time available for resuscitation until irreversible damage and advance development of interventions that prolong this span. Experimentally, injury to central neurons begins only with anoxic depolarization. This potentially reversible, spreading wave typically starts 2 to 5 minutes after the onset of severe ischemia, marking the onset of a toxic intraneuronal change that eventually results in irreversible injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25147-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this in the human brain, we performed recordings with either subdural electrode strips (n = 4) or intraparenchymal electrode arrays (n = 5) in patients with devastating brain injury that resulted in activation of a Do Not Resuscitate–Comfort Care order followed by terminal extubation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25147-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies produced a decline in brain tissue partial pressure of oxygen (p&lt;sub&gt;ti&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and circulatory arrest. Silencing of spontaneous electrical activity developed simultaneously across regional electrode arrays in 8 patients. This silencing, termed “nonspreading depression,” developed during the steep falling phase of p&lt;sub&gt;ti&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (intraparenchymal sensor, n = 6) at 11 (interquartile range [IQR] = 7–14) mmHg. Terminal spreading depolarizations started to propagate between electrodes 3.9 (IQR = 2.6–6.3) minutes after onset of the final drop in perfusion and 13 to 266 seconds after nonspreading depression. In 1 patient, terminal spreading depolarization induced the initial electrocerebral silence in a spreading depression pattern; circulatory arrest developed thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25147-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results provide fundamental insight into the neurobiology of dying and have important implications for survivable cerebral ischemic insults.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25161-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a broad class of inherited metabolic diseases caused by the defective activity of lysosomal enzymes. Central nervous system (CNS) manifestations are present in roughly 50% of LSD patients and represent an unmet medical need for them. We explored the therapeutic potential of metallothioneins (MTs), a newly identified family of proteins with reported neuroprotective roles, in the murine models of two LSDs with CNS involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25161-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MT-1 overexpressing transgenic mice (MTtg) were crossed with the murine models of Batten and Krabbe diseases. Changes in the survival and manifestations of the disease in the MTtg setting were assessed. In addition, we analyzed the therapeutic effects of MT-1 CNS gene delivery in one of these LSD models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25161-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constitutive expression of MT-1 exerted favorable phenotypic effects in both LSD models. MT-LSD mice showed a 5% to 10% increase in survival and slower disease progression as compared to not-transgenic LSD mice. Rescue of Purkinje cells from degeneration and apoptosis was also observed in the MT-LSD models. This phenotypic amelioration was accompanied by a modulation of the disease-associated activated inflammatory microglia phenotype, and by a reduction of oxidative stress. Importantly, for the clinical translation of our findings, the very same effects were obtained when MTs were delivered to brains by systemic AAV gene transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 and 2 in human temporal lobe epilepsy</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25149-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a chronic epilepsy syndrome defined by seizures and progressive neurological disabilities, including cognitive impairments, anxiety, and depression. Here, human TLE specimens were investigated focusing on the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) and complex 2 (mTORC2) activities in the brain, given that both pathways may represent unique targets for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25149-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgically resected hippocampal and temporal lobe samples from therapy-resistant TLE patients were analyzed by western blotting to quantify the expression of established mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity markers and upstream or downstream signaling pathways involving the two complexes. Histological and immunohistochemical techniques were used to assess hippocampal and neocortical structural abnormalities and cell-specific expression of individual biomarkers. Samples from patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II served as positive controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25149-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found significantly increased expression of phospho-mTOR (Ser2448), phospho-S6 (Ser235/236), phospho-S6 (Ser240/244), and phospho-Akt (Ser473) in TLE samples compared to controls, consistent with activation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Our work identified the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathways as potential mTORC1 and mTORC2 upstream activators. In addition, we found that overactive mTORC2 signaling was accompanied by induction of two protein kinase B–dependent prosurvival pathways, as evidenced by increased inhibitory phosphorylation of forkhead box class O3a (Ser253) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (Ser9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25149-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data demonstrate that mTOR signaling is significantly dysregulated in human TLE, offering new targets for pharmacological interventions. Specifically, clinically available drugs that suppress mTORC1 without compromising mTOR2 signaling, such as rapamycin and its analogs, may represent a new group of antiepileptogenic agents in TLE patients.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Central vein sign differentiates Multiple Sclerosis from central nervous system inflammatory vasculopathies</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25146-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objectives&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In multiple sclerosis (MS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a sensitive tool for detecting white matter lesions, but its diagnostic specificity is still suboptimal; ambiguous cases are frequent in clinical practice. Detection of perivenular lesions in the brain (the “central vein sign”) improves the pathological specificity of MS diagnosis, but comprehensive evaluation of this MRI biomarker in MS-mimicking inflammatory and/or autoimmune diseases, such as central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory vasculopathies, is lacking. In a multicenter study, we assessed the frequency of perivenular lesions in MS versus systemic autoimmune diseases with CNS involvement and primary angiitis of the CNS (PACNS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25146-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 31 patients with inflammatory CNS vasculopathies and 52 with relapsing–remitting MS, 3-dimensional T2*-weighted and T2–fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images were obtained during a single MRI acquisition after gadolinium injection. For each lesion, the central vein sign was evaluated according to consensus guidelines. For each patient, lesion count, volume, and brain location, as well as fulfillment of dissemination in space MRI criteria, were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25146-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS showed higher frequency of perivenular lesions (median = 88%) than did inflammatory CNS vasculopathies (14%), without overlap between groups or differences between 3T and 1.5T MRI. Among inflammatory vasculopathies, Behçet disease showed the highest median frequency of perivenular lesions (34%), followed by PACNS (14%), antiphospholipid syndromes (12%), Sjögren syndrome (11%), and systemic lupus erythematosus (0%). When a threshold of 50% perivenular lesions was applied, central vein sign discriminated MS from inflammatory vasculopathies with a diagnostic accuracy of 100%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25146-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central vein sign differentiates inflammatory CNS vasculopathies from MS at standard clinical magnetic field strengths.

	<description>The ability of the retina to adapt to changes in mean light intensity and contrast is well known. Classically, however, adaptation is thought to affect gain but not to change the visual modality encoded by a given type of retinal neuron. Recent findings reveal unexpected dynamic properties in mouse retinal neurons that challenge this view. Specifically, certain cell types change the visual modality they encode with variations in ambient illumination or following repetitive visual stimulation. These discoveries demonstrate that computations performed by retinal circuits with defined architecture can change with visual input.</description>

	<description>Vyas et al. ask whether learning “covertly,” without physical movements, can transfer to overt behavior. By using visuomotor perturbations, they show that covert and overt movements derive from a common neural substrate consisting of motor cortical preparatory activity that facilitates transfer of learning.</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Gain control with A-type potassium current: IA as a switch between divisive and subtractive inhibition. (arXiv:1802.04794v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04794</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04794</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons process information by transforming barrages of synaptic inputs into
spiking activity. Synaptic inhibition suppresses the output firing activity of
a neuron, and is commonly classified as having a subtractive or divisive effect
on a neuron's output firing activity. Subtractive inhibition can narrow the
range of inputs that evoke spiking activity by eliminating responses to
non-preferred inputs. Divisive inhibition is a form of gain control: it
modifies firing rates while preserving the range of inputs that evoke firing
activity. Since these two &quot;modes&quot; of inhibition have distinct impacts on neural
coding, it is important to understand the biophysical mechanisms that
distinguish these response profiles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use simulations and mathematical analysis of a neuron model to find the
specific conditions for which inhibitory inputs have subtractive or divisive
effects. We identify a novel role for the A-type Potassium current (IA). In our
model, this fast-activating, slowly- inactivating outward current acts as a
switch between subtractive and divisive inhibition. If IA is strong (large
maximal conductance) and fast (activates on a time-scale similar to spike
initiation), then inhibition has a subtractive effect on neural firing. In
contrast, if IA is weak or insufficiently fast-activating, then inhibition has
a divisive effect on neural firing. We explain these findings using dynamical
systems methods to define how a spike threshold condition depends on synaptic
inputs and IA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that neurons can &quot;self-regulate&quot; the gain control
effects of inhibition via combinations of synaptic plasticity and/or modulation
of the conductance and kinetics of A-type Potassium channels. This novel role
for IA would add flexibility to neurons and networks, and may relate to recent
observations of divisive inhibitory effects on neurons in the nucleus of the
solitary tract.

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Why Do Hearing Aids Fail to Restore Normal Auditory Perception?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30032-8?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30032-8?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Hearing loss is a widespread condition that is linked to declines in quality of life and mental health. Hearing aids remain the treatment of choice, but, unfortunately, even state-of-the-art devices provide only limited benefit for the perception of speech in noisy environments. While traditionally viewed primarily as a loss of sensitivity, hearing loss is also known to cause complex distortions of sound-evoked neural activity that cannot be corrected by amplification alone. This Opinion article describes the effects of hearing loss on neural activity to illustrate the reasons why current hearing aids are insufficient and to motivate the use of new technologies to explore directions for improving the next generation of devices.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Respiration-Entrained Brain Rhythms Are Global but Often Overlooked</title>

	<description>We revisit recent evidence showing that nasal respiration entrains oscillations at the same frequency as breathing in several regions of the rodent brain. Moreover, respiration modulates the amplitude of a specific gamma sub-band (70–120Hz), most prominently in frontal regions. Since rodents often breathe at delta and theta frequencies, we caution that previous studies on delta and theta power and their cross-regional synchrony, as well as on delta–gamma and theta–gamma coupling, may have detected the respiration-entrained rhythm and respiration–gamma coupling.</description>

	<description>Matt et al. introduce α-actinin as a critical postsynaptic docking protein for PSD-95 and AMPARs. They found that disruption of the PSD-95-α-actinin interaction by point-mutating the essential residues on either protein leads to reduced synaptic localization of PSD-95 and AMPARs.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Global White Matter Diffusion Characteristics Predict Longitudinal Cognitive Change Independently of Amyloid Status in Clinically Normal Older Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy031</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy031/4841692?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;White matter degradation has been proposed as one possible explanation for age-related cognitive decline. In the present study, we examined 2 main questions: 1) Do diffusion characteristics predict longitudinal change in cognition independently or synergistically with amyloid status? 2) Are the effects of diffusion characteristics on longitudinal cognitive change tract-specific or global in nature? Cognitive domains of executive function, episodic memory, and processing speed were measured annually (mean follow-up = 3.93 ± 1.25 years). Diffusion tensor imaging and Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography were performed at baseline in 265 clinically normal older adults (aged 63–90). Tract-specific diffusion was measured as the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) for 9 major white matter tracts. Global diffusion was measured as the mean FA across the 9 white matter tracts. Linear mixed models demonstrated independent, rather than synergistic, effects of global FA and amyloid status on cognitive decline. After controlling for amyloid status, lower global FA was associated with worse longitudinal performance in episodic memory and processing speed, but not executive function. After accounting for global FA, none of the individual tracts predicted a significant change in cognitive performance. These findings suggest that global, rather than tract-specific, diffusion characteristics predict longitudinal cognitive decline independently of amyloid status.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Prenatal Stress, Mood, and Gray Matter Volume in Young Adulthood</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy030</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy030/4841691?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;This study aimed to determine whether prenatal stress, measured by the number of stressful life events during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, might relate to mood dysregulation and altered brain structure in young adulthood. Participants included 93 young adults from a community-based birth cohort from the Czech Republic. Information on prenatal stress exposure was collected from their mothers in 1990−1992. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mood-related data were collected from the young adults in 2015. MRI analyses focused on overall gray matter (GM) volume and GM volume of cortical regions previously associated with major depression. Higher prenatal stress predicted more mood dysregulation, lower overall GM volume, and lower GM volume in mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus in young adulthood. We observed no prenatal stress by sex interactions for any of the relations. We conclude that prenatal stress is an important risk factor that relates to worse mood states and altered brain structure in young adulthood irrespective of sex. Our results point to the importance and long-lasting effects of prenatal programming and suggest that offspring of mothers who went through substantial stress during pregnancy might benefit from early intervention that would reduce the odds of mental illness in later life.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Differential Dependence of GABAergic and Glutamatergic Neurons on Glia for the Establishment of Synaptic Transmission</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy029</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy029/4841690?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In the mammalian cortex, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons represent 2 major neuronal classes, which establish inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively. Despite differences in their anatomy, physiology and developmental origin, both cell types require support from glial cells, particularly astrocytes, for their growth and survival. Recent experiments indicate that glutamatergic neurons also depend on astrocytes for synapse formation. However, it is not clear if the same holds true for GABAergic neurons. By studying highly pure GABAergic cell cultures, established through fluorescent activated cell sorting, we find that purified GABAergic neurons are smaller and have reduced survival, nevertheless they establish robust synaptic transmission in the absence of glia. Support from glial cells reverses morphological and survival deficits, but does little to alter synaptic transmission. In contrast, in cultures of purified glutamatergic neurons, morphological development, survival and synaptic transmission are collectively dependent on glial support. Thus, our results demonstrate a fundamental difference in the way GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons depend on glia for the establishment of synaptic transmission, a finding that has important implications for our understanding of how neuronal networks develop.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: System-Specific Patterns of Thalamocortical Connectivity in Early Brain Development as Revealed by Structural and Functional MRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy028</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy028/4841689?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The normal development of thalamocortical connections plays a critical role in shaping brain connectivity in the prenatal and postnatal periods. Recent studies using advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in neonates and infants have shown that abnormal thalamocortical connectivity is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, all these studies have focused on a single neuroimaging modality, overlooking the dynamic relationship between structure and function at this early stage. Here, we study the relationship between structural and functional thalamocortical connectivity patterns derived from healthy full-term infants scanned with diffusion-weighted MRI and resting-state functional MRI within the first weeks of life (mean gestational age = 39.3 ± 1.2 weeks; age at scan = 24.2 ± 7.9 days). Our results show that while there is, in general, good spatial agreement between both MRI modalities, there are regional variations that are system-specific: regions involving primary-sensory cortices exhibit greater structural/functional overlap, whereas higher-order association areas such as temporal and posterior parietal cortices show divergence in spatial patterns of each modality. This variability illustrates the complementarity of both modalities and highlights the importance of multimodal approaches.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Determinants of Optogenetic Cortical Spreading Depolarizations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy021</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy021/4841687?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical spreading depolarization (SD) is the electrophysiological event underlying migraine aura, and a critical contributor to secondary damage after brain injury. Experimental models of SD have been used for decades in migraine and brain injury research; however, they are highly invasive and often cause primary tissue injury, diminishing their translational value. Here we present a non-invasive method to trigger SDs using light-induced depolarization in transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in neurons (Thy1-ChR2-YFP). Focal illumination (470 nm, 1–10 mW) through intact skull using an optical fiber evokes power-dependent steady extracellular potential shifts and local elevations of extracellular [K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] that culminate in an SD when power exceeds a threshold. Using the model, we show that homozygous mice are significantly more susceptible to SD (i.e., lower light thresholds) than heterozygous ChR2 mice. Moreover, we show SD susceptibility differs significantly among cortical divisions (motor, whisker barrel, sensory, visual, in decreasing order of susceptibility), which correlates with relative channelrhodopsin-2 expression. Furthermore, the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 blocks the transition to SD without diminishing extracellular potential shifts. Altogether, our data show that the optogenetic SD model is highly suitable for examining physiological or pharmacological modulation of SD in acute and longitudinal studies.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Self-Face Recognition Begins to Share Active Region in Right Inferior Parietal Lobule with Proprioceptive Illusion During Adolescence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy027</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy027/4840635?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We recently reported that right-side dominance of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in self-body recognition (proprioceptive illusion) task emerges during adolescence in typical human development. Here, we extend this finding by demonstrating that functional lateralization to the right IPL also develops during adolescence in another self-body (specifically a self-face) recognition task. We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 60 right-handed healthy children (8–11 years), adolescents (12–15 years), and adults (18–23 years; 20 per group) while they judged whether a presented face was their own (Self) or that of somebody else (Other). We also analyzed fMRI data collected while they performed proprioceptive illusion task. All participants performed self-face recognition with high accuracy. Among brain regions where self-face-related activity (Self vs. Other) developed, only right IPL activity developed predominantly for self-face processing, with no substantial involvement in other-face processing. Adult-like right-dominant use of IPL emerged during adolescence, but was not yet present in childhood. Adult-like common activation between the tasks also emerged during adolescence. Adolescents showing stronger right-lateralized IPL activity during illusion also showed this during self-face recognition. Our results suggest the importance of the right IPL in neuronal processing of information associated with one’s own body in typically developing humans.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neural Representations of the Full Spatial Field in Auditory Cortex of Awake Marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Unlike visual signals, sound can reach the ears from any direction, and the ability to localize sounds from all directions is essential for survival in a natural environment. Previous studies have largely focused on the space in front of a subject that is also covered by vision and were often limited to measuring spatial tuning along the horizontal (azimuth) plane. As a result, we know relatively little about how the auditory cortex responds to sounds coming from spatial locations outside the frontal space where visual information is unavailable. By mapping single-neuron responses to the full spatial field in awake marmoset (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Callithrix jacchus&lt;/span&gt;), an arboreal animal for which spatial processing is vital in its natural habitat, we show that spatial receptive fields in several auditory areas cover all spatial locations. Several complementary measures of spatial tuning showed that neurons were tuned to both frontal space and rear space (outside the coverage of vision), as well as the space above and below the horizontal plane. Together, these findings provide valuable new insights into the representation of all spatial locations by primate auditory cortex.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: PDK1 Deficit Impairs the Development of the Dentate Gyrus in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy024</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy024/4840633?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) is crucial for the development of the dentate gyrus (DG), the first gateway receiving afferent inputs from the entorhinal cortex. However, the role of PDK1 in DG development is unclear. In the present study, by crossing &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Pdk1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;fl/fl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice with the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Emx1-cre&lt;/span&gt; line, we identified that the ablation of PDK1 disrupted the development of DG via decreasing the proliferation, and increasing the differentiation of dentate neural progenitor cells, downregulating AKT activity and upregulating GSK3β signaling. Moreover, PDK1 deletion disrupted the distribution of Reelin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells and decreased the level of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Reelin&lt;/span&gt; mRNA which may contribute to the defective migration of progenitor cells and the disrupted radial glial scaffolds. Furthermore, the inhibition of GSK3β activity partially restored the decreased proliferation of primary neural stem cells in vitro. Taken together, our data indicated that the ablation of PDK1 affected the proliferation and differentiation of dentate neural progenitor cells in mice.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Cerebellar Functional Connectivity in Term- and Very Preterm-Born Infants</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy023</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy023/4840632?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical resting state networks have been consistently identified in infants using resting state-functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Comparable studies in adults have demonstrated cerebellar components of well-established cerebral networks. However, there has been limited investigation of early cerebellar functional connectivity. We acquired non-sedated rs-fMRI data in the first week of life in 57 healthy, term-born infants and at term-equivalent postmenstrual age in 20 very preterm infants (mean birth gestational age 27 ± 2 weeks) without significant cerebral or cerebellar injury. Seed correlation analyses were performed using regions of interests spanning the cortical and subcortical gray matter and cerebellum. Parallel analyses were performed using rs-fMRI data acquired in 100 healthy adults. Our results demonstrate that cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity is well-established by term. Intra- and cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity were largely similar in infants and adults. However, infants showed more functional connectivity structure within the cerebellum, including stronger homotopic correlations and more robust anterior–posterior anticorrelations. Prematurity was associated with reduced correlation magnitudes, but no alterations in intra- and cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity topography. These results add to the growing evidence that the cerebellum plays an important role in shaping early brain development during infancy.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Environmental Influences on Infant Cortical Thickness and Surface Area</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy020</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy020/4840631?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) vary widely between individuals and are associated with intellectual ability and risk for various psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. Factors influencing this variability remain poorly understood, but the radial unit hypothesis, as well as the more recent supragranular cortex expansion hypothesis, suggests that prenatal and perinatal influences may be particularly important. In this report, we examine the impact of 17 major demographic and obstetric history variables on interindividual variation in CT and SA in a unique sample of 805 neonates who received MRI scans of the brain around 2 weeks of age. Birth weight, postnatal age at MRI, gestational age at birth, and sex emerged as important predictors of SA. Postnatal age at MRI, paternal education, and maternal ethnicity emerged as important predictors of CT. These findings suggest that individual variation in infant CT and SA is explained by different sets of environmental factors with neonatal SA more strongly influenced by sex and obstetric history and CT more strongly influenced by socioeconomic and ethnic disparities. Findings raise the possibility that interventions aimed at reducing disparities and improving obstetric outcomes may alter prenatal/perinatal cortical development.&lt;/span&gt;</description>
