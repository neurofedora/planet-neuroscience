	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present an error-controlled mesh refinement procedure for needle insertion
simulation and apply it to the simulation of electrode implantation for deep
brain stimulation, including brain shift. Our approach enables to control the
error in the computation of the displacement and stress fields around the
needle tip and needle shaft by suitably refining the mesh, whilst maintaining a
coarser mesh in other parts of the domain. We demonstrate through academic and
practical examples that our approach increases the accuracy of the displacement
and stress fields around the needle without increasing the computational
expense. This enables real-time simulations. The proposed methodology has
direct implications to increase the accuracy and control the computational
expense of the simulation of percutaneous procedures such as biopsy,
brachytherapy, regional anesthesia, or cryotherapy and can be essential to the
development of robotic guidance.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07635</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The functional network approach, where fMRI BOLD time series are mapped to
networks depicting functional relationships between brain areas, has opened new
insights into the function of the human brain. In this approach, the choice of
network nodes is of crucial importance. One option is to consider fMRI voxels
as nodes. This results in a large number of nodes, making network analysis and
interpretation of results challenging. A common alternative is to use
pre-defined clusters of anatomically close voxels, Regions of Interest (ROIs).
This approach assumes that voxels within ROIs are functionally similar. Because
these two approaches result in different network structures, it is crucial to
understand what happens to network connectivity when moving from the voxel
level to the ROI level. We show that the consistency of ROIs, defined as the
mean Pearson correlation coefficient between the time series of their voxels,
varies widely in resting-state experimental data. Therefore the assumption of
similar voxel dynamics within each ROI does not generally hold. Further, the
time series of low-consistency ROIs may be highly correlated, resulting in
spurious links in ROI-level networks. Based on these results, we recommend that
averaging BOLD signals over anatomically defined ROIs should be carefully
considered.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Sharing deep generative representation for perceived image reconstruction from human brain activity. (arXiv:1704.07575v1 [cs.AI])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Decoding human brain activities via functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) has gained increasing attention in recent years. While encouraging
results have been reported in brain states classification tasks, reconstructing
the details of human visual experience still remains difficult. Two main
challenges that hinder the development of effective models are the perplexing
fMRI measurement noise and the high dimensionality of limited data instances.
Existing methods generally suffer from one or both of these issues and yield
dissatisfactory results. In this paper, we tackle this problem by casting the
reconstruction of visual stimulus as the Bayesian inference of missing view in
a multiview latent variable model. Sharing a common latent representation, our
joint generative model of external stimulus and brain response is not only
&quot;deep&quot; in extracting nonlinear features from visual images, but also powerful
in capturing correlations among voxel activities of fMRI recordings. The
nonlinearity and deep structure endow our model with strong representation
ability, while the correlations of voxel activities are critical for
suppressing noise and improving prediction. We devise an efficient variational
Bayesian method to infer the latent variables and the model parameters. To
further improve the reconstruction accuracy, the latent representations of
testing instances are enforced to be close to that of their neighbours from the
training set via posterior regularization. Experiments on three fMRI recording
datasets demonstrate that our approach can more accurately reconstruct visual
stimuli.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Neurogenesis and multiple plasticity mechanisms enhance associative memory retrieval in a spiking network model of the hippocampus. (arXiv:1704.07526v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07526</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07526</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal CA3 is crucial for the formation of long-term associative memory.
It has a heavily recurrent connectivity, and memories are thought to be stored
as memory engrams in the CA3. However, despite its importance for memory
storage and retrieval, spiking network models of the CA3 to date are relatively
small-scale, and exist as only proof-of-concept models. Specifically, how
neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus affects memory encoding and retrieval in the
CA3 is not studied in such spiking models. Our work is the first to develop a
biologically plausible spiking neural network model of hippocampal memory
encoding and retrieval, with at least an order-of-magnitude more neurons than
previous models. It is also the first to investigate the effect of neurogenesis
on CA3 memory encoding and retrieval. Using such a model, we first show that a
recently developed plasticity model is crucial for good encoding and retrieval.
Next, we show how neural properties related to neurogenesis and neuronal death
enhance storage and retrieval of associative memories in the CA3. In
particular, we show that without neurogenesis, increasing number of CA3 neurons
are recruited by each new memory stimulus, resulting in a corresponding
increase in inhibition and poor memory retrieval as more memories are encoded.
Neurogenesis, on the other hand, maintains the number of CA3 neurons recruited
per stimulus, and enables the retrieval of recent memories, while forgetting
the older ones. Our model suggests that structural plasticity (provided by
neurogenesis and apoptosis) is required in the hippocampus for memory encoding
and retrieval when the network is overloaded; synaptic plasticity alone does
not suffice. The above results are obtained from an exhaustive study in the
different plasticity models and network parameters.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is a complex network that supports mental function. The
nascent field of network neuroscience applies tools from mathematics to
neuroimaging data in the hopes of shedding light on cognitive function. A
critical question arising from these empirical studies is how to modulate a
human brain network to treat cognitive deficits or enhance mental abilities.
While historically a number of tools have been employed to modulate mental
states (such as cognitive behavioral therapy and brain stimulation),
theoretical frameworks to guide these interventions - and to optimize them for
clinical use - are fundamentally lacking. One promising and as-yet
underexplored approach lies in a sub-discipline of engineering known as network
control theory. Here, we posit that network control fundamentally relates to
mind control, and that this relationship highlights important areas for future
empirical research and opportunities to translate knowledge in practical
domains. We clarify the conceptual intersection between neuroanatomy,
cognition, and control engineering in the context of network neuroscience.
Finally, we discuss the challenges, ethics, and promises of mind control.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05659</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce a novel tool for analyzing complex network dynamics, allowing
for cascades of causally-related events, which we call causal webs (c-webs), to
be separated from other non-causally-related events. This tool shows that
traditionally-conceived avalanches may contain mixtures of spatially-distinct
but temporally-overlapping cascades of events, and dynamical disorder or noise.
In contrast, c-webs separate these components, unveiling previously hidden
features of the network and dynamics. We apply our method to mouse cortical
data with resulting statistics which demonstrate for the first time that
neuronal avalanches are not merely composed of causally-related events.

	<description>Low phosphate (Pi) availability constrains plant development and seed production in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. When Pi is scarce, modifications of root system architecture (RSA) enhance the soil exploration ability of the plant and lead to an increase in Pi uptake. In Arabidopsis, an iron-dependent mechanism reprograms primary root...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/jnKeswxjoFg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patient brains with Parkinson's disease or Dementia with Lewy bodies show aggregation of alpha-synuclein in pre-cerebellar brainstem structures. Furthermore, patients exhibit resting tremor, unstable gait and impaired balance which may be associated with cerebellar dysfunction. Therefore, we screened the cerebella of 12 patients with alpha-synucleinopathies for neuropathological changes. Cerebellar nuclei and neighboring white matter displayed numerous aggregates, while lobules were mildly affected. Cerebellar aggregation pathology may suggest a prion-like spread originating from affected precerebellar structures and the high homogeneity between patients with Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease shows that both diseases likely belong to the same neuropathological spectrum.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To assess prognostic factors for a second clinical attack and a first disability worsening event in pediatric clinically isolated syndrome (pCIS) suggestive of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: A cohort of 770 pCIS patients was followed-up for at least 10 years. Cox proportional hazard models and RECursive Partitioning and AMalgamation (RECPAM) tree-regression were used to analyze data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: In pCIS, female sex and a multifocal onset were risk factors for a second clinical attack (HR, 95% CI: 1.28, 1.06-1.55; 1.42, 1.10-1.84, respectively), whereas disease modifying drugs (DMDs) exposure reduced this risk (HR, 95% CI: 0.75, 0.60-0.95). After pediatric onset MS (POMS) diagnosis, age at onset younger than 15 years and DMDs exposure decreased the risk of a first EDSS worsening event (HR, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.42-0.83; 0.75, 0.71-0.80, respectively), whereas the occurrence of relapse/s increased this risk (HR, 95% CI: 5.08, 3.46-7.46).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;An exploratory RECPAM analysis highlighted a significant higher incidence of a first EDSS worsening event in patients with multifocal or isolated spinal-cord or optic neuritis involvement at onset in comparison to those with an isolated supratentorial or brainstem syndrome. A Cox regression model including RECPAM classes confirmed DMDs exposure as the most protective factor against EDSS worsening events and relapses as the most important risk factor for attaining EDSS worsening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: This work represents an important step forward in identifying predictors of unfavorable course in pCIS and POMS and supports a protective effect of early DMDs treatment in preventing MS development and disability accumulation in this population.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Efficient Probabilistic Inference in Generic Neural Networks Trained with Non-Probabilistic Feedback. (arXiv:1601.03060v4 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03060</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03060</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Animals perform near-optimal probabilistic inference in a wide range of
psychophysical tasks. Probabilistic inference requires trial-to-trial
representation of the uncertainties associated with task variables and
subsequent use of this representation. Previous work has implemented such
computations using neural networks with hand-crafted and task-dependent
operations. We show that generic neural networks trained with a simple
error-based learning rule perform near-optimal probabilistic inference in nine
common psychophysical tasks. In a probabilistic categorization task,
error-based learning in a generic network simultaneously explains a monkey's
learning curve and the evolution of qualitative aspects of its choice behavior.
In all tasks, the number of neurons required for a given level of performance
grows sub-linearly with the input population size, a substantial improvement on
previous implementations of probabilistic inference. The trained networks
develop a novel sparsity-based probabilistic population code. Our results
suggest that probabilistic inference emerges naturally in generic neural
networks trained with error-based learning rules.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Mass univariate testing biases the detection of interaction effects in whole-brain analysis of variance.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/130773v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/130773v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Whole-brain analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a common analytic approach in cognitive neuroscience. Researchers are often interested in exploring whether brain activity reflects to the interaction of two factors. Disordinal interactions - where there is a reversal of the effect of one independent variable at a level of a second independent variable - are common in the literature. It is well established in power-analyses of factorial ANOVAs that certain patterns of interactions, such as disordinal (e.g., cross-over interactions) require less power than others to detect. This fact, combined with the perils of mass univariate testing suggests that testing for interactions in whole-brain ANOVAs, may be biased towards the detection of disordinal interactions. Here, we report on a series of simulated analysis --including whole-brain fMRI data using realistic multi-source noise parameters-- that demonstrate a bias towards the detection of disordinal interactions in mass-univariate contexts. Moreover, results of these simulations indicated that spurious disordinal interactions are found at common thresholds and cluster sizes at the group level. Moreover, simulations based on implanting true ordinal interaction effects can nevertheless appear like crossover effects at realistic levels of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when performing mass univariate testing at the whole-brain level, potentially leading to erroneous conclusions when interpreted as is. Simulations of varying sample sizes and SNR levels show that this bias is driven primarily by SNR and larger sample sizes do little to ameliorate this issue. Together, the results of these simulations argue for caution when searching for ordinal interactions in whole-brain ANOVA.</description>

	<description>The inverse base-rate effect (IBRE) describes an apparent irrationality in human decision making whereby people tend to ignore category base rates and choose rarer options when classifying ambiguous stimuli. According to some theories, people choose rare categories for ambiguous stimuli because rare cues draw more attention. Other theories predict that people choose rare categories because the ambiguous stimuli contrast with the more well-established patterns in common categories. In this experiment, we used multi-voxel pattern analysis to decode which features of ambiguous stimuli participants are activating during an fMRI version of the IBRE task. We show that individuals engage qualitatively distinct neural processes when making rare versus common responses: choosing a rarer category involved activation of cues associated with the common category. Consistent with inferential theories of base-rate neglect, our findings suggest that this surprising behavior involves a deliberative mechanism not explained by purely associative models.</description>

	<description>Inter-individual differences in sleep spindles are highly correlated with &quot;Reasoning&quot; abilities (problem solving skills; i.e., the ability to employ logic, identify complex patterns), but not Short Term Memory or Verbal abilities. Simultaneous electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) have revealed brain activations time-locked to spindles (e.g., thalamic, paralimbic, and motor cortical areas)-yet the functional significance of inter-individual differences in spindle-related brain activation remains to be investigated. Using EEG-fMRI during sleep, we identified, for the first time, the neural activation patterns time-locked to spindles that are correlated with cognitive abilities. Similar to previous studies, activations time-locked to spindles were observed in thalamocortical circuitry and basal ganglia regions. Importantly, spindle-related activation in a subset of these regions were specifically related to inter-individual differences in Reasoning, but not STM or Verbal abilities. These results may help elucidate the physiological mechanisms which support the function of sleep for the capacity for reasoning.</description>

	<description>Neurodevelopmental insults such as malformations of cortical development (MCD) are a common cause of psychiatric disorders, learning impairments and epilepsy. Animals with MCDs have impairments in spatial cognition that, remarkably, are improved by post-weaning environmental enrichment (EE). To establish the network-level mechanisms responsible for these impacts, hippocampal in vivo single unit recordings were performed in freely moving animals in an open arena. We took a generalized linear modeling approach to extract fine spike timing (FST) characteristics and related these to place cell fidelity used as a surrogate of spatial cognition. We find that MCDs disrupt FST and place-modulated rate coding in hippocampal CA1 and that EE restores both to normal. Moreover, FST parameters predict spatial coherence of neurons, suggesting that mechanisms determining FST are critical for cognition. This suggests that FST parameters could represent a therapeutic target to improve cognition even in the context of a structurally abnormal brain.</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;SUMMARY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We report 5 cases of acute heart failure (AHF) related to multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses. AHF was inaugural in 3 patients, always preceded or accompanied by signs of brainstem dysfunction; it was severe, requiring intensive care management. Echocardiography showed left ventricular hypokinesis. No other cause of AHF has been found. All patients showed a new medullary lesion on brain MRI. All had rapid and complete recovery of ventricular function after intravenous corticosteroids. We concluded to a takotsubo phenomenon. Physicians should be aware of rare cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in MS relapses. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt; To assess the associations of blood biomarkers of carbohydrate, lipid and apolipoprotein metabolisms with the future risk of ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt; In the Apolipoprotein-related MOrtality RISk (AMORIS) study, we enrolled 636,132 men and women during 1985-1996 in Stockholm, Sweden with measurements of serum glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B (apoB), and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). Serum LDL-C and HDL-C were either directly measured or calculated from total cholesterol, triglycerides and apoA-I. The cohort was followed until end of 2011. We used Cox models and mixed-effects models to first estimate the associations between these biomarkers and ALS incidence, and secondly to assess the changes of these biomarkers during the 20 years before ALS diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt; One-unit increase of LDL-C (HR=1.14, 95%CI=1.02-1.27), apoB (HR=1.68, 95%CI=1.17-2.42) and apoB/apoA-I ratio (HR=1.90, 95%CI=1.29-2.78) was associated with a higher incidence of ALS. High glucose level (≥6.11 mmol/L) was associated with a lower incidence (HR=0.62, 95%CI=0.42-0.93), whereas high LDL-C/HDL-C (≥3.50; HR=1.50, 95%CI 1.15-1.96) and high apoB/apoA-I (≥0.90 for men, ≥0.8 for women; HR=1.41, 95%CI 1.04-1.90) ratios were associated with a higher incidence. During the 10 years before diagnosis, ALS patients had increasing levels of LDL-C, HDL-C, apoB and apoA-I, whereas gradually decreasing levels of LDL-C/HDL-C and apoB/apoA-I ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt; Alterations in the carbohydrate, lipid and apolipoprotein metabolisms are associated with ALS risk and may serve as prodromal symptoms decades before ALS diagnosis. The imbalance between apoB and apoA-I as well as between LDL-C and HDL-C may be an etiologic mechanism for ALS and needs to be further studied. This article is protected by copyright.

The rapid development of sequencing technology has led to an explosive accumulation of genomic sequence data. Clustering is often the first step to perform in sequence analy- sis, and hierarchical clustering is one of the most commonly used approaches for this purpose. However, it is currently computationally expensive to perform hierarchical clustering of extremely large sequence datasets due to its quadratic time and space complexities. In this paper we developed a new algorithm called ESPRIT-Forest for parallel hierarchical clustering of sequences. The algorithm achieves subquadratic time and space complexity and maintains a high clustering accuracy comparable to the standard method. The basic idea is to organize sequences into a pseudo-metric based partitioning tree for sub-linear time searching of nearest neighbors, and then use a new multiple-pair merging criterion to construct clusters in parallel using multiple threads. The new algorithm was tested on the human microbiome project (HMP) dataset, currently one of the largest published microbial 16S rRNA sequence dataset. Our experiment demonstrated that with the power of parallel computing it is now compu- tationally feasible to perform hierarchical clustering analysis of tens of millions of sequences.

The formation and stability of synapses are key questions in neuroscience. Post-synaptic domains have been classically conceived as resulting from local insertion and turnover of proteins at the synapse. However, insertion is likely to occur outside the post-synaptic domains and advances in single-molecule imaging have shown that proteins diffuse in the plane of the membrane prior to their accumulation at synapses. We quantitatively investigated this scenario using computer simulations and mathematical analysis, taking for definiteness the specific case of inhibitory synapse components, i.e., the glycine receptors (GlyR) and the associated gephyrin scaffolding protein. The observed domain sizes of scaffold clusters can be explained by a dynamic balance between the aggregation of gephyrin proteins diffusing while bound to GlyR and their turnover at the neuron membrane. We also predict the existence of extrasynaptic clusters with a characteristic size distribution that significantly contribute to the size fluctuations of synaptic domains. New super-resolution data for gephyrin proteins established the existence of extrasynaptic clusters the sizes of which are consistent with the model predictions in a range of model parameters. At a general level, our results highlight aggregation with removal as a non-equilibrium phase separation which produces structures of tunable size.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-0Vh2Pl2bgo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Representational models: A common framework for understanding encoding, pattern-component, and representational-similarity analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005508</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jörn Diedrichsen, Nikolaus Kriegeskorte&lt;/p&gt;

Representational models specify how activity patterns in populations of neurons (or, more generally, in multivariate brain-activity measurements) relate to sensory stimuli, motor responses, or cognitive processes. In an experimental context, representational models can be defined as hypotheses about the distribution of activity profiles across experimental conditions. Currently, three different methods are being used to test such hypotheses: encoding analysis, pattern component modeling (PCM), and representational similarity analysis (RSA). Here we develop a common mathematical framework for understanding the relationship of these three methods, which share one core commonality: all three evaluate the second moment of the distribution of activity profiles, which determines the representational geometry, and thus how well any feature can be decoded from population activity. Using simulated data for three different experimental designs, we compare the power of the methods to adjudicate between competing representational models. PCM implements a likelihood-ratio test and therefore provides the most powerful test if its assumptions hold. However, the other two approaches—when conducted appropriately—can perform similarly. In encoding analysis, the linear model needs to be appropriately regularized, which effectively imposes a prior on the activity profiles. With such a prior, an encoding model specifies a well-defined distribution of activity profiles. In RSA, the unequal variances and statistical dependencies of the dissimilarity estimates need to be taken into account to reach near-optimal power in inference. The three methods render different aspects of the information explicit (e.g. single-response tuning in encoding analysis and population-response representational dissimilarity in RSA) and have specific advantages in terms of computational demands, ease of use, and extensibility. The three methods are properly construed as complementary components of a single data-analytical toolkit for understanding neural representations on the basis of multivariate brain-activity data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/D1EUTvjXL8w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Predicting explorative motor learning using decision-making and motor noise</title>

A fundamental problem faced by humans is learning to select motor actions based on noisy sensory information and incomplete knowledge of the world. Recently, a number of authors have asked whether this type of motor learning problem might be very similar to a range of higher-level decision-making problems. If so, participant behaviour on a high-level decision-making task could be predictive of their performance during a motor learning task. To investigate this question, we studied performance during an explorative motor learning task and a decision-making task which had a similar underlying structure with the exception that it was not subject to motor (execution) noise. We also collected an independent measurement of each participant’s level of motor noise. Our analysis showed that explorative motor learning and decision-making could be modelled as the (approximately) optimal solution to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process bounded by noisy neural information processing. The model was able to predict participant performance in motor learning by using parameters estimated from the decision-making task and the separate motor noise measurement. This suggests that explorative motor learning can be formalised as a sequential decision-making process that is adjusted for motor noise, and raises interesting questions regarding the neural origin of explorative motor learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pwLVQOklUD0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Intrinsically-generated fluctuating activity in excitatory-inhibitory networks</title>

Recurrent networks of non-linear units display a variety of dynamical regimes depending on the structure of their synaptic connectivity. A particularly remarkable phenomenon is the appearance of strongly fluctuating, chaotic activity in networks of deterministic, but randomly connected rate units. How this type of intrinsically generated fluctuations appears in more realistic networks of spiking neurons has been a long standing question. To ease the comparison between rate and spiking networks, recent works investigated the dynamical regimes of randomly-connected rate networks with segregated excitatory and inhibitory populations, and firing rates constrained to be positive. These works derived general dynamical mean field (DMF) equations describing the fluctuating dynamics, but solved these equations only in the case of purely inhibitory networks. Using a simplified excitatory-inhibitory architecture in which DMF equations are more easily tractable, here we show that the presence of excitation qualitatively modifies the fluctuating activity compared to purely inhibitory networks. In presence of excitation, intrinsically generated fluctuations induce a strong increase in mean firing rates, a phenomenon that is much weaker in purely inhibitory networks. Excitation moreover induces two different fluctuating regimes: for moderate overall coupling, recurrent inhibition is sufficient to stabilize fluctuations; for strong coupling, firing rates are stabilized solely by the upper bound imposed on activity, even if inhibition is stronger than excitation. These results extend to more general network architectures, and to rate networks receiving noisy inputs mimicking spiking activity. Finally, we show that signatures of the second dynamical regime appear in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DbZz07hx9B4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recurrent neural network architectures can have useful computational
properties, with complex temporal dynamics. However, evaluation of recurrent
dynamic architectures requires solution of systems of differential equations,
and the number of evaluations required to determine their response to a given
input can vary with the input, or can be indeterminate altogether in the case
of oscillations or instability. In feed-forward networks, by contrast, only a
single pass through the network is needed to determine the response to a given
input. Modern machine-learning systems are designed to operate efficiently on
feed-forward architectures. We hypothesised that two-layer feedforward
architectures with simple, deterministic dynamics could approximate the
responses of single-layer recurrent network architectures. By identifying the
fixed-point responses of a given recurrent network, we trained two-layer
networks to directly approximate the fixed-point response to a given input.
These feed-forward networks then embodied useful computations, including
competitive interactions, information transformations and noise rejection. Our
approach was able to find useful approximations to recurrent networks, which
can then be evaluated in linear and deterministic time complexity.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a computational model of neuron, called firing cell (FC),
properties of which cover such phenomena as attenuation of receptors for
external stimuli, delay and decay of postsynaptic potentials, modification of
internal weights due to propagation of postsynaptic potentials through the
dendrite, modification of properties of the analog memory for each input due to
a pattern of short-time synaptic potentiation or long-time synaptic
potentiation (LTP), output-spike generation when the sum of all inputs exceeds
a threshold, and refraction. The cell may take one of the three forms:
excitatory, inhibitory, and receptory. The computer simulations showed that,
depending on the phase of input signals, the artificial neuron's output
frequency may demonstrate various chaotic behaviors.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Towards a theory of cortical columns: From spiking neurons to interacting neural populations of finite size. (arXiv:1611.00294v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural population equations such as neural mass or field models are widely
used to study brain activity on a large scale. However, the relation of these
models to the properties of single neurons is unclear. Here we derive an
equation for several interacting populations at the mesoscopic scale starting
from a microscopic model of randomly connected generalized integrate-and-fire
neuron models. Each population consists of 50 -- 2000 neurons of the same type
but different populations account for different neuron types. The stochastic
population equations that we find reveal how spike-history effects in
single-neuron dynamics such as refractoriness and adaptation interact with
finite-size fluctuations on the population level. Efficient integration of the
stochastic mesoscopic equations reproduces the statistical behavior of the
population activities obtained from microscopic simulations of a full spiking
neural network model. The theory describes nonlinear emergent dynamics like
finite-size-induced stochastic transitions in multistable networks and
synchronization in balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The
mesoscopic equations are employed to rapidly simulate a model of a local
cortical microcircuit consisting of eight neuron types. Our theory establishes
a general framework for modeling finite-size neural population dynamics based
on single cell and synapse parameters and offers an efficient approach to
analyzing cortical circuits and computations.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Invariant recognition drives neural representations of action sequences. (arXiv:1606.04698v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the actions of others from visual stimuli is a crucial aspect of
human visual perception that allows individuals to respond to social cues.
Humans are able to identify similar behaviors and discriminate between distinct
actions despite transformations, like changes in viewpoint or actor, that
substantially alter the visual appearance of a scene. This ability to
generalize across complex transformations is a hallmark of human visual
intelligence. Advances in understanding motion perception at the neural level
have not always translated in precise accounts of the computational principles
underlying what representation our visual cortex evolved or learned to compute.
Here we test the hypothesis that invariant action discrimination might fill
this gap. Recently, the study of artificial systems for static object
perception has produced models, CNNs, that achieve human level performance in
complex discriminative tasks. Within this class of models, architectures that
better support invariant object recognition also produce image representations
that match those implied by human and primate neural data. However, whether
these models produce representations of action sequences that support
recognition across complex transformations and closely follow neural
representations remains unknown. Here we show that spatiotemporal CNNs
appropriately categorize video stimuli into actions, and that deliberate model
modifications that improve performance on an invariant action recognition task
lead to data representations that better match human neural recordings. Our
results support our hypothesis that performance on invariant discrimination
dictates the neural representations of actions computed by human visual cortex.

	<description>UK Biobank is a large-scale prospective epidemiological study with all data accessible to researchers worldwide. It is currently in the process of bringing back 100,000 of the original participants for brain, heart and body MRI, carotid ultrasound and low-dose bone/fat x-ray. The brain imaging component covers 6 modalities (T1, T2 FLAIR, susceptibility weighted MRI, Resting fMRI, Task fMRI and Diffusion MRI). Raw and processed data from the first 10,000 imaged subjects has recently been released for general research access. To help convert this data into useful summary information we have developed an automated processing and QC (Quality Control) pipeline that is available for use by other researchers. In this paper we describe the pipeline in detail, following a brief overview of UK Biobank brain imaging and the acquisition protocol. We also describe several quantitative investigations carried out as part of the development of both the imaging protocol and the processing pipeline.</description>

	<description>Social functioning involves learning about the social networks in which we live and interact; knowing not just our friends, but also who is friends with our friends. Here we utilized a novel incidental learning paradigm and representational similarity analysis (RSA), a functional MRI multivariate pattern analysis technique, to examine the relationship between learning social networks and the brain's response to the faces within the networks. We found that accuracy of learning face pair relationships through observation is correlated with neural similarity patterns to those pairs in the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ), the left fusiform gyrus, and the subcallosal ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), all areas previously implicated in social cognition. This model was also significant in portions of the cerebellum and thalamus. Our findings indicate that these areas of the brain not only process knowledge and understanding of others, but also support learning relations between individuals in groups.</description>

	<description>The structure of population activity in the dorsolateral striatum during the performance of motor sequences has not been characterized and it is unclear if striatal ensembles encode (predict) kinematic parameters defining how sequences are executed. Here we analyzed hundreds of striatal spike trains from naive and trained rats performing a running sequence. We found that the population response was composed of a diversity of phasic modulations covering the entire sequence. The accuracy of kinematics encoding by single neurons was around chance level but improved when neuronal ensembles were considered. The distribution of single-neuron contributions to ensemble encoding was highly skewed with a minority of neurons responsible for most of the encoding accuracy. Importantly, running speed ensemble encoding improved after learning. We propose that during motor learning, striatal ensembles adjust their task representation by tuning the activity of a minority of neurons to the kinematic parameters most relevant to motor performance.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dorsal Anterior Cingulate-Midbrain Ensemble As A Reinforcement Meta-Learner</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/130195v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/130195v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is central in higher-order cognition and in the pathogenesis of several mental disorders. Reinforcement Learning (RL), Bayesian decision-making, and cognitive control are currently the three main theoretical frameworks attempting to capture the elusive computational nature of this brain area. Although theoretical effort to explain the dACC functions is intense, no single theoretical framework managed so far to account for the myriad of relevant experimental data. Here we propose that dACC plays, in concert with midbrain catecholamine nuclei, the role of a reinforcement meta-learner. This cortical-subcortical system not only can learn and make decisions based on RL principles, but it can also learn to control the learning process itself, for both its own circuits and for other brain areas. We show that a neural model implementing this theory, the Reinforcement Meta-Learner (RML), can account for an unprecedented number of experimental findings among which effort exertion, higher-order conditioning and working memory. The RML performs meta-learning by means of approximate Bayesian inference and it respects several neuro-functional and neuro-anatomical constraints, providing a perspective that assimilates the other theoretical proposals in a single computational framework.</description>

	<description>The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) is essential for higher-level cognition, but how interactions among LPFC areas support cognitive control remains elusive. Previously, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) indicated that mid LPFC integrates abstract, rostral and concrete, caudal influences to inform context-appropriate action. Here, we use continuous theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) to causally test this model. cTBS was applied to caudal, mid, and rostral LPFC, and a control site in counterbalanced sessions. Behavioral modulations resulting from cTBS were largely predicted by information flow within the previously estimated DCM. However, cTBS to caudal LPFC unexpectedly impaired processes presumed to involve rostral LPFC. Adding a pathway from caudal LPFC to rostral LPFC significantly improved the model fit and accounted for the observed behavioral findings. These data provide causal evidence for LPFC dynamics supporting cognitive control and demonstrate the utility of combining DCM with causal manipulations to test and refine models of cognition.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dopaminergic Modulation Of Brain Signal Variability And The Functional Connectome During Cognitive Performance</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/130021v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Dopamine underlies important aspects of cognition, and has been suggested to boost cognitive performance. How dopamine modulates the large-scale brain dynamics during cognitive performance has remained elusive, however. Using functional MRI during a working memory task in healthy young human listeners, we investigated the effect of levodopa (L-dopa) on two aspects of brain dynamics, blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal variability and the connectome of large-scale cortical networks. We here show that enhanced dopaminergic signaling modulates the two potentially interrelated aspects of large-scale cortical dynamics during cognitive performance, and the degree of these modulations is able to explain inter-individual differences in L-dopa-induced behavioral benefits. Relative to placebo, L-dopa increased BOLD signal variability in task-relevant regions within temporal, inferior frontal, parietal and cingulo-opercular cortices. On the connectome level, L-dopa diminished functional integration in a network of temporo-cingulo-opercular regions. This hypo-integration was expressed as a reduction in network efficiency and modularity, and occurred concurrent with a relative hyper-connectivity in paracentral lobule and precuneus. Both, L-dopa-induced signal variability modulation and functional connectome modulations proved predictive of an individual's L-dopa-induced gain in behavioral measures, namely response speed and perceptual sensitivity. Lastly, signal variability modulation correlated positively with modulation of nodal connectivity and network efficiency in distributed cortical regions. In sum, by providing first evidence for a direct link between dopaminergic modulation of brain signal variability and the functional connectome, we conclude that dopamine enhances information-processing capacity in the human cortex during cognitive performance.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/129551v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Alzheimer's disease (AD), a condition characterized by cognitive deficits and progressive loss of memory, is causally linked to the short amyloid peptide A{beta}42, which disrupts normal neurotransmission. Neurotransmitter (NT) release from synaptic vesicles (SV) requires coordinated binding of the conserved core secretory machinery comprised of the soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (vSNARE) synaptobrevin 2 (VAMP2) on the SV and the cognate tSNAREs on the plasma membrane. Synaptophysin (SYP) is the most abundant SV protein3 and the major pre-fusion binding partner of VAMP24. A major challenge in understanding the etiology and prevention of AD is determining the proteins directly targeted by A{beta}42 and elucidating if these targets mediate disease phenotypes. Here we demonstrate that A{beta}42 binds to SYP with picomolar affinity and disrupts the SYP/VAMP2 complex resulting in inhibition of both neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. While functionally redundant paralogs of SYP have masked its critical activity in knockout studies, we now demonstrate a profound seizure susceptibility phenotype in SYP knockout mice that is recapitulated in an AD model. Our studies imply a subtle yet critical role for SYP in the synaptic vesicle cycle and the etiology of AD.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/129130v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Aversive emotions are likely to be a key source of irrational human decision-making but still little is known about the underlying neural circuitry. Here, we show that aversive emotions distort trust decisions and cause significant changes in the associated neural circuitry. They reduce trust and suppress trust-specific activity in left temporoparietal junction (TPJ). In addition, aversive emotions reduce the functional connectivity between TPJ and emotion-related regions such as the amygdala. We also find that the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) plays a key role in mediating the impact of aversive emotions on brain-behavior relationships. Functional connectivity of right pSTS with left TPJ not only predicts mean trust taking in the absence of negative emotions, but aversive emotions also largely remove this association between TPJ-pSTS connectivity and behavioral trust. These findings may be useful for a better understanding of the neural circuitry of affective distortions and may thus help identify the neural bases of psychiatric diseases that are associated with emotion-related psychological and behavioral dysfunctions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Evaluating Methods of Correcting for Multiple Comparisons Implemented in SPM12 in Social Neuroscience fMRI Studies: An Example from Moral Psychology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/129734v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/129734v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In fMRI research, the goal of correcting for multiple comparisons is to identify areas of activity that reflect true effects, and thus would be expected to replicate in future studies. Finding an appropriate balance between trying to minimize false positives (Type I error) while not being too stringent and omitting true effects (Type II error) can be challenging. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of these types of errors may differ for different areas of study. In many areas of social neuroscience that involve complex processes and considerable individual differences, such as the study of moral judgment, effects are typically smaller and statistical power weaker, leading to the suggestion that less stringent corrections that allow for more sensitivity may be beneficial, but also result in more false positives. Using moral judgment fMRI data, we evaluated four commonly used methods for multiple comparison correction implemented in SPM12 by examining which method produced the most precise overlap with results from a meta-analysis of relevant studies and with results from nonparametric permutation analyses. We found that voxel-wise thresholding with family-wise error correction based on Random Field Theory provides a more precise overlap (i.e., without omitting too few regions or encompassing too many additional regions) than either clusterwise thresholding, Bonferroni correction, or false discovery rate correction methods.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/129676v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Self-control and the ability to resist temptation are critical for successful completion of long-term goals. Contemporary models in cognitive neuroscience emphasize the primary role of prefrontal cognitive control networks in aligning behavior with such goals. Here we use gaze pattern analysis and dynamic functional connectivity fMRI data to explore how individual differences in the ability to resist temptation are related to intrinsic brain dynamics of the cognitive control and salience networks. Behaviorally, individuals exhibit greater gaze distance from target location (e.g. higher distractibility) during presentation of tempting erotic images compared with neutral images. Individuals whose intrinsic dynamic functional connectivity patterns gravitate towards configurations in which salience detection systems are less strongly coupled with visual systems resist tempting distractors more effectively. The ability to resist tempting distractors was not significantly related to intrinsic dynamics of the cognitive control network. These results suggest that susceptibility to temptation is governed in part by individual differences in salience network dynamics, and provide novel evidence for involvement of brain systems outside canonical cognitive control networks in contributing to individual differences in self-control.</description>

We investigated whether anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR Abs could be involved in muscle damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24902-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle biopsies of patients were analyzed for atrophy and regeneration by measuring fiber size and by performing immunostaining of neonatal myosin heavy chain. To further understand the role of the Abs in the pathology, we performed muscle cell coculture with the Abs. Atrophy and regeneration were evaluated based on the myotube surface area as well as gene and cytokine profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In vitro, anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR Abs induced muscle fiber atrophy and increased the transcription of &lt;em&gt;MAFbx&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;TRIM63&lt;/em&gt;. In addition, the muscle fiber atrophy was associated with high levels of inflammatory cytokines: tumor necrosis factor, interleukin (IL)-6, and reactive oxygen species. In the presence of anti-SRP or anti-HMGCR Abs, mechanisms involved in muscle regeneration were also impaired due to a defect of myoblast fusion. This defect was associated with a decreased production of IL-4 and IL-13. The addition of IL-4 and/or IL-13 totally rescued fusion capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This emphasizes the potential interest of targeted therapies addressing these mechanisms. Ann Neurol 2017;81:538–548&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The neurology of acutely failing respiratory mechanics</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forces involved in breathing—which effectively pull in air—are the diaphragmatic, intercostal, spine, and neck muscles. Equally important is the bulbar musculature maintaining the architecture of a patent airway conduit and abdominal wall and internal intercostal muscles providing cough. Acute injury along a neural trajectory from brainstem to muscle will impair the coordinated interaction between these muscle groups. Acutely failing respiratory mechanics can be caused by central and peripheral lesions. In central lesions, the key lesion is in the nucleus ambiguus innervating the dilator muscles of the soft palate, pharynx, and larynx, but abnormal respiratory mechanics rarely coincide with abnormalities of the respiratory pattern generator. In peripheral lesions, diaphragmatic weakness is a main element, but in many neuromuscular disorders mechanical upper airway obstruction from oropharyngeal weakness contributes equally to an increased respiratory load. The neurology of breathing involves changes in respiratory drive, rhythm, mechanics, and dynamics. This review focuses on the fundamentals of abnormal respiratory mechanics in acute neurologic conditions, bedside judgment, interpretation of additional laboratory tests, and initial stabilization, with practical solutions provided. Many of these respiratory signs are relevant to neurologists, who in acute situations may see these patients first. Ann Neurol 2017;81:485–494&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24907-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neonatal white matter injury (NWMI) is a lesion found in preterm infants that can lead to cerebral palsy. Although antagonists of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, such as Noggin, promote oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) production after hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury, the downstream functional targets are poorly understood. The basic helix-loop-helix protein, oligodendrocyte transcription factor 1 (Olig1), promotes oligodendrocyte (OL) development and is essential during remyelination in adult mice. Here, we investigated whether &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt; function is required downstream of BMP antagonism for response to injury in the neonatal brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24907-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used wild-type and &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt;-null mice subjected to neonatal stroke and postnatal neural progenitor cultures, and we analyzed Olig1 expression in human postmortem samples from neonates that suffered HI encephalopathy (HIE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24907-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt;-null neonatal mice showed significant hypomyelination after moderate neonatal stroke. Surprisingly, damaged white matter tracts in &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt;-null mice lacked Olig2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; OPCs, and instead proliferating neuronal precursors and GABAergic interneurons were present. We demonstrate that Noggin-induced OPC production requires &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt; function. In postnatal neural progenitors, Noggin governs production of OLs versus interneurons through &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt;-mediated repression of &lt;em&gt;Dlx1/2&lt;/em&gt; transcription factors. Additionally, we observed that Olig1 and the BMP signaling effector, phosphorylated SMADs (Sma- and Mad-related proteins) 1, 5, and 8, were elevated in the subventricular zone of human infants with HIE compared to controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24907-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt; has a critical function in regulation of postnatal neural progenitor cell production in response to Noggin.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A mechanistic model of the spatial interaction between blue cones and blue cone bipolar cells in macaque retina</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/129643v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/129643v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The spatial positions of blue cones (BC) and blue cone bipolars (BCBP) are positively correlated in macaque retina (Kouyama and Marshak, 1997): BCs, located in the outer nuclear layer (ONL), and BCBPs, located in the inner nuclear layer (INL), tend to be located close to each other in the lateral dimension. They also form separate homotypic mosaics and, finally, most BCBPs contact only a single BC pedicle. We present a mechanistic model of the BC-BCBP interaction to account for the development of these two mosaics and their connections. It assumes that BCs are immobile and that BCBPs can migrate within the INL due to a compromise between a dendritic string force and an intrinsic INL friction force. Model parameters were selected to optimise the fit with observed fields (Kouyama and Marshak, 1997). Simulated density recovery profiles (DRPs) closely mimic the observed DRPs. In particular, for each of the five retinal fields studied, the simulated DRP for the interaction between BCs and BCBPs has a peak at distances less than around 20 um and a small dip at distances up to the maximal lateral dendritic length (~ 44$ um), matching the profiles of the real data. We conclude that our mechanistic model is a candidate for the unknown mechanism that drives the observed interaction between BCs and BCBPs in macaque retina.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Optimal structure of metaplasticity for adaptive learning</title>

	<description>Learning from reward feedback in a changing environment requires a high degree of adaptability, yet the precise estimation of reward information demands slow updates. We show that this tradeoff between adaptability and precision, which is present in standard reinforcement-learning models, can be substantially overcome via reward-dependent metaplasticity (reward-dependent synaptic changes that do not always alter synaptic efficacy). Metaplastic synapses achieve both adaptability and precision by forming two separate sets of meta-states: reservoirs and buffers. Synapses in reservoir meta-states do not change their efficacy upon reward feedback, whereas those in buffer meta-states can change their efficacy. Rapid changes in efficacy are limited to synapses occupying buffers, creating a bottleneck that reduces noise without significantly decreasing adaptability. In contrast, more-populated reservoirs can generate a strong signal without manifesting any observable plasticity. We suggest that ubiquitous unreliability of synaptic changes evinces metaplasticity that can provide a robust mechanism for adaptive learning.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Distinct regulation of history-dependent responses by two cortical interneuron populations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/129593v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/129593v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Cortical responses to repeated stimuli are highly dynamic and rapidly adaptive. Such rapid changes are prominent in all sensory cortices, across which many aspects of circuitry are conserved. As an example, in the auditory cortex, preceding sounds can powerfully suppress responses to later, spectrally similar sounds, a phenomenon called forward suppression. Whether cortical inhibitory networks shape such suppression, or whether it is wholly regulated by common mechanisms such as synaptic depression or spike-frequency adaptation, is controversial. Here, we show that optogenetically suppressing somatostatin-positive interneurons reveals facilitation in neurons that are normally forward-suppressed. This is accompanied by a weakening of forward suppression, suggesting that these interneurons regulate the strength of forward interactions. In contrast, inactivating parvalbumin-positive interneurons does not change suppression strength, but does alter its frequency-dependence. These results establish a role of cortical inhibition in forward suppression and link specific aspects of rapid sensory adaptation to genetically distinct interneuron types.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Finger recruitment patterns during mirror movements suggest two systems for hand recovery after stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/129510v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/129510v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Accumulating behavioural and neurophysiological evidence suggests that upper-limb control relies on contributions from both cortical and subcortical motor circuits, with cortical inputs providing fine-finger function and subcortical inputs providing the ability for gross movements, respectively. During recovery of function after stroke, the relative contributions from these pathways may shift. Here we propose that mirror movements that appear after stroke provide a non-invasive assay through which relative contributions from cortical and subcortical pathways towards hand recovery can be studied. We hypothesized that mirror movements, like hand function, are generated by summed contributions from cortical and subcortical pathways, and suggest that subcortical contributions should be characterized by a broad recruitment of fingers, while cortical contributions primarily recruit the homologous finger in the passive hand. In a longitudinal stroke recovery study (Xu et al., 2016), we quantified mirror movements and paretic hand function in 53 stroke patients in the year following unilateral stroke. Mirror movements in the non-paretic hand were exaggerated early after damage (week 2), with paretic finger presses broadly recruiting multiple fingers in the non-paretic hand. On average, however, mirroring in homologous fingers was 1.76 times larger than in non-homologous fingers. Over the year, mirroring in the non-paretic hand progressively normalized with a time-course that mimicked that for the fine-finger deficits in the paretic hand. In comparison, during non-paretic finger presses, the homologous component of mirroring in the paretic hand was reduced early after stroke (week 2) but progressively normalized. Altogether, we conclude that the pattern of mirror movements across homologous and non-homologous fingers reflect the summed contributions of both cortical and subcortical systems, and we discuss the implications of our results towards hand recovery after stroke.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Computational neuroanatomy of human stratum proprium of interparietal sulcus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/126961v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Recent advances in diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) and tractography have enabled identification of major long-range white matter tracts in the human brain. Yet, our understanding of shorter tracts, such as those within the parietal lobe, remains limited. Over a century ago, a tract connecting the superior and inferior parts of the parietal cortex was identified in a post-mortem study: Stratum proprium of interparietal sulcus (SPIS; Sachs, 1892). The tract has since been replicated in another fibre dissection study (Vergani et al. 2014), however, it has not been fully investigated in the living human brain and its anatomical properties are yet to be described in detail. We used dMRI and tractography to identify and characterise SPIS in vivo, and explored its spatial proximity to the cortical areas associated with optic-flow processing using fMRI. SPIS was identified bilaterally in all subjects, and its anatomical position and trajectory are consistent with previous post-mortem studies. Subsequent evaluation of the tractography results using linear fascicle evaluation and virtual lesion analysis yielded strong statistical evidence for SPIS. We also found that SPIS endpoints are adjacent to the optic-flow selective areas. In sum, we show that SPIS is a short-range tract connecting the superior and inferior parts of the parietal cortex, wrapping around the intraparietal sulcus, and that it may be a crucial anatomy underlying optic-flow processing. In vivo identification and characterisation of SPIS will facilitate further research on SPIS in relation to cortical functions, their development, and diseases that affect them.</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Introduction: Toward an interdisciplinary science of spontaneous thought. (arXiv:1704.06014v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06014</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Enormous questions still loom for the emerging science of spontaneous
thought: what, exactly, is spontaneous thought? Why does our brain engage in
spontaneous forms of thinking, and when is this most likely to occur? And
perhaps the question most interesting and accessible from a scientific
perspective: how does the brain generate, elaborate, and evaluate its own
spontaneous creations? The central aim of this volume is to bring together
views from neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, phenomenology, history,
education, contemplative traditions, and clinical practice in order to begin to
address the ubiquitous but poorly understood mental phenomena that we
collectively call 'spontaneous thought.' Perhaps no other mental experience is
so familiar to us in daily life, and yet so difficult to understand and explain
scientifically. The present volume represents the first effort to bring such
highly diverse perspectives to bear on answering the what, when, why, and how
of spontaneous thought.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Amygdala Input Differentially Influences Prefrontal Local Field Potential And Single Neuron Encoding Of Reward-Based Decisions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/129221v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/129221v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Reward-guided behaviors require functional interaction between amygdala, orbital (OFC), and medial (MFC) divisions of prefrontal cortex, but the neural mechanisms underlying these interactions are unclear. Here, we used a decoding approach to analyze local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from OFC and MFC of monkeys engaged in a stimulus-choice task, before and after excitotoxic amygdala lesions. Whereas OFC LFP responses were strongly modulated by the amount of reward associated with each stimulus, MFC responses best represented which stimulus subjects decided to choose. This was counter to what we observed in the level of single neurons where their activity was closely associated with the value of the stimuli presented on each trial. After lesions of the amygdala, stimulus-reward value and choice encoding were reduced in OFC and MFC, respectively. However, while the lesion-induced decrease in OFC LFP encoding of stimulus-reward value mirrored changes in single neuron activity, reduced choice encoding in MFC LFPs was distinct from changes in single neuron activity. Thus, LFPs and single neurons represent different information required for decision-making in OFC and MFC. At the circuit-level, amygdala input to these two areas play a distinct role in stimulus-reward encoding in OFC and choice encoding in MFC.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Exhaustive search of linear information encoding protein-peptide recognition</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005499</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Abdellali Kelil, Benjamin Dubreuil, Emmanuel D. Levy, Stephen W. Michnick&lt;/p&gt;

High-throughput &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; methods have been extensively applied to identify linear information that encodes peptide recognition. However, these methods are limited in number of peptides, sequence variation, and length of peptides that can be explored, and often produce solutions that are not found in the cell. Despite the large number of methods developed to attempt addressing these issues, the exhaustive search of linear information encoding protein-peptide recognition has been so far physically unfeasible. Here, we describe a strategy, called DALEL, for the exhaustive search of linear sequence information encoded in proteins that bind to a common partner. We applied DALEL to explore binding specificity of SH3 domains in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;. Using only the polypeptide sequences of SH3 domain binding proteins, we succeeded in identifying the majority of known SH3 binding sites previously discovered either &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, we discovered a number of sites with both non-canonical sequences and distinct properties that may serve ancillary roles in peptide recognition. We compared DALEL to a variety of state-of-the-art algorithms in the blind identification of known binding sites of the human Grb2 SH3 domain. We also benchmarked DALEL on curated biological motifs derived from the ELM database to evaluate the effect of increasing/decreasing the enrichment of the motifs. Our strategy can be applied in conjunction with experimental data of proteins interacting with a common partner to identify binding sites among them. Yet, our strategy can also be applied to any group of proteins of interest to identify enriched linear motifs or to exhaustively explore the space of linear information. Finally, we have developed a webserver located at http://michnick.bcm.umontreal.ca/dalel, offering user-friendly interface and providing different scenarios utilizing DALEL.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dW2RiuWYhoY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A dynamic genetic-hormonal regulatory network model explains multiple cellular behaviors of the root apical meristem of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thalian&lt;/i&gt;</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005488</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Mónica L. García-Gómez, Eugenio Azpeitia, Elena R. Álvarez-Buylla&lt;/p&gt;

The study of the concerted action of hormones and transcription factors is fundamental to understand cell differentiation and pattern formation during organ development. The root apical meristem of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; is a useful model to address this. It has a stem cell niche near its tip conformed of a quiescent organizer and stem or initial cells around it, then a proliferation domain followed by a transition domain, where cells diminish division rate before transiting to the elongation zone; here, cells grow anisotropically prior to their final differentiation towards the plant base. A minimal model of the gene regulatory network that underlies cell-fate specification and patterning at the root stem cell niche was proposed before. In this study, we update and couple such network with both the auxin and cytokinin hormone signaling pathways to address how they collectively give rise to attractors that correspond to the genetic and hormonal activity profiles that are characteristic of different cell types along &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thaliana&lt;/i&gt; root apical meristem. We used a Boolean model of the genetic-hormonal regulatory network to integrate known and predicted regulatory interactions into alternative models. Our analyses show that, after adding some putative missing interactions, the model includes the necessary and sufficient components and regulatory interactions to recover attractors characteristic of the root cell types, including the auxin and cytokinin activity profiles that correlate with different cellular behaviors along the root apical meristem. Furthermore, the model predicts the existence of activity configurations that could correspond to the transition domain. The model also provides a possible explanation for apparently paradoxical cellular behaviors in the root meristem. For example, how auxin may induce and at the same time inhibit WOX5 expression. According to the model proposed here the hormonal regulation of WOX5 might depend on the cell type. Our results illustrate how non-linear multi-stable qualitative network models can aid at understanding how transcriptional regulators and hormonal signaling pathways are dynamically coupled and may underlie both the acquisition of cell fate and the emergence of hormonal activity profiles that arise during complex organ development.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8EgFpp_IOhQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The fight against cancer is hindered by its highly heterogeneous nature. Genome-wide sequencing studies have shown that individual malignancies contain many mutations that range from those commonly found in tumor genomes to rare somatic variants present only in a small fraction of lesions. Such rare somatic variants dominate the landscape of genomic mutations in cancer, yet efforts to correlate somatic mutations found in one or few individuals with functional roles have been largely unsuccessful. Traditional methods for identifying somatic variants that drive cancer are ‘gene-centric’ in that they consider only somatic variants within a particular gene and make no comparison to other similar genes in the same family that may play a similar role in cancer. In this work, we present oncodomain hotspots, a new ‘domain-centric’ method for identifying clusters of somatic mutations across entire gene families using protein domain models. Our analysis confirms that our approach creates a framework for leveraging structural and functional information encapsulated by protein domains into the analysis of somatic variants in cancer, enabling the assessment of even rare somatic variants by comparison to similar genes. Our results reveal a vast landscape of somatic variants that act at the level of domain families altering pathways known to be involved with cancer such as protein phosphorylation, signaling, gene regulation, and cell metabolism. Due to oncodomain hotspots’ unique ability to assess rare variants, we expect our method to become an important tool for the analysis of sequenced tumor genomes, complementing existing methods.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3F8cY6IbcVU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Cheminformatics-aided discovery of small-molecule Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) dual inhibitors of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and Receptor Activator of NF-κB Ligand (RANKL)</title>

We present an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; drug discovery pipeline developed and applied for the identification and virtual screening of small-molecule Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) compounds that act as dual inhibitors of TNF and RANKL through the trimerization interface. The cheminformatics part of the pipeline was developed by combining structure–based with ligand–based modeling using the largest available set of known TNF inhibitors in the literature (2481 small molecules). To facilitate virtual screening, the consensus predictive model was made freely available at: http://enalos.insilicotox.com/TNFPubChem/. We thus generated a priority list of nine small molecules as candidates for direct TNF function inhibition. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; evaluation of these compounds led to the selection of two small molecules that act as potent direct inhibitors of TNF function, with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values comparable to those of a previously-described direct inhibitor (SPD304), but with significantly reduced toxicity. These molecules were also identified as RANKL inhibitors and validated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; with respect to this second functionality. Direct binding of the two compounds was confirmed both for TNF and RANKL, as well as their ability to inhibit the biologically-active trimer forms. Molecular dynamics calculations were also carried out for the two small molecules in each protein to offer additional insight into the interactions that govern TNF and RANKL complex formation. To our knowledge, these compounds, namely T8 and T23, constitute the second and third published examples of dual small-molecule direct function inhibitors of TNF and RANKL, and could serve as lead compounds for the development of novel treatments for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rEIehantWPU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Multi-scale detection of hierarchical community architecture in structural and functional brain networks. (arXiv:1704.05826v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Community detection algorithms have been widely used to study the
organization of complex systems like the brain. A principal appeal of these
techniques is their ability to identify a partition of brain regions (or nodes)
into communities, where nodes within a community are densely interconnected. In
their simplest application, community detection algorithms are agnostic to the
presence of community hierarchies, but a common characteristic of many neural
systems is a nested hierarchy. To address this limitation, we exercise a
multi-scale extension of a community detection technique known as modularity
maximization, and we apply the tool to both synthetic graphs and graphs derived
from human structural and functional imaging data. Our multi-scale community
detection algorithm links a graph to copies of itself across neighboring
topological scales, thereby becoming sensitive to conserved community
organization across neighboring levels of the hierarchy. We demonstrate that
this method allows for a better characterization of topological inhomogeneities
of the graph's hierarchy by providing a local (node) measure of community
stability and inter-scale reliability across topological scales. We compare the
brain's structural and functional network architectures and demonstrate that
structural graphs display a wider range of topological scales than functional
graphs. Finally, we build a multimodal multiplex graph that combines structural
and functional connectivity in a single model, and we identify the topological
scales where resting state functional connectivity and underlying structural
connectivity show similar versus unique hierarchical community architecture.
Together, our results showcase the advantages of the multi-scale community
detection algorithm in studying hierarchical community structure in brain
graphs, and they illustrate its utility in modeling multimodal neuroimaging
data.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: EEG source imaging assists decoding in a face recognition task. (arXiv:1704.05748v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05748</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05748</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;EEG based brain state decoding has numerous applications. State of the art
decoding is based on processing of the multivariate sensor space signal,
however evidence is mounting that EEG source reconstruction can assist
decoding. EEG source imaging leads to high-dimensional representations and
rather strong a priori information must be invoked. Recent work by Edelman et
al. (2016) has demonstrated that introduction of a spatially focal source space
representation can improve decoding of motor imagery. In this work we explore
the generality of Edelman et al. hypothesis by considering decoding of face
recognition. This task concerns the differentiation of brain responses to
images of faces and scrambled faces and poses a rather difficult decoding
problem at the single trial level. We implement the pipeline using spatially
focused features and show that this approach is challenged and source imaging
does not lead to an improved decoding. We design a distributed pipeline in
which the classifier has access to brain wide features which in turn does lead
to a 15% reduction in the error rate using source space features. Hence, our
work presents supporting evidence for the hypothesis that source imaging
improves decoding.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: NEURAL: quantitative features for newborn EEG using Matlab. (arXiv:1704.05694v1 [physics.med-ph])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05694</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05694</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: For newborn infants in critical care, continuous monitoring of
brain function can help identify infants at-risk of brain injury. Quantitative
features allow a consistent and reproducible approach to EEG analysis, but only
when all implementation aspects are clearly defined.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods: We detail quantitative features frequently used in neonatal EEG
analysis and present a Matlab software package together with exact
implementation details for all features. The feature set includes stationary
features that capture amplitude and frequency characteristics and features of
inter-hemispheric connectivity. The software, a Neonatal Eeg featURe set in
mAtLab (NEURAL), is open source and freely available. The software also
includes a pre-processing stage with a basic artefact removal procedure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: NEURAL provides a common platform for quantitative analysis of
neonatal EEG. This will support reproducible research and enable comparisons
across independent studies. These features present summary measures of the EEG
that can also be used in automated methods to determine brain development and
health of the newborn in critical care.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Neural (EEG) Response during Creation and Appreciation: A Novel Study with Hindustani Raga Music. (arXiv:1704.05687v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;What happens inside the performers brain when he is performing and composing
a particular raga. Are there some specific regions in brain which are activated
when an artist is creating or imaging a raga in his brain. Do the regions
remain the same when the artist is listening to the same raga sung by him.
These are the questions that perplexed neuroscientists for a long time. In this
study we strive to answer these questions by using latest state of the art
techniques to assess brain response. An EEG experiment was conducted for two
eminent performers of Indian classical music, when they mentally created the
imagery of a raga Jay Jayanti in their mind, as well as when they listened to
the same raga. The beauty of Hindustani music lies in the fact that the
musician is himself the composer and recreates the imagery of the raga in his
mind while performing, hence the scope of creative improvisations are immense.
The alpha and theta frequency rhythms were segregated from each of the time
series data and analyzed using robust non MFDXA technique to quantitatively
assess the degree of cross-correlation of each EEG frequency rhythm in
different combination of electrodes from frontal, occipital and temporal lobes.
A strong response was found in the occipital and fronto occipital region during
mental improvisation of the raga, which is an interesting revelation of this
study. Strong retentive features were obtained in regard to both alpha and
theta rhythms in musical listening in the fronto temporal and occipital
temporal region while the features were almost absent in the thinking part.
Further, other specific regions have been identified separately for the two
separate conditions in which the correlations among the different lobes were
the strongest.

	<description>Varadarajan et al. show that netrin1 supplied by neural progenitors, not floor plate (FP) cells, guides commissural axons in the developing spinal cord. These findings contrast with the long-held model that the FP supplies a long-range axonal chemoattractant. Rather, netrin1 is produced by neural progenitors and deposited on the pial surface, providing a growth substrate that directs ventrally directed axonal growth.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Towards a theory of cortical columns: From spiking neurons to interacting neural populations of finite size</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Tilo Schwalger, Moritz Deger, Wulfram Gerstner&lt;/p&gt;

Neural population equations such as neural mass or field models are widely used to study brain activity on a large scale. However, the relation of these models to the properties of single neurons is unclear. Here we derive an equation for several interacting populations at the mesoscopic scale starting from a microscopic model of randomly connected generalized integrate-and-fire neuron models. Each population consists of 50–2000 neurons of the same type but different populations account for different neuron types. The stochastic population equations that we find reveal how spike-history effects in single-neuron dynamics such as refractoriness and adaptation interact with finite-size fluctuations on the population level. Efficient integration of the stochastic mesoscopic equations reproduces the statistical behavior of the population activities obtained from microscopic simulations of a full spiking neural network model. The theory describes nonlinear emergent dynamics such as finite-size-induced stochastic transitions in multistable networks and synchronization in balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The mesoscopic equations are employed to rapidly integrate a model of a cortical microcircuit consisting of eight neuron types, which allows us to predict spontaneous population activities as well as evoked responses to thalamic input. Our theory establishes a general framework for modeling finite-size neural population dynamics based on single cell and synapse parameters and offers an efficient approach to analyzing cortical circuits and computations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qqiGo_2jYDE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Task-Dependent Behavioral Dynamics Make the Case for Temporal Integration in Multiple Strategies during Odor Processing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4416?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4416?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Differing results in olfactory-based decision-making research regarding the amount of time that rats and mice use to identify odors have led to some disagreements about odor-processing mechanics, including whether or not rodents use temporal integration (i.e., sniffing longer to identify odors better). Reported differences in behavioral strategies may be due to the different types of tasks used in different laboratories. Some researchers have reported that animals performing two-alternative choice (TAC) tasks need only 1–2 sniffs and do not increase performance with longer sampling. Others have reported that animals performing go/no-go (GNG) tasks increase sampling times and performance for difficult discriminations, arguing for temporal integration. We present results from four experiments comparing GNG and TAC tasks over several behavioral variables (e.g., performance, sampling duration). When rats know only one task, they perform better in GNG than in TAC. However, performance was not statistically different when rats learned and were tested in both tasks. Rats sample odors longer in GNG than in TAC, even when they know both tasks and perform them in the same or different sessions. Longer sampling is associated with better performance for both tasks in difficult discriminations, which supports the case for temporal integration over ≥2–6 sniffs in both tasks. These results illustrate that generalizations from a single task about behavioral or cognitive abilities (e.g., processing, perception) do not capture the full range of complexity and can significantly impact inferences about general abilities in sensory perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Behavioral tasks and training and testing history affect measured outcomes in cognitive tests. Rats sample odors longer in a go/no-go (GNG) than in a two-alternative choice (TAC) task, performing better in GNG unless they know both tasks. Odor-sampling time is extended in both tasks when the odors to be discriminated are very similar. Rats may extend sampling time to integrate odor information up to ~0.5 s (2–6 sniffs). Such factors as task, task parameters, and training history affect decision times and performance, making it important to use multiple tasks when making inferences about sensory or cognitive processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cholinergic, But Not Dopaminergic or Noradrenergic, Enhancement Sharpens Visual Spatial Perception in Humans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4405?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neuromodulator acetylcholine modulates spatial integration in visual cortex by altering the balance of inputs that generate neuronal receptive fields. These cholinergic effects may provide a neurobiological mechanism underlying the modulation of visual representations by visual spatial attention. However, the consequences of cholinergic enhancement on visuospatial perception in humans are unknown. We conducted two experiments to test whether enhancing cholinergic signaling selectively alters perceptual measures of visuospatial interactions in human subjects. In Experiment 1, a double-blind placebo-controlled pharmacology study, we measured how flanking distractors influenced detection of a small contrast decrement of a peripheral target, as a function of target-flanker distance. We found that cholinergic enhancement with the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil improved target detection, and modeling suggested that this was mainly due to a narrowing of the extent of facilitatory perceptual spatial interactions. In Experiment 2, we tested whether these effects were selective to the cholinergic system or would also be observed following enhancements of related neuromodulators dopamine or norepinephrine. Unlike cholinergic enhancement, dopamine (bromocriptine) and norepinephrine (guanfacine) manipulations did not improve performance or systematically alter the spatial profile of perceptual interactions between targets and distractors. These findings reveal mechanisms by which cholinergic signaling influences visual spatial interactions in perception and improves processing of a visual target among distractors, effects that are notably similar to those of spatial selective attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Acetylcholine influences how visual cortical neurons integrate signals across space, perhaps providing a neurobiological mechanism for the effects of visual selective attention. However, the influence of cholinergic enhancement on visuospatial perception remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that cholinergic enhancement improves detection of a target flanked by distractors, consistent with sharpened visuospatial perceptual representations. Furthermore, whereas most pharmacological studies focus on a single neurotransmitter, many neuromodulators can have related effects on cognition and perception. Thus, we also demonstrate that enhancing noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems does not systematically improve visuospatial perception or alter its tuning. Our results link visuospatial tuning effects of acetylcholine at the neuronal and perceptual levels and provide insights into the connection between cholinergic signaling and visual attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel pore-forming subunit Kv4.3 is expressed in a subset of nonpeptidergic nociceptors within the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), and knockdown of Kv4.3 selectively induces mechanical hypersensitivity, a major symptom of neuropathic pain. K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel modulatory subunits KChIP1, KChIP2, and DPP10 are coexpressed in Kv4.3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; DRG neurons, but whether they participate in Kv4.3-mediated pain control is unknown. Here, we show the existence of a Kv4.3/KChIP1/KChIP2/DPP10 complex (abbreviated as the Kv4 complex) in the endoplasmic reticulum and cell surface of DRG neurons. After intrathecal injection of a gene-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to knock down the expression of each component in the Kv4 complex, mechanical hypersensitivity develops in the hindlimbs of rats in parallel with a reduction in all components in the lumbar DRGs. Electrophysiological data further indicate that the excitability of nonpeptidergic nociceptors is enhanced. The expression of all Kv4 complex components in DRG neurons is downregulated following spinal nerve ligation (SNL). To rescue Kv4 complex downregulation, cDNA constructs encoding Kv4.3, KChIP1, and DPP10 were transfected into the injured DRGs (defined as DRGs with injured spinal nerves) of living SNL rats. SNL-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity was attenuated, accompanied by a partial recovery of Kv4.3, KChIP1, and DPP10 surface levels in the injured DRGs. By showing an interdependent regulation among components in the Kv4 complex, this study demonstrates that K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel modulatory subunits KChIP1, KChIP2, and DPP10 participate in Kv4.3-mediated mechanical pain control. Thus, these modulatory subunits could be potential drug targets for neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuropathic pain, a type of moderate to severe chronic pain resulting from nerve injury or disorder, affects 6.9%–10% of the global population. However, less than half of patients report satisfactory pain relief from current treatments. K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, which act to reduce nociceptor activity, have been suggested to be novel drug targets for neuropathic pain. This study is the first to show that K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel modulatory subunits KChIP1, KChIP2, and DPP10 are potential drug targets for neuropathic pain because they form a channel complex with the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel pore-forming subunit Kv4.3 in a subset of nociceptors to selectively inhibit mechanical hypersensitivity, a major symptom of neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Linear Summation of Repulsive and Attractive Serial Dependencies: Orientation and Motion Dependencies Sum in Motion Perception</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4381?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent work from several groups has shown that perception of various visual attributes in human observers at a given moment is biased toward what was recently seen. This positive serial dependency is a kind of temporal averaging that exploits short-term correlations in visual scenes to reduce noise and stabilize perception. To date, this stabilizing &quot;continuity field&quot; has been demonstrated on stable visual attributes such as orientation and face identity, yet it would be counterproductive to apply it to dynamic attributes in which change sensitivity is needed. Here, we tested this using motion direction discrimination and predict a negative perceptual dependency: a contrastive relationship that enhances sensitivity to change. Surprisingly, our data showed a cubic-like pattern of dependencies with positive and negative components. By interleaving various stimulus combinations, we separated the components and isolated a positive perceptual dependency for motion and a negative dependency for orientation. A weighted linear sum of the separate dependencies described the original cubic pattern well. The positive dependency for motion shows an integrative perceptual effect and was unexpected, although it is consistent with work on motion priming. These findings suggest that a perception-stabilizing continuity field occurs pervasively, occurring even when it obscures sensitivity to dynamic stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent studies show that visual perception at a given moment is not entirely veridical, but rather biased toward recently seen stimuli: a positive serial dependency. This temporal smoothing process helps perceptual continuity by preserving stable aspects of the visual scene over time, yet, for dynamic stimuli, temporal smoothing would blur dynamics and reduce sensitivity to change. We tested whether this process is selective for stable attributes by examining dependencies in motion perception. We found a clear positive dependency for motion, suggesting that positive perceptual dependencies are pervasive. We also found a concurrent negative (contrastive) dependency for orientation. Both dependencies combined linearly to determine perception, showing that the brain can calculate contrastive and integrative dependencies simultaneously from recent stimulus history when making perceptual decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Effort-Based Reinforcement Processing and Functional Connectivity Underlying Amotivation in Medicated Patients with Depression and Schizophrenia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4370?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4370?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amotivation is a common phenotype of major depressive disorder and schizophrenia, which are clinically distinct disorders. Effective treatment targets and strategies can be discovered by examining the dopaminergic reward network function underlying amotivation between these disorders. We conducted an fMRI study in healthy human participants and medicated patients with depression and schizophrenia using an effort-based reinforcement task. We examined regional activations related to reward type (positive and negative reinforcement), effort level, and their composite value, as well as resting-state functional connectivities within the meso–striatal–prefrontal pathway. We found that integrated reward and effort values of low effort-positive reinforcement and high effort-negative reinforcement were behaviorally anticipated and represented in the putamen and medial orbitofrontal cortex activities. Patients with schizophrenia and depression did not show anticipation-related and work-related reaction time reductions, respectively. Greater amotivation severity correlated with smaller work-related putamen activity changes according to reward type in schizophrenia and effort level in depression. Patients with schizophrenia showed feedback-related putamen hyperactivity of low effort compared with healthy controls and depressed patients. The strength of medial orbitofrontal-striatal functional connectivity predicted work-related reaction time reduction of high effort negative reinforcement in healthy controls and amotivation severity in both patients with schizophrenia and those with depression. Patients with depression showed deficient medial orbitofrontal-striatal functional connectivity compared with healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia. These results indicate that amotivation in depression and schizophrenia involves different pathophysiology in the prefrontal-striatal circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Amotivation is present in both depression and schizophrenia. However, treatment involves the use of drugs that enhance serotonin activity in depression and inhibit serotonin and dopamine activity in schizophrenia. Understanding how motivation processed in the mesocorticolimbic and nigostriatal pathways is affected in depression and schizophrenia is important in discovering treatment targets and strategies for amotivation. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare patients with depression and schizophrenia in a common functional construct. By using an effort-based reinforcement task and examining resting-state functional connectivity in the dopaminergic network, we propose that difference in striato–orbitofrontal dysfunction in effort-based reinforcement between depression and schizophrenia may be related to differences in the extent of functional dysconnectivity in the dopaminergic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Prefrontal Cortex KCa2 Channels Regulate mGlu5-Dependent Plasticity and Extinction of Alcohol-Seeking Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4359?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Identifying novel treatments that facilitate extinction learning could enhance cue-exposure therapy and reduce high relapse rates in alcoholics. Activation of mGlu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex (IL-PFC) facilitates learning during extinction of cue-conditioned alcohol-seeking behavior. Small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2) channels have also been implicated in extinction learning of fear memories, and mGlu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation can reduce K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 channel function. Using a combination of electrophysiological, pharmacological, and behavioral approaches, this study examined K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 channels as a novel target to facilitate extinction of alcohol-seeking behavior in rats. This study also explored related neuronal and synaptic mechanisms within the IL-PFC that underlie mGlu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent enhancement of extinction learning. Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, activation of mGlu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; in &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; slices significantly reduced K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 channel currents in layer V IL-PFC pyramidal neurons, confirming functional downregulation of K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 channel activity by mGlu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. Additionally, positive modulation of K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 channels prevented mGlu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-dependent facilitation of long-term potentiation in the IL-PFC. Systemic and intra-IL-PFC treatment with apamin (K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 channel allosteric inhibitor) significantly enhanced extinction of alcohol-seeking behavior across multiple extinction sessions, an effect that persisted for 3 weeks, but was not observed after apamin microinfusions into the prelimbic PFC. Positive modulation of IL-PFC K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 channels significantly attenuated mGlu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent facilitation of alcohol cue-conditioned extinction learning. These data suggest that mGlu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent facilitation of extinction learning and synaptic plasticity in the IL-PFC involves functional inhibition of K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 channels. Moreover, these findings demonstrate that K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 channels are a novel target to facilitate long-lasting extinction of alcohol-seeking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Alcohol use disorder is a chronic relapsing disorder that is associated with compulsive alcohol-seeking behavior. One of the main causes of alcohol relapse is the craving caused by environmental cues that are associated with alcohol. These cues are formed by normal learning and memory principles, and the understanding of the brain mechanisms that help form these associations can lead to the development of drugs and/or behavior therapies that reduce the impact that these cues have on relapse in alcoholics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sleep Deprivation and Caffeine Treatment Potentiate Photic Resetting of the Master Circadian Clock in a Diurnal Rodent</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4343?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4343?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Circadian rhythms in nocturnal and diurnal mammals are primarily synchronized to local time by the light/dark cycle. However, nonphotic factors, such as behavioral arousal and metabolic cues, can also phase shift the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCNs) and/or reduce the synchronizing effects of light in nocturnal rodents. In diurnal rodents, the role of arousal or insufficient sleep in these functions is still poorly understood. In the present study, diurnal Sudanian grass rats, &lt;i&gt;Arvicanthis ansorgei&lt;/i&gt;, were aroused at night by sleep deprivation (gentle handling) or caffeine treatment that both prevented sleep. Phase shifts of locomotor activity were analyzed in grass rats transferred from a light/dark cycle to constant darkness and aroused in early night or late night. Early night, but not late night, sleep deprivation induced a significant phase shift. Caffeine on its own induced no phase shifts. Both sleep deprivation and caffeine treatment potentiated light-induced phase delays and phase advances in response to a 30 min light pulse, respectively. Sleep deprivation in early night, but not late night, potentiated light-induced c-Fos expression in the ventral SCN. Caffeine treatment in midnight triggered c-Fos expression in dorsal SCN. Both sleep deprivation and caffeine treatment potentiated light-induced c-Fos expression in calbindin-containing cells of the ventral SCN in early and late night. These findings indicate that, in contrast to nocturnal rodents, behavioral arousal induced either by sleep deprivation or caffeine during the sleeping period potentiates light resetting of the master circadian clock in diurnal rodents, and activation of calbindin-containing suprachiasmatic cells may be involved in this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Arousing stimuli have the ability to regulate circadian rhythms in mammals. Behavioral arousal in the sleeping period phase shifts the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei and/or slows down the photic entrainment in nocturnal animals. How these stimuli act in diurnal species remains to be established. Our study in a diurnal rodent, the Grass rat, indicates that sleep deprivation in the early rest period induces phase delays of circadian locomotor activity rhythm. Contrary to nocturnal rodents, both sleep deprivation and caffeine-induced arousal potentiate the photic entrainment in a diurnal rodent. Such enhanced light-induced circadian responses could be relevant for developing chronotherapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Working Memory Load Strengthens Reward Prediction Errors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4332?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4332?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning (RL) in simple instrumental tasks is usually modeled as a monolithic process in which reward prediction errors (RPEs) are used to update expected values of choice options. This modeling ignores the different contributions of different memory and decision-making systems thought to contribute even to simple learning. In an fMRI experiment, we investigated how working memory (WM) and incremental RL processes interact to guide human learning. WM load was manipulated by varying the number of stimuli to be learned across blocks. Behavioral results and computational modeling confirmed that learning was best explained as a mixture of two mechanisms: a fast, capacity-limited, and delay-sensitive WM process together with slower RL. Model-based analysis of fMRI data showed that striatum and lateral prefrontal cortex were sensitive to RPE, as shown previously, but, critically, these signals were reduced when the learning problem was within capacity of WM. The degree of this neural interaction related to individual differences in the use of WM to guide behavioral learning. These results indicate that the two systems do not process information independently, but rather interact during learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Reinforcement learning (RL) theory has been remarkably productive at improving our understanding of instrumental learning as well as dopaminergic and striatal network function across many mammalian species. However, this neural network is only one contributor to human learning and other mechanisms such as prefrontal cortex working memory also play a key role. Our results also show that these other players interact with the dopaminergic RL system, interfering with its key computation of reward prediction errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Phases of Hyperconnectivity and Hypoconnectivity in the Default Mode and Salience Networks Track with Amyloid and Tau in Clinically Normal Individuals</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by two hallmark molecular pathologies: amyloid aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; and Tau neurofibrillary tangles. To date, studies of functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) in individuals with preclinical AD have relied on associations with &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; measures of amyloid pathology. With the recent advent of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; Tau-PET tracers it is now possible to extend investigations on fcMRI in a sample of cognitively normal elderly humans to regional measures of Tau. We modeled fcMRI measures across four major cortical association networks [default-mode network (DMN), salience network (SAL), dorsal attention network, and frontoparietal control network] as a function of global cortical amyloid [Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET] and regional Tau (AV1451-PET) in entorhinal, inferior temporal (IT), and inferior parietal cortex. Results showed that the interaction term between PiB and IT AV1451 was significantly associated with connectivity in the DMN and salience. The interaction revealed that amyloid-positive (aβ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) individuals show increased connectivity in the DMN and salience when neocortical Tau levels are low, whereas aβ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; individuals demonstrate decreased connectivity in these networks as a function of elevated Tau-PET signal. This pattern suggests a hyperconnectivity phase followed by a hypoconnectivity phase in the course of preclinical AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This article offers a first look at the relationship between Tau-PET imaging with F&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;-AV1451 and functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) in the context of amyloid-PET imaging. The results suggest a nonlinear relationship between fcMRI and both Tau-PET and amyloid-PET imaging. The pattern supports recent conjecture that the AD fcMRI trajectory is characterized by periods of both hyperconnectivity and hypoconnectivity. Furthermore, this nonlinear pattern can account for the sometimes conflicting reports of associations between amyloid and fcMRI in individuals with preclinical Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Decoding Information for Grasping from the Macaque Dorsomedial Visual Stream</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4311?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodecoders have been developed by researchers mostly to control neuroprosthetic devices, but also to shed new light on neural functions. In this study, we show that signals representing grip configurations can be reliably decoded from neural data acquired from area V6A of the monkey medial posterior parietal cortex. Two &lt;i&gt;Macaca fascicularis&lt;/i&gt; monkeys were trained to perform an instructed-delay reach-to-grasp task in the dark and in the light toward objects of different shapes. Population neural activity was extracted at various time intervals on vision of the objects, the delay before movement, and grasp execution. This activity was used to train and validate a Bayes classifier used for decoding objects and grip types. Recognition rates were well over chance level for all the epochs analyzed in this study. Furthermore, we detected slightly different decoding accuracies, depending on the task's visual condition. Generalization analysis was performed by training and testing the system during different time intervals. This analysis demonstrated that a change of code occurred during the course of the task. Our classifier was able to discriminate grasp types fairly well in advance with respect to grasping onset. This feature might be important when the timing is critical to send signals to external devices before the movement start. Our results suggest that the neural signals from the dorsomedial visual pathway can be a good substrate to feed neural prostheses for prehensile actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recordings of neural activity from nonhuman primate frontal and parietal cortex have led to the development of methods of decoding movement information to restore coordinated arm actions in paralyzed human beings. Our results show that the signals measured from the monkey medial posterior parietal cortex are valid for correctly decoding information relevant for grasping. Together with previous studies on decoding reach trajectories from the medial posterior parietal cortex, this highlights the medial parietal cortex as a target site for transforming neural activity into control signals to command prostheses to allow human patients to dexterously perform grasping actions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distinct Actions of Voltage-Activated Ca2+ Channel Block on Spontaneous Release at Excitatory and Inhibitory Central Synapses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4301?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4301?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;At chemical synapses, voltage-activated calcium channels (VACCs) mediate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx to trigger action potential-evoked neurotransmitter release. However, the mechanisms by which Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; regulates spontaneous transmission have not been fully determined. We have shown that VACCs are a major trigger of spontaneous release at neocortical inhibitory synapses but not at excitatory synapses, suggesting fundamental differences in spontaneous neurotransmission at GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses. Recently, VACC blockers were reported to reduce spontaneous release of glutamate and it was proposed that there was conservation of underlying mechanisms of neurotransmission at excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that the different effects on excitatory and inhibitory synapses may have resulted from off-target actions of Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, a nonselective VACC blocker, or other variations in experimental conditions. Here we report that in mouse neocortical neurons, selective and nonselective VACC blockers inhibit spontaneous release at inhibitory but not at excitatory terminals, and that this pattern is observed in culture and slice preparations as well as in synapses from acute slices of the auditory brainstem. The voltage dependence of Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; block of VACCs accounts for the apparent lower potency of Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; on spontaneous release of GABA than on VACC current amplitudes. Our findings indicate fundamental differences in the regulation of spontaneous release at inhibitory and excitatory synapses by stochastic VACC activity that extend beyond the cortex to the brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry via voltage-activated calcium channels (VACCs) is the major trigger of action potential-evoked synaptic release. However, the role of VACCs in the regulation of spontaneous neurotransmitter release (in the absence of a synchronizing action potential) remains controversial. We show that spontaneous release is affected differently by VACCs at excitatory and inhibitory synapses. At inhibitory synapses, stochastic openings of VACCs trigger the majority of spontaneous release, whereas they do not affect spontaneous release at excitatory synapses. We find this pattern to be wide ranging, holding for large and small synapses in the neocortex and brainstem. These findings indicate fundamental differences of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dependence of spontaneous release at excitatory and inhibitory synapses and heterogeneity of the mechanisms of release across the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Amyloid Precursor Protein in Drosophila Glia Regulates Sleep and Genes Involved in Glutamate Recycling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4289?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyloid precursor protein (App) plays a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease via the production and deposition of toxic β-amyloid peptides. App is heavily expressed in neurons, the focus of the vast majority of studies investigating its function. Meanwhile, almost nothing is known about App's function in glia, where it is also expressed, and can potentially participate in the regulation of neuronal physiology. In this report, we investigated whether &lt;i&gt;Appl&lt;/i&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; homolog of &lt;i&gt;App&lt;/i&gt;, could influence sleep–wake regulation when its function is manipulated in glial cells. &lt;i&gt;Appl&lt;/i&gt; inhibition in astrocyte-like and cortex glia resulted in higher sleep amounts and longer sleep bout duration during the night, while overexpression had the opposite effect. These sleep phenotypes were not the result of developmental defects, and were correlated with changes in expression in glutamine synthetase (GS) in astrocyte-like glia and in changes in the gap-junction component innexin2 in cortex glia. Downregulating both GS and innexin2, but not either one individually, resulted in higher sleep amounts, similarly to &lt;i&gt;Appl&lt;/i&gt; inhibition. Consistent with these results, the expression of GS and innexin2 are increased following sleep deprivation, indicating that GS and innexin2 genes are dynamically linked to vigilance states. Interestingly, the reduction of GS expression and the sleep phenotype observed upon &lt;i&gt;Appl&lt;/i&gt; inhibition could be rescued by increasing the expression of the glutamate transporter dEaat1. In contrast, reducing dEaat1 expression severely disrupted sleep. These results associate glutamate recycling, sleep, and a glial function for the App family proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The amyloid precursor protein (App) has been intensively studied for its implication in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The attributed functions of App are linked to the physiology and cellular biology of neurons where the protein is predominantly expressed. Consequences on glia in AD are generally thought to be secondary effects of the pathology in neurons. Researchers still do not know whether App plays a role in glia in nonpathological conditions. We report here that glial App plays a role in physiology and in the regulation of sleep/wake, which has been shown recently to be involved in AD pathology. These results also associate glutamate recycling and sleep regulation, adding further complexity to the physiological role of App and to its implication in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Effects of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome on the Dentate Gyrus and Learning and Memory in Children</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4280?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4280?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is associated with intermittent hypoxia and sleep loss. In children, impairments of cognitive function are important manifestations, but the underlying pathology is unknown. We hypothesized that OSAS would affect the dentate gyrus, a hippocampal subdivision essential to neurogenesis and cognition, and that this impact would further affect cognitive function in children. In children with OSAS (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 11) and control subjects (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 12; age and sex matched), we performed diffusion tensor imaging and structural MRI, polysomnography, and neuropsychological assessments. We found that OSAS was associated with decreased mean diffusivity of the left dentate gyrus (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002; false discovery rate corrected; adjusting for sex, age, and body mass index), showing a large effect size (partial &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.491), but not with any other structural measures across the brain. Decreased dentate gyrus mean diffusivity correlated with a higher apnea hypopnea index (Spearman's &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = –0.50, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008) and a greater arousal index (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = –0.44, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.017). OSAS did not significantly affect neuropsychological measures (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; values &amp;gt;0.5); however, a lower verbal learning score correlated with lower dentate gyrus mean diffusivity (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.54, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004). Path analysis demonstrated that dentate gyrus mean diffusivity mediates the impact of OSAS on verbal learning capacity. Finally, the diagnostic accuracy of a regression model based on dentate gyrus mean diffusivity reached 85.8% (cross validated). This study demonstrates a likely pathway of effects of OSAS on neurocognitive function in children, as well as potential utility of the dentate gyrus mean diffusivity as an early marker of brain pathology in children with OSAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In this study we investigate the relationships between dentate gyrus structure, hippocampus-dependent cognition, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). We demonstrate lower mean diffusivity of the dentate gyrus in children with OSAS, which correlates with a lower verbal learning and memory score. This study provides new evidence of disrupted microstructure of the dentate gyrus in children with OSAS that may help explain some of the neurocognitive deficits described in these children.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Multivoxel Pattern Analysis Reveals 3D Place Information in the Human Hippocampus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The spatial world is three dimensional (3D) and humans and other animals move both horizontally and vertically within it. Extant neuroscientific studies have typically investigated spatial navigation on a horizontal 2D plane, leaving much unknown about how 3D spatial information is represented in the brain. Specifically, horizontal and vertical information may be encoded in the same or different neural structures with equal or unequal sensitivity. Here, we investigated these possibilities using fMRI while participants were passively moved within a 3D lattice structure as if riding a rollercoaster. Multivoxel pattern analysis was used to test for the existence of information relating to where and in which direction participants were heading in this virtual environment. Behaviorally, participants had similarly accurate memory for vertical and horizontal locations and the right anterior hippocampus (HC) expressed place information that was sensitive to changes along both horizontal and vertical axes. This is suggestive of isotropic 3D place encoding. In contrast, participants indicated their heading direction faster and more accurately when they were heading in a tilted-up or tilted-down direction. This direction information was expressed in the right retrosplenial cortex and posterior HC and was only sensitive to vertical pitch, which could reflect the importance of the vertical (gravity) axis as a reference frame. Overall, our findings extend previous knowledge of how we represent the spatial world and navigate within it by taking into account the important third dimension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The spatial world is 3D. We can move horizontally across surfaces, but also vertically, going up slopes or stairs. Little is known about how the brain supports representations of 3D space. A key question is whether horizontal and vertical information is equally well represented. Here, we measured fMRI response patterns while participants moved within a virtual 3D environment and found that the anterior hippocampus (HC) expressed location information that was sensitive to the vertical and horizontal axes. In contrast, information about heading direction, found in retrosplenial cortex and posterior HC, favored the vertical axis, perhaps due to gravity effects. These findings provide new insights into how we represent our spatial 3D world and navigate within it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: STAT3 Controls the Long-Term Survival and Phenotype of Repair Schwann Cells during Nerve Regeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4255?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4255?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After nerve injury, Schwann cells convert to a phenotype specialized to promote repair. But during the slow process of axonal regrowth, these repair Schwann cells gradually lose their regeneration-supportive features and eventually die. Although this is a key reason for the frequent regeneration failures in humans, the transcriptional mechanisms that control long-term survival and phenotype of repair cells have not been studied, and the molecular signaling underlying their decline is obscure. We show, in mice, that Schwann cell STAT3 has a dual role. It supports the long-term survival of repair Schwann cells and is required for the maintenance of repair Schwann cell properties. In contrast, STAT3 is less important for the initial generation of repair Schwann cells after injury. In repair Schwann cells, we find that Schwann cell STAT3 activation by Tyr705 phosphorylation is sustained during long-term denervation. STAT3 is required for maintaining autocrine Schwann cell survival signaling, and inactivation of Schwann cell STAT3 results in a striking loss of repair cells from chronically denervated distal stumps. STAT3 inactivation also results in abnormal morphology of repair cells and regeneration tracks, and failure to sustain expression of repair cell markers, including Shh, GDNF, and BDNF. Because Schwann cell development proceeds normally without STAT3, the function of this factor appears restricted to Schwann cells after injury. This identification of transcriptional mechanisms that support long-term survival and differentiation of repair cells will help identify, and eventually correct, the failures that lead to the deterioration of this important cell population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although injured peripheral nerves contain repair Schwann cells that provide signals and spatial clues for promoting regeneration, the clinical outcome after nerve damage is frequently poor. A key reason for this is that, during the slow growth of axons through the proximal parts of injured nerves repair, Schwann cells gradually lose regeneration-supporting features and eventually die. Identification of signals that sustain repair cells is therefore an important goal. We have found that in mice the transcription factor STAT3 protects these cells from death and contributes to maintaining the molecular and morphological repair phenotype that promotes axonal regeneration. Defining the molecular mechanisms that maintain repair Schwann cells is an essential step toward developing therapeutic strategies that improve nerve regeneration and functional recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Topography and Lateralized Effect of Acute Aromatase Inhibition on Auditory Processing in a Seasonal Songbird</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4243?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is increasingly recognized that brain-derived estrogens (neuroestrogens) can regulate brain physiology and behavior much faster than what was previously known from the transcriptional action of estrogens on nuclear receptors. One of the best examples of such neuromodulation by neuroestrogens concerns the acute regulation of sensory coding by the auditory cortex as demonstrated by electrophysiological studies of selected neurons in zebra finches. Yet, the spatial extent of such modulation by neuroestrogens is not known. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate here that acute estrogen depletion alters within minutes auditory processing in male European starlings. These effects are confined to very specific but large areas of the auditory cortex. They are also specifically lateralized to the left hemisphere. Interestingly, the modulation of auditory responses by estrogens was much larger (both in amplitude and in topography) in March than in December or May/June. This effect was presumably independent from changes in circulating testosterone concentrations since levels of the steroid were controlled by subcutaneous implants, thus suggesting actions related to other aspects of the seasonal cycle or photoperiodic manipulations. Finally, we also show that estrogen production specifically modulates selectivity for behaviorally relevant vocalizations in a specific part of the caudomedial nidopallium. These findings confirm and extend previous conclusions that had been obtained by electrophysiological techniques. This approach provides a new very powerful tool to investigate auditory responsiveness in songbirds and its fast modulation by sex steroids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuroestrogens can acutely modulate sensory processing in a manner similar to neuromodulators. We report that acute estrogen depletion rapidly disrupts auditory processing in large areas of the male starling brain. Effects were larger in March than in December or May/June, lateralized to the left hemisphere and specific to behaviorally relevant stimuli. These findings confirm and extend previous data that identified an acute regulation of auditory neurons in zebra finches by (1) delineating the extent of the brain region affected, (2) confirming its lateralization, and (3) demonstrating that a large part of the auditory brain regions are acutely affected by estrogens. These findings provide a very powerful tool to investigate auditory responsiveness in songbirds and its fast modulation by sex steroids.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Respiration-Deficient Astrocytes Survive As Glycolytic Cells In Vivo</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4231?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4231?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons and glial cells exchange energy-rich metabolites and it has been suggested, originally based on &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; data, that astrocytes provide lactate to glutamatergic synapses (&quot;lactate shuttle&quot;). Here, we have studied astrocytes that lack mitochondrial respiration &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. A novel mouse mutant (&lt;i&gt;GLAST&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;CreERT2&lt;/sup&gt;::&lt;i&gt;Cox10&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox&lt;/sup&gt;) was generated, in which the administration of tamoxifen causes mutant astrocytes to fail in the assembly of mitochondrial cytochrome &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; oxidase (COX). Focusing on cerebellar Bergmann glia (BG) cells, which exhibit the highest rate of Cre-mediated recombination, we found a normal density of viable astrocytes even 1 year after tamoxifen-induced &lt;i&gt;Cox10&lt;/i&gt; gene targeting. Our data show that BG cells, and presumably all astrocytes, can survive by aerobic glycolysis for an extended period of time in the absence of glial pathology or unspecific signs of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When astrocytes are placed into culture, they import glucose and release lactate, an energy-rich metabolite readily metabolized by neurons. This observation led to the &quot;glia-to-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis,&quot; but &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; evidence for this hypothesis is weak. To study astroglial energy metabolism and the directionality of lactate flux, we generated conditional &lt;i&gt;Cox10&lt;/i&gt; mouse mutants lacking mitochondrial respiration in astrocytes, which forces these cells to survive by aerobic glycolysis. Here, we report that these mice are fully viable in the absence of any signs of glial or neuronal loss, suggesting that astrocytes are naturally glycolytic cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The activity of a neuronal network, characterized by action potentials
(spikes) is constrained by the intrinsic properties of neurons and their
interactions. When a neuronal network is submitted to external stimuli, the
statistics of spikes changes, and becomes difficult to disentangle the
influence of the stimuli from the intrinsic dynamics. Using the formalism of
Gibbs distributions we analyze this problem in a specific model
(Conductance-based Integrate-and-Fire), where the neuronal dynamics depends on
the history of spikes of the network. We derive a linear response formula
allowing to quantify the influence of a weak amplitude external stimuli on the
average value of arbitrary observables. This formula clearly disentangles the
effect of the stimuli, intrinsic neuronal dynamics, and network connectivity.
Upon some approximations, it reduces to a convolution, allowing to recover a
standard computation in computational neuroscience.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper outlines a methodological approach to generate adaptive agents
driving themselves near points of criticality. Using a synthetic approach we
construct a conceptual model that, instead of specifying mechanistic
requirements to generate criticality, exploits the maintenance of an
organizational structure capable of reproducing critical behavior. Our approach
captures the well-known principle of universality that classifies critical
phenomena inside a few universality classes of systems without relying on
specific mechanisms or topologies. In particular, we implement an artificial
embodied agent controlled by a neural network maintaining a correlation
structure randomly sampled form a lattice Ising model at a critical point. We
evaluate the agent in two classical reinforcement learning scenarios: the
Mountain Car benchmark and the Acrobot double pendulum, finding that in both
cases the neural controller reaches a point of criticality, which coincides
with a transition point between two regimes of the agent's behaviour,
maximizing the synergistic information between hidden neurons and sensorimotor
patterns. Finally, we discuss the possible applications of this synthetic
approach to the comprehension of deeper principles connected to the pervasive
presence of criticality in biological and cognitive systems.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Creative Process of Cultural Evolution. (arXiv:1704.05056v1 [q-bio.PE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05056</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05056</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Even this saying itself is a variant of a similar statement attributed to
Bernard of Chartres in the 12th Century, and inspired the title for a book by
Steven Hawking and an album by Oasis. Creative ideas beget other creative ideas
and, as a result, modifications accumulate, and we see an overall increase in
the complexity of cultural novelty over time, a phenomenon sometimes referred
to as the ratchet effect (Tomasello, Kruger, &amp;amp; Ratner, 1993). Although we may
never meet the people or objects that creatively influence us, by assimilating
what we encounter around us and bringing to bear our own insights and
perspectives, we all contribute in our own way, however small, to a second
evolutionary process -- the evolution of culture. This chapter explores how we
can better understand culture by understanding the creative processes that fuel
it, and better understand creativity by examining it from its cultural context.
First, we look at some theoretical frameworks for how culture evolves and what
these frameworks imply for the role of creativity. Then we will see how
questions about the relationship between creativity and cultural evolution have
been addressed using an agent-based model. We will also discuss studies of how
creative outputs are influenced, in perhaps unexpected ways, by other ideas and
individuals, and how individual creative styles &quot;peek through&quot; cultural outputs
in different domains.

	<description>How are fear memories organized? In this issue of Neuron, Vetere et al. take a network-based approach to demonstrate the importance of highly interconnected hub regions in the consolidation of a fear memory. By doing so, they provide an elegant framework for predicting behavior from functional network properties.</description>

Distinct aPVT efferents bidirectionally regulate sucrose seeking only during reward omission. Whereas aPVT-NAc projections decrease reward seeking, aPVT-amygdala projections increase reward seeking. Photoactivating aPVT neurons abolishes reward seeking.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Robust information propagation through noisy neural circuits</title>

Sensory neurons give highly variable responses to stimulation, which can limit the amount of stimulus information available to downstream circuits. Much work has investigated the factors that affect the amount of information encoded in these population responses, leading to insights about the role of covariability among neurons, tuning curve shape, etc. However, the informativeness of neural responses is not the only relevant feature of population codes; of potentially equal importance is how robustly that information propagates to downstream structures. For instance, to quantify the retina’s performance, one must consider not only the informativeness of the optic nerve responses, but also the amount of information that survives the spike-generating nonlinearity and noise corruption in the next stage of processing, the lateral geniculate nucleus. Our study identifies the set of covariance structures for the upstream cells that optimize the ability of information to propagate through noisy, nonlinear circuits. Within this optimal family are covariances with “differential correlations”, which are known to reduce the information encoded in neural population activities. Thus, covariance structures that maximize information in neural population codes, and those that maximize the ability of this information to propagate, can be very different. Moreover, redundancy is neither necessary nor sufficient to make population codes robust against corruption by noise: redundant codes can be very fragile, and synergistic codes can—in some cases—optimize robustness against noise.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-OtN3PGmSPM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Energy metabolism is central to cellular biology. Thus, genome-scale models of heterotrophic unicellular species must account appropriately for the utilization of external nutrients to synthesize energy metabolites such as ATP. However, metabolic models designed for flux-balance analysis (FBA) may contain thermodynamically impossible energy-generating cycles: without nutrient consumption, these models are still capable of charging energy metabolites (such as ADP→ATP or NADP+→NADPH). Here, we show that energy-generating cycles occur in over 85% of metabolic models without extensive manual curation, such as those contained in the ModelSEED and MetaNetX databases; in contrast, such cycles are rare in the manually curated models of the BiGG database. Energy generating cycles may represent model errors, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;., erroneous assumptions on reaction reversibilities. Alternatively, part of the cycle may be thermodynamically feasible in one environment, while the remainder is thermodynamically feasible in another environment; as standard FBA does not account for thermodynamics, combining these into an FBA model allows erroneous energy generation. The presence of energy-generating cycles typically inflates maximal biomass production rates by 25%, and may lead to biases in evolutionary simulations. We present efficient computational methods (i) to identify energy generating cycles, using FBA, and (ii) to identify minimal sets of model changes that eliminate them, using a variant of the GlobalFit algorithm.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SEq20qtdmn4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This chapter revisits the concept of excitability, a basic system property of
neurons. The focus is on excitable systems regarded as behaviors rather than
dynamical systems. By this we mean open systems modulated by specific
interconnection properties rather than closed systems classified by their
parameter ranges. Modeling, analysis, and synthesis questions can be formulated
in the classical language of circuit theory. The input-output characterization
of excitability is in terms of the local sensitivity of the current-voltage
relationship. It suggests the formulation of novel questions for non-linear
system theory, inspired by questions from experimental neurophysiology.

&lt;p&gt;Two new studies provide new tools for examining mechanisms of plasticity in dendrites. Tang and Yasuda developed new fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensors for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase A (PKA), which are implicated in synaptic plasticity, primarily by replacing the fluorophore &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans exhibit socially contagious behaviours, including contagious itching, but studying the underlying mechanisms has been difficult.

	<description>Pharmacoresistant seizures and cytotoxic cerebral edema are serious complications of ischemic and traumatic brain injury. Intraneuronal Cl− concentration ([Cl−]i) regulation impacts on both cell volume homeostasis and Cl−-permeable GABAA receptor-dependent membrane excitability. Understanding the pleiotropic molecular determinants of neuronal [Cl−]i − cytoplasmic impermeant anions, polyanionic extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins, and plasmalemmal Cl− transporters − could help the identification of novel anticonvulsive and neuroprotective targets.</description>

	<description>We sleep almost one-third of our lives and sleep plays an important role in critical brain functions like memory formation and consolidation. The role of sleep in cerebellar processing, however, constitutes an enigma in the field of neuroscience; we know little about cerebellar sleep-physiology, cerebro–cerebellar interactions during sleep, or the contributions of sleep to cerebellum-dependent memory consolidation. Likewise, we do not understand why cerebellar malfunction can lead to changes in the sleep–wake cycle and sleep disorders.</description>

Discriminating the causative disease variant(s) for individuals with inherited or &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; mutations presents one of the main challenges faced by the clinical genetics community today. Computational approaches for variant prioritization include machine learning methods utilizing a large number of features, including molecular information, interaction networks, or phenotypes. Here, we demonstrate the PhenomeNET Variant Predictor (PVP) system that exploits semantic technologies and automated reasoning over genotype-phenotype relations to filter and prioritize variants in whole exome and whole genome sequencing datasets. We demonstrate the performance of PVP in identifying causative variants on a large number of synthetic whole exome and whole genome sequences, covering a wide range of diseases and syndromes. In a retrospective study, we further illustrate the application of PVP for the interpretation of whole exome sequencing data in patients suffering from congenital hypothyroidism. We find that PVP accurately identifies causative variants in whole exome and whole genome sequencing datasets and provides a powerful resource for the discovery of causal variants.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tDgNhG1ME4I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Deeper exploration of the brain’s vast synaptic networks will require new tools for high-throughput structural and molecular profiling of the diverse populations of synapses that compose those networks. Fluorescence microscopy (FM) and electron microscopy (EM) offer complementary advantages and disadvantages for single-synapse analysis. FM combines exquisite molecular discrimination capacities with high speed and low cost, but rigorous discrimination between synaptic and non-synaptic fluorescence signals is challenging. In contrast, EM remains the gold standard for reliable identification of a synapse, but offers only limited molecular discrimination and is slow and costly. To develop and test single-synapse image analysis methods, we have used datasets from conjugate array tomography (cAT), which provides voxel-conjugate FM and EM (annotated) images of the same individual synapses. We report a novel unsupervised probabilistic method for detection of synapses from multiplex FM (muxFM) image data, and evaluate this method both by comparison to EM gold standard annotated data and by examining its capacity to reproduce known important features of cortical synapse distributions. The proposed probabilistic model-based synapse detector accepts molecular-morphological synapse models as user queries, and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel represents part of a synapse. Taking human annotation of cAT EM data as ground truth, we show that our algorithm detects synapses from muxFM data alone as successfully as human annotators seeing only the muxFM data, and accurately reproduces known architectural features of cortical synapse distributions. This approach opens the door to data-driven discovery of new synapse types and their density. We suggest that our probabilistic synapse detector will also be useful for analysis of standard confocal and super-resolution FM images, where EM cross-validation is not practical.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aRCvW-nYvK8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Effect of transcription factor resource sharing on gene expression noise</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Dipjyoti Das, Supravat Dey, Robert C. Brewster, Sandeep Choubey&lt;/p&gt;

Gene expression is intrinsically a stochastic (noisy) process with important implications for cellular functions. Deciphering the underlying mechanisms of gene expression noise remains one of the key challenges of regulatory biology. Theoretical models of transcription often incorporate the kinetics of how transcription factors (TFs) interact with a single promoter to impact gene expression noise. However, inside single cells multiple identical gene copies as well as additional binding sites can compete for a limiting pool of TFs. Here we develop a simple kinetic model of transcription, which explicitly incorporates this interplay between TF copy number and its binding sites. We show that TF sharing enhances noise in mRNA distribution across an isogenic population of cells. Moreover, when a single gene copy shares it’s TFs with multiple competitor sites, the mRNA variance as a function of the mean remains unaltered by their presence. Hence, all the data for variance as a function of mean expression collapse onto a single master curve independent of the strength and number of competitor sites. However, this result does not hold true when the competition stems from multiple copies of the same gene. Therefore, although previous studies showed that the mean expression follows a universal master curve, our findings suggest that different scenarios of competition bear distinct signatures at the level of variance. Intriguingly, the introduction of competitor sites can transform a unimodal mRNA distribution into a multimodal distribution. These results demonstrate the impact of limited availability of TF resource on the regulation of noise in gene expression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TIEMlk0J4j0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) mechanism allows bacteria to adaptively defend against phages by acquiring short genomic sequences (spacers) that target specific sequences in the viral genome. We propose a population dynamical model where immunity can be both acquired and lost. The model predicts regimes where bacterial and phage populations can co-exist, others where the populations exhibit damped oscillations, and still others where one population is driven to extinction. Our model considers two key parameters: (1) ease of acquisition and (2) spacer effectiveness in conferring immunity. Analytical calculations and numerical simulations show that if spacers differ mainly in ease of acquisition, or if the probability of acquiring them is sufficiently high, bacteria develop a diverse population of spacers. On the other hand, if spacers differ mainly in their effectiveness, their final distribution will be highly peaked, akin to a “winner-take-all” scenario, leading to a specialized spacer distribution. Bacteria can interpolate between these limiting behaviors by actively tuning their overall acquisition probability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Rk5kitjCtOo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Achieving global perfect homeostasis through transporter regulation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yonatan Savir, Alexander Martynov, Michael Springer&lt;/p&gt;

Nutrient homeostasis—the maintenance of relatively constant internal nutrient concentrations in fluctuating external environments—is essential to the survival of most organisms. Transcriptional regulation of plasma membrane transporters by internal nutrient concentrations is typically assumed to be the main mechanism by which homeostasis is achieved. While this mechanism is homeostatic we show that it does not achieve global perfect homeostasis—a condition where internal nutrient concentrations are completely independent of external nutrient concentrations for all external nutrient concentrations. We show that the criterion for global perfect homeostasis is that transporter levels must be inversely proportional to net nutrient flux into the cell and that downregulation of active transporters (activity-dependent regulation) is a simple and biologically plausible mechanism that meets this criterion. Activity-dependent transporter regulation creates a trade-off between robustness and efficiency, i.e., the system's ability to withstand perturbation in external nutrients and the transporter production rate needed to maintain homeostasis. Additionally, we show that a system that utilizes both activity-dependent transporter downregulation and regulation of transporter synthesis by internal nutrient levels can create a system that mitigates the shortcomings of each of the individual mechanisms. This analysis highlights the utility of activity-dependent regulation in achieving homeostasis and calls for a re-examination of the mechanisms of regulation of other homeostatic systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-bFXMDNyVUw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Accumulating evidence supports a role for exosomes in immune regulation. In this study, we investigated the total circulating exosome transcriptome in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients (RRMS) and healthy controls (HC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to define the global RNA profile of serum exosomes in 19 RRMS patients (9 in relapse, 10 in remission) and 10 HC. We analyzed 5 million reads and over 50,000 transcripts per sample, including a detailed analysis of microRNA (miRNA) differentially expressed in RRMS. The discovery set data were validated by quantification using digital quantitative PCR with an independent cohort of 63 RRMS patients (33 in relapse, 30 in remission) and 32 HC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Exosomal RNA NGS revealed that of 15 different classes of transcripts detected 4 circulating exosomal sequences within the miRNA category were differentially expressed in RRMS patients vs HC: hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-196b-5p, hsa-miR-301a-3p and hsa-miR-532-5p. Serum exosomal expression of these miRNA was significantly decreased during relapse in RRMS. These miRNA were also decreased in patients with a gadolinium enhancement on brain magnetic resonance imaging. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; secretion of these miRNA by peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also significantly impaired in RRMS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: These data show that circulating exosomes have a distinct RNA profile in RRMS. Since putative targets for these miRNA include the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and the cell cycle regulator aryl hydrocarbon receptor the data suggest a disturbed cell-to-cell communication in this disease. Thus exosomal miRNA might represent a useful biomarker to distinguish MS relapse. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Simple biochemical networks allow accurate sensing of multiple ligands with a single receptor</title>

Cells use surface receptors to estimate concentrations of external ligands. Limits on the accuracy of such estimations have been well studied for pairs of ligand and receptor species. However, the environment typically contains many ligands, which can bind to the same receptors with different affinities, resulting in cross-talk. In traditional rate models, such cross-talk prevents accurate inference of concentrations of individual ligands. In contrast, here we show that knowing the precise timing sequence of stochastic binding and unbinding events allows one receptor to provide information about multiple ligands simultaneously and with a high accuracy. We show that such high-accuracy estimation of multiple concentrations can be realized with simple structural modifications of the familiar kinetic proofreading biochemical network diagram. We give two specific examples of such modifications. We argue that structural and functional features of real cellular biochemical sensory networks in immune cells, such as feedforward and feedback loops or ligand antagonism, sometimes can be understood as solutions to the accurate multi-ligand estimation problem.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ubt69dgmPdA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Highly accessible AU-rich regions in 3’ untranslated regions are hotspots for binding of regulatory factors</title>

Post-transcriptional regulation is regarded as one of the major processes involved in the regulation of gene expression. It is mainly performed by RNA binding proteins and microRNAs, which target RNAs and typically affect their stability. Recent efforts from the scientific community have aimed at understanding post-transcriptional regulation at a global scale by using high-throughput sequencing techniques such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP), which facilitates identification of binding sites of these regulatory factors. However, the diversity in the experimental procedures and bioinformatics analyses has hindered the integration of multiple datasets and thus limited the development of an integrated view of post-transcriptional regulation. In this work, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of 107 CLIP datasets from 49 different RBPs in HEK293 cells to shed light on the complex interactions that govern post-transcriptional regulation. By developing a more stringent CLIP analysis pipeline we have discovered the existence of conserved regulatory AU-rich regions in the 3’UTRs where miRNAs and RBPs that regulate several processes such as polyadenylation or mRNA stability bind. Analogous to promoters, many factors have binding sites overlapping or in close proximity in these hotspots and hence the regulation of the mRNA may depend on their relative concentrations. This hypothesis is supported by RBP knockdown experiments that alter the relative concentration of RBPs in the cell. Upon AGO2 knockdown (KD), transcripts containing “free” target sites show increased expression levels compared to those containing target sites in hotspots, which suggests that target sites within hotspots are less available for miRNAs to bind. Interestingly, these hotspots appear enriched in genes with regulatory functions such as DNA binding and RNA binding. Taken together, our results suggest that hotspots are functional regulatory elements that define an extra layer of regulation of post-transcriptional regulatory networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Eu7ni9y2PKY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Heterogeneous firing responses predict diverse couplings to presynaptic activity in mice layer V pyramidal neurons</title>

In this study, we present a theoretical framework combining experimental characterizations and analytical calculus to capture the firing rate input-output properties of single neurons in the fluctuation-driven regime. Our framework consists of a two-step procedure to treat independently how the dendritic input translates into somatic fluctuation variables, and how the latter determine action potential firing. We use this framework to investigate the functional impact of the heterogeneity in firing responses found experimentally in young mice layer V pyramidal cells. We first design and calibrate &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; a simplified morphological model of layer V pyramidal neurons with a dendritic tree following Rall's branching rule. Then, we propose an analytical derivation for the membrane potential fluctuations at the soma as a function of the properties of the synaptic input in dendrites. This mathematical description allows us to easily emulate various forms of synaptic input: either balanced, unbalanced, synchronized, purely proximal or purely distal synaptic activity. We find that those different forms of input activity lead to various impact on the membrane potential fluctuations properties, thus raising the possibility that individual neurons will differentially couple to specific forms of activity as a result of their different firing response. We indeed found such a heterogeneous coupling between synaptic input and firing response for all types of presynaptic activity. This heterogeneity can be explained by different levels of cellular excitability in the case of the balanced, unbalanced, synchronized and purely distal activity. A notable exception appears for proximal dendritic inputs: increasing the input level can either promote firing response in some cells, or suppress it in some other cells whatever their individual excitability. This behavior can be explained by different sensitivities to the speed of the fluctuations, which was previously associated to different levels of sodium channel inactivation and density. Because local network connectivity rather targets proximal dendrites, our results suggest that this aspect of biophysical heterogeneity might be relevant to neocortical processing by controlling how individual neurons couple to local network activity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6jte2cL8TGI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The immune response of the human brain to abdominal surgery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24909</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24909</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24909-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgery launches a systemic inflammatory reaction that reaches the brain and associates with immune activation and cognitive decline. Although preclinical studies have in part described this systemic-to-brain signaling pathway, we lack information on how these changes appear in humans. This study examines the short- and long-term impact of abdominal surgery on the human brain immune system by positron emission tomography (PET) in relation to blood immune reactivity, plasma inflammatory biomarkers, and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24909-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight males undergoing prostatectomy under general anesthesia were included. Prior to surgery (baseline), at postoperative days 3 to 4, and after 3 months, patients were examined using [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 brain PET imaging to assess brain immune cell activation. Concurrently, systemic inflammatory biomarkers, ex vivo blood tests on immunoreactivity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and cognitive function were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24909-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients showed a global downregulation of gray matter [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 binding of 26 ± 26% (mean ± standard deviation) at 3 to 4 days postoperatively compared to baseline (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.023), recovering or even increasing after 3 months. LPS-induced release of the proinflammatory marker tumor necrosis factor-α in blood displayed a reduction (41 ± 39%) on the 3rd to 4th postoperative day, corresponding to changes in [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 distribution volume. Change in Stroop Color-Word Test performance between postoperative days 3 to 4 and 3 months correlated to change in [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 binding (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.027).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24909-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study translates preclinical data on changes in the brain immune system after surgery to humans, and suggests an interplay between the human brain and the inflammatory response of the peripheral innate immune system. These findings may be related to postsurgical impairments of cognitive function. Ann Neurol 2017;81:572–582&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Focused ultrasound as a novel strategy for Alzheimer's disease therapeutics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24933</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of advances in the pathology, genetics and imaging of Alzheimer's disease (AD), there remain no effective treatments that significantly alter its natural history. Several late phase clinical trials, focused largely on amyloid beta metabolism and clearance, have unfortunately demonstrated no significant benefit in early AD patients. Recent work investigating blood-brain barrier opening using focused ultrasound in transgenic animal models has shown that repeated ultrasound administration coupled with microbubble-containing contrast can reduce plaque burden and reverse memory deficits. While the mechanisms underlying plaque clearance are under investigation, this image-guided, noninvasive technique appears promising. This article describes the rationale and underlying principles of focused ultrasound as applied to Alzheimer's disease and suggests that based on promising pre-clinical results, this technology, whether alone or in conjunction with targeted therapies, can be of potential benefit.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Are midsagittal tissue bridges predictive of outcome after cervical spinal cord injury?</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;T2-weighted scans provided data on the extent and dynamics of neuronal tissue damage and midsagittal tissue bridges at the epicenter of traumatic cervical spinal cord lesions in 24 subacute tetraplegic patients. At one month post-injury, smaller lesion area and midsagittal tissue bridges identified those patients with lower extremity evoked potentials and better clinical recovery. Wider midsagittal tissue bridges and smaller lesions at one month post-injury were associated with neurological and functional recovery at 1 year follow-up. Neuroimaging biomarkers of lesion area and midsagittal tissue bridges are potential outcome predictors and patient stratifiers in both subacute and chronic clinical trials.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A mutation in the Tubb4a gene leads to microtubule accumulation with hypomyelination and demyelination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24930</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24930</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Our goal was to define the genetic cause of the profound hypomyelination in the &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; rat model and determine its relevance to human white matter disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Based on previous localization of the &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; mutation to rat chromosome 9, we tested if the mutation resided within the &lt;em&gt;Tubb4a&lt;/em&gt; (β-tubulin 4A) gene, since mutations in the &lt;em&gt;TUBB4A&lt;/em&gt; gene have been described in patients with CNS hypomyelination. To determine whether accumulation of microtubules led to progressive demyelination we analyzed the spinal cord and optic nerves of 2 year old rats by light and electron microscopy. Cerebral white matter from a patient with &lt;em&gt;TUBB4A&lt;/em&gt; Asn414Lys mutation and MRI evidence of severe hypomyelination was studied similarly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: As the &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; rat ages there is progressive loss of myelin in the brain and dorsal column of the spinal cord associated with increased oligodendrocyte numbers with accumulation of microtubules. This accumulation involved the entire cell body and distal processes of oligodendrocytes but there was no accumulation of microtubules in axons. A single point mutation in &lt;em&gt;Tubb4a&lt;/em&gt; (p.Ala302Thr) was found in homozygous &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; samples. A similar hypomyelination associated with increased oligodendrocyte numbers and arrays of microtubules in oligodendrocytes was demonstrated in the human patient sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: The &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; rat is the first animal model of &lt;em&gt;TUBB4&lt;/em&gt; mutations in humans and a novel system in which to test the mechanism of microtubule accumulation. The finding of microtubule accumulation in a patient with a &lt;em&gt;TUBB4A&lt;/em&gt; mutation and leukodystrophy confirms the usefulness of &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; as a model of the human disease.

&lt;p&gt;People have been told that 'brain training' will make them not only better at playing certain games but smarter in general. However, evidence indicates that brain plasticity is specific to the acquired skill. The search for neural mechanisms of transfer of training-induced benefits needs to build on this evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proper construction of neural circuits requires the generation of diverse cell types, their distribution to defined regions, and their specific and appropriate wiring. A major objective in neurobiology has been to understand the molecular determinants that link neural birth to terminal specification and functional &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Deciphering Neural Codes of Memory during Sleep</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30045-0?rss=yes</guid>

	<description>Memories of experiences are stored in the cerebral cortex. Sleep is critical for the consolidation of hippocampal memory of wake experiences into the neocortex. Understanding representations of neural codes of hippocampal–neocortical networks during sleep would reveal important circuit mechanisms in memory consolidation and provide novel insights into memory and dreams. Although sleep-associated ensemble spike activity has been investigated, identifying the content of memory in sleep remains challenging.</description>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors: Dominik R. Bach &amp;amp; Peter Dayan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature and neural implementation of emotions is the subject of vigorous debate. Here, we use Bayesian decision theory to address key complexities in this field and conceptualize emotions in terms of their relationship to survival-relevant behavioural choices. Decision theory indicates which behaviours are optimal &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authors: Ulrike C. Müller, Thomas Deller &amp;amp; Martin Korte&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amyloid precursor protein (APP) gives rise to the amyloid-β peptide and thus has a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. By contrast, the physiological functions of APP and the closely related APP-like proteins (APLPs) remain less well understood. Studying these physiological functions has &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>A growing body of work is investigating the use of mental maps during decision-making. Here we discuss how decision-making organizes experiences according to an internal model of the current task, thereby structuring memory. Likewise, we consider how the structure of mental maps contributes to decision-making.</description>

	<description>Early sensory cortex is typically investigated in response to sensory stimulation, masking the contribution of internal signals. Recently, van Kerkoerle and colleagues reported that attention and memory signals segregate from sensory signals within specific layers of primary visual cortex, providing insight into the role of internal signals in sensory processing.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules of the Immunoglobulin Superfamily Regulate Synapse Formation, Maintenance, and Function</title>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30032-2?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecules are among the most abundant proteins in vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems. Prominent family members are the neural cell adhesion molecules NCAM and L1, which were the first to be shown to be essential not only in development but also in synaptic function and as key regulators of synapse formation, synaptic activity, plasticity, and synaptic vesicle recycling at distinct developmental and activity stages. In addition to interacting with each other, adhesion molecules interact with ion channels and cytokine and neurotransmitter receptors.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Author: Theresa A. Jones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroke instigates a dynamic process of repair and remodelling of remaining neural circuits, and this process is shaped by behavioural experiences. The onset of motor disability simultaneously creates a powerful incentive to develop new, compensatory ways of performing daily activities. Compensatory movement strategies that are &lt;/p&gt;
