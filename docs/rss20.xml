	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A computational model of shared fine-scale structure in the human connectome</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by J. Swaroop Guntupalli, Ma Feilong, James V. Haxby&lt;/p&gt;

Variation in cortical connectivity profiles is typically modeled as having a coarse spatial scale parcellated into interconnected brain areas. We created a high-dimensional common model of the human connectome to search for fine-scale structure that is shared across brains. Projecting individual connectivity data into this new common model connectome accounts for substantially more variance in the human connectome than do previous models. This newly discovered shared structure is closely related to fine-scale distinctions in representations of information. These results reveal a shared fine-scale structure that is a major component of the human connectome that coexists with coarse-scale, areal structure. This shared fine-scale structure was not captured in previous models and was, therefore, inaccessible to analysis and study.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PKWzqyJ_2Tk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: On the role of extrinsic noise in microRNA-mediated bimodal gene expression</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Marco Del Giudice, Stefano Bo, Silvia Grigolon, Carla Bosia&lt;/p&gt;

Several studies highlighted the relevance of extrinsic noise in shaping cell decision making and differentiation in molecular networks. Bimodal distributions of gene expression levels provide experimental evidence of phenotypic differentiation, where the modes of the distribution often correspond to different physiological states of the system. We theoretically address the presence of bimodal phenotypes in the context of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation. MiRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules that downregulate the expression of their target mRNAs. The nature of this interaction is titrative and induces a threshold effect: below a given target transcription rate almost no mRNAs are free and available for translation. We investigate the effect of extrinsic noise on the system by introducing a fluctuating miRNA-transcription rate. We find that the presence of extrinsic noise favours the presence of bimodal target distributions which can be observed for a wider range of parameters compared to the case with intrinsic noise only and for lower miRNA-target interaction strength. Our results suggest that combining threshold-inducing interactions with extrinsic noise provides a simple and robust mechanism for obtaining bimodal populations without requiring fine tuning. Furthermore, we characterise the protein distribution’s dependence on protein half-life.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kcCJaIvDnzk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: The Midline Axon Crossing Decision Is Regulated through an Activity-Dependent Mechanism by the NMDA Receptor</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Axon guidance in vertebrates is controlled by genetic cascades as well as by intrinsic activity-dependent refinement of connections. Midline axon crossing is one of the best studied pathfinding models and is fundamental to the establishment of bilaterally symmetric nervous systems. However, it is not known whether crossing requires intrinsic activity in axons, and what controls that activity. Further, a mechanism linking neuronal activity and gene expression has not been identified for axon pathfinding. Using embryonic zebrafish, we found that the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) NR1.1 subunit (&lt;i&gt;grin1a&lt;/i&gt;) is expressed in commissural axons. Pharmacological inhibition of &lt;i&gt;grin1a&lt;/i&gt;, hypoxia exposure reduction of &lt;i&gt;grin1a&lt;/i&gt; expression, or CRISPR knock-down of &lt;i&gt;grin1a&lt;/i&gt; leads to defects in midline crossing. Inhibition of neuronal activity phenocopies the effects of &lt;i&gt;grin1a&lt;/i&gt; loss on midline crossing. By combining pharmacological inhibition of the NMDAR with optogenetic stimulation to precisely restore neuronal activity, we observed rescue of midline crossing. This suggests that the NMDAR controls pathfinding by an activity-dependent mechanism. We further show that the NMDAR may act, via modulating activity, on the transcription factor &lt;i&gt;arxa&lt;/i&gt; (mammalian &lt;i&gt;Arx&lt;/i&gt;), a known regulator of midline pathfinding. These findings uncover a novel role for the NMDAR in controlling activity to regulate commissural pathfinding and identify &lt;i&gt;arxa&lt;/i&gt; as a key link between the genetic and activity-dependent regulation of midline axon guidance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Beneficial Outcome of Urethane Treatment Following Status Epilepticus in a Rat Organophosphorus Toxicity Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of benzodiazepines to terminate electrographic status epilepticus (SE) declines the longer a patient is in SE. Therefore, alternative methods for ensuring complete block of SE and refractory SE are necessary. We compared the ability of diazepam and a subanesthetic dose of urethane to terminate prolonged SE and mitigate subsequent pathologies. Adult Sprague Dawley rats were injected with diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) to induce SE. Rats were administered diazepam (10 mg/kg, ip) or urethane (0.8 g/kg, s.c.) 1 h after DFP-induced SE and compared to rats that experienced uninterrupted SE. Large-amplitude and high-frequency spikes induced by DFP administration were quenched for at least 46 h in rats administered urethane 1 h after SE onset as demonstrated by cortical electroencephalography (EEG). By contrast, diazepam interrupted SE but seizures with high power in the 20- to 70-Hz band returned 6–10 h later. Urethane was more effective than diazepam at reducing hippocampal neurodegeneration, brain inflammation, gliosis and weight loss as measured on day 4 after SE. Furthermore, rats administered urethane displayed a 73% reduction in the incidence of spontaneous recurrent seizures after four to eight weeks and a 90% reduction in frequency of seizures in epileptic rats. By contrast, behavioral changes in the light/dark box, open field and a novel object recognition task were not improved by urethane. These findings indicate that in typical rodent SE models, it is the return of SE overnight, and not the initially intense 1–2 h of SE experience, that is largely responsible for neurodegeneration, accompanying inflammation, and the subsequent development of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Frontal Eye Field Inactivation Reduces Saccade Preparation in the Superior Colliculus but Does Not Alter How Preparatory Activity Relates to Saccades of a Given Latency</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;A neural correlate for saccadic reaction times (SRTs) in the gap saccade task is the level of low-frequency activity in the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (iSC) just before visual target onset: greater levels of such &lt;i&gt;preparatory&lt;/i&gt; iSC low-frequency activity precede shorter SRTs. The frontal eye fields (FEFs) are one likely source of iSC preparatory activity, since FEF preparatory activity is also inversely related to SRT. To better understand the FEF’s role in saccade preparation, and the way in which such preparation relates to SRT, in two male rhesus monkeys, we compared iSC preparatory activity across unilateral reversible cryogenic inactivation of the FEF. FEF inactivation increased contralesional SRTs, and lowered ipsilesional iSC preparatory activity. FEF inactivation also reduced rostral iSC activity during the gap period. Importantly, the distributions of SRTs generated with or without FEF inactivation overlapped, enabling us to conduct a novel population-level analyses examining iSC preparatory activity just before generation of SRT-matched saccades. When matched for SRTs, we observed no change during FEF inactivation in the relationship between iSC preparatory activity and SRT-matched saccades across a range of SRTs, even for the occasional express saccade. Thus, while our results emphasize that the FEF has an overall excitatory influence on preparatory activity in the iSC, the communication between the iSC and downstream oculomotor brainstem is unaltered for SRT-matched saccades.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Cytoskeletal components, such as tubulins and actins, have the remarkable ability to organize themselves into filaments and networks to support specialized and compartmentalized functions. Alterations in cytoskeletal proteins have long been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on recent findings, primarily from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans that illustrate how different tubulin protein isotypes can play distinct roles in neuronal development and function. Additionally, we discuss studies revealing new regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and highlight recent technological advances in in vivo imaging and functional dissection of the neuronal cytoskeleton. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Molecular-level functional magnetic resonance imaging (molecular fMRI) is a new technology that can help bridge these scales by mapping defined microscopic phenomena over large, optically inaccessible regions of the living brain. In this review, we explain how MRI-detectable imaging probes can be used to sensitize noninvasive imaging to mechanistically significant components of neural processing. We discuss how a combination of innovative probe design, advanced imaging methods, and strategies for brain delivery can make molecular fMRI an increasingly successful approach for spatiotemporally resolved studies of diverse neural phenomena, perhaps eventually in people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Although clinically different, they share similar molecular features: the accumulation of one or two proteins in abnormal conformations inside or outside neurons. Enhancing protein quality control systems could be a useful strategy to neutralize the abnormal proteins causing neurodegenerative diseases. This review emphasizes the subcellular location of protein deposits in neurodegenerative diseases and the need to tailor strategies aimed at boosting protein quality control systems to the affected subcellular compartment. Inhibition of a protein phosphatase terminating the unfolded protein response will be discussed as a strategy to protect from diseases associated with misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Andy   Zhou, Benjamin C   Johnson, Rikky   Muller&lt;br /&gt; Closed-loop and responsive neuromodulation systems improve open-loop neurostimulation by responding directly to measured neural activity and providing adaptive, on-demand therapy. To be effective, these systems must be able to simultaneously record and stimulate neural activity, a task made difficult by persistent stimulation artifacts that distort and obscure underlying biomarkers. To enable simultaneous stimulation and recording, several techniques have been proposed. These techniques involve artifact-preventing system configurations, resilient recording front-ends, and back-end signal processing for removing recorded artifacts. Co-designing and integrating these artifact cancellation techniques will be key to enabling neuromodulation systems to stimulate and record at the same time. Here, we review the state-of-the-art for these techniques and their role in achieving artifact-free neuromodulation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Gilles C   .Vanwalleghem, Misha B   Ahrens, Ethan K   Scott&lt;br /&gt; Due to their small size and transparency, zebrafish larvae are amenable to a range of fluorescence microscopy techniques. With the development of sensitive genetically encoded calcium indicators, this has extended to the whole-brain imaging of neural activity with cellular resolution. This technique has been used to study brain-wide population dynamics accompanying sensory processing and sensorimotor transformations, and has spurred the development of innovative closed-loop behavioral paradigms in which stimulus–response relationships can be studied. More recently, microscopes have been developed that allow whole-brain calcium imaging in freely swimming and behaving larvae. In this review, we highlight the technologies underlying whole-brain functional imaging in zebrafish, provide examples of the sensory and motor processes that have been studied with this technique, and discuss the need to merge data from whole-brain functional imaging studies with neurochemical and anatomical information to develop holistic models of functional neural circuits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Thanks to the development and optimization of various genetically encoded sensors, we are approaching the stage in which a few key neurotransmitters/neuromodulators can be imaged with high cell specificity and good signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we summarize recent progress regarding these sensors, focusing on their design principles, properties, potential applications, and current limitations. We also highlight the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) scaffold as a promising platform that may enable the scalable development of the next generation of sensors, enabling the rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of a large repertoire of neurotransmitters/neuromodulators in vivo at cellular or even subcellular resolution. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;165&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817301915-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Microelectrode arrays based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, such as Neuropixels probes, look set to transform these methods. Neuropixels probes provide ∼1000 recording sites on an extremely narrow shank, with on-board amplification, digitization, and multiplexing. They deliver low-noise recordings from hundreds of neurons, providing a step change in the type of data available to neuroscientists. Here we discuss the opportunities afforded by these probes for large-scale electrophysiology, the challenges associated with data processing and anatomical localization, and avenues for further improvements of the technology. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Miao   He, Z Josh   Huang&lt;br /&gt; Understanding brain circuit organization and function requires systematic dissection of its cellular components. With vast cell number and diversity, mammalian nervous systems present a daunting challenge for achieving specific and comprehensive cell type access—prerequisite to circuit analysis. Genetic approaches in the mouse have relied on germline engineering to access marker-defined cell populations. Combinatorial strategies that engage marker intersection, anatomy and projection pattern (e.g. antero-grade and retro-grade viral vectors), and developmental lineage substantially increase the specificity of cell type targeting. While increasing number of mouse cell types are becoming experimentally accessible, comprehensive coverage requires larger coordinated efforts with strategic infrastructural and fiscal planning. CRISPR-based genome editing may enable cell type access in other species, but issues of time, cost and ethics remain, especially for primates. Novel approaches that bypass the germline, such as somatic cell engineering and cell surface-based gene delivery, may reduce the barrier of genetic access to mammalian cell types. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): I-Wen   Chen, Eirini   Papagiakoumou, Valentina   Emiliani&lt;br /&gt; Optogenetics neuronal targeting combined with single-photon wide-field illumination has already proved its enormous potential in neuroscience, enabling the optical control of entire neuronal networks and disentangling their role in the control of specific behaviors. However, establishing how a single or a sub-set of neurons controls a specific behavior, or how functionally identical neurons are connected in a particular task, or yet how behaviors can be modified in real-time by the complex wiring diagram of neuronal connections requires more sophisticated approaches enabling to drive neuronal circuits activity with single-cell precision and millisecond temporal resolution. This has motivated on one side the development of flexible optical methods for two-photon (2P) optogenetic activation using either, or a hybrid of two approaches: scanning and parallel illumination. On the other side, it has stimulated the engineering of new opsins with modified spectral characteristics, channel kinetics and spatial distribution of expression, offering the necessary flexibility of choosing the appropriate opsin for each application. The need for optical manipulation of multiple targets with millisecond temporal resolution has imposed three-dimension (3D) parallel holographic illumination as the technique of choice for optical control of neuronal circuits organized in 3D. Today 3D parallel illumination exists in several complementary variants, each with a different degree of simplicity, light uniformity, temporal precision and axial resolution. In parallel, the possibility to reach hundreds of targets in 3D volumes has prompted the development of low-repetition rate amplified laser sources enabling high peak power, while keeping low average power for stimulating each cell. All together those progresses open the way for a precise optical manipulation of neuronal circuits with unprecedented precision and flexibility. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;245&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817302477-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;249&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: August 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Natali L   Chanaday, Ege T   Kavalali&lt;br /&gt; Presynaptic nerve terminals release neurotransmitter synchronously, asynchronously or spontaneously. During synchronous neurotransmission release is precisely coupled to action potentials, in contrast, asynchronous release events show only loose temporal coupling to presynaptic activity whereas spontaneous neurotransmission occurs independent of presynaptic activity. The mechanisms that give rise to this diversity in neurotransmitter release modes are poorly understood. Recent studies have described several presynaptic molecular pathways controlling synaptic vesicle pool segregation and recycling, which in turn may dictate distinct modes of neurotransmitter release. In this article, we review this recent work regarding neurotransmitter release modes and their relationship to synaptic vesicle pool dynamics as well as the molecular machinery that establishes synaptic vesicle pool identity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Denis   Scaini, Laura   Ballerini&lt;br /&gt; Interfacing the nervous system with devices able to efficiently record or modulate the electrical activity of neuronal cells represents the underlying foundation of future theranostic applications in neurology and of current openings in neuroscience research. These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Equalization of the network sensitivity enhances predictive power at criticality in a whole-brain model. (arXiv:1804.05823v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the relationship between structural and functional connectivity
remains a crucial issue in modern neuroscience. Here we investigate such
relationship through a stochastic neural whole-brain model, using as input the
structural connectivity matrix defined by the human connectome. Importantly, we
address the structure-function relationship both at the group and
individual-based levels. In this work, we show that equalization of the nodes
excitatory input improves the correlation between simulated neural patterns of
the model and various brain functional data. We find that the best model
performance is achieved when the model control parameter is in its critical
value and that equalization minimizes both the variability of the critical
points and neuronal activity patterns among subjects. Our results open new
perspectives in personalized brain modelling with potential applications to
investigate the deviation from criticality due to structural lesions (e.g.
stroke) or brain disorders.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Universal Features in Phonological Neighbor Networks. (arXiv:1804.05766v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05766</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human speech perception involves transforming a countinous acoustic signal
into discrete linguistically meaningful units, such as phonemes, while
simultaneously causing a listener to activate words that are similar to the
spoken utterance and to each other. The Neighborhood Activation Model
(NAM~\cite{Luce:1986,Luce:1998}) posits that phonological neighbors (two forms
[words] that differ by one phoneme) compete significantly for recognition as a
spoken word is heard. This definition of phonological similarity can be
extended to an entire corpus of forms to produce a phonological neighbor
network~\cite{Vitevitch:2008} (PNN). We study PNNs for five languages: English,
Spanish, French, Dutch, and German. Consistent with previous work, we find that
the PNNs share a consistent set of topological features. Using an approach that
generates random lexicons with increasing levels of phonological realism, we
show that even random forms with minimal relationship to any real language,
combined with only the empirical distribution of language-specific phonological
form lengths, are sufficient to produce the topological properties observed in
the real language PNNs. The resulting pseudo-PNNs are insensitive to the level
of lingusitic realism in the random lexicons but quite sensitive to the shape
of the form length distribution. We therefore conclude that &quot;universal&quot;
features seen across multiple languages are really string universals, not
language universals, and arise primarily due to limitations in the kinds of
networks generated by the one-step neighbor definition. Taken together, our
results indicate that caution is warranted when linking the dynamics of human
spoken word recognition to the topological properties of PNNs, and that the
investigation of alternative similarity metrics for phonological forms should
be a priority.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Cochlear detection of double-slip motion in cello bowing. (arXiv:1804.05695v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05695</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05695</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A double-slip motion of a cello sound is investigated experimentally with a
bowing machine and analyzed using a Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD)
cochlear model. A double-slip sound is investigated. Here the sawtooth motion
of normal bowing is basically present, but within each period the bow hair
tears off the strings once more within the period, resulting in a blurred
sound. This additional intermediate slip appears around the middle of each
period and drifts temporally around while the sound progresses. When the
double-slip is perfectly in the middle of one period the sound is that of a
regular sawtooth motion. If not, two periodicities are present around double
the fundamental periodicity, making the sound arbitrary. Analyzing the sound
with a Wavelet-transform, the expected double-peak of two periodicities around
the second partial cannot be found. Analyzing the tone with a cochlear FDTD
model including the transfer of mechanical energy into spikes, the doubling and
even more complex behaviour is perfectly represented in the Interspike Interval
(ISI) of two adjacent spikes. This cochlear spike representation fits perfectly
to an amplitude peak detection algorithm, tracking the precise time point of
the double-slip within the fundamental period. Therefore the ear is able to
detect the double-slip motion right at the transition from the basilar membrane
motion into electrical spikes.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Robust entropy requires strong and balanced excitatory and inhibitory synapses. (arXiv:1804.05266v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05266</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05266</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is widely appreciated that well-balanced excitation and inhibition are
necessary for proper function in neural networks. However, in principle, such
balance could be achieved by many possible configurations of excitatory and
inhibitory strengths, and relative numbers of excitatory and inhibitory
neurons. For instance, a given level of excitation could be balanced by either
numerous inhibitory neurons with weak synapses, or few inhibitory neurons with
strong synapses. Among the continuum of different but balanced configurations,
why should any particular configuration be favored? Here we address this
question in the context of the entropy of network dynamics by studying an
analytically tractable network of binary neurons. We find that entropy is
highest at the boundary between excitation-dominant and inhibition-dominant
regimes. Entropy also varies along this boundary with a trade-off between high
and robust entropy: weak synapse strengths yield high network entropy which is
fragile to parameter variations, while strong synapse strengths yield a lower,
but more robust, network entropy. In the case where inhibitory and excitatory
synapses are constrained to have similar strength, we find that a small, but
non-zero fraction of inhibitory neurons, like that seen in mammalian cortex,
results in robust and relatively high entropy.

	<description>The dynamic process of memory consolidation involves a reorganization of brain regions that support a memory trace over time, but exactly how the network reorganizes as the memory changes remains unclear. We present novel converging evidence from studies of animals (rats) and humans for the time-dependent reorganization and transformation of different types of memory as measured both by behavior and brain activation. We find that context-specific memories in rats, and naturalistic episodic memories in humans, lose precision over time and activity in the hippocampus decreases. If, however, the retrieved memories retain contextual or perceptual detail, the hippocampus is engaged similarly at recent and remote timepoints. As the interval between the timepoint increases, the medial prefrontal cortex is engaged increasingly during memory retrieval, regardless of the context or the amount of retrieved detail. Moreover, these hippocampal-frontal shifts are accompanied by corresponding changes in a network of cortical structures mediating perceptually-detailed as well as less precise, schematic memories. These findings provide cross-species evidence for the crucial interplay between hippocampus and neocortex that reflects changes in memory representation over time and underlies systems consolidation.</description>

	<description>Numerous genetic and environmental factors contribute to psychiatric disorders and other brain disorders. Common risk factors likely converge on biological pathways regulating the optimization of brain structure and function across the lifespan. Here, using structural magnetic resonance imaging and machine learning, we estimated the gap between brain age and chronological age in 36,891 individuals aged 3 to 96 years, including individuals with different brain disorders. We show that several disorders are associated with accentuated brain aging, with strongest effects in schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis and dementia, and document differential regional patterns of brain age gaps between disorders. In 16,269 healthy adult individuals, we show that brain age gap is heritable with a polygenic architecture overlapping those observed in common brain disorders. Our results identify brain age gap as a genetically modulated trait that offers a window into shared and distinct mechanisms in different brain disorders.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Hemispheric Asymmetry of Globus Pallidus Explains Reward-related Posterior Alpha Modulation in Humans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303016v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Although basal ganglia (BG) functions have been widely explored in relation to motor control, recent evidence suggests that their mechanisms extend to the domain of attentional switching. We here investigated the BG involvement in reward related top-down control of visual alpha-band oscillations (8-13 Hz), which have been linked to the mechanisms supporting the allocation of spatial attention. Given that items associated with contextual saliency (e.g. monetary reward or loss) attract attention, it is not surprising that alpha oscillations are further modulated by the saliency properties of the visual items. The executive network controlling such reward-dependent modulations of oscillatory brain activity has yet to be elucidated, and likely relies on the contribution of subcortical regions. To uncover this, we investigated whether derived measures of basal ganglia (BG) structural asymmetries could predict interhemispheric modulation of alpha power, during a spatial attention task. We show that volumetric lateralization of the globus pallidus (GP) significantly explains individual hemispheric biases in alpha power modulation. Importantly, this effect varied as a function of value-saliency parings in the task. We hence provide compelling evidence suggesting that the GP in humans is a node within the executive control network, implicated in reward related top-down control of visual alpha oscillations during saliency processing.</description>

	<description>The neural substrates of working memory are spread across prefrontal, parietal and cingulate 2 cortices and are thought to be coordinated through low frequency cortical oscillations in the theta 3 (3 to 8 Hz) and alpha (8 to 12 Hz) frequency bands. While the functional role of many subregions 4 have been elucidated using neuroimaging studies, the role of superior frontal gyrus (SFG) is not 5 yet clear. Here, we combined electrocorticography and direct cortical stimulation in three patients 6 implanted with subdural electrodes to assess if superior frontal gyrus is indeed involved in working 7 memory. We found left SFG exhibited task-related modulation of oscillations in the theta and alpha 8 frequency bands specifically during the encoding epoch. Stimulation at the frequency matched to 9 the endogenous oscillations resulted in reduced reaction times in all three participants. Our results 10 support the causal role of SFG in working memory and suggest that SFG may coordinate working 11 memory through low-frequency oscillations thus bolstering the feasibility of targeting oscillations 12 for restoring cognitive function.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Rules Governing Perception of Multiple Phosphenes by Human Observers</title>

	<description>Stimulation of single sites in primary visual cortex results in the perception of a small flash of light known as a phosphene. Little is known about how phosphenes from multiple electrodes can be combined to form perception of coherent patterns. Here we examine the percepts reported by human observers as various spatial configurations of 2 to 5 electrodes in visual cortex were stimulated simultaneously. When two electrodes were stimulated simultaneously, subjects reliably perceived either one or two phosphenes depending on the physical distance separating the electrodes. In cases where two phosphenes were perceived, they were located in the same visual field location as when the two electrodes were stimulated separately. Adding a third electrode produced similar results. In several subjects, we obtained combination of 4 to 5 electrodes that generated individual phosphenes when stimulated concurrently. Subjects were able to reliably discriminate between different multiple electrode stimulation patterns that were presented in random order. These results demonstrate that simple pattern information can be conveyed to subjects with surface electrodes spaced at millimeters apart on the cortex.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Population coding of pattern separation in the monkey hippocampus</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302505v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the hippocampus are considered key for disambiguating sensory inputs from similar experiences in memory, a process termed pattern separation. The neural mechanisms underlying pattern separation, however, have been difficult to compare across species: rodents offer robust recording methods with less human-centric tasks while humans provide complex behavior with less recording potential. To overcome these limitations, we trained monkeys to perform a visual pattern separation task similar to those used in humans while recording activity from single CA3/DG neurons. Using a novel looking pattern assay to evaluate behavior, we find that when animals distinguish recently seen novel images from similar images, indicative of pattern separation, CA3/DG neurons treat the similar images more like novel than repeat images. Further, while many hippocampal neurons respond during pattern separation, only a limited proportion respond to any given pattern separation event, consistent with a sparse distributed code.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Representation of auditory motion directions and sound source locations in the human planum temporale</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302497v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The ability to precisely compute the location and direction of sounds in external space is a crucial perceptual process to efficiently interact with dynamic environments. Little is known, however, about how the human brain implements spatial hearing. In our study, we used fMRI to characterize the brain activity of humans listening to left, right, up and down moving as well as static sounds. Whole brain univariate results contrasting moving and static sounds varying in their location revealed a robust functional preference for auditory motion in bilateral human Planum Temporale (hPT). Importantly, multivariate pattern classification analysis showed that hPT contains information about both auditory motion directions and, to a lesser extent, sound source locations. More precisely, we observed that our classifier successfully decoded opposite axes of motion (vertical versus horizontal) but was less able to classify opposite within-axis direction (left versus right or up versus down); reminiscent of the axis of motion organization observed in the middle-temporal cortex for vision. Further multivariate analyses demonstrated that even if motion direction and location rely on partially shared pattern geometries in PT, the responses elicited by static and moving sounds were however highly distinct. Altogether our results demonstrate that human PT codes for auditory motion and location but that the underlying neural computation linked to motion processing is more reliable and partially distinct from the one supporting sound source location.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Beyond Core Object Recognition: Recurrent processes account for object recognition under occlusion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302034v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302034v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Core object recognition, the ability to rapidly recognize objects despite variations in their appearance, is largely solved through the feedforward processing of visual information. Deep neural networks are shown to achieve human-level performance in these tasks, and explain the primate brain representation. On the other hand, object recognition under more challenging conditions (i.e. beyond the core recognition problem) is less characterized. One such example is object recognition under occlusion. It is unclear to what extent feedforward and recurrent processes contribute to object recognition under occlusion. Furthermore, we do not know whether the conventional deep neural networks that were shown to be successful in solving core object recognition, can perform similarly well in problems that go beyond the core recognition. Here, we characterize neural dynamics of object recognition under occlusion, using magnetoencephalography (MEG), while human subjects were presented with images of objects with various levels of occlusion. We provide evidence from multivariate analysis of MEG data, behavioral data, and computational modeling, demonstrating an essential role for recurrent processes in object recognition under occlusion. Furthermore, the computational model with local recurrent connections, used here, suggests a mechanistic explanation of how the human brain might be solving this problem.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300350v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>During in vivo functional imaging, animals are head-fixed and thus deprived from vestibular inputs, which severely hampers the design of naturalistic virtual environments. To overcome this limitation, we developed a miniaturized ultra-stable light-sheet microscope that can be dynamically rotated during imaging along with a head-restrained zebrafish larva. We demonstrate that this system enables whole-brain functional imaging at single-cell resolution under controlled vestibular stimulation. We recorded for the first time the dynamic whole-brain response of a vertebrate to physiological vestibular stimulation. This development largely expands the potential of virtual-reality systems to explore complex multisensory-motor integration in 3D.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/299933v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The significance of shape and surface information for face perception is well established, yet their relative contribution to recognition and their neural underpinnings await clarification. Here, we employ image reconstruction to retrieve, assess and visualize such information using behavioral, electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our results indicate that both shape and surface information can be successfully recovered from each modality but that the latter is better recovered than the former, consistent with its key role for face representations. Further, shape and surface information exhibit similar spatiotemporal profiles, rely on the extraction of specific visual features, such as eye shape or skin tone, and reveal a systematic representational structure, albeit with more cross-modal consistency for shape than surface. Thus, the present results help elucidate the representational basis of individual face recognition while, methodologically, they showcase the utility of image reconstruction and clarify its reliance on diagnostic visual information.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A modelling approach for exploring muscle dynamics during cyclic contractions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006123</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Stephanie A. Ross, Nilima Nigam, James M. Wakeling&lt;/p&gt;

Hill-type muscle models are widely used within the field of biomechanics to predict and understand muscle behaviour, and are often essential where muscle forces cannot be directly measured. However, these models have limited accuracy, particularly during cyclic contractions at the submaximal levels of activation that typically occur during locomotion. To address this issue, recent studies have incorporated effects into Hill-type models that are oftentimes neglected, such as size-dependent, history-dependent, and activation-dependent effects. However, the contribution of these effects on muscle performance has yet to be evaluated under common contractile conditions that reflect the range of activations, strains, and strain rates that occur &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The purpose of this study was to develop a modelling framework to evaluate modifications to Hill-type muscle models when they contract in cyclic loops that are typical of locomotor muscle function. Here we present a modelling framework composed of a damped harmonic oscillator in series with a Hill-type muscle actuator that consists of a contractile element and parallel elastic element. The intrinsic force-length and force-velocity properties are described using Bezier curves where we present a system to relate physiological parameters to the control points for these curves. The muscle-oscillator system can be geometrically scaled while preserving dynamic and kinematic similarity to investigate the muscle size effects while controlling for the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. The model is driven by time-varying muscle activations that cause the muscle to cyclically contract and drive the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. Thus, this framework provides a platform to test current and future Hill-type model formulations and explore factors affecting muscle performance in muscles of different sizes under a range of cyclic contractile conditions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wFWSqfInABw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The C-terminus domain of non-structural 3 (NS3) protein of the &lt;i&gt;Flaviviridae&lt;/i&gt; viruses (e.g. HCV, dengue, West Nile, Zika) is a nucleotide triphosphatase (NTPase) -dependent superfamily 2 (SF2) helicase that unwinds double-stranded RNA while translocating along the nucleic polymer. Due to these functions, NS3 is an important target for antiviral development yet the biophysics of this enzyme are poorly understood. Microsecond-long molecular dynamic simulations of the dengue NS3 helicase domain are reported from which allosteric effects of RNA and NTPase substrates are observed. The presence of a bound single-stranded RNA catalytically enhances the phosphate hydrolysis reaction by affecting the dynamics and positioning of waters within the hydrolysis active site. Coupled with results from the simulations, electronic structure calculations of the reaction are used to quantify this enhancement to be a 150-fold increase, in qualitative agreement with the experimental enhancement factor of 10–100. Additionally, protein-RNA interactions exhibit NTPase substrate-induced allostery, where the presence of a nucleotide (e.g. ATP or ADP) structurally perturbs residues in direct contact with the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA. Residue-residue network analyses highlight pathways of short ranged interactions that connect the two active sites. These analyses identify motif V as a highly connected region of protein structure through which energy released from either active site is hypothesized to move, thereby inducing the observed allosteric effects. These results lay the foundation for the design of novel allosteric inhibitors of NS3.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Tae9aMgOb9I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The origin of the machinery that realizes protein biosynthesis in all organisms is still unclear. One key component of this machinery are aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS), which ligate tRNAs to amino acids while consuming ATP. Sequence analyses revealed that these enzymes can be divided into two complementary classes. Both classes differ significantly on a sequence and structural level, feature different reaction mechanisms, and occur in diverse oligomerization states. The one unifying aspect of both classes is their function of binding ATP. We identified Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers as most compact ATP binding motifs characteristic for each Class. Geometric analysis shows a structural rearrangement of the Backbone Brackets upon ATP binding, indicating a general mechanism of all Class I structures. Regarding the origin of aaRS, the Rodin-Ohno hypothesis states that the peculiar nature of the two aaRS classes is the result of their primordial forms, called Protozymes, being encoded on opposite strands of the same gene. Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers were traced back to the proposed Protozymes and their more efficient successors, the Urzymes. Both structural motifs can be observed as pairs of residues in contemporary structures and it seems that the time of their addition, indicated by their placement in the ancient aaRS, coincides with the evolutionary trace of Proto- and Urzymes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZqNwxiUByA0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Pooled DNA from multiple unknown organisms arises in a variety of contexts, for example microbial samples from ecological or human health research. Determining the composition of pooled samples can be difficult, especially at the scale of modern sequencing data and reference databases. Here we propose a novel method for taxonomic profiling in pooled DNA that combines the speed and low-memory requirements of k-mer based pseudoalignment with a likelihood framework that uses base quality information to better resolve multiply mapped reads. We apply the method to the problem of classifying 16S rRNA reads using a reference database of known organisms, a common challenge in microbiome research. Using simulations, we show the method is accurate across a variety of read lengths, with different length reference sequences, at different sample depths, and when samples contain reads originating from organisms absent from the reference. We also assess performance in real 16S data, where we reanalyze previous genetic association data to show our method discovers a larger number of quantitative trait associations than other widely used methods. We implement our method in the software Karp, for k-mer based analysis of read pools, to provide a novel combination of speed and accuracy that is uniquely suited for enhancing discoveries in microbial studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/T3dI4mAo5X0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Biofilms are microbial collectives that occupy a diverse array of surfaces. It is well known that the function and evolution of biofilms are strongly influenced by the spatial arrangement of different strains and species within them, but how spatiotemporal distributions of different genotypes in biofilm populations originate is still underexplored. Here, we study the origins of biofilm genetic structure by combining model development, numerical simulations, and microfluidic experiments using the human pathogen &lt;i&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/i&gt;. Using spatial correlation functions to quantify the differences between emergent cell lineage segregation patterns, we find that strong adhesion often, but not always, maximizes the size of clonal cell clusters on flat surfaces. Counterintuitively, our model predicts that, under some conditions, investing in adhesion can reduce rather than increase clonal group size. Our results emphasize that a complex interaction between fluid flow and cell adhesiveness can underlie emergent patterns of biofilm genetic structure. This structure, in turn, has an outsize influence on how biofilm-dwelling populations function and evolve.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-LcIezdmCHM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In this work, we assess a previously advanced hypothesis that predicts the existence of ion channels in the capsid of small and non-enveloped icosahedral viruses. With this purpose we examine &lt;i&gt;Triatoma Virus&lt;/i&gt; (TrV) as a case study. This virus has a stable capsid under highly acidic conditions but disassembles and releases the genome in alkaline environments. Our calculations range from a subtle sub-atomic proton interchange to the dismantling of a large-scale system representing several million of atoms. Our results provide structure-based explanations for the three roles played by the capsid to enable genome release. First, we observe, for the first time, the formation of a hydrophobic gate in the cavity along the five-fold axis of the wild-type virus capsid, which can be disrupted by an ion located in the pore. Second, the channel enables protons to permeate the capsid through a unidirectional Grotthuss-like mechanism, which is the most likely process through which the capsid senses pH. Finally, assuming that the proton leak promotes a charge imbalance in the interior of the capsid, we model an internal pressure that forces shell cracking using coarse-grained simulations. Although qualitatively, this last step could represent the mechanism of capsid opening that allows RNA release. All of our calculations are in agreement with current experimental data obtained using TrV and describe a cascade of events that could explain the destabilization and disassembly of similar icosahedral viruses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HAp1mwq20rY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Whole-body iron transport and metabolism: Mechanistic, multi-scale model to improve treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Joydeep Sarkar, Alka A. Potdar, Gerald M. Saidel&lt;/p&gt;

Iron plays vital roles in the human body including enzymatic processes, oxygen-transport via hemoglobin and immune response. Iron metabolism is characterized by ~95% recycling and minor replenishment through diet. Anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by a lack of synthesis of erythropoietin leading to reduced red blood cell (RBC) formation and aberrant iron recycling. Treatment of CKD anemia aims to normalize RBC count and serum hemoglobin. Clinically, the various fluxes of iron transport and accumulation are not measured so that changes during disease (e.g., CKD) and treatment are unknown. Unwanted iron accumulation in patients is known to lead to adverse effects. Current whole-body models lack the mechanistic details of iron transport related to RBC maturation, transferrin (Tf and TfR) dynamics and assume passive iron efflux from macrophages. Hence, they are not predictive of whole-body iron dynamics and cannot be used to design individualized patient treatment. For prediction, we developed a mechanistic, multi-scale computational model of whole-body iron metabolism incorporating four compartments containing major pools of iron and RBC generation process. The model accounts for multiple forms of iron &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, mechanisms involved in iron uptake and release and their regulation. Furthermore, the model is interfaced with drug pharmacokinetics to allow simulation of treatment dynamics. We calibrated our model with experimental and clinical data from peer-reviewed literature to reliably simulate CKD anemia and the effects of current treatment involving combination of epoietin-alpha and iron dextran. This &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; whole-body model of iron metabolism predicts that a year of treatment can potentially lead to 90% downregulation of ferroportin (FPN) levels, 15-fold increase in iron stores with only a 20% increase in iron flux from the reticulo-endothelial system (RES). Model simulations quantified unmeasured iron fluxes, previously unknown effects of treatment on FPN-level and iron stores in the RES. This mechanistic whole-body model can be the basis for future studies that incorporate iron metabolism together with related clinical experiments. Such an approach could pave the way for development of effective personalized treatment of CKD anemia.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mfiym6I-5Rs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A computational study of astrocytic glutamate influence on post-synaptic neuronal excitability</title>

The ability of astrocytes to rapidly clear synaptic glutamate and purposefully release the excitatory transmitter is critical in the functioning of synapses and neuronal circuits. Dysfunctions of these homeostatic functions have been implicated in the pathology of brain disorders such as mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. However, the reasons for these dysfunctions are not clear from experimental data and computational models have been developed to provide further understanding of the implications of glutamate clearance from the extracellular space, as a result of EAAT2 downregulation: although they only partially account for the glutamate clearance process. In this work, we develop an explicit model of the astrocytic glutamate transporters, providing a more complete description of the glutamate chemical potential across the astrocytic membrane and its contribution to glutamate transporter driving force based on thermodynamic principles and experimental data. Analysis of our model demonstrates that increased astrocytic glutamate content due to glutamine synthetase downregulation also results in increased postsynaptic quantal size due to gliotransmission. Moreover, the proposed model demonstrates that increased astrocytic glutamate could prolong the time course of glutamate in the synaptic cleft and enhances astrocyte-induced slow inward currents, causing a disruption to the clarity of synaptic signalling and the occurrence of intervals of higher frequency postsynaptic firing.

To communicate effectively animals need to detect temporal vocalization cues that vary over several orders of magnitude in their amplitude and frequency content. This large range of temporal cues is evident in the power-law scale-invariant relationship between the power of temporal fluctuations in sounds and the sound modulation frequency (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;). Though various forms of scale invariance have been described for natural sounds, the origins and implications of scale invariant phenomenon remain unknown. Using animal vocalization sequences, including continuous human speech, and a stochastic model of temporal amplitude fluctuations we demonstrate that temporal acoustic edges are the primary acoustic cue accounting for the scale invariant phenomenon. The modulation spectrum of vocalization sequences and the model both exhibit a dual regime lowpass structure with a flat region at low modulation frequencies and scale invariant 1/&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; trend for high modulation frequencies. Moreover, we find a time-frequency tradeoff between the average vocalization duration of each vocalization sequence and the cutoff frequency beyond which scale invariant behavior is observed. These results indicate that temporal edges are universal features responsible for scale invariance in vocalized sounds. This is significant since temporal acoustic edges are salient perceptually and the auditory system could exploit such statistical regularities to minimize redundancies and generate compact neural representations of vocalized sounds.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bhrtKDTjYVA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Exposure to stress increases the risk of developing affective disorders such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, these disorders occur in only a subset of individuals, those that are more vulnerable to the effects of stress, whereas others remain resilient. The coping style adopted to deal with the stressor, either passive or active coping, is related to vulnerability or resilience, respectively. Important neural substrates that mediate responses to a stressor are the orexins. These neuropeptides are altered in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with stress-related illnesses such as depression and PTSD. The present experiments used a rodent social defeat model that generates actively coping rats and passively coping rats, which we have previously shown exhibit resilient and vulnerable profiles, respectively, to examine if orexins play a role in these stress-induced phenotypes. &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt; radiolabeling and qPCR revealed that actively coping rats expressed significantly lower prepro-orexin mRNA compared with passively coping rats. This led to the hypothesis that lower levels of orexins contribute to resilience to repeated social stress. To test this hypothesis, rats first underwent 5 d of social defeat to establish active and passive coping phenotypes. Then, orexin neurons were inhibited before each social defeat for three additional days using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). Inhibition of orexins increased social interaction behavior and decreased depressive-like behavior in the vulnerable population of rats. Indeed, these data suggest that lowering orexins promoted resilience to social defeat and may be an important target for treatment of stress-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Cortical Measures of Phoneme-Level Speech Encoding Correlate with the Perceived Clarity of Natural Speech</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In real-world environments, humans comprehend speech by actively integrating prior knowledge (P) and expectations with sensory input. Recent studies have revealed effects of prior information in temporal and frontal cortical areas and have suggested that these effects are underpinned by enhanced encoding of speech-specific features, rather than a broad enhancement or suppression of cortical activity. However, in terms of the specific hierarchical stages of processing involved in speech comprehension, the effects of integrating bottom-up sensory responses and top-down predictions are still unclear. In addition, it is unclear whether the predictability that comes with prior information may differentially affect speech encoding relative to the perceptual enhancement that comes with that prediction. One way to investigate these issues is through examining the impact of P on indices of cortical tracking of continuous speech features. Here, we did this by presenting participants with degraded speech sentences that either were or were not preceded by a clear recording of the same sentences while recording non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG). We assessed the impact of prior information on an isolated index of cortical tracking that reflected phoneme-level processing. Our findings suggest the possibility that prior information affects the early encoding of natural speech in a dual manner. Firstly, the availability of prior information, as hypothesized, enhanced the perceived clarity of degraded speech, which was positively correlated with changes in phoneme-level encoding across subjects. In addition, P induced an overall reduction of this cortical measure, which we interpret as resulting from the increase in predictability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Post-Stroke Intranasal (+)-Naloxone Delivery Reduces Microglial Activation and Improves Behavioral Recovery from Ischemic Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0395-17.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of disability, and effective therapeutic strategies are needed to promote incomplete recovery. Neuroinflammation plays a significant role in stroke pathophysiology, and there is limited understanding how it affects recovery. The aim of the study was to characterize the spatiotemporal expression profile of microglial activation and to study whether dampening microglial/macrophage activation post-stroke facilitates the recovery. For dampening microglial/macrophage activation we chose intranasal administration of naloxone, a drug that is already in clinical use for opioid overdose and is known to decrease microglia/macrophage activation. We characterized the temporal progression of microglia/macrophage activation following cortical ischemic injury in rat and found the peak activation in cortex 7 days post-stroke. Unexpectedly, there was a chronic expression of phagocytic cells in the thalamus associated with neuronal loss. (+)-Naloxone, an enantiomer that reduces microglial activation without antagonizing opioid receptors, was administered intranasally starting 1 day post-stroke and continuing for 7 days. (+)-Naloxone treatment decreased microglia/macrophage activation in the striatum and thalamus, promoted behavioral recovery during the 14-day monitoring period, and reduced neuronal death in the lesioned cortex and ipsilateral thalamus. Our results are the first to show that post-stroke intranasal (+)-naloxone administration promotes short-term functional recovery and reduces microglia/macrophage activation. Therefore, (+)-naloxone is a promising drug for the treatment of ischemic stroke and further studies should be conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of adult disability and new drug treatments are needed as there is no drug that would promote the recovery. Neuroinflammation is suggested to play a role in the recovery process. Naloxone is a drug used clinically to treat opioid overdose. Its opioid receptor inactive form, (+)-naloxone, is known to reduce the activation of microglia, the immune cells of the brain. We show for the first time that repeated dosing of intranasal (+)-naloxone starting one day after stroke promotes short-term recovery in rats, reduces microglial activation and neuronal loss in the stroke brain. Our finding could be important for future stroke treatment and encourages further testing of (+)-naloxone in stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: The Midline Axon Crossing Decision Is Regulated through an Activity-Dependent Mechanism by the NMDA Receptor</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0389-17.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Axon guidance in vertebrates is controlled by genetic cascades as well as by intrinsic activity-dependent refinement of connections. Midline axon crossing is one of the best studied pathfinding models and is fundamental to the establishment of bilaterally symmetric nervous systems. However, it is not known whether crossing requires intrinsic activity in axons, and what controls that activity. Further, a mechanism linking neuronal activity and gene expression has not been identified for axon pathfinding. Using embryonic zebrafish, we found that the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) NR1.1 subunit (&lt;i&gt;grin1a&lt;/i&gt;) is expressed in commissural axons. Pharmacological inhibition of &lt;i&gt;grin1a&lt;/i&gt;, hypoxia exposure reduction of &lt;i&gt;grin1a&lt;/i&gt; expression, or CRISPR knockdown of &lt;i&gt;grin1a&lt;/i&gt;, leads to defects in midline crossing. Inhibition of neuronal activity phenocopies the effects of &lt;i&gt;grin1a&lt;/i&gt; loss on midline crossing. By combining pharmacological inhibition of the NMDAR with optogenetic stimulation to precisely restore neuronal activity, we observed rescue of midline crossing. This suggests that the NMDAR controls pathfinding by an activity-dependent mechanism. We further show that the NMDAR may act, via modulating activity, on the transcription factor &lt;i&gt;arxa&lt;/i&gt; (mammalian &lt;i&gt;Arx&lt;/i&gt;), a known regulator of midline pathfinding. These findings uncover a novel role for the NMDAR in controlling activity to regulate commissural pathfinding, and identify &lt;i&gt;arxa&lt;/i&gt; as a key link between the genetic and activity-dependent regulation of midline axon guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; While intrinsic neuronal activity is involved in refinement of axon connections, its role in pathfinding decisions is poorly understood. We found that midline axon crossing is regulated by the NMDA receptor (NMDAR). The NMDAR is expressed on axons that cross the midline, and inhibition or knockdown of the NDMDAR led to fewer axons crossing. Precise optogenetic stimulation of neurons rescued the effects of NMDAR blockade, demonstrating that the NMDAR acts by an activity-dependent mechanism. In turn, the NMDAR affects expression of &lt;i&gt;arxa&lt;/i&gt;, an important gene for brain development and that is associated with several human neurologic diseases. These results show a critical role for the NMDAR in early axon guidance decisions by control of neuronal activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Retinal degenerations are a major cause of vision impairment and blindness. Neuroprotective therapy is a promising therapeutic strategy for retinal degenerative diseases. We investigated a novel neurotrophic factor MANF (mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor) in the retina. MANF is expressed at a high level during postnatal development and the expression declines to a lower level as the retina matures. Müller cells are the major cells expressing MANF. The expression is also found in the retinal ganglion cells, in the inner nuclear layer neurons, and in retinal pigment epithelial cells. Intravitreal injection of recombinant human MANF significantly protected rod and cone photoreceptors in rats carrying the rhodopsin S334ter mutation, and preserved ERGs (electroretinograms) in the &lt;i&gt;rd10&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Pde6b&lt;sup&gt;rd10/rd10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) mice. These results indicate that MANF is a native protein in the retina and is a potent neurotrophic factor for photoreceptor protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; This is a study of high translational value to examine the neuroprotective potential of a novel neurotrophic factor MANF in the retina. MANF is expressed in the retina at high level during postnatal development and then declines as the retina matures. Recombinant MANF protects rod and cone photoreceptor cells, and preserves ERGs. These results suggest a role of MANF in the retinal development, and provide preclinical evidence for further development of MANF as a neuroprotective agent as a potential treatment for retinal degenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Beneficial Outcome of Urethane Treatment following Status Epilepticus in a Rat Organophosphorus Toxicity Model</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of benzodiazepines to terminate electrographic status epilepticus (SE) declines the longer a patient is in SE. Therefore, alternative methods for ensuring complete block of SE and refractory SE are necessary. We compared the ability of diazepam and a subanesthetic dose of urethane to terminate prolonged SE and mitigate subsequent pathologies. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) to induce SE. Rats were administered diazepam (10 mg/kg, ip) or urethane (0.8 g/kg, sc) one hour after DFP-induced SE and compared to rats that experienced uninterrupted SE. Large amplitude and high frequency spikes induced by DFP administration were quenched for at least 46 hr in rats administered urethane one hour after SE onset as demonstrated by cortical electroencephalography (EEG). By contrast, diazepam interrupted SE but seizures with high power in the 20-70Hz band returned 6-10 hr later. Urethane was more effective than diazepam at reducing hippocampal neurodegeneration, brain inflammation, gliosis and weight loss as measured on day 4 after SE. Furthermore, rats administered urethane displayed a 73% reduction in the incidence of spontaneous recurrent seizures after 4-8 weeks and a 90% reduction in frequency of seizures in epileptic rats. By contrast, behavioral changes in the light-dark box, open field and a novel object recognition task were not improved by urethane. These findings indicate that in typical rodent SE models it is the return of SE overnight, and not the initially intense 1-2 hr SE experience, that is largely responsible for neurodegeneration, accompanying inflammation, and the subsequent development of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance&lt;/b&gt; Delayed medical care to patients exposed to high levels of an organophosphorus (OP) agent can lead to the development of seizures and/or status epilepticus, which if left untreated results in neuropathologies and the inevitable development of epilepsy in surviving rats. Administration of the general anesthetic, urethane following DFP induced status epilepticus produced a number of beneficial consequences. Urethane effectively terminated electrographic status epilepticus, reduced neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and astrogliosis, accelerated weight regain within 4 days after DFP exposure, and reduced the incidence and frequency of spontaneous recurrent seizures. This study gives insight into therapeutic modalities for the treatment of status epilepticus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

negative. Experimental observations suggest that the response of neurons to
oscillatory inputs in different frequencies may enhance excitation or
inhibition. Here we show that this asymmetric voltage response can arise by
submitting a neuron model to ZAP functions of high amplitude. We propose a
method to characterize resonance in both depolarized and hyperpolarized states,
which depending on a combination of parameters may differ in frequency and
amplitude, and discuss on the implications of such observation. Our work offers
a simple yet biophysically grounded framework to characterize resonance
properties and to provide further advancement on the understanding of the
modulation of an input by a neuron.

	<description>The spectral properties of the ambient illumination provide useful information about time of day and weather. We study the perceptual representation of illumination by analyzing measurements of how well people discriminate between illuminations across scene configurations. More specifically, we compare human performance to a computational-observer analysis that evaluates the information available in the isomerizations of the cones in a model human photoreceptor mosaic. Some patterns of human performance are predicted by the computational observer, other aspects are not. The analysis clarifies which aspects of performance require additional explanation in terms of the action of visual mechanisms beyond the isomerization of light by the cones.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Pupil responses as indicators of value-based decision-making</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302166v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302166v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Pupil responses have been used to track cognitive processes during decision-making. Studies have shown that in these cases the pupil reflects the joint activation of many cortical and subcortical brain regions, also those traditionally implicated in value-based learning. However, how the pupil tracks value-based decisions and reinforcement learning is unknown. We combined a reinforcement learning task with a computational model to study pupil responses during value-based decisions, and decision evaluations. We found that the pupil closely tracks reinforcement learning both across trials and participants. Prior to choice, the pupil dilated as a function of trial-by-trial fluctuations in value beliefs. After feedback, early dilation scaled with value uncertainty, whereas later constriction scaled with reward prediction errors. Our computational approach systematically implicates the pupil in value-based decisions, and the subsequent processing of violated value beliefs. These dissociable influences provide an exciting possibility to non-invasively study ongoing reinforcement learning in the pupil.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Timing Determines Tuning: a Rapid Spatiotemporal Transformation in Superior Colliculus Neurons During Reactive Gaze Shifts.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302125v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302125v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Gaze saccades (rapid shifts of the eyes and head toward a goal) have provided fundamental insights into the neural control of movement. For example, it has been shown that the superior colliculus (SC) transforms a visual target (T) code to future gaze (G) location commands after a memory delay. However, this transformation has not been observed in reactive saccades made directly to a stimulus, so its contribution to normal gaze behavior is unclear. Here, we tested this using a quantitative measure of the spatial continuum between T and G coding based on variable gaze errors. We demonstrate that a rapid T G transformation occurs between SC visual and motor responses during reactive saccades, even within visuomotor cells, with a continuous spatiotemporal shift in coding occurring in cell types (visual, visuomotor, motor). We further show that the primary determinant of this spatial code was not the intrinsic visual-motor index of different cells or populations, but rather the timing of the response in all cells. These results suggest that the SC provides a rapid spatiotemporal transformation for normal gaze saccades, that its motor responses contribute to variable gaze errors, and that those errors arise from a noisy spatiotemporal transformation involving all SC neurons.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302000v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Neural oscillations are widely studied using methods based on the Fourier transform, which models data as sums of sinusoids. For decades these Fourier-based approaches have successfully uncovered links between oscillations and cognition or disease. However, because of the fundamental sinusoidal basis, these methods might not fully capture neural oscillatory dynamics, because neural data are both nonsinusoidal and non-stationary. Here, we present a new analysis framework, complementary to Fourier analysis, that quantifies cycle-by-cycle time-domain features. For each cycle, the amplitude, period, and waveform symmetry are measured, the latter of which is missed using conventional approaches. Additionally, oscillatory bursts are algorithmically identified, allowing us to investigate the variability of oscillatory features within and between bursts. This approach is validated on simulated noisy signals with oscillatory bursts and outperforms conventional metrics. Further, these methods are applied to real data, including hippocampal theta, motor cortical beta, and visual cortical alpha, and can differentiate behavioral conditions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Inferior parietal lobule and early visual areas support elicitation of individualized meanings during narrative listening</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301812v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301812v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>When listening to a narrative, the verbal expressions translate into meanings and flow of mental imagery, at best vividly immersing the keen listener into the sights, sounds, scents, objects, actions, and events in the story. However, the same narrative can be heard quite differently based on differences in listeners' previous experiences and knowledge, as the semantics and mental imagery elicited by words and phrases in the story vary extensively between any given two individuals. Here, we capitalized on such inter-individual differences to disclose brain regions that support transformation of narrative into individualized propositional meanings and associated mental imagery by analyzing brain activity associated with behaviorally-assessed individual meanings elicited by a narrative. Sixteen subjects listed words best describing what had come to their minds during each 3-5 sec segment of an eight-minute narrative that they listened during fMRI of brain hemodynamic activity. Similarities in these word listings between subjects, estimated using latent-semantic analysis combined with WordNet knowledge, predicted similarities in brain hemodynamic activity in supramarginal and angular gyri as well as in cuneus. Our results demonstrate how inter-individual differences in semantic representations can be measured and utilized to identify specific brain regions that support the elicitation of individual propositional meanings and the associated mental imagery when one listens to a narrative.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301739v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The process of aging can be characterised by a decline in cognitive performance, which may be accompanied by deterioration of brain structure as well. In this study we sought to investigate to what extent mindfulness changes over the aging process, and which alterations in brain structure can be associated to aging and concomitant changes in mindfulness. We collected Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) questionnaire data to assess mindfulness and we acquired DTI images in a group of middle-aged to elderly participants. Our results suggested that with age, mindfulness as assessed with the MAAS, increases. In terms of white-matter structure, we replicated previous findings that overall fractional anisotropy (FA) decreases with age. In an explorative analysis, we found that mindfulness predicted FA in a localized area consisting of internal and external capsule, as well as the corona radiata. We speculated that mindfulness might deter age-associated neurocognitive decline, perhaps by preventing age-associated microlesions specifically in cortico-subcortical white matter tracts. This possibility invites future interventions or longitudinal studies to confirm this hypothesis.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Evidence for a reversal of the neural information flow between object perception and object reconstruction from memory</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300913v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Remembering is a reconstructive process. Surprisingly little is known about how the reconstruction of a memory unfolds in time in the human brain. We used reaction times and EEG time-series decoding to test the hypothesis that the information flow is reversed when an event is reconstructed from memory, compared to when the same event is initially being perceived. Across three experiments, we found highly consistent evidence supporting such a reversed stream. When seeing an object, low-level perceptual features were discriminated faster behaviourally, and could be decoded from brain activity earlier, than high-level conceptual features. This pattern reversed during associative memory recall, with reaction times and brain activity patterns now indicating that conceptual information was reconstructed more rapidly than perceptual details. Our findings support a neurobiologically plausible model of human memory, suggesting that memory retrieval is a hierarchical, multi-layered process that prioritizes semantically meaningful information over perceptual detail.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Electrophysiological characterization and MCH/orexin neuronal distribution in the lateral hypothalamus of naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/299818v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/299818v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The lateral hypothalamus (LH) controls various homeostatic processes, including sleep-wake cycles, energy balance and thermoregulation in many mammalian species. In the LH, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and hypocretin/orexin (HO) containing neurons differentially regulate these processes. Naked mole-rats (NMR) (Heterocephalus glaber) are eusocial mammals with remarkable physiological peculiarities including extreme longevity without significant weight gain and absence of thermoregulation. Altered hypothalamic function could potentially underlie the unusual NMR phenotypes, but to date electrophysiological characterization of LH NMR neurons and expression of MCH and HO is missing. Here, we performed whole-cell recordings from LH neurons in acute NMR and mouse brain slices and found that NMR and mouse neuronal basic properties and activities were comparable. Additionally, we showed that both MCH-positive and HO-positive neuronal populations exist in the NMR hypothalamus and although the majority of MCH- and HO-positive neurons are located in the LH, as previously described in rodents, significant differences exist in MCH/HO distribution in other NMR hypothalamic areas. These results indicate that NMR LH neurons are comparable to mouse neurons with respect to their electrophysiological properties, but differences in the neuronal MCH and HO populations in hypothalamic regions exist and may contribute to the adaptive changes seen in NMR homeostatic processes.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Spotting the path that leads nowhere: Modulation of human theta and alpha oscillations induced by trajectory changes during navigation</title>

	<description>The capacity to take efficient detours and exploit novel shortcuts during navigation is thought to be supported by a cognitive map of the environment. Despite advances in understanding the neural basis of the cognitive map, little is known about the neural dynamics associated with detours and shortcuts. Here, we recorded magnetoencephalography from humans as they navigated a virtual desert island riven by shifting lava flows. The task probed their ability to take efficient detours and shortcuts to remembered goals. We report modulation in event-related fields and theta power as participants identified real shortcuts and differentiated these from false shortcuts that led along suboptimal paths. Additionally, we found that a decrease in alpha power preceded 'back-tracking' where participants spontaneously turned back along a previous path. These findings help advance our understanding of the fine-grained temporal dynamics of human brain activity during navigation and support the development of models of brain networks that support navigation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Measuring single neuron visual receptive field sizes by fMRI</title>

	<description>The non-invasive measurements of neuronal receptive field (RF) properties in-vivo allow a detailed understanding of brain organization as well as its plasticity by longitudinal following of potential changes. Visual RFs measured invasively by electrophysiology in animal models have traditionally provided a great extent of our current knowledge about the visual brain and its disorders. Voxel based estimates of population RF (pRF) by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans revolutionized the field and have been used extensively in numerous studies. However, current methods cannot estimate single-neuron RF sizes as they reflect large populations of neurons with individual RF scatter. Here, we introduce a new approach to estimate RF size using spatial frequency selectivity to checkerboard patterns. This method allowed us to obtain non-invasive, single-unit, RF estimates in human V1 for the first time. These estimates were significantly smaller compared to prior pRF methods. Further, fMRI and electrophysiological experiments in non-human primates demonstrated an exceptional match validating the approach.</description>

Sample-induced image-degradation remains an intricate wave-optical problem in light-sheet microscopy. Here we present &lt;i&gt;biobeam&lt;/i&gt;, an open-source software package that enables simulation of operational light-sheet microscopes by combining data from 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; multiplexed and GPU-accelerated point-spread-function calculations. The wave-optical nature of these simulations leads to the faithful reproduction of spatially varying aberrations, diffraction artifacts, geometric image distortions, adaptive optics, and emergent wave-optical phenomena, and renders image-formation in light-sheet microscopy computationally tractable.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/r2Zl1-90KGY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Synaptic activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; can potentially alter the integration properties of neurons. Using recordings in awake mice, we targeted somatosensory layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons and compared neuronal properties with those from slices. Pyramidal cells &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; had lower resistance and gain values, as well as broader spikes and increased spike frequency adaptation compared to the same cells in slices. Increasing conductance in neurons using dynamic clamp to levels observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, however, did not lessen the differences between &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and slice conditions. Further, local application of tetrodotoxin (TTX) &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; blocked synaptic-mediated membrane voltage fluctuations but had little impact on pyramidal cell membrane input resistance and time constant values. Differences in electrophysiological properties of layer 2/3 neurons in mouse somatosensory cortex, therefore, stem from intrinsic sources separate from synaptic-mediated membrane voltage fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) Activation Suppresses TRPV1 Sensitization in Mouse, But Not Human, Sensory Neurons</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The use of human tissue to validate putative analgesic targets identified in rodents is a promising strategy for improving the historically poor translational record of preclinical pain research. We recently demonstrated that in mouse and human sensory neurons, agonists for metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3) reduce membrane hyperexcitability produced by the inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Previous rodent studies indicate that mGluR2/3 can also reduce peripheral sensitization by suppressing inflammation-induced sensitization of TRPV1. Whether this observation similarly translates to human sensory neurons has not yet been tested. We found that activation of mGluR2/3 with the agonist APDC suppressed PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced sensitization of TRPV1 in mouse, but not human, sensory neurons. We also evaluated sensory neuron expression of the gene transcripts for mGluR2 (&lt;i&gt;Grm2&lt;/i&gt;), mGluR3 (&lt;i&gt;Grm3&lt;/i&gt;), and TRPV1 (&lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt;). The majority of &lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mouse and human sensory neurons expressed &lt;i&gt;Grm2&lt;/i&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;Grm3&lt;/i&gt;, and in both mice and humans, &lt;i&gt;Grm2&lt;/i&gt; was expressed in a greater percentage of sensory neurons than &lt;i&gt;Grm3&lt;/i&gt;. Although we demonstrated a functional difference in the modulation of TRPV1 sensitization by mGluR2/3 activation between mouse and human, there were no species differences in the gene transcript colocalization of mGluR2 or mGluR3 with TRPV1 that might explain this functional difference. Taken together with our previous work, these results suggest that mGluR2/3 activation suppresses only some aspects of human sensory neuron sensitization caused by PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These differences have implications for potential healthy human voluntary studies or clinical trials evaluating the analgesic efficacy of mGluR2/3 agonists or positive allosteric modulators.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Combined Blockade of Interleukin-1{alpha} and -1{beta} Signaling Protects Mice from Cognitive Dysfunction after Traumatic Brain Injury</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Diffuse activation of interleukin-1 inflammatory cytokine signaling after traumatic brain injury (TBI) elicits progressive neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric dysfunction, and thus represents a potential opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Although interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-1β both activate the common type 1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI), they manifest distinct injury-specific roles in some models of neurodegeneration. Despite its potential relevance to treating patients with TBI, however, the individual contributions of IL-1α and IL-1β to TBI-pathology have not been previously investigated. To address this need, we applied genetic and pharmacologic approaches in mice to dissect the individual contributions of IL-1α, IL-β, and IL-1RI signaling to the pathophysiology of fluid percussion–mediated TBI, a model of mixed focal and diffuse TBI. IL-1RI ablation conferred a greater protective effect on brain cytokine expression and cognitive function after TBI than did individual IL-1α or IL-1β ablation. This protective effect was recapitulated by treatment with the drug anakinra, a recombinant naturally occurring IL-1RI antagonist. Our data thus suggest that broad targeting of IL-1RI signaling is more likely to reduce neuroinflammation and preserve cognitive function after TBI than are approaches that individually target IL-1α or IL-1β signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Evidence Integration in Natural Acoustic Textures during Active and Passive Listening</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Many natural sounds can be well described on a statistical level, for example, wind, rain, or applause. Even though the spectro-temporal profile of these acoustic textures is highly dynamic, changes in their statistics are indicative of relevant changes in the environment. Here, we investigated the neural representation of change detection in natural textures in humans, and specifically addressed whether active task engagement is required for the neural representation of this change in statistics. Subjects listened to natural textures whose spectro-temporal statistics were modified at variable times by a variable amount. Subjects were instructed to either report the detection of changes (active) or to passively listen to the stimuli. A subset of passive subjects had performed the active task before (passive-aware vs passive-naive). Psychophysically, longer exposure to pre-change statistics was correlated with faster reaction times and better discrimination performance. EEG recordings revealed that the build-up rate and size of parieto-occipital (PO) potentials reflected change size and change time. Reduced effects were observed in the passive conditions. While P2 responses were comparable across conditions, slope and height of PO potentials scaled with task involvement. Neural source localization identified a parietal source as the main contributor of change-specific potentials, in addition to more limited contributions from auditory and frontal sources. In summary, the detection of statistical changes in natural acoustic textures is predominantly reflected in parietal locations both on the skull and source level. The scaling in magnitude across different levels of task involvement suggests a context-dependent degree of evidence integration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Rostrocaudal Areal Patterning of Human PSC-Derived Cortical Neurons by FGF8 Signaling</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The cerebral cortex is subdivided into distinct areas that have particular functions. The rostrocaudal (R-C) gradient of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) signaling defines this areal identity during neural development. In this study, we recapitulated cortical R-C patterning in human pluripotent stem cell (PSC) cultures. Modulation of FGF8 signaling appropriately regulated the R-C markers, and the patterns of global gene expression resembled those of the corresponding areas of human fetal brains. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of this culture system in modeling the area-specific forebrain phenotypes (presumptive upper motor neuron (UMN) phenotypes) of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We anticipate that our culture system will contribute to studies of human neurodevelopment and neurological disease modeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Although the cerebral cortex is organized into functionally unique subdivisions or areas, the areal specification has not been studied extensively in PSC-based neurodevelopmental models. Here, we report a culture system to control the areal identity of PSC-derived cerebral cortical progenitors along the R-C axis by modulating FGF8 signaling. Treatment with FGF8 conferred rostral (the sensorimotor cortex) identity on cerebral cortical progenitors, whereas these progenitors retained caudal (the temporal lobe) identity in the absence of FGF8. By using this culture system, we succeeded in modeling area-specific forebrain phenotypes (presumptive UMN phenotypes) of ALS. This system offers a novel platform in the field of human neurodevelopment and neurologic disease modeling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Discovery and usage of joint attention in images. (arXiv:1804.04604v1 [cs.CV])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Joint visual attention is characterized by two or more individuals looking at
a common target at the same time. The ability to identify joint attention in
scenes, the people involved, and their common target, is fundamental to the
understanding of social interactions, including others' intentions and goals.
In this work we deal with the extraction of joint attention events, and the use
of such events for image descriptions. The work makes two novel contributions.
First, our extraction algorithm is the first which identifies joint visual
attention in single static images. It computes 3D gaze direction, identifies
the gaze target by combining gaze direction with a 3D depth map computed for
the image, and identifies the common gaze target. Second, we use a human study
to demonstrate the sensitivity of humans to joint attention, suggesting that
the detection of such a configuration in an image can be useful for
understanding the image, including the goals of the agents and their joint
activity, and therefore can contribute to image captioning and related tasks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain computer interface is the current area of research to provide
assistance to disabled persons. To cope up with the growing needs of BCI
applications, this paper presents an automated classification scheme for
handgrip actions on objects by using Electroencephalography (EEG) data. The
presented approach focuses on investigation of classifying correct and
incorrect handgrip responses for objects by using EEG recorded patterns. The
method starts with preprocessing of data, followed by extraction of relevant
features from the epoch data in the form of discrete wavelet transform (DWT),
and entropy measures. After computing feature vectors, artificial neural
network classifiers used to classify the patterns into correct and incorrect
handgrips on different objects. The proposed method was tested on real dataset,
which contains EEG recordings from 14 persons. The results showed that the
proposed approach is effective and may be useful to develop a variety of BCI
based devices to control hand movements.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Decision making based on behavioral and neural observations of living systems
has been extensively studied in brain science, psychology, and other
disciplines. Decision-making mechanisms have also been experimentally
implemented in physical processes, such as single photons and chaotic lasers.
The findings of these experiments suggest that there is a certain common basis
in describing decision making, regardless of its physical realizations. In this
study, we propose a local reservoir model to account for choice-based learning
(CBL). CBL describes decision consistency as a phenomenon where making a
certain decision increases the possibility of making that same decision again
later, which has been intensively investigated in neuroscience, psychology,
etc. Our proposed model is inspired by the viewpoint that a decision is
affected by its local environment, which is referred to as a local reservoir.
If the size of the local reservoir is large enough, consecutive decision making
will not be affected by previous decisions, thus showing lower degrees of
decision consistency in CBL. In contrast, if the size of the local reservoir
decreases, a biased distribution occurs within it, which leads to higher
degrees of decision consistency in CBL. In this study, an analytical approach
on local reservoirs is presented, as well as several numerical demonstrations.
Furthermore, a physical architecture for CBL based on single photons is
discussed, and the effects of local reservoirs is numerically demonstrated.
Decision consistency in human decision-making tasks and in recruiting empirical
data are evaluated based on local reservoir. In summary, the proposed local
reservoir model paves a path toward establishing a foundation for computational
mechanisms and the systematic analysis of decision making on different levels.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Association Between Brain Activation and Functional Connectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy077</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy077/4969848?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The origin of the “resting-state” brain activity recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is still uncertain. Here we provide evidence for the neurovascular origins of the amplitude of the low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and the local functional connectivity density (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;FCD) by comparing them with task-induced blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses, which are considered a proxy for neuronal activation. Using fMRI data for 2 different tasks (Relational and Social) collected by the Human Connectome Project in 426 healthy adults, we show that ALFF and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;FCD have linear associations with the BOLD response. This association was significantly attenuated by a novel task signal regression (TSR) procedure, indicating that task performance enhances &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;FCD and ALFF in activated regions. We also show that lFCD predicts BOLD activation patterns, as was recently shown for other functional connectivity metrics, which corroborates that resting functional connectivity architecture impacts brain activation responses. Thus, our findings indicate a common source for BOLD responses, ALFF and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;FCD, which is consistent with the neurovascular origin of local hemodynamic synchrony presumably reflecting coordinated fluctuations in neuronal activity. This study also supports the development of task-evoked functional connectivity density mapping.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: MEG Working Memory N-Back Task Reveals Functional Deficits in Combat-Related Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy075</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Combat-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a leading cause of sustained cognitive impairment in military service members and Veterans. However, the mechanism of persistent cognitive deficits including working memory (WM) dysfunction is not fully understood in mTBI. Few studies of WM deficits in mTBI have taken advantage of the temporal and frequency resolution afforded by electromagnetic measurements. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and an N-back WM task, we investigated functional abnormalities in combat-related mTBI. Study participants included 25 symptomatic active-duty service members or Veterans with combat-related mTBI and 20 healthy controls with similar combat experiences. MEG source–magnitude images were obtained for alpha (8–12 Hz), beta (15–30 Hz), gamma (30–90 Hz), and low-frequency (1–7 Hz) bands. Compared with healthy combat controls, mTBI participants showed increased MEG signals across frequency bands in frontal pole (FP), ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), but decreased MEG signals in anterior cingulate cortex. Hyperactivations in FP, OFC, and anterior dlPFC were associated with slower reaction times. MEG activations in lateral FP also negatively correlated with performance on tests of letter sequencing, verbal fluency, and digit symbol coding. The profound hyperactivations from FP suggest that FP is particularly vulnerable to combat-related mTBI.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Densities and Laminar Distributions of Kv3.1b-, PV-, GABA-, and SMI-32-Immunoreactive Neurons in Macaque Area V1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy072</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy072/4969846?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The Kv3.1b potassium channel subunit is associated with narrow spike widths and fast-spiking properties. In macaque primary visual cortex (V1), subsets of neurons have previously been found to be Kv3.1b-immunoreactive (ir) but not parvalbumin (PV)-ir or not GABA-ir, suggesting that they may be both fast-spiking and excitatory. This population includes Meynert cells, the large layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons that are also labeled by the neurofilament antibody SMI-32. In the present study, triple immunofluorescence labeling and confocal microscopy were used to measure the distribution of Kv3.1b-ir, non-PV-ir, non-GABA-ir neurons across cortical depth in V1, and to determine whether, like the Meynert cells, other Kv3.1b-ir excitatory neurons were also SMI-32-ir pyramidal neurons. We found that Kv3.1b-ir, non-PV-ir, non-GABA-ir neurons were most prevalent in the M pathway-associated layers 4 Cα and 4B. GABAergic neurons accounted for a smaller fraction (11%) of the total neuronal population across layers 1–6 than has previously been reported. Of Kv3.1b-ir neurons, PV expression reliably indicated GABA expression. Kv3.1b-ir, non-PV-ir neurons varied in SMI-32 coimmunoreactivity. The results suggest the existence of a heterogeneous population of excitatory neurons in macaque V1 with the potential for sustained high firing rates, and these neurons were particularly abundant in layers 4B and 4 Cα.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Evidence That Default Network Connectivity During Rest Consolidates Social Information</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Brain regions engaged during social inference, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and tempoparietal junction (TPJ), are also known to spontaneously engage during rest. While this overlap is well known, the social cognitive function of engaging these regions during rest remains unclear. Building on past research suggesting that new information is committed to memory during rest, we explored whether one function of MPFC and TPJ engagement during rest may be to consolidate new social information. MPFC and TPJ regions significantly increased connectivity during rest after encoding new social information (relative to baseline and post nonsocial encoding rest periods). Moreover, greater connectivity between rTPJ and MPFC, as well as other portions of the default network (vMPFC, anterior temporal lobe, and middle temporal gyrus) during post social encoding rest corresponded with superior social recognition and social associative memory. The tendency to engage MPFC and TPJ during rest may tune people towards social learning.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Distinct Interplay Between Atrophy and Hypometabolism in Alzheimer’s Versus Semantic Dementia</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Multimodal neuroimaging analyses offer additional information beyond that provided by each neuroimaging modality. Thus, direct comparisons and correlations between neuroimaging modalities allow revealing disease-specific topographic relationships. Here, we compared the topographic discrepancies between atrophy and hypometabolism in two neurodegenerative diseases characterized by distinct pathological processes, namely Alzheimer’s disease (AD) versus semantic dementia (SD), to unravel their specific influence on local and global brain structure–function relationships. We found that intermodality topographic discrepancies clearly distinguished the two patient groups: AD showed marked discrepancies between both alterations, with greater hypometabolism than atrophy in large posterior associative neocortical regions, while SD showed more topographic consistency between atrophy and hypometabolism across brain regions. These findings likely reflect the multiple pathologies versus the relatively unitary pathological process underlying AD versus SD respectively. Our results evidence that multimodal neuroimaging-derived indexes can provide clinically relevant information to discriminate the two diseases, and potentially reveal distinct neuropathological processes.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Adult-Onset Hearing Impairment Induces Layer-Specific Cortical Reorganization: Evidence of Crossmodal Plasticity and Central Gain Enhancement</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy067</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Adult-onset hearing impairment can lead to hyperactivity in the auditory pathway (i.e., central gain enhancement) as well as increased cortical responsiveness to nonauditory stimuli (i.e., crossmodal plasticity). However, it remained unclear to what extent hearing loss-induced hyperactivity is relayed beyond the auditory cortex, and thus, whether central gain enhancement competes or coexists with crossmodal plasticity throughout the distinct layers of the audiovisual cortex. To that end, we investigated the effects of partial hearing loss on laminar processing in the auditory, visual and audiovisual cortices of adult rats using extracellular electrophysiological recordings performed 2 weeks after loud noise exposure. Current-source density analyses revealed that central gain enhancement was not relayed to the audiovisual cortex (V2L), and was instead restricted to the granular layer of the higher order auditory area, AuD. In contrast, crossmodal plasticity was evident across multiple cortical layers within V2L, and also manifested in AuD. Surprisingly, despite this coexistence of central gain enhancement and crossmodal plasticity, noise exposure did not disrupt the responsiveness of these neighboring cortical regions to combined audiovisual stimuli. Overall, we have shown for the first time that adult-onset hearing impairment causes a complex assortment of intramodal and crossmodal changes across the layers of higher order sensory cortices.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Microglial Pruning of Synapses in the Prefrontal Cortex During Adolescence</title>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy061/4969841?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Exaggerated synaptic elimination in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during adolescence has been suggested to contribute to the neuropathological changes of schizophrenia. Recent data indicate that microglia (MG) sculpt synapses during early postnatal development. However, it is not known if MG contribute to the structural maturation of the PFC, which has a protracted postnatal development. We determined if MG are involved in developmentally specific synapse elimination in the PFC, focusing on adolescence. Layer 5 PFC pyramidal cells (PCs) were intracellularly filled with Lucifer Yellow for dendritic spine measurements in postnatal day (P) 24, P30, P35, P39, and P50 rats. In the contralateral PFC we evaluated if MG engulfed presynaptic (glutamatergic) and postsynaptic (dendritic spines) elements. Dendritic spine density increased from P24 to P35, when spine density peaked. There was a significant increase in MG engulfment of spines at P39 relative to earlier ages; this subsided by P50. MG also phagocytosed presynaptic glutamatergic terminals. These data indicate that MG transiently prune synapses of PFC PCs during adolescence, when the symptoms of schizophrenia typically first appear. An increase in MG-mediated synaptic remodeling of PFC PCs may contribute to the structural changes observed in schizophrenia.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Movement Decomposition in the Primary Motor Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;A complex action can be described as the composition of a set of elementary movements. While both kinematic and dynamic elements have been proposed to compose complex actions, the structure of movement decomposition and its neural representation remain unknown. Here, we examined movement decomposition by modeling the temporal dynamics of neural populations in the primary motor cortex of macaque monkeys performing forelimb reaching movements. Using a hidden Markov model, we found that global transitions in the neural population activity are associated with a consistent segmentation of the behavioral output into acceleration and deceleration epochs with directional selectivity. Single cells exhibited modulation of firing rates between the kinematic epochs, with abrupt changes in spiking activity timed with the identified transitions. These results reveal distinct encoding of acceleration and deceleration phases at the level of M1, and point to a specific pattern of movement decomposition that arises from the underlying neural activity. A similar approach can be used to probe the structure of movement decomposition in different brain regions, possibly controlling different temporal scales, to reveal the hierarchical structure of movement composition.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Truncating &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CHD8&lt;/span&gt; mutations are amongst the highest confidence risk factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) identified to date. Here, we report that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Chd8&lt;/span&gt; heterozygous mice display increased brain size, motor delay, hypertelorism, pronounced hypoactivity, and anomalous responses to social stimuli. Whereas gene expression in the neocortex is only mildly affected at midgestation, over 600 genes are differentially expressed in the early postnatal neocortex. Genes involved in cell adhesion and axon guidance are particularly prominent amongst the downregulated transcripts. Resting-state functional MRI identified increased synchronized activity in cortico-hippocampal and auditory-parietal networks in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Chd8&lt;/span&gt; heterozygous mutant mice, implicating altered connectivity as a potential mechanism underlying the behavioral phenotypes. Together, these data suggest that altered brain growth and diminished expression of important neurodevelopmental genes that regulate long-range brain wiring are followed by distinctive anomalies in functional brain connectivity in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Chd8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;+/&lt;/span&gt;âˆ’&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Human imaging studies have reported altered functional connectivity in ASD patients, with long-range under-connectivity seemingly more frequent. Our data suggest that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CHD8&lt;/span&gt; haploinsufficiency represents a specific subtype of ASD where neuropsychiatric symptoms are underpinned by long-range over-connectivity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Rho-GTPases are master regulators of polarity establishment and cell morphology. Positive feedback enables concentration of Rho-GTPases into clusters at the cell cortex, from where they regulate the cytoskeleton. Different cell types reproducibly generate either one (e.g. the front of a migrating cell) or several clusters (e.g. the multiple dendrites of a neuron), but the mechanistic basis for unipolar or multipolar outcomes is unclear. The design principles of Rho-GTPase circuits are captured by two-component reaction-diffusion models based on conserved aspects of Rho-GTPase biochemistry. Some such models display rapid winner-takes-all competition between clusters, yielding a unipolar outcome. Other models allow prolonged co-existence of clusters. We investigate the behavior of a simple class of models and show that while the timescale of competition varies enormously depending on model parameters, a single factor explains a large majority of this variation. The dominant factor concerns the degree to which the maximal active GTPase concentration in a cluster approaches a “saturation point” determined by model parameters. We suggest that both saturation and the effect of saturation on competition reflect fundamental properties of the Rho-GTPase polarity machinery, regardless of the specific feedback mechanism, which predict whether the system will generate unipolar or multipolar outcomes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HtPVWxk38yc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Assessing the durability and efficiency of landscape-based strategies to deploy plant resistance to pathogens</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006067</guid>

Genetically-controlled plant resistance can reduce the damage caused by pathogens. However, pathogens have the ability to evolve and overcome such resistance. This often occurs quickly after resistance is deployed, resulting in significant crop losses and a continuing need to develop new resistant cultivars. To tackle this issue, several strategies have been proposed to constrain the evolution of pathogen populations and thus increase genetic resistance durability. These strategies mainly rely on varying different combinations of resistance sources across time (crop rotations) and space. The spatial scale of deployment can vary from multiple resistance sources occurring in a single cultivar (pyramiding), in different cultivars within the same field (cultivar mixtures) or in different fields (mosaics). However, experimental comparison of the efficiency (i.e. ability to reduce disease impact) and durability (i.e. ability to limit pathogen evolution and delay resistance breakdown) of landscape-scale deployment strategies presents major logistical challenges. Therefore, we developed a spatially explicit stochastic model able to assess the epidemiological and evolutionary outcomes of the four major deployment options described above, including both qualitative resistance (i.e. major genes) and quantitative resistance traits against several components of pathogen aggressiveness: infection rate, latent period duration, propagule production rate, and infectious period duration. This model, implemented in the R package &lt;i&gt;landsepi&lt;/i&gt;, provides a new and useful tool to assess the performance of a wide range of deployment options, and helps investigate the effect of landscape, epidemiological and evolutionary parameters. This article describes the model and its parameterisation for rust diseases of cereal crops, caused by fungi of the genus &lt;i&gt;Puccinia&lt;/i&gt;. To illustrate the model, we use it to assess the epidemiological and evolutionary potential of the combination of a major gene and different traits of quantitative resistance. The comparison of the four major deployment strategies described above will be the objective of future studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7LHbywjCaMk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Physics-based simulations of aerial attacks by peregrine falcons reveal that stooping at high speed maximizes catch success against agile prey</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006044</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Robin Mills, Hanno Hildenbrandt, Graham K. Taylor, Charlotte K. Hemelrijk&lt;/p&gt;

The peregrine falcon &lt;i&gt;Falco peregrinus&lt;/i&gt; is renowned for attacking its prey from high altitude in a fast controlled dive called a stoop. Many other raptors employ a similar mode of attack, but the functional benefits of stooping remain obscure. Here we investigate whether, when, and why stooping promotes catch success, using a three-dimensional, agent-based modeling approach to simulate attacks of falcons on aerial prey. We simulate avian flapping and gliding flight using an analytical quasi-steady model of the aerodynamic forces and moments, parametrized by empirical measurements of flight morphology. The model-birds’ flight control inputs are commanded by their guidance system, comprising a phenomenological model of its vision, guidance, and control. To intercept its prey, model-falcons use the same guidance law as missiles (pure proportional navigation); this assumption is corroborated by empirical data on peregrine falcons hunting lures. We parametrically vary the falcon’s starting position relative to its prey, together with the feedback gain of its guidance loop, under differing assumptions regarding its errors and delay in vision and control, and for three different patterns of prey motion. We find that, when the prey maneuvers erratically, high-altitude stoops increase catch success compared to low-altitude attacks, but only if the falcon’s guidance law is appropriately tuned, and only given a high degree of precision in vision and control. Remarkably, the optimal tuning of the guidance law in our simulations coincides closely with what has been observed empirically in peregrines. High-altitude stoops are shown to be beneficial because their high airspeed enables production of higher aerodynamic forces for maneuvering, and facilitates higher roll agility as the wings are tucked, each of which is essential to catching maneuvering prey at realistic response delays.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ypEvewr7kSA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The characterisation of information processing is an important task in
complex systems science. Information dynamics is a quantitative methodology for
modelling the intrinsic information processing conducted by a process
represented as a time series, but to date has only been formulated in discrete
time. Building on previous work which demonstrated how to formulate transfer
entropy in continuous time, we give a total account of information processing
in this setting, incorporating information storage. We find that a convergent
rate of predictive capacity, comprised of the transfer entropy and active
information storage, does not exist, arising through divergent rates of active
information storage. We identify that active information storage can be
decomposed into two separate quantities that characterise predictive capacity
stored in a process: active memory utilisation and instantaneous predictive
capacity. The latter involves prediction related to path regularity and so
solely inherits the divergent properties of the active information storage,
whilst the former permits definitions of pathwise and rate quantities. We
formulate measures of memory utilisation for jump and neural spiking processes
and illustrate measures of information processing in synthetic neural spiking
models and coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models. The application to synthetic
neural spiking models demonstrates that active memory utilisation for point
processes consists of discontinuous jump contributions (at spikes) interrupting
a continuously varying contribution (relating to waiting times between spikes),
complementing the behaviour previously demonstrated for transfer entropy in

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: An Information-Driven 2-Pathway Characterization of Occipitotemporal and Posterior Parietal Visual Object Representations</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of rich visual representations in both occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Using fMRI decoding and a bottom-up data-driven approach, we showed that although robust object category representations exist in both OTC and PPC, there is an information-driven 2-pathway separation among these regions in the representational space, with occipitotemporal regions arranging hierarchically along 1 pathway and posterior parietal regions along another pathway. We obtained 10 independent replications of this 2-pathway distinction, accounting for 58–81% of the total variance of the region-wise differences in visual representation. The separation of the PPC regions from higher occipitotemporal regions was not driven by a difference in tolerance to changes in low-level visual features, did not rely on the presence of special object categories, and was present whether or not object category was task relevant. Our information-driven 2-pathway structure differs from the well-known ventral-what and dorsal-where/how characterization of posterior brain regions. Here both pathways contain rich nonspatial visual representations. The separation we see likely reflects a difference in neural coding scheme used by PPC to represent visual information compared with that of OTC.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Topology of Functional Connectivity and Hub Dynamics in the Beta Band As Temporal Prior for Natural Vision in the Human Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3858?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3858?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Networks hubs represent points of convergence for the integration of information across many different nodes and systems. Although a great deal is known on the topology of hub regions in the human brain, little is known about their temporal dynamics. Here, we examine the static and dynamic centrality of hub regions when measured in the absence of a task (rest) or during the observation of natural or synthetic visual stimuli. We used Magnetoencephalography (MEG) in humans (both sexes) to measure static and transient regional and network-level interaction in α- and β-band limited power (BLP) in three conditions: visual fixation (rest), viewing of movie clips (natural vision), and time-scrambled versions of the same clips (scrambled vision). Compared with rest, we observed in both movie conditions a robust decrement of α-BLP connectivity. Moreover, both movie conditions caused a significant reorganization of connections in the α band, especially between networks. In contrast, β-BLP connectivity was remarkably similar between rest and natural vision. Not only the topology did not change, but the joint dynamics of hubs in a core network during natural vision was predicted by similar fluctuations in the resting state. We interpret these findings by suggesting that slow-varying fluctuations of integration occurring in higher-order regions in the β band may be a mechanism to anticipate and predict slow-varying temporal patterns of the visual environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A fundamental question in neuroscience concerns the function of spontaneous brain connectivity. Here, we tested the hypothesis that topology of intrinsic brain connectivity and its dynamics might predict those observed during natural vision. Using MEG, we tracked the static and time-varying brain functional connectivity when observers were either fixating or watching different movie clips. The spatial distribution of connections and the dynamics of centrality of a set of regions were similar during rest and movie in the β band, but not in the α band. These results support the hypothesis that the intrinsic β-rhythm integration occurs with a similar temporal structure during natural vision, possibly providing advanced information about incoming stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: BMP-Responsive Protease HtrA1 Is Differentially Expressed in Astrocytes and Regulates Astrocytic Development and Injury Response</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes perform a wide array of physiological functions, including structural support, ion exchange, and neurotransmitter uptake. Despite this diversity, molecular markers that label subpopulations of astrocytes are limited, and mechanisms that generate distinct astrocyte subtypes remain unclear. Here we identified serine protease high temperature requirement A 1 (HtrA1), a bone morphogenetic protein 4 signaling regulated protein, as a novel marker of forebrain astrocytes, but not of neural stem cells, in adult mice of both sexes. Genetic deletion of HtrA1 during gliogenesis accelerates astrocyte differentiation. In addition, ablation of HtrA1 in cultured astrocytes leads to altered chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan expression and inhibition of neurite extension, along with elevated levels of transforming growth factor-β family proteins. Brain injury induces HtrA1 expression in reactive astrocytes, and loss of HtrA1 leads to an impairment in wound closure accompanied by increased proliferation of endothelial and immune cells. Our findings demonstrate that HtrA1 is differentially expressed in adult mouse forebrain astrocytes, and that HtrA1 plays important roles in astrocytic development and injury response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Astrocytes, an abundant cell type in the brain, perform a wide array of physiological functions. Although characterized as morphologically and functionally diverse, molecular markers that label astrocyte subtypes or signaling pathways that lead to their diversity remain limited. Here, after examining the expression profile of astrocytes generated in response to bone morphogenetic protein signaling, we identify high temperature requirement A 1 (HtrA1) as an astrocyte-specific marker that is differentially expressed in distinct adult mouse brain regions. HtrA1 is a serine protease that has been linked to cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, a small blood vessel disease in humans. Understanding the role of HtrA1 during development and after injury will provide insights into how distinct astrocyte populations are generated and their unique roles in injury and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: ACC to Dorsal Medial Striatum Inputs Modulate Histaminergic Itch Sensation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3823?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Itch is an unpleasant sensation that initiates scratching behavior. The itch–scratch reaction is a complex phenomenon that implicates supraspinal structures required for regulation of sensory, emotional, cognitive, and motivational aspects. However, the central mechanisms underlying the processing of itch and the interplay of the supraspinal regions and spinal cord in regulating itch–scratch processes are poorly understood. Here, we have shown that the neural projections from anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to dorsal medial striatum (DMS) constitute a critical circuit element for regulating itch-related behaviors in the brains of male C57BL/6J mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that ACC-DMS projections selectively modulate histaminergic, but not nonhistaminergic, itch-related behavior. Furthermore, photoactivation of ACC-DMS projections has also no significant effects on pain behavior induced by thermal, mechanical, and chemical stimuli except for a relief on inflammatory pain evoked by formalin and complete Freund's adjuvant. We further demonstrate that the dorsal spinal cord exerts an inhibitory effect on itch signal from ACC-DMS projections through B5-I neurons, which represent a population of spinal inhibitory interneurons that mediate the inhibition of itch. Therefore, this study presents the first evidence that the ACC-DMS projections modulate histaminergic itch-related behavior and reveals an interplay between the supraspinal and spinal levels in histaminergic itch regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study reveals that the projections from anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to dorsal medial striatum (DMS) constitute a supraspinal circuit for modulation of histaminergic, but not nonhistaminergic, itch. Manipulation of ACC-DMS projections has no effect on acute pain sensation. Furthermore, the dorsal spinal cord exerts an inhibitory effect on itch signal from ACC-DMS projections through B5-I neurons. Understanding the supraspinal itch circuits is of great significance in the development of new therapies for chronic itch-related intractable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Autophagy Enhances Memory Erasure through Synaptic Destabilization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3809?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3809?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is substantial interest in memory reconsolidation as a target for the treatment of anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. However, its applicability is restricted by reconsolidation-resistant boundary conditions that constrain the initial memory destabilization. In this study, we investigated whether the induction of synaptic protein degradation through autophagy modulation, a major protein degradation pathway, can enhance memory destabilization upon retrieval and whether it can be used to overcome these conditions. Here, using male mice in an auditory fear reconsolidation model, we showed that autophagy contributes to memory destabilization and its induction can be used to enhance erasure of a reconsolidation-resistant auditory fear memory that depended on AMPAR endocytosis. Using male mice in a contextual fear reconsolidation model, autophagy induction in the amygdala or in the hippocampus enhanced fear or contextual memory destabilization, respectively. The latter correlated with AMPAR degradation in the spines of the contextual memory-ensemble cells. Using male rats in an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; LTP reconsolidation model, autophagy induction enhanced synaptic destabilization in an NMDAR-dependent manner. These data indicate that induction of synaptic protein degradation can enhance both synaptic and memory destabilization upon reactivation and that autophagy inducers have the potential to be used as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It has been reported that inhibiting synaptic protein degradation prevents memory destabilization. However, whether the reverse relation is true and whether it can be used to enhance memory destabilization are still unknown. Here we addressed this question on the behavioral, molecular, and synaptic levels, and showed that induction of autophagy, a major protein degradation pathway, can enhance memory and synaptic destabilization upon reactivation. We also show that autophagy induction can be used to overcome a reconsolidation-resistant memory, suggesting autophagy inducers as a potential therapeutic tool in the treatment of anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: EEG Correlates of Preparatory Orienting, Contextual Updating, and Inhibition of Sensory Processing in Left Spatial Neglect</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3792?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3792?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Studies with event-related potentials have highlighted deficits in the early phases of orienting to left visual targets in right-brain-damaged patients with left spatial neglect (N+). However, brain responses associated with preparatory orienting of attention, with target novelty and with the detection of a match/mismatch between expected and actual targets (contextual updating), have not been explored in N+. Here in a study in healthy humans and brain-damaged patients of both sexes we demonstrate that frontal activity that reflects supramodal mechanisms of attentional orienting (Anterior Directing Attention Negativity, ADAN) is entirely spared in N+. In contrast, posterior responses that mark the early phases of cued orienting (Early Directing Attention Negativity, EDAN) and the setting up of sensory facilitation over the visual cortex (Late Directing Attention Positivity, LDAP) are suppressed in N+. This uncoupling is associated with damage of parietal-frontal white matter. N+ also exhibit exaggerated novelty reaction to targets in the right side of space and reduced novelty reaction for those in the left side (P3a) together with impaired contextual updating (P3b) in the left space. Finally, we highlight a drop in the amplitude and latency of the P1 that over the left hemisphere signals the early blocking of sensory processing in the right space when targets occur in the left one: this identifies a new electrophysiological marker of the rightward attentional bias in N+. The heterogeneous effects and spatial biases produced by localized brain damage on the different phases of attentional processing indicate relevant functional independence among their underlying neural mechanisms and improve the understanding of the spatial neglect syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our investigation answers important questions: are the different components of preparatory orienting (EDAN, ADAN, LDAP) functionally independent in the healthy brain? Is preparatory orienting of attention spared in left spatial neglect? Does the sparing of preparatory orienting have an impact on deficits in reflexive orienting and in the assignment of behavioral relevance to the left space? We show that supramodal preparatory orienting in frontal areas is entirely spared in neglect patients though this does not counterbalance deficits in preparatory parietal-occipital activity, reflexive orienting, and contextual updating. This points at relevant functional dissociations among different components of attention and suggests that improving voluntary attention in N+ might be behaviorally ineffective unless associated with stimulations boosting the response of posterior parietal-occipital areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Electrophysiological Evidence for the Development of a Self-Sustained Large-Scale Epileptic Network in the Kainate Mouse Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3776?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Most research on focal epilepsy focuses on mechanisms of seizure generation in the primary epileptic focus (EF). However, neurological deficits that are not directly linked to seizure activity and that may persist after focus removal are frequent. The recruitment of remote brain regions of an epileptic network (EN) is recognized as a possible cause, but a profound lack of experimental evidence exists concerning their recruitment and the type of pathological activities they exhibit. We studied the development of epileptic activities at the large-scale in male mice of the kainate model of unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy using high-density surface EEG and multiple-site intracortical recordings. We show that, along with focal spikes and fast ripples that remain localized to the injected hippocampus (i.e., the EF), a subpopulation of spikes that propagate across the brain progressively emerges even before the expression of seizures. The spatiotemporal propagation of these generalized spikes (GSs) is highly stable within and across animals, defining a large-scale EN comprising both hippocampal regions and frontal cortices. Interestingly, GSs are often concomitant with muscular twitches. In addition, while fast ripples are, as expected, highly frequent in the EF, they also emerge in remote cortical regions and in particular in frontal regions where GSs propagate. Finally, we demonstrate that these remote interictal activities are dependent on the focus in the early phase of the disease but continue to be expressed after focus silencing at later stages. Our results provide evidence that neuronal networks outside the initial focus are progressively altered during epileptogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It has long been held that the epileptic focus is responsible for triggering seizures and driving interictal activities. However, focal epilepsies are associated with heterogeneous symptoms, calling into question the concept of a strictly focal disease. Using the mouse model of hippocampal sclerosis, this work demonstrates that focal epilepsy leads to the development of pathological activities specific to the epileptic condition, notably fast ripples, that appear outside of the primary epileptic focus. Whereas these activities are dependent on the focus early in the disease, focus silencing fails to control them in the chronic stage. Thus, dynamical changes specific to the epileptic condition are built up outside of the epileptic focus along with disease progression, which provides supporting evidence for network alterations in focal epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex Is Necessary for Normal Associative Inference and Memory Integration</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to flexibly combine existing knowledge in response to novel circumstances is highly adaptive. However, the neural correlates of flexible associative inference are not well characterized. Laboratory tests of associative inference have measured memory for overlapping pairs of studied items (e.g., AB, BC) and for nonstudied pairs with common associates (i.e., AC). Findings from functional neuroimaging and neuropsychology suggest the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) may be necessary for associative inference. Here, we used a neuropsychological approach to test the necessity of vmPFC for successful memory-guided associative inference in humans using an overlapping pairs associative memory task. We predicted that individuals with focal vmPFC damage (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 5; 3F, 2M) would show impaired inferential memory but intact non-inferential memory. Performance was compared with normal comparison participants (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 10; 6F, 4M). Participants studied pairs of visually presented objects including overlapping pairs (AB, BC) and nonoverlapping pairs (XY). Participants later completed a three-alternative forced-choice recognition task for studied pairs (AB, BC, XY) and inference pairs (AC). As predicted, the vmPFC group had intact memory for studied pairs but significantly impaired memory for inferential pairs. These results are consistent with the perspective that the vmPFC is necessary for memory-guided associative inference, indicating that the vmPFC is critical for adaptive abilities that require application of existing knowledge to novel circumstances. Additionally, vmPFC damage was associated with unexpectedly reduced memory for AB pairs post-inference, which could potentially reflect retroactive interference. Together, these results reinforce an emerging understanding of a role for the vmPFC in brain networks supporting associative memory processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We live in a constantly changing environment, so the ability to adapt our knowledge to support understanding of new circumstances is essential. One important adaptive ability is &lt;i&gt;associative inference&lt;/i&gt; which allows us to extract shared features from distinct experiences and relate them. For example, if we see a woman holding a baby, and later see a man holding the same baby, then we might infer that the two adults are a couple. Despite the importance of associative inference, the brain systems necessary for this ability are not known. Here, we report that damage to human ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) disproportionately impairs associative inference. Our findings show the necessity of the vmPFC for normal associative inference and memory integration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Convergence and Divergence of CRH Amacrine Cells in Mouse Retinal Circuitry</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3753?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory interneurons sculpt the outputs of excitatory circuits to expand the dynamic range of information processing. In mammalian retina, &amp;gt;30 types of amacrine cells provide lateral inhibition to vertical, excitatory bipolar cell circuits, but functional roles for only a few amacrine cells are well established. Here, we elucidate the function of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-expressing amacrine cells labeled in Cre-transgenic mice of either sex. CRH cells costratify with the ON alpha ganglion cell, a neuron highly sensitive to positive contrast. Electrophysiological and optogenetic analyses demonstrate that two CRH types (CRH-1 and CRH-3) make GABAergic synapses with ON alpha cells. CRH-1 cells signal via graded membrane potential changes, whereas CRH-3 cells fire action potentials. Both types show sustained ON-type responses to positive contrast over a range of stimulus conditions. Optogenetic control of transmission at CRH-1 synapses demonstrates that these synapses are tuned to low temporal frequencies, maintaining GABA release during fast hyperpolarizations during brief periods of negative contrast. CRH amacrine cell output is suppressed by prolonged negative contrast, when ON alpha ganglion cells continue to receive inhibitory input from converging OFF-pathway amacrine cells; the converging ON- and OFF-pathway inhibition balances tonic excitatory drive to ON alpha cells. Previously, it was demonstrated that CRH-1 cells inhibit firing by suppressed-by-contrast (SbC) ganglion cells during positive contrast. Therefore, divergent outputs of CRH-1 cells inhibit two ganglion cell types with opposite responses to positive contrast. The opposing responses of ON alpha and SbC ganglion cells are explained by differing excitation/inhibition balance in the two circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A goal of neuroscience research is to explain the function of neural circuits at the level of specific cell types. Here, we studied the function of specific types of inhibitory interneurons, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) amacrine cells, in the mouse retina. Genetic tools were used to identify and manipulate CRH cells, which make GABAergic synapses with a well studied ganglion cell type, the ON alpha cell. CRH cells converge with other types of amacrine cells to tonically inhibit ON alpha cells and balance their high level of excitation. CRH cells diverge to different types of ganglion cell, the unique properties of which depend on their balance of excitation and inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Role of the Mechanotransduction Ion Channel Candidate Nanchung-Inactive in Auditory Transduction in an Insect Ear</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3741?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Insect auditory receivers provide an excellent comparative resource to understand general principles of auditory transduction, but analysis of the electrophysiological properties of the auditory neurons has been hampered by their tiny size and inaccessibility. Here we pioneer patch-clamp recordings from the auditory neurons of Müller's organ of the desert locust &lt;i&gt;Schistocerca gregaria&lt;/i&gt; to characterize dendritic spikes, axonal spikes, and the transduction current. We demonstrate that dendritic spikes, elicited by sound stimuli, trigger axonal spikes, and that both types are sodium and voltage dependent and blocked by TTX. Spontaneous discrete depolarizations summate upon acoustic stimulation to produce a graded transduction potential that in turn elicits the dendritic spikes. The transduction current of Group III neurons of Müller's organ, which are broadly tuned to 3 kHz, is blocked by three ion channel blockers (FM1-43, streptomycin, and 2-APB) that are known to block mechanotransduction channels. We investigated the contribution of the candidate mechanotransduction ion channel Nanchung-Inactive—which is expressed in Müller's organ—to the transduction current. A specific agonist of Nanchung-Inactive, pymetrozine, eliminates the sound-evoked transduction current while inducing a tonic depolarizing current of comparable amplitude. The Nanchung-Inactive ion channels, therefore, have the required conductance to carry the entire transduction current, and sound stimulation appears not to open any additional channels. The application of three mechanotransduction ion channel blockers prevented the pymetrozine-induced depolarizing current. This implies that either Nanchung-Inactive is, or forms part of, the mechanotransduction ion channel or it amplifies a relatively small current (&amp;lt;30 pA) produced by another mechanotransduction ion channel such as NompC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mechanically activated ion channel underpinning hearing is not known. We have pioneered intracellular patch-clamp recordings from locust auditory neurons to unravel the role of the candidate mechanotransduction ion channel Nanchung-Inactive in auditory transduction in insects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Regulation of Nociceptive Glutamatergic Signaling by Presynaptic Kv3.4 Channels in the Rat Spinal Dorsal Horn</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3729?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Presynaptic voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (Kv) channels in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons are thought to regulate nociceptive synaptic transmission in the spinal dorsal horn. However, the Kv channel subtypes responsible for this critical role have not been identified. The Kv3.4 channel is particularly important because it is robustly expressed in DRG nociceptors, where it regulates action potential (AP) duration. Furthermore, Kv3.4 dysfunction is implicated in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain in multiple pain models. We hypothesized that, through their ability to modulate AP repolarization, Kv3.4 channels in DRG nociceptors help to regulate nociceptive synaptic transmission. To test this hypothesis, we investigated Kv3.4 immunoreactivity (IR) in the rat cervical superficial dorsal horn (sDH) in both sexes and implemented an intact spinal cord preparation to investigate glutamatergic synaptic currents from second order neurons in the sDH under conditions that selectively inhibit the Kv3.4 current. We found presynaptic Kv3.4 IR in peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptive fibers of the sDH. The Kv3.4 channel is hypersensitive to 4-aminopyridine and tetraethylammonium (TEA). Accordingly, 50 μm 4-aminopyridine and 500 μm TEA significantly prolong the AP, slow the maximum rate of repolarization in small-diameter DRG neurons, and potentiate monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in dorsal horn laminae I and II through a presynaptic mechanism. In contrast, highly specific inhibitors of BK, Kv7, and Kv1 channels are less effective modulators of the AP and have little to no effect on EPSCs. The results strongly suggest that presynaptic Kv3.4 channels are major regulators of nociceptive synaptic transmission in the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Intractable neuropathic pain can result from disease or traumatic injury and many studies have been conducted to determine the underlying pathophysiological changes. Voltage-gated ion channels, including the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel Kv3.4, are dysregulated in multiple pain models. Kv3.4 channels are ubiquitously expressed in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), where they are major regulators of DRG excitability. However, little is known about the ionic mechanisms that regulate nociceptive synaptic transmission at the level of the first synapse in the spinal cord, which is critical to pain transmission in both intact and pathological states. Here, we show that Kv3.4 channels have a significant impact on glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the dorsal horn, further illuminating its potential as a molecular pain therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: JIP1-Mediated JNK Activation Negatively Regulates Synaptic Plasticity and Spatial Memory</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signal transduction pathway is implicated in learning and memory. Here, we examined the role of JNK activation mediated by the JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP1) scaffold protein. We compared male wild-type mice with a mouse model harboring a point mutation in the &lt;i&gt;Jip1&lt;/i&gt; gene that selectively blocks JIP1-mediated JNK activation. These male mutant mice exhibited increased NMDAR currents, increased NMDAR-mediated gene expression, and a lower threshold for induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation. The JIP1 mutant mice also displayed improved hippocampus-dependent spatial memory and enhanced associative fear conditioning. These results were confirmed using a second JIP1 mutant mouse model that suppresses JNK activity. Together, these observations establish that JIP1-mediated JNK activation contributes to the regulation of hippocampus-dependent, NMDAR-mediated synaptic plasticity and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The results of this study demonstrate that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation induced by the JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP1) scaffold protein negatively regulates the threshold for induction of long-term synaptic plasticity through the NMDA-type glutamate receptor. This change in plasticity threshold influences learning. Indeed, mice with defects in JIP1-mediated JNK activation display enhanced memory in hippocampus-dependent tasks, such as contextual fear conditioning and Morris water maze, indicating that JIP1-JNK constrains spatial memory. This study identifies JIP1-mediated JNK activation as a novel molecular pathway that negatively regulates NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity and memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Functional MRI Responses to Passive, Active, and Observed Touch in Somatosensory and Insular Cortices of the Macaque Monkey</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3689?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurophysiological data obtained in primates suggests that merely observing others' actions can modulate activity in the observer's motor cortices. In humans, it has been suggested that these multimodal vicarious responses extend well beyond the motor cortices, including somatosensory and insular brain regions, which seem to yield vicarious responses when witnessing others' actions, sensations, or emotions (Gazzola and Keysers, 2009). Despite the wealth of data with respect to shared action responses in the monkey motor system, whether the somatosensory and insular cortices also yield vicarious responses during observation of touch remains largely unknown. Using independent tactile and motor fMRI localizers, we first mapped the hand representations of two male monkeys' primary (SI) and secondary (SII) somatosensory cortices. In two subsequent visual experiments, we examined fMRI brain responses to (1) observing a conspecific's hand being touched or (2) observing a human hand grasping or mere touching an object or another human hand. Whereas functionally defined &quot;tactile SI&quot; and &quot;tactile SII&quot; showed little involvement in representing observed touch, vicarious responses for touch were found in parietal area PFG, consistent with recent observations in humans (Chan and Baker, 2015). Interestingly, a more anterior portion of SII, and posterior insular cortex, both of which responded when monkeys performed active grasping movements, also yielded visual responses during different instances of touch observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Common coding of one's own and others' actions, sensations, and emotions seems to be widespread in the brain. Although it is currently unclear to what extent human somatosensory cortices yield vicarious responses when observing touch, even less is known about the presence of similar vicarious responses in monkey somatosensory cortex. We therefore localized monkey somatosensory hand representations using fMRI and investigated whether these regions yield vicarious responses while observing various instances of touch. Whereas &quot;tactile SI and SII&quot; did not elicit responses during touch observation, a more anterior portion of SII, in addition to area PFG and posterior insular cortex, all of which responded during monkeys' own grasping movements, yielded vicarious responses during observed touch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: SIRT1 Deacetylates Tau and Reduces Pathogenic Tau Spread in a Mouse Model of Tauopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3680?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hyperacetylation of tau has been implicated in neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in tauopathy brains. The nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide-dependent class-III protein deacetylase SIRT1 is one of the major enzymes involved in removal of acetyl groups from tau &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. However, whether SIRT1 regulates acetylation of pathogenic tau and ameliorates tau-mediated pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we report deacetylating activity of SIRT1 for acetylated Lys174 (K174) of tau in tauP301S transgenic mice with a brain-specific SIRT1 deletion. We show that SIRT1 deficiency leads to exacerbation of premature mortality, synapse loss, and behavioral disinhibition in tauP301S transgenic mice of both sexes. By contrast, SIRT1 overexpression by stereotaxic delivery of adeno-associated virus that encodes SIRT1 into the hippocampus reduces acetylated K174 tau. Furthermore, SIRT1 overexpression significantly attenuates the spread of tau pathology into anatomically connected brain regions of tauP301S transgenic mice of both sexes. These findings suggest the functional importance of SIRT1 in regulating pathogenic tau acetylation and in suppressing the spread of tau pathology &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In neurodegenerative disorders with inclusions of microtubule-associated protein tau, aberrant lysine acetylation of tau plays critical roles in promoting tau accumulation and toxicity. Identifying strategies to deacetylate tau could interfere with disease progression; however, little is known about how pathogenic tau is deacetylated &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here we show that the protein deacetylase SIRT1 reduces tau acetylation in a mouse model of neurodegeneration. SIRT1 deficiency in the brain aggravates synapse loss and behavioral disinhibition, and SIRT1 overexpression ameliorates propagation of tau pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Bilateral Tactile Input Patterns Decoded at Comparable Levels But Different Time Scales in Neocortical Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The presence of contralateral tactile input can profoundly affect ipsilateral tactile perception, and unilateral stroke in somatosensory areas can result in bilateral tactile deficits, suggesting that bilateral tactile integration is an important part of brain function. Although previous studies have shown that bilateral tactile inputs exist and that there are neural interactions between inputs from the two sides, no previous study explored to what extent the local neuronal circuitry processing contains detailed information about the nature of the tactile input from the two sides. To address this question, we used a recently introduced approach to deliver a set of electrical, reproducible, tactile afferent, spatiotemporal activation patterns, which permits a high-resolution analysis of the neuronal decoding capacity, to the skin of the second forepaw digits of the anesthetized male rat. Surprisingly, we found that individual neurons of the primary somatosensory can decode contralateral and ipsilateral input patterns to comparable extents. Although the contralateral input was stronger and more rapidly decoded, given sufficient poststimulus processing time, ipsilateral decoding levels essentially caught up to contralateral levels. Moreover, there was a weak but significant correlation for neurons with high decoding performance for contralateral tactile input to also perform well on decoding ipsilateral input. Our findings shed new light on the brain mechanisms underlying bimanual haptic integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we demonstrate that the spiking activity of single neocortical neurons in the somatosensory cortex of the rat can be used to decode patterned tactile stimuli delivered to the distal ventral skin of the second forepaw digits on both sides of the body. Even though comparable levels of decoding of the tactile input were achieved faster for contralateral input, given sufficient integration time each neuron was found to decode ipsilateral input with a comparable level of accuracy. Given that the neocortical neurons could decode ipsilateral inputs with such small differences between the patterns suggests that S1 cortex has access to very precise information about ipsilateral events. The findings shed new light on possible network mechanisms underlying bimanual haptic processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Human V4 Activity Patterns Predict Behavioral Performance in Imagery of Object Color</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Color is special among basic visual features in that it can form a defining part of objects that are engrained in our memory. Whereas most neuroimaging research on human color vision has focused on responses related to external stimulation, the present study investigated how sensory-driven color vision is linked to subjective color perception induced by object imagery. We recorded fMRI activity in male and female volunteers during viewing of abstract color stimuli that were red, green, or yellow in half of the runs. In the other half we asked them to produce mental images of colored, meaningful objects (such as tomato, grapes, banana) corresponding to the same three color categories. Although physically presented color could be decoded from all retinotopically mapped visual areas, only hV4 allowed predicting colors of imagined objects when classifiers were trained on responses to physical colors. Importantly, only neural signal in hV4 was predictive of behavioral performance in the color judgment task on a trial-by-trial basis. The commonality between neural representations of sensory-driven and imagined object color and the behavioral link to neural representations in hV4 identifies area hV4 as a perceptual hub linking externally triggered color vision with color in self-generated object imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Humans experience color not only when visually exploring the outside world, but also in the absence of visual input, for example when remembering, dreaming, and during imagery. It is not known where neural codes for sensory-driven and internally generated hue converge. In the current study we evoked matching subjective color percepts, one driven by physically presented color stimuli, the other by internally generated color imagery. This allowed us to identify area hV4 as the only site where neural codes of corresponding subjective color perception converged regardless of its origin. Color codes in hV4 also predicted behavioral performance in an imagery task, suggesting it forms a perceptual hub for color perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Deletion of the Cold Thermoreceptor TRPM8 Increases Heat Loss and Food Intake Leading to Reduced Body Temperature and Obesity in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3643?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The coupling of energy homeostasis to thermoregulation is essential to maintain homeothermy in changing external environments. We studied the role of the cold thermoreceptor TRPM8 in this interplay in mice of both sexes. We demonstrate that TRPM8 is required for a precise thermoregulation in response to cold, in fed and fasting. &lt;i&gt;Trpm8&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited a fall of 0.7°C in core body temperature when housed at cold temperatures, and a deep hypothermia (&amp;lt;30°C) during food deprivation. In both situations, TRPM8 deficiency induced an increase in tail heat loss. This, together with the presence of TRPM8-sensory fibers innervating the main tail vessels, unveils a major role of this ion channel in tail vasomotor regulation. Finally, TRPM8 deficiency had a remarkable impact on energy balance. &lt;i&gt;Trpm8&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice raised at mild cold temperatures developed late-onset obesity and metabolic dysfunction, with daytime hyperphagia and reduction of fat oxidation as plausible causal factors. In conclusion, TRPM8 fine-tunes eating behavior and fuel utilization during thermoregulatory adjustments to mild cold. Persistent imbalances in these responses result in obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The thermosensitive ion channel TRPM8 is required for a precise thermoregulatory response to cold and fasting, playing an important role in tail vasoconstriction, and therefore heat conservation, as well as in the regulation of ingestive behavior and metabolic fuel selection upon cooling. Indeed, TRPM8-deficient mice, housed in a mild cold environment, displayed an increase in tail heat loss and lower core body temperature, associated with the development of late-onset obesity with glucose and lipid metabolic dysfunction. A persistent diurnal hyperphagia and reduced fat oxidation constitute plausible underlying mechanisms in the background of a deficient thermoregulatory adjustment to mild cold ambient temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Activity-Dependent Myelination of Parvalbumin Interneurons Mediated by Axonal Morphological Plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3631?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3631?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Axonal myelination of neocortical pyramidal neurons is modulated dynamically by neuronal activity. Recent studies have shown that a substantial proportion of neocortical myelin content is contributed by fast-spiking, parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons. However, it remains unknown whether the myelination of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons is also modulated by intrinsic activity. Here, we used cell-type-specific Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) in adult mice to activate a sparse population of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons. Using single-cell axonal reconstructions, we found that DREADD-stimulated PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons exhibited a nearly two-fold increase in total length of myelination, predominantly mediated by a parallel increase of axonal arborization and number of internodes. In contrast, the distribution of axonal interbranch segment distance and myelin internode length were not altered significantly. Topographical analysis revealed that myelination of DREADD-stimulated cells extended to higher axonal branch orders while retaining a similar interbranch distance threshold for myelination. Together, our results demonstrate that chemogenetically induced neuronal activity increases the myelination of neocortical PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons mediated at least in part by an elaboration of their axonal morphology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Myelination is the wrapping of an axon to optimize conduction velocity in an energy-efficient manner. Previous studies have shown that myelination of neocortical pyramidal neurons is experience and activity dependent. We now show that activity-dependent myelin plasticity in the adult neocortex extends to parvalbumin (PV)-expressing fast-spiking interneurons. Chemogenetic stimulation of PV interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) significantly enhanced axonal myelination, which was paralleled by an increase in axonal arborization. This suggests that activity-dependent axonal plasticity may involve changes in both structural morphology and myelination. Such multicomponent plasticity reveals an unexpected repertoire of anatomical parameters available for optimizing and adapting neuronal networks in response to experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Filter Based Phase Shifts Distort Neuronal Timing Information</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Filters are widely used for the modulation, typically attenuation, of amplitudes of different frequencies within neurophysiological signals. Filters, however, also induce changes in the phases of different frequencies whose amplitude is unmodulated. These phase shifts cause time lags in the filtered signals, leading to a disruption of the timing information between different frequencies within the same signal and between different signals. The emerging time lags can be either constant in the case of linear phase (LP) filters, or vary as a function of the frequency in the more common case of non-linear phase (NLP) filters. Since filters are used ubiquitously online in the early stages of data acquisition, the vast majority of neurophysiological signals thus suffer from distortion of the timing information even prior to their sampling. This distortion is often exacerbated by further multiple offline filtering stages of the sampled signal. The distortion of timing information may cause misinterpretation of the results and lead to erroneous conclusions. Here we present a variety of typical examples of filter-induced phase distortions and discuss the evaluation and restoration of the timing information underlying the original signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Filters are a common tool used in the processing of neuronal signals. In addition to their effect on the amplitude of different frequencies, filters also have a significant impact on their phases, which results in the distortion of the underlying timing information. This distortion, which arises by the online filters used in most neurophysiological systems and is exacerbated by further offline filtering, may cause severe misinterpretation of the results and lead to false conclusions. This manuscript presents different cases in which the timing information is disrupted and discusses the evaluation and correction of the underlying phase shifts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Controlling seizure propagation in large-scale brain networks. (arXiv:1804.03588v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Information transmission in the human brain is a fundamentally dynamic
network process. In partial epilepsy, this process is perturbed and highly
synchronous seizures originate in a local network, the so-called epileptogenic
zone (EZ), before recruiting other close or distant brain regions. We studied
patient-specific brain network models of 15 drug-resistant epilepsy patients
with implanted stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) electrodes. Each
personalized brain model was derived from structural data of magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor weighted imaging (DTI), comprising 88 nodes
equipped with region specific neural mass models capable of demonstrating a
range of epileptiform discharges. Each patients virtual brain was further
personalized through the integration of the clinically hypothesized EZ.
Subsequent simulations and connectivity modulations were performed and
uncovered a finite repertoire of seizure propagation patterns. Across patients,
we found that (i) patient-specific network connectivity is predictive for the
subsequent seizure propagation pattern; (ii)seizure propagation is
characterized by a systematic sequence of brain states; (iii) propagation can
be controlled by an optimal intervention on the connectivity matrix; (iv) the
degree of invasiveness can be significantly reduced via the here proposed
seizure control as compared to traditional resective surgery. To stop seizures,
neurosurgeons typically resect the EZ completely. We showed that stability
analysis of the network dynamics using graph theoretical metrics estimates
reliably the spatiotemporal properties of seizure propagation. This suggests
novel less invasive paradigms of surgical interventions to treat and manage
partial epilepsy.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Efficient brain simulation is a scientific grand challenge, a
parallel/distributed coding challenge and a source of requirements and
suggestions for future computing architectures. Indeed, the human brain
includes about 10^15 synapses and 10^11 neurons activated at a mean rate of
several Hz. Full brain simulation poses Exascale challenges even if simulated
at the highest abstraction level. The WaveScalES experiment in the Human Brain
Project (HBP) has the goal of matching experimental measures and simulations of
slow waves during deep-sleep and anesthesia and the transition to other brain
states. The focus is the development of dedicated large-scale
parallel/distributed simulation technologies. The ExaNeSt project designs an
ARM-based, low-power HPC architecture scalable to million of cores, developing
a dedicated scalable interconnect system, and SWA/AW simulations are included
among the driving benchmarks. At the joint between both projects is the INFN
proprietary Distributed and Plastic Spiking Neural Networks (DPSNN) simulation
engine. DPSNN can be configured to stress either the networking or the
computation features available on the execution platforms. The simulation
stresses the networking component when the neural net - composed by a
relatively low number of neurons, each one projecting thousands of synapses -
is distributed over a large number of hardware cores. When growing the number
of neurons per core, the computation starts to be the dominating component for
short range connections. This paper reports about preliminary performance
results obtained on an ARM-based HPC prototype developed in the framework of
the ExaNeSt project. Furthermore, a comparison is given of instantaneous power,
total energy consumption, execution time and energetic cost per synaptic event
of SWA/AW DPSNN simulations when executed on either ARM- or Intel-based server
platforms.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Studying the Effects of Deep Brain Stimulation and Medication on the Dynamics of STN-LFP Signals for Human Behavior Analysis. (arXiv:1804.03190v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents the results of our recent work on studying the effects of
deep brain stimulation (DBS) and medication on the dynamics of brain local
field potential (LFP) signals used for behavior analysis of patients with
Parkinson s disease (PD). DBS is a technique used to alleviate the severe
symptoms of PD when pharmacotherapy is not very effective. Behavior recognition
from the LFP signals recorded from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has
application in developing closed-loop DBS systems, where the stimulation pulse
is adaptively generated according to subjects performing behavior. Most of the
existing studies on behavior recognition that use STN-LFPs are based on the DBS
being off. This paper discovers how the performance and accuracy of automated
behavior recognition from the LFP signals are affected under different
paradigms of stimulation on/off. We first study the notion of beta power
suppression in LFP signals under different scenarios (stimulation on/off and
medication on/off). Afterward, we explore the accuracy of support vector
machines in predicting human actions (button press and reach) using the
spectrogram of STN-LFP signals. Our experiments on the recorded LFP signals of
three subjects confirm that the beta power is suppressed significantly when the
patients take medication (p-value&amp;lt;0.002) or stimulation (p-value&amp;lt;0.0003). The
results also show that we can classify different behaviors with a reasonable
accuracy of 85% even when the high-amplitude stimulation is applied.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Quantifying behavior is crucial for many applications in neuroscience.
Videography provides easy methods for the observation and recording of animal
behavior in diverse settings, yet extracting particular aspects of a behavior
for further analysis can be highly time consuming. In motor control studies,
humans or other animals are often marked with reflective markers to assist with
computer-based tracking, yet markers are intrusive (especially for smaller
animals), and the number and location of the markers must be determined a
priori. Here, we present a highly efficient method for markerless tracking
based on transfer learning with deep neural networks that achieves excellent
results with minimal training data. We demonstrate the versatility of this
framework by tracking various body parts in a broad collection of experimental
settings: mice odor trail-tracking, egg-laying behavior in drosophila, and
mouse hand articulation in a skilled forelimb task. For example, during the
skilled reaching behavior, individual joints can be automatically tracked (and
a confidence score is reported). Remarkably, even when a small number of frames
are labeled ($\approx 200$), the algorithm achieves excellent tracking
performance on test frames that is comparable to human accuracy.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Travers Ching, Xun Zhu, Lana X. Garmire&lt;/p&gt;

Artificial neural networks (ANN) are computing architectures with many interconnections of simple neural-inspired computing elements, and have been applied to biomedical fields such as imaging analysis and diagnosis. We have developed a new ANN framework called Cox-nnet to predict patient prognosis from high throughput transcriptomics data. In 10 TCGA RNA-Seq data sets, Cox-nnet achieves the same or better predictive accuracy compared to other methods, including Cox-proportional hazards regression (with LASSO, ridge, and mimimax concave penalty), Random Forests Survival and CoxBoost. Cox-nnet also reveals richer biological information, at both the pathway and gene levels. The outputs from the hidden layer node provide an alternative approach for survival-sensitive dimension reduction. In summary, we have developed a new method for accurate and efficient prognosis prediction on high throughput data, with functional biological insights.

	<title>RSS PAP: A Transient Dopamine Signal Represents Avoidance Value and Causally Influences the Demand to Avoid</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0058-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;While an extensive literature supports the notion that mesocorticolimbic dopamine plays a role in negative reinforcement, recent evidence suggests that dopamine exclusively encodes the value of positive reinforcement. In the present study, we employed a behavioral economics approach to investigate whether dopamine plays a role in the valuation of negative reinforcement. Using rats as subjects, we first applied fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to determine that dopamine concentration decreases with the number of lever presses required to avoid electrical footshock (i.e. the economic price of avoidance). Analysis of the rate of decay of avoidance demand curves, which depict an inverse relationship between avoidance and increasing price, allows for inference of the worth an animal places on avoidance outcomes. Rapidly decaying demand curves indicate increased price sensitivity, or low worth placed on avoidance outcomes, while slow rates of decay indicate reduced price sensitivity, or greater worth placed on avoidance outcomes. We therefore used optogenetics to assess how inducing dopamine release causally modifies the demand to avoid electrical footshock in an economic setting. Increasing release at an avoidance predictive cue made animals more sensitive to price, consistent with a negative reward prediction error (i.e., the animal perceives they received a worse outcome than expected). Increasing release at avoidance made animals less sensitive to price, consistent with a positive reward prediction error (i.e., the animal perceives they received a better outcome than expected). These data demonstrate that transient dopamine release events represent the value of avoidance outcomes and can predictably modify the demand to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Dopamine is thought to play a crucial role in reward learning and directing actions toward beneficial outcomes. While the avoidance of harmful stimuli is similarly pertinent to an organism’s survival, the role of dopamine in avoidance remains controversial. Using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrochemistry, we observed that dopamine concentration decreased when the effort (lever presses) required to avoid electrical footshock increased. We also found that increasing dopamine at an avoidance predictive cue decreased avoidance, consistent with a negative prediction error. In contrast, increasing release at successful avoidance increased avoidance, consistent with a positive prediction error. These data demonstrate that transient dopamine release events represent the value of avoidance outcomes and capably modify avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A theory of consciousness: computation, algorithm, and neurobiological realization. (arXiv:1804.02952v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02952</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02952</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The most enigmatic aspect of consciousness is the fact that it is felt, as a
subjective sensation. This particular aspect is explained by the theory
proposed here. The theory encompasses both the computation that is presumably
involved and the way in which that computation may be realized in the brain's
neurobiology. It is assumed that the brain makes an internal estimate of an
individual's own evolutionary fitness, which can be shown to produce an
irreducible, distinct cause. Communicating components of the fitness estimate
(either for external or internal use) requires inverting them. Such inversion
can be performed by the thalamocortical feedback loop in the mammalian brain,
if that loop is operating in a switched, dual-stage mode. A first
(nonconscious) stage produces forward estimates, whereas the second (conscious)
stage inverts those estimates. It is argued that inversion produces
irreducible, distinct, and spatially localized causes, which are plausibly
sensed as the feeling of consciousness.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Visual detection of time-varying signals: opposing biases and their timescales. (arXiv:1804.02885v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02885</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02885</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human visual perception is a complex, dynamic and fluctuating process. In
addition to the incoming visual stimulus, it is affected by many other factors
including temporal context, both external and internal to the observer. In this
study we investigate the dynamic properties of psychophysical responses to a
continuous stream of visual near-threshold detection tasks. We manipulate the
incoming signals to have temporal structures with various characteristic
timescales. Responses of human observers to these signals are analyzed using
tools that highlight their dynamical features as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find that two opposing biases shape perception, and operate over distinct
timescales. Positive recency appears over short times, e.g. consecutive trials.
Adaptation, entailing an increased probability of changed response, reflects
trends over longer times. Analysis of psychometric curves conditioned on
various temporal events reveals that the balance between the two biases can
shift depending on their interplay with the temporal properties of the input
signal. A simple mathematical model reproduces the experimental data in all
stimulus regimes. Taken together, our results support the view that visual
response fluctuations reflect complex internal dynamics, possibly related to
higher cognitive processes.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Big imaging data is becoming more prominent in brain sciences across
spatiotemporal scales and phylogenies. We have developed a computational
ecosystem that enables storage, visualization, and analysis of these data in
the cloud, thusfar spanning 20+ publications and 100+ terabytes including
nanoscale ultrastructure, microscale synaptogenetic diversity, and mesoscale
whole brain connectivity, making NeuroData the largest and most diverse open
repository of brain data.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The new phenomenological model of the ensemble of three neurons with chemical
(synaptic) and electrical couplings has been studied. One neuron is modeled by
a single Van der Pol oscillator. The influence of the electrical coupling
strength and the frequency mismatch between the elements to the regime of
sequential activity is investigated.

We present a computational model of spatial navigation comprising different learning mechanisms in mammals, i.e., associative, cognitive mapping and parallel systems. This model is able to reproduce a large number of experimental results in different variants of the Morris water maze task, including standard associative phenomena (spatial generalization gradient and blocking), as well as navigation based on cognitive mapping. Furthermore, we show that competitive and cooperative patterns between different navigation strategies in the model allow to explain previous apparently contradictory results supporting either associative or cognitive mechanisms for spatial learning. The key computational mechanism to reconcile experimental results showing different influences of distal and proximal cues on the behavior, different learning times, and different abilities of individuals to alternatively perform spatial and response strategies, relies in the dynamic coordination of navigation strategies, whose performance is evaluated online with a common currency through a modular approach. We provide a set of concrete experimental predictions to further test the computational model. Overall, this computational work sheds new light on inter-individual differences in navigation learning, and provides a formal and mechanistic approach to test various theories of spatial cognition in mammals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ErL2lgBM7O0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The relationship between the structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) of neural systems is of central importance in brain network science. It is an open question, however, how the SC-FC relationship depends on specific topological features of brain networks or the models used for describing neural dynamics. Using a basic but general model of discrete excitable units that follow a susceptible—excited—refractory activity cycle (SER model), we here analyze how the network activity patterns underlying functional connectivity are shaped by the characteristic topological features of the network. We develop an analytical framework for describing the contribution of essential topological elements, such as common inputs and pacemakers, to the coactivation of nodes, and demonstrate the validity of the approach by comparison of the analytical predictions with numerical simulations of various exemplar networks. The present analytic framework may serve as an initial step for the mechanistic understanding of the contributions of brain network topology to brain dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-BJLyjXZ7qg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to sense time and anticipate events is critical for survival. Learned responses that allow anticipation of the availability of food or water have been intensively studied. While anticipatory behaviors also occur prior to availability of regularly available rewards, there has been relatively little work on anticipation of drugs of abuse, specifically methamphetamine (MA). In the present study, we used a protocol that avoided possible CNS effects of stresses of handling or surgery by testing anticipation of MA availability in animals living in their home cages, with daily voluntary access to the drug at a fixed time of day. Anticipation was operationalized as the amount of wheel running prior to MA availability. Mice were divided into four groups given access to either nebulized MA or water, in early or late day. Animals with access to MA, but not water controls, showed anticipatory activity, with more anticipation in early compared to late day and significant interaction effects. Next, we explored the neural basis of the MA anticipation, using c-FOS expression, in animals euthanized at the usual time of nebulization access. In the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the pattern of c-FOS expression paralleled that of anticipatory behavior, with significant main and interaction effects of treatment and time of day. The results for the lateral septum (LS) were significant for main effects and marginally significant for interaction effects. These studies suggest that anticipation of MA is associated with activation of brain regions important in circadian timing, emotional regulation, and decision making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Dopaminergic Drug Effects on Probability Weighting during Risky Decision Making</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine has been associated with risky decision-making, as well as with pathological gambling, a behavioral addiction characterized by excessive risk-taking behavior. However, the specific mechanisms through which dopamine might act to foster risk-taking and pathological gambling remain elusive. Here we test the hypothesis that this might be achieved, in part, via modulation of subjective probability weighting during decision making. Human healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 21) and pathological gamblers (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 16) played a decision-making task involving choices between sure monetary options and risky gambles both in the gain and loss domains. Each participant played the task twice, either under placebo or the dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist sulpiride, in a double-blind counterbalanced design. A prospect theory modelling approach was used to estimate subjective probability weighting and sensitivity to monetary outcomes. Consistent with prospect theory, we found that participants presented a distortion in the subjective weighting of probabilities, i.e., they overweighted low probabilities and underweighted moderate to high probabilities, both in the gain and loss domains. Compared with placebo, sulpiride attenuated this distortion in the gain domain. Across drugs, the groups did not differ in their probability weighting, although gamblers consistently underweighted losing probabilities in the placebo condition. Overall, our results reveal that dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonism modulates the subjective weighting of probabilities in the gain domain, in the direction of more objective, economically rational decision making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Excitatory Neuronal Responses of Ca2+ Transients in Interstitial Cells of Cajal in the Small Intestine</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) regulate smooth muscle excitability and motility in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. ICC in the deep muscular plexus (ICC-DMP) of the small intestine are aligned closely with varicosities of enteric motor neurons and thought to transduce neural responses. ICC-DMP generate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients that activate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activated Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; channels and generate electrophysiological responses. We tested the hypothesis that excitatory neurotransmitters regulate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in ICC-DMP as a means of regulating intestinal muscles. High-resolution confocal microscopy was used to image Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in ICC-DMP within murine small intestinal muscles with cell-specific expression of GCaMP3. Intrinsic nerves were stimulated by electrical field stimulation (EFS). ICC-DMP exhibited ongoing Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients before stimuli were applied. EFS caused initial suppression of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, followed by escape during sustained stimulation, and large increases in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients after cessation of stimulation. Basal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity and the excitatory phases of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses to EFS were inhibited by atropine and neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1) antagonists, but not by NK2 receptor antagonists. Exogenous ACh and substance P (SP) increased Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, atropine and NK1 antagonists decreased Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients. Neurokinins appear to be released spontaneously (tonic excitation) in small intestinal muscles and are the dominant excitatory neurotransmitters. Subcellular regulation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release events in ICC-DMP may be a means by which excitatory neurotransmission organizes intestinal motility patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: BC RNA mislocalization in the fragile X premutation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0091-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Fragile X premutation disorder is caused by CGG triplet repeat expansions in the 5’ UTR of FMR1 mRNA. The question how expanded CGG repeats cause disease is a subject of continuing debate. Our work indicates that CGG-repeat structures compete with regulatory BC1 RNA for access to RNA transport factor hnRNP A2. As a result, BC1 RNA is mislocalized in vivo as its synapto-dendritic presence is severely diminished in brains of CGG-repeat knock-in animals (a premutation mouse model). Lack of BC1 RNA is known to cause seizure activity and cognitive dysfunction (Zhong et al., 2009; Chung et al., 2017; Iacoangeli et al., 2017). Our working hypothesis thus predicted that absence, or significantly reduced presence, of BC1 RNA in synapto-dendritic domains of premutation animal neurons would engender cognate phenotypic alterations. Testing this prediction, we established epileptogenic susceptibility and cognitive impairments as major phenotypic abnormalities of CGG premutation mice. In CA3 hippocampal neurons of such animals, synaptic release of glutamate elicits neuronal hyperexcitability in the form of mGluR-dependent prolonged epileptiform discharges. CGG-repeat knock-in animals are susceptible to sound-induced seizures and are cognitively impaired as revealed in the Attentional Set Shift Task. These phenotypic disturbances occur in young-adult premutation animals, indicating that a neurodevelopmental deficit is an early-initial manifestation of the disorder. The data are consistent with the notion that RNA mislocalization can contribute to pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The fragile X premutation finds expression in two distinct disease manifestations. Young premutation carriers may present with seizure activity and cognitive disturbances while advanced-age patients may experience intention tremor and gait ataxia, a condition known as FXTAS. In contrast to FXTAS, the early-onset phase of fragile X premutation disorder remains poorly understood. We discovered that in brains of CGG-repeat knock-in animals (a premutation mouse model), regulatory BC1 RNA is mislocalized as its presence at synapto-dendritic domains is severely diminished. Lack of BC1 RNA is known to cause epileptogenesis and cognitive dysfunction, and we report that such phenotypic alterations are hallmarks of young premutation animals. The data are congruous with a potential role of RNA localization impairments in pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in a micro-circuit connected by chemical synapses can have their
connectivity affected by the prior activity of the cells. The number of
synapses available for releasing neurotransmitter can be decreased by
repetitive activation through depletion of readily releasable neurotransmitter
(NT), or increased through facilitation, where the probability of release of NT
is increased by prior activation. These competing effects can create a
complicated and subtle range of time dependent connectivity. Here we
investigate the probabilistic properties of facilitation and depression (FD)
for a presynaptic neuron that is receiving a Poisson spike train of input. We
use a model of FD that is parameterized with experimental data from a
hippocampal basket cell and pyramidal cell connection, for fixed frequency
input spikes at frequencies in the range of theta and gamma oscillations. Hence
our results will apply to micro-circuits in the hippocampus that are
responsible for the interaction of theta and gamma rhythms associated with
learning and memory. A control situation is compared with one in which a
pharmaceutical neuromodulator (muscarine) is employed. We apply standard
information theoretic measures such as entropy and mutual information, and find
a closed form approximate expression for the probability distribution of
release probability. We also use techniques that measure the dependence of the
response on the exact history of stimulation the synapse has received, which
uncovers some unexpected differences between control and muscarine-added cases.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We develop a general analytical and numerical framework for estimating intra-
and extra-neurite water fractions and diffusion coefficients, as well as
neurite orientational dispersion, in each imaging voxel. By employing a set of
rotational invariants and their expansion in the powers of diffusion weighting,
we analytically uncover the nontrivial topology of the parameter estimation
landscape, showing that multiple branches of parameters describe the
measurement almost equally well, with only one of them corresponding to the
biophysical reality. A comprehensive acquisition shows that the branch choice
varies across the brain. Our framework reveals hidden degeneracies in MRI
parameter estimation for neuronal tissue, provides microstructural and
orientational maps in the whole brain without constraints or priors, and
connects modern biophysical modeling with clinical MRI.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Baby brains reflect maternal inflammation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baby brains reflect maternal inflammation, Published online: 09 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0134-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0134-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Epidemiology and animal research have shown that the offspring of mothers who experience inflammation during pregnancy are at increased risk for psychopathology. A human study links a mother’s inflammation during pregnancy to her newborn’s functional brain organization and the child’s working memory two years later.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/Ngzyqfknp-A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Machine learning of neuroimaging to diagnose cognitive impairment and dementia: a systematic review and comparative analysis. (arXiv:1804.01961v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01961</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01961</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION: Advanced machine learning methods might help to identify
dementia risk from neuroimaging, but their accuracy to date is unclear.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;METHODS: We systematically reviewed the literature, 2006 to late 2016, for
machine learning studies differentiating healthy ageing through to dementia of
various types, assessing study quality, and comparing accuracy at different
disease boundaries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RESULTS: Of 111 relevant studies, most assessed Alzheimer's disease (AD) vs
healthy controls, used ADNI data, support vector machines and only T1-weighted
sequences. Accuracy was highest for differentiating AD from healthy controls,
and poor for differentiating healthy controls vs MCI vs AD, or MCI converters
vs non-converters. Accuracy increased using combined data types, but not by
data source, sample size or machine learning method.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION: Machine learning does not differentiate clinically-relevant
disease categories yet. More diverse datasets, combinations of different types
of data, and close clinical integration of machine learning would help to
advance the field.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Formin 2 Regulates Lysosomal Degradation of Wnt-Associated β-Catenin in Neural Progenitors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy073</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy073/4962184?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Although neural progenitor proliferation along the ventricular zone is regulated by β-catenin through Wnt signaling, the cytoskeletal mechanisms that regulate expression and localization of these proteins are not well understood. Our prior studies have shown that loss of the actin-binding Filamin A (FlnA) and actin-nucleating protein Formin 2 (Fmn2) impairs endocytosis of low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-related protein 6 (Lrp6), thereby disrupting β-catenin activation, resulting in decreased brain size. Here, we report that activated RhoA-GTPase disengages Fmn2 N- to C-terminal binding to promote Fmn2 activation and redistribution into lysosomal vesicles. Fmn2 colocalizes with β-catenin in lysosomes and promotes its degradation. Further, Fmn2 binds the E3 ligase Smurf2, enhances Smurf2-dependent ubiquitination, and degradation of Dishevelled-2 (Dvl2), thereby initiates β-catenin degradation. Finally, Fmn2 overexpression disrupts neuroepithelial integrity, neuronal migration, and proliferation-phenotypes in E13 mouse embryos, as seen with loss of Fmn2+FlnA function. Conversely, co-expression of Dvl2 with Fmn2 rescues the proliferation defect due to Fmn2 overexpression in mouse embryos. These findings suggest that there is a homeostatic feedback mechanism in the cytoskeletal-dependent regulation of neural proliferation within the cerebral cortex. Upstream, Fmn2 promotes proliferation by stabilizing the Lrp6 receptor, leading to β-catenin activation. Downstream, RhoA-activated Fmn2 promotes lysosomal degradation of Dvl2, leading to β-catenin degradation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Slow-Wave Activity Enhancement to Improve Cognition</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30064-X?rss=yes</guid>

	<description>Slow-wave activity (SWA), and its coupling with other sleep features, reorganizes cortical circuitry, supporting cognition. This raises the question: can cognition be improved through SWA enhancement? SWA enhancement techniques range from behavioral interventions (such as exercise), which have high feasibility but low specificity, to laboratory-based techniques (such as transcranial stimulation), which have high specificity but are less feasible for widespread use. In this review we describe the pathways through which SWA is enhanced.</description>

	<description>Collins, Anastasiades et al. show that prefrontal cortex (PFC) engages multiple thalamic nuclei. Dorsal and ventral thalamus in turn target distinct networks within the PFC. Finally, local connectivity in the PFC completes a loop connecting thalamic input with cortico-thalamic output.</description>

	<description>The neural code of cortical processing remains uncracked; however, it must necessarily rely on faithful signal propagation between cortical areas. In this issue of Neuron, Joglekar et al. (2018) show that strong inter-areal excitation balanced by local inhibition can enable reliable signal propagation in data-constrained network models of macaque cortex.</description>

	<title>Neuron: Complementary Tuning of Na+ and K+ Channel Gating Underlies Fast and Energy-Efficient Action Potentials in GABAergic Interneuron Axons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30145-4?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30145-4?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Hu et al. demonstrate that action potentials in parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic interneuron axons are energetically efficient, which is highly unexpected given their brief duration. High energy efficiency emerges from the combination of fast inactivation of voltage-gated Na+ channels and delayed activation of Kv3 channels in the axon.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: ‘Surface Transplantation’ for Nerve Injury and Repair: The Quest for Minimally Invasive Cell Delivery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30069-9?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30069-9?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Cell transplantation is an ambitious, but arguably realistic, therapy for repair of the nervous system. Cell delivery is a major challenge for clinical translation, especially given the apparently inhibitory astrogliotic environment in degenerated tissue. However, astrogliotic tissue also contains endogenous structural and biochemical cues that can be harnessed for functional repair. Minimizing damage to these cues during cell delivery could enhance cell integration. This theory is supported by studies with an auditory astrocyte scar model, in which cells delivered onto the surface of the damaged nerve were more successfully integrated in the host than those injected into the tissue.</description>

	<description>Deafness causes speech to deteriorate, but whether this deterioration reflects an active or passive process is unclear. Birdsong – a learned vocal behavior that resembles speech in its dependence on auditory feedback – also deteriorates following deafening. In their 2000 paper, Brainard and Doupe showed that, following deafening, birdsong deteriorates through an active process mediated by a cortex–basal ganglia (BG) circuit.</description>

	<description>In the late 1970s, key discoveries in neurophysiology, psychophysics, computer vision, and image processing had reached a tipping point that would shape visual science for decades to come. David Marr and Ellen Hildreth’s ‘Theory of edge detection’, published in 1980, set out to integrate the newly available wealth of data from behavioral, physiological, and computational approaches in a unifying theory. Although their work had wide and enduring ramifications, their most important contribution may have been to consolidate the foundations of the ongoing dialogue between theoretical and empirical vision science.</description>

	<description>Characterizing how network state modulates cortical dynamics and information processing is an important step for understanding the neural code. In 2010, Churchland et al. reported wide experimental evidence showing that spontaneous and stimulus-evoked conditions are two distinct states, as indicated by a marked reduction of neuronal variability after stimulus onset.</description>

	<description>How are different neural cell types generated from progenitor cells? In 1990, Turner et al. used new lineage tracing techniques to show that different cells in the mammalian retina share their progenitor origin. The findings established a key step toward our understanding of how multipotent progenitor cells give rise to complex circuitry in the retina.</description>

	<description>Complement activation products have long been associated with roles in the innate immune system, linking the humoral and cellular responses. However, among their recently described non-inflammatory roles, complement proteins also have multiple emerging novel functions in brain development. Within this context, separate proteins and pathways of complement have carved out physiological niches in the formation, development, and refinement of neurons. They demonstrate actions that are both reminiscent of peripheral immune actions and removed from them.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Prefrontal Oxytocin is Involved in Impairments in Prefrontal Plasticity and Social Memory Following Acute Exposure to High Fat Diet in Juvenile Animals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy070</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy070/4955783?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Juvenility represents a critical developmental phase during which exposure to a high fat diet (HFD) can severely modify cognitive and emotional functioning. The purpose of this study was to address how short and acute exposure to a HFD during juvenility affects social memory recognition and prefrontal long-term potentiation (LTP). As LTP and social memory depend on the neuromodulator oxytocin (OXY) and due to its role in metabolism, we also examined the effects of OXY in mediating HFD-induced alterations in social memory and LTP. Our results show that short exposure to a HFD during juvenility impairs social preference memory and prefrontal LTP. Interestingly, whereas systemic injections of OXY reversed the impairments in HFD-fed animals and impaired LTP and memory in control animals; prefrontal injections of the OXY agonist TGOT reversed the effects in HFD animals without affecting control animals. Exposure to HFD was associated with a reduction in the levels of OXY in the prefrontal compared to control animals. Interestingly, the restoration of social memory by TGOT in HFD animals was also associated with normalization of OXY in the prefrontal. These results point to a role that prefrontal OXY has in mediating the effects of HFD on memory and plasticity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Working Memory Load Modulates Neuronal Coupling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy065</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy065/4955775?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;There is a severe limitation in the number of items that can be held in working memory. However, the neurophysiological limits remain unknown. We asked whether the capacity limit might be explained by differences in neuronal coupling. We developed a theoretical model based on Predictive Coding and used it to analyze Cross Spectral Density data from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), frontal eye fields (FEF), and lateral intraparietal area (LIP). Monkeys performed a change detection task. The number of objects that had to be remembered (memory load) was varied (1–3 objects in the same visual hemifield). Changes in memory load changed the connectivity in the PFC–FEF–LIP network. Feedback (top-down) coupling broke down when the number of objects exceeded cognitive capacity. Thus, impaired behavioral performance coincided with a break-down of Prediction signals. This provides new insights into the neuronal underpinnings of cognitive capacity and how coupling in a distributed working memory network is affected by memory load.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Regional GABA Concentrations Modulate Inter-network Resting-state Functional Connectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy059</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy059/4955774?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Coordinated activity within and differential activity between large-scale neuronal networks such as the default mode network (DMN) and the control network (CN) is a critical feature of brain organization. The CN usually exhibits activations in response to cognitive tasks while the DMN shows deactivations; in addition, activity between the two networks is anti-correlated at rest. To address this issue, we used functional MRI to measure whole-brain BOLD signal during resting-state and task-evoked conditions, and MR spectroscopy (MRS) to quantify GABA and glutamate concentrations, in nodes within the DMN and CN (MPFC and DLPFC, respectively) in 19 healthy individuals at 3 Tesla. We found that GABA concentrations in the MPFC were significantly associated with DMN deactivation during a working memory task and with anti-correlation between DMN and CN at rest and during task performance, while GABA concentrations in the DLPFC weakly modulated DMN–CN anti-correlation in the opposite direction. Highlighting specificity, glutamate played a less significant role related to brain activity. These findings indicate that GABA in the MPFC is potentially involved in orchestrating between-network brain activity at rest and during task performance.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>The physiology of the central nervous system (CNS) is built on a foundation of connection, integration, and the exchange of complex information among brain cells. Emerging evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key players in the intercellular communication that underlies physiological processes such as synaptic plasticity and the maintenance of myelination. Furthermore, upon injury to the CNS, EVs may propagate inflammation across the blood–brain barrier and beyond, and also appear to mediate neuroprotection and modulate regenerative processes.</description>
