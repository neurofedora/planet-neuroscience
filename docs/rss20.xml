	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytochrome &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; oxidase (COX) deficiency is a major mitochondrial respiratory chain defect that has vast genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. This study aims to identify novel causative genes of COX deficiency with only striated muscle–specific symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole exome sequencing was performed in 2 unrelated individuals who were diagnosed with congenital myopathy and presented COX deficiency in muscle pathology. We assessed the &lt;i&gt;COX6A2&lt;/i&gt; variants using measurements of enzymatic activities and assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in the samples from the patients and knockout mice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both patients presented muscle weakness and hypotonia in 4 limbs along with facial muscle weakness. One patient had cardiomyopathy. Neither patient exhibited involvement from other organs. Whole exome sequencing identified biallelic missense variants in &lt;i&gt;COX6A2&lt;/i&gt;, which is expressed only in the skeletal muscle and heart. The variants detected were homozygous c.117C &amp;gt; A (p.Ser39Arg) and compound heterozygous c.117C &amp;gt; A (p.Ser39Arg) and c.127T &amp;gt; C (p.Cys43Arg). We found specific reductions in complex IV activities in the skeletal muscle of both individuals. Assembly of complex IV and its supercomplex formation were impaired in the muscle.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study indicates that biallelic variants in &lt;i&gt;COX6A2&lt;/i&gt; cause a striated muscle–specific form of COX deficiency. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Selection starts in the primary visual cortex (V1), which creates a bottom-up saliency map to guide the fovea to selected visual locations via gaze shifts. This motivates a new framework that views vision as consisting of encoding, selection, and decoding stages, placing selection on center stage. It suggests a massive loss of non-selected information from V1 downstream along the visual pathway. Hence, feedback from downstream visual cortical areas to V1 for better decoding (recognition), through analysis-by-synthesis, should query for additional information and be mainly directed at the foveal region. Accordingly, non-foveal vision is not only poorer in spatial resolution, but also more susceptible to many illusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Ideas are Not Replicators but Minds Are. (arXiv:q-bio/0402002v2 [q-bio.PE] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An idea is not a replicator because it does not consist of coded
self-assembly instructions. It may retain structure as it passes from one
individual to another, but does not replicate it. The cultural replicator is
not an idea but an associatively-structured network of them that together form
an internal model of the world, or worldview. A worldview is a primitive,
uncoded replicator, like the autocatalytic sets of polymers widely believed to
be the earliest form of life. Primitive replicators generate self-similar
structure, but because the process happens in a piecemeal manner, through
bottom-up interactions rather than a top-down code, they replicate with low
fidelity, and acquired characteristics are inherited. Just as polymers catalyze
reactions that generate other polymers, the retrieval of an item from memory
can in turn trigger other items, thus cross-linking memories, ideas, and
concepts into an integrated conceptual structure. Worldviews evolve idea by
idea, largely through social exchange. An idea participates in the evolution of
culture by revealing certain aspects of the worldview that generated it,
thereby affecting the worldviews of those exposed to it. If an idea influences
seemingly unrelated fields this does not mean that separate cultural lineages
are contaminating one another, because it is worldviews, not ideas, that are
the basic unit of cultural evolution.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper I review the submission to the Explaining the Human Visual
Brain Challenge 2019 in both the fMRI and MEG tracks. The goal was to construct
neural network features which generate the so-called representational
dissimilarity matrix (RDM) which is most similar to the one extracted from fMRI
and MEG data upon viewing a set of images. I review exploring the optimal
granularity of the receptive field, a construction of intermediate surrogate
features using Multidimensional Scaling and modelling them using neural network
features. I also point out some peculiarities of the RDM construction which
have to be taken into account.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;GABAergic interneurons can be subdivided into three subclasses: parvalbumin
positive (PV), somatostatin positive (SOM) and serotonin positive neurons. With
principal cells (PCs) they form complex networks. We examine PCs and PV
responses in mouse anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) and barrel cortex (S1)
upon PV photostimulation in vivo. In layer 5, the PV response is paradoxical:
photoexcitation reduces their activity. This is not the case in ALM layer 2/3.
We combine analytical calculations and numerical simulations to investigate how
these results constrain the architecture. Two-population models cannot account
for the results. Networks with three inhibitory populations and V1-like
architecture account for the data in ALM layer 2/3. Our data in layer 5 can be
accounted for if SOM neurons receive inputs only from PCs and PV neurons. In
both four-population models, the paradoxical effect implies not too strong
recurrent excitation. It is not evidence for stabilization by inhibition.

of the minimal self, namely, body ownership and sense of agency, and also
discuss robotics research investigating and developing these concepts in
artificial agents. We investigate possible avenues for expanding the research

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The subjective experience of consciousness is at once familiar and yet deeply
mysterious. Strategies exploring the top-down mechanisms of conscious thought
within the human brain have been unable to produce a generalized explanatory
theory that scales through evolution and can be applied to artificial systems.
Information Flow Theory (IFT) provides a novel framework for understanding both
the development and nature of consciousness in any system capable of processing
information. In prioritizing the direction of information flow over information
computation, IFT produces a range of unexpected predictions. The purpose of
this manuscript is to introduce the basic concepts of IFT and explore the
manifold implications regarding artificial intelligence, superhuman
consciousness, and our basic perception of reality.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00694</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Afterimages result from a prolonged exposure to still visual stimuli. They
are best detectable when viewed against uniform backgrounds and can persist for
multiple seconds. Consequently, the dynamics of afterimages appears to be slow
by their very nature. To the contrary, we report here that about 50% of an
afterimage intensity can be erased rapidly--within less than a second. The
prerequisite is that subjects view a rich visual content to erase the
afterimage; fast erasure of afterimages does not occur if subjects view a blank
screen. Moreover, we find evidence that fast removal of afterimages is a skill
learned with practice as our subjects were always more effective in cleaning up
afterimages in later parts of the experiment. These results can be explained by
a tri-level hierarchy of adaptive mechanisms, as has been proposed by the
theory of practopoiesis.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The discovery of neural plasticity has proved that throughout the life of a
human being, the brain reorganizes itself through forming new neural
connections. The formation of new neural connections are achieved through the
brain's effort to adapt to new environments or to changes in the existing
environment. Despite the realization of neural plasticity, there is a lack of
understanding the probability of neural plasticity occurring given some event.
Using ordinary differential equations, neural firing equations and spike-train
statistics, we show how an additive short-term memory (STM) equation can be
formulated to approach the computation of neural plasticity. We then show how
the additive STM equation can be used for probabilistic inference in computable
neural plasticity, and the computation of probabilistic neural plasticity. We
will also provide a brief introduction to the theory of probabilistic neural
plasticity and conclude with showing how it can be applied to multiple
disciplines such as behavioural science, machine learning, and psychiatry.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Latent dynamics discovery is challenging in extracting complex dynamics from
high-dimensional noisy neural data. Many dimensionality reduction methods have
been widely adopted to extract low-dimensional, smooth and time-evolving latent
trajectories. However, simple state transition structures, linear embedding
assumptions, or inflexible inference networks impede the accurate recovery of
dynamic portraits. In this paper, we propose a novel latent dynamic model that
is capable of capturing nonlinear, non-Markovian, long short-term
time-dependent dynamics via recurrent neural networks and tackling complex
nonlinear embedding via non-parametric Gaussian process. Due to the complexity
and intractability of the model and its inference, we also provide a powerful
inference network with bi-directional long short-term memory networks that
encode both past and future information into posterior distributions. In the
experiment, we show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods
in reconstructing insightful latent dynamics from both simulated and
experimental neural datasets with either Gaussian or Poisson observations,
especially in the low-sample scenario. Our codes and additional materials are
available at https://github.com/sheqi/GP-RNN_UAI2019.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep predictive coding networks are neuroscience-inspired unsupervised
learning models that learn to predict future sensory states. We build upon the
PredNet implementation by Lotter, Kreiman, and Cox (2016) to investigate if
predictive coding representations are useful to predict brain activity in the
visual cortex. We use representational similarity analysis (RSA) to compare
PredNet representations to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from the Algonauts Project. In contrast to
previous findings in the literature (Khaligh-Razavi &amp;amp;Kriegeskorte, 2014), we
report empirical data suggesting that unsupervised models trained to predict
frames of videos may outperform supervised image classification baselines. Our
best submission achieves an average noise normalized score of 16.67% and 27.67%
on the fMRI and MEG tracks of the Algonauts Challenge.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With the rising societal demand for more information-processing capacity with
lower power consumption, alternative architectures inspired by the parallelism
and robustness of the human brain have recently emerged as possible solutions.
In particular, spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a bio-realistic approach,
relying on pulses analogous to action potentials as units of information. While
software encoded networks provide flexibility and precision, they are often
computationally expensive. As a result, hardware SNNs based on the spiking
dynamics of a device or circuit represent an increasingly appealing direction.
Here, we propose to use superconducting nanowires as a platform for the
development of an artificial neuron. Building on an architecture first proposed
for Josephson junctions, we rely on the intrinsic nonlinearity of two coupled
nanowires to generate spiking behavior, and use electrothermal circuit
simulations to demonstrate that the nanowire neuron reproduces multiple
characteristics of biological neurons. Furthermore, by harnessing the
nonlinearity of the superconducting nanowire's inductance, we develop a design
for a variable inductive synapse capable of both excitatory and inhibitory
control. We demonstrate that this synapse design supports direct fanout, a
feature that has been difficult to achieve in other superconducting
architectures, and that the nanowire neuron's nominal energy performance is
competitive with that of current technologies.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Coexistence of fast and slow gamma oscillations in one population of inhibitory spiking neurons. (arXiv:1907.00230v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00230</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00230</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Oscillations are a hallmark of neural population activity in various brain
regions with a spectrum covering a wide range of frequencies. Within this
spectrum gamma oscillations have received particular attention due to their
ubiquitous nature and to their correlation with higher brain functions.
Recently, it has been reported that gamma oscillations in the hippocampus of
behaving rodents are segregated in two distinct frequency bands: slow and fast.
These two gamma rhythms correspond to dfferent states of the network, but their
origin has been not yet clarified. Here, we show theoretically and numerically
that a single inhibitory population can give rise to coexisting slow and fast
gamma rhythms corresponding to collective oscillations of a balanced spiking
network. The slow and fast gamma rhythms are generated via two different
mechanisms: the fast one being driven by the coordinated tonic neural firing
and the slow one by endogenous fluctuations due to irregular neural activity.
We show that almost instantaneous stimulations can switch the collective gamma
oscillations from slow to fast and vice versa. Furthermore, to make a closer
contact with the experimental observations, we consider the modulation of the
gamma rhythms induced by a slower (theta) rhythm driving the network dynamics.
In this context, depending on the strength of the forcing, we observe
phase-amplitude and phase-phase coupling between the fast and slow gamma
oscillations and the theta forcing. Phase-phase coupling reveals different
theta-phases preferences for the two coexisting gamma rhythms.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00070</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We use Generalized Beta Prime distribution, also known as GB2, for fitting
response time distributions. This distribution, characterized by one scale and
three shape parameters, is incredibly flexible in that it can mimic behavior of
many other distributions. GB2 exhibits power-law behavior at both front and
tail ends and is a steady-state distribution of a simple stochastic
differential equation. We apply GB2 in contrast studies between two distinct
groups -- in this case children with dyslexia and a control group -- and show
that it provides superior fitting. We compare aggregate response time
distributions of the two groups for scale and shape differences (including
several scale-independent measures of variability, such as Hoover index), which
may in turn reflect on cognitive dynamics differences. In this approach,
response time distribution of an individual can be considered as a random
variate of that individual's group distribution.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06574</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking neural networks (SNNs) possess energy-efficient potential due to
event-based computation. However, supervised training of SNNs remains a
challenge as spike activities are non-differentiable. Previous SNNs training
methods can be generally categorized into two basic classes, i.e.,
backpropagation-like training methods and plasticity-based learning methods.
The former methods are dependent on energy-inefficient real-valued computation
and non-local transmission, as also required in artificial neural networks
(ANNs), whereas the latter are either considered to be biologically implausible
or exhibit poor performance. Hence, biologically plausible (bio-plausible)
high-performance supervised learning (SL) methods for SNNs remain deficient. In
this paper, we proposed a novel bio-plausible SNN model for SL based on the
symmetric spike-timing dependent plasticity (sym-STDP) rule found in
neuroscience. By combining the sym-STDP rule with bio-plausible synaptic
scaling and intrinsic plasticity of the dynamic threshold, our SNN model
implemented SL well and achieved good performance in the benchmark recognition
task (MNIST dataset). To reveal the underlying mechanism of our SL model, we
visualized both layer-based activities and synaptic weights using the
t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method after training and
found that they were well clustered, thereby demonstrating excellent
classification ability. Furthermore, to verify the robustness of our model, we
trained it on another more realistic dataset (Fashion-MNIST), which also showed
good performance. As the learning rules were bio-plausible and based purely on
local spike events, our model could be easily applied to neuromorphic hardware
for online training and may be helpful for understanding SL information
processing at the synaptic level in biological neural systems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Detecting and segmenting salient objects from natural scenes, often referred
to as salient object detection, has attracted great interest in computer
vision. While many models have been proposed and several applications have
emerged, a deep understanding of achievements and issues remains lacking. We
aim to provide a comprehensive review of recent progress in salient object
detection and situate this field among other closely related areas such as
generic scene segmentation, object proposal generation, and saliency for
fixation prediction. Covering 228 publications, we survey i) roots, key
concepts, and tasks, ii) core techniques and main modeling trends, and iii)
datasets and evaluation metrics for salient object detection. We also discuss
open problems such as evaluation metrics and dataset bias in model performance,
and suggest future research directions.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.4744</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The paper uses the SCOP theory of concepts to model the role of environmental
context on three levels of entrepreneurial opportunity: idea generation, idea
development, and entrepreneurial decision. The role of contextual-fit in the
generation and development of ideas is modeled as the collapse of their
superposition state into one of the potential states that composes this
superposition. The projection of this collapsed state on the socio-economic
basis results in interference of the developed idea with the perceptions of the
supporting community, undergoing an eventual collapse for an entrepreneurial
decision that reflects the shared vision of its stakeholders. The developed
idea may continue to evolve due to continuous or discontinuous changes in the
environment. The model offers unique insights into the effects of external
influences on entrepreneurial decisions.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It has been proposed that, since the origin of life and the ensuing evolution
of biological species, a second evolutionary process has appeared on our
planet. It is the evolution of culture-e.g., ideas, beliefs, and artifacts.
Does culture evolve in the same genuine sense as biological life? And if so,
does it evolve through natural selection, or by some other means? Why does no
other species remotely approach the degree of cultural complexity of humans?
These questions lie at the foundation of who we are and what makes our lives
meaningful. Although much research has been done on how selective pressures
operating at the biological level affect cognition and culture, little research
has focused on culture as an evolutionary process in its own right. Like
biological forms, cultural forms-ideas, attitudes, artifacts, mannerisms,
etc.-incrementally adapt to the constraints and affordances of their
environment through descent with modification. In some respects culture appears
to be Darwinian, i.e., a process of differential replication and selection
amongst randomly generated variants. This suggests that knowledge of biological
evolution can be put to use to gain insight into culture. However, attempts to
apply Darwinian theory to culture have not yielded the kind of unifying
framework for the social sciences that it provided for the biological sciences,
largely because of the nonrandom manner in which the mind-the hub of cultural
change-generates and assimilates novelty. This paper investigates how and when
humans became capable of supporting culture, and what previously held it back,
focusing on how we attained the creative powers we now possess. To invent in
the strategic, intuitive manner characteristic of humans requires a cognitive
architecture that supports the capacity to spontaneously adapt concepts to new
circumstances and merge them together to conceptualize new situations.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: An Analysis of the 'Blind Variation and Selective Retention' Theory of Creativity. (arXiv:1309.4692v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Picasso's Guernica sketches continue to provide a fruitful testing ground for
examining and assessing the Blind Variation Selective Retention (BVSR) theory
of creativity. Nonmonotonicity--e.g. as indicated by a lack of similarity of
successive sketches--is not evidence of a selectionist process; Darwin's theory
explains adaptive change, not nonmonotonicity. Although the notion of blindness
originally implied randomness, it now encompasses phenomena that bias idea
generation, e.g. the influence of remote associations on sketch ideas. However,
for a selectionist framework is to be applicable, such biases must be
negligible, otherwise evolutionary change is attributed to those biases, not to
selection. The notion of 'variants' should not be applied to creativity;
without a mechanism of inheritance, there is no basis upon which to delineate,
for example, which sketch ideas are or are not variants of a given sketch idea.
The notion of selective retention is also problematic. Selection provides an
explanation when acquired change is not transmitted; it cannot apply to
Picasso's painting (or other creative acts) because his ideas acquired
modifications as he thought them through that were incorporated into paintings
and viewed by others. The generation of one sketch affects the criteria by
which the next is judged, so sequentially generated sketches cannot be treated
as members of a generation, and selected amongst. Although BVSR is
inappropriate as a theoretical framework for creativity, exploring to what
extent selectionism explains the generation of not just biological form but
masterpieces such as Picasso's Guernica is useful for gaining insight into
creativity.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This chapter begins by outlining a promising, new theoretical framework for
the process by which human culture evolves inspired by the views of complexity
theorists on the problem of how life began. Elements of culture, like species,
evolve over time; that is, they exhibit cumulative change that is adaptive in
nature. By studying how biological evolution got started, we gain insight into
not just the specifics of biological evolution, but also general insights into
the initiation of any evolutionary process that may be applicable to culture.
We then explore the implications of this new framework for culture on the
transformative processes of individuals. Specifically, we will address what
this emerging perspective on cultural evolution implies for to go about
attaining a sustainable worldview; that is, a web of habits, understandings,
and ways of approaching situations that is conducive to the development of a
sustainable world.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper reviews and clarifies five misunderstandings about cultural
evolution identified by Henrich, Boyd, and Richerson (2008). First, cultural
representations are neither discrete nor continuous; they are distributed
across neurons that respond to microfeatures. This enables associations to be
made, and cultural change to be generated. Second, 'replicator dynamics' do not
ensure natural selection. The replicator notion does not capture the
distinction between actively interpreted self-assembly code and passively
copied self-description, which leads to a fundamental principle of natural
selection: inherited information is transmitted, whereas acquired information
is not. Third, this principle is violated in culture by the ubiquity of
acquired change. Moreover, biased transmission is less important to culture
than the creative processes by which novelty is generated. Fourth, there is no
objective basis for determining cultural fitness. Fifth, the necessity of
randomness is discussed. It is concluded that natural selection is
inappropriate as an explanatory framework for culture.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Recognizability of Individual Creative Styles Within and Across Domains. (arXiv:1309.2615v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a set of studies that tested the hypothesis that creative style is
recognizable within and across domains. Art students were shown two sets of
paintings, the first by five famous artists and the second by their art student
peers. For both sets, they guessed the creators of the works at above-chance
levels. In a similar study, creative writing students guessed at above-chance
levels which passages were written by which of five famous writers, and which
passages were written by which of their writing student peers. When creative
writing students were asked to produce works of art, they guessed at
above-chance levels which of their peers produced which artwork. Finally, art
students who were familiar with each other's paintings guessed at above-chance
levels which of their peers produced which non-painting artwork. The findings
support the hypothesis that creative styles are recognizable not just within
but also across domains. We suggest this is because all of an individual's
creative outputs are expressions of a particular underlying uniquely structured
self-organizing internal model of the world.

	<description>The application of super-resolution optical microscopy to investigating synaptic structures has revealed a highly heterogeneous and variable intra-synaptic organization. Dense subsynaptic protein assemblies named subsynaptic domains or SSDs have been proposed as structural units that regulate the efficacy of neuronal transmission. However, an in-depth characterization of subsynaptic domains has been hampered by technical limitations of super-resolution microscopy of synapses, namely the stochasticity of the signals during the imaging procedures and the variability of the synaptic structures. Here, we synthetize the available evidence for the existence of subsynaptic domains at central synapses, as well as the possible functional relevance of SSDs. In particular, we discuss the possible regulation of co-transmission at mixed inhibitory synapses as a consequence of the subsynaptic distribution of glycine receptors (GlyRs) and GABAA receptors (GABAARs).</description>

	<description>Methamphetamine abuse has become a serious public health problem. However, effective treatment for methamphetamine addiction still remains elusive, especially considering its high rate of relapse after treatment. A conditioned stimulus (CS) memory retrieval-extinction procedure has been demonstrated to decrease reinstatement of cocaine, heroin and alcohol seeking in rats, and to reduce cue-induced craving in heroin and nicotine addicts. The goal of the present study was to explore the effect of CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure on methamphetamine seeking in rats and the underlying mechanisms. We found that daily presenting extinction training within reconsolidation time window attenuated subsequent drug priming-induced reinstatement, spontaneous recovery, and renewal of methamphetamine seeking. We also found retrieval of methamphetamine-associated memories induced neuronal activation in basolateral amygdala (BLA), while presenting extinction within the time window of reconsolidation abolished the neuronal activation in BLA. These results indicated that the CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure could prevent reconsolidation of methamphetamine memory traces in BLA and subsequent methamphetamine craving and relapse.</description>

	<description>Extracellular vesicles (EVs), like exosomes, play a critical role in physiological processes, including synaptic transmission and nerve regeneration. However, exosomes in particular can also contribute to the development of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, and prion diseases. All of these disorders are characterized by protein aggregation and deposition in specific regions of the brain. Several lines of evidence indicate that protein in exosomes is released from affected neurons and propagated along neuroanatomically connected regions of the brain, thus spreading the neurodegenerative disease. Also, different cell types contribute to the progression of tauopathy, such as microglia.  Several groups have reported tau release via exosomes by cultured neurons or cells overexpressing human tau. Although the exact mechanisms underlying the propagation of protein aggregates are not fully understood, recent findings have implicated EVs in this process. The AD brain has two hallmarks, namely the presence of amyloid--containing plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the latter formed by hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Both amyloid peptide and tau protein are present in specific exosomes. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of exosomes in the pathology of AD, with a special focus on tau protein.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Parkinson's Disease Detection Using Isosurfaces-Based Features and Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

	<description>Computer aided diagnosis systems based on brain imaging are an important tool to assist in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, whose ultimate goal is the detection by automatic recognizing of patterns that characterize the disease. In recent times Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have proved to be amazingly useful for that task. The drawback, however, is that 3D brain images contain a huge amount of information that leads to complex CNN architectures. When these architectures become too complex, classification performances often degrades because the limitations of the training algorithm and overfitting. Thus, this paper proposes the use of isosurfaces as a way to reduce such amount of data while keeping the most relevant information. These isosurfaces are then used to implement a classification system which uses two of the most well-known CNN architectures, LeNet and AlexNet, to classify DaTScan images with an average accuracy of 95.1% and AUC=97%, obtaining comparable (slightly better) values to those obtained for most of the recently proposed systems. It can be concluded therefore that the computation of isosurfaces reduces the complexity of the inputs significantly, resulting in high classification accuracies with reduced computational burden.</description>

	<description>Introduction: Striatal dopamine depletion disrupts basal ganglia function and causes Parkinson´s disease (PD). The pathophysiology of the dopamine-dependent relationship between basal ganglia signalling and motor control, however, is not fully understood. We obtained simultaneous recordings of local field potentials (LFP) from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and electromyograms (EMG) in patients with PD to investigate the impact of dopaminergic state and movement on long-range beta functional connectivity between basal ganglia and lower motor neurons. 
Methods: 8 PD patients were investigated three months after implantation of a DBS-system capable of recording LFPs via chronically-implanted leads (Medtronic, ACTIVA PC + S®). We analysed STN spectral power and its coherence with EMG in the context of two different movement paradigms (tonic wrist extension versus alternating wrist extension and flexion) and the effect of L-Dopa intake using an unbiased data-driven approach to determine regions of interest (ROI). 
Results Two ROIs capturing prominent coherence within a grand average coherogram were identified. A trend of a dopamine effect was observed for the first ROI (50–150 ms after movement start) with higher STN-EMG coherence in medicated patients. Concerning the second ROI (300–500 ms after movement start), an interaction effect of L-Dopa medication and movement task was observed with higher coherence in the isometric contraction task compared to alternating movements in the medication ON state, a pattern which was reversed in L-Dopa OFF.
Discussion: L-Dopa medication may normalize functional connectivity between remote structures of the motor system with increased upper beta coherence reflecting a physiological restriction of the amount of information conveyed between remote structures. This may be necessary to maintain simple movements like isometric contraction. Our study adds dynamic properties to the complex interplay between STN spectral beta power and the nucleus’ functional connectivity to remote structures of the motor system as a function of movement and dopaminergic state. This may help to identify markers of neuronal activity relevant for more individualised programming of DBS therapy.</description>

	<description>Approximately 3% of the world population suffers from depression, which is one of the most common form of mental disorder. Recent findings suggest that an interaction between the nervous system and immune system might be behind the pathophysiology of various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including depression. Neuropeptides have been shown to play a major role in mediating response to stress and inducing immune activation or suppression. Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is a major regulator of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis response. CRF is a stress-related neuropeptide whose dysregulation has been associated with depression. In this review, we summarized the role of CRF in the neuroimmune mechanisms of depression, and the potential therapeutic effects of Chinese herbal medicines as well as other agents. Studying the network of CRF and immune responses will help to enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of depression. Additionally, targeting this important network may aid in developing novel treatments for this debilitating psychiatric disorder.</description>

	<description>Demyelinated lesions of the central nervous system are characteristic for multiple sclerosis (MS). Remyelination is not very effective, particular at later stages of the disease, which results in a chronic neurodegenerative character with worsening of symptoms. Previously, we have shown that the enzyme Tissue Transglutaminase (TG2) is downregulated upon differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into myelin-forming oligodendrocytes and that TG2 knock-out mice lag behind in remyelination after cuprizone-induced demyelination. Here, we examined whether astrocytic or oligodendroglial TG2 affects OPCs in a cell-specific manner to modulate their differentiation, and therefore myelination. Our findings indicate that human TG2-expressing astrocytes did not modulate OPC differentiation and myelination. In contrast, persistent TG2 expression upon OPC maturation or exogenously added recombinant TG2 accelerated OPC differentiation and myelin membrane formation. Continuous exposure of recombinant TG2 to OPCs at different consecutive developmental stages, however, decreased OPC differentiation and myelin membrane formation, while it enhanced myelination in dorsal root ganglion neuron-OPC co-cultures. In MS lesions, TG2 is absent in OPCs, while human OPCs show TG2 immunoreactivity during brain development. Exposure to the MS-relevant pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ increased TG2 expression in OPCs and prolonged expression of endogenous TG2 upon differentiation. However, despite the increased TG2 levels, OPC maturation was not accelerated, indicating that TG2-mediated OPC differentiation may be counteracted by other pathways. Together, our data show that TG2, either endogenously expressed, or exogenously supplied to OPCs, accelerates early OPC differentiation. A better understanding of the role of TG2 in the OPC differentiation process during MS is of therapeutic interest to overcome remyelination failure.</description>

	<description>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has long been connected to the development of tissue lesion following ischemic stroke. Contradictory findings either situate VEGF as a promoter of large infarct volumes or as a potential attenuator of damage due to its well documented neuroprotective capability. The core of this discrepancy mostly lies on the substantial number of pleiotropic functions driven by VEGF. Mechanistically, these effects are activated through several VEGF receptors for which various closely related ligands exist. Here, we tested in an experimental model of stroke how the differential activation of VEGF receptors 1 and 2 would modify functional and histological outcomes in the acute phase post-ischemia. We also assessed whether VEGF-mediated responses would involve the modulation of inflammatory mechanisms and how this trophic factor acted specifically on neuronal receptors. We produced ischemic infarcts in adult rats by transiently occluding the middle cerebral artery and induced the pharmacological inhibition of VEGF receptors by i.c.v. administration of the specific VEGFR2 inhibitor SU1498 and the pan-VEGFR blocker Axitinib. We evaluated the neurological performance of animals at 24 h following stroke and the occurrence of brain infarctions analyzed at the gross metabolic and neuronal viability levels. We also assessed the induction of peripheral pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood and assessed the polarization of activated microglia. Finally, we studied the direct involvement of cortical neuronal receptors for VEGF with in vitro assays of excitotoxic damage. Preferential VEGFR1 activation by the endogenous ligand promotes neuronal protection and prevents the presentation of large volume infarcts that highly correlate with neurological performance, while the concomitant activation of VEGFR2 reduces this effect, even in the presence of exogenous ligand. This process partially involves the polarization of microglia to the state M2. At the cellular level, neurons also responded better to the preferential activation of VEGFR1 when challenged to N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced excitotoxicity. Endogenous activation of VEGFR2 hinders the neuroprotective mechanisms mediated by the activation of VEGFR1. The selective modulation of these concurrent processes might enable the development of therapeutic approaches that target specific VEGFR1-mediated signaling during the acute phase post-stroke.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Post-mortem 11.7 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging vs. Polarized Light Imaging Microscopy to Measure the Angle and Orientation of Dorsal Root Afferents in the Human Cervical Dorsal Root Entry Zone</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00066</guid>

	<description>BACKGROUND: Destruction of the afferents by dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) surgery may be an effective treatment of intractable neuropathic pain, though it remains a high risk surgical intervention. Potential complications due to the lesioning of structures within the cervical spinal cord other than the DREZ can be minimized by accurate knowledge of the optimal insertion angle (i.e., the angle between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus). The employed insertion angle has based on measurements between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus on post-mortem transverse slices. However, new, more sophisticated imaging techniques are currently available and are thought to yield higher spatial resolution and more accurate images. 
OBEJCTIVE: This paper measures the angle between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus on 11.7T post-mortem magnetic resonance images and compares these findings with polarized light imaging (PLI) microscopy images of the same specimens in order to quantify fiber orientation within the DREZ. 
METHODS: To visualize the anatomy of the cervical DREZ, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), probabilistic tractography, and polarized light imaging (PLI)) were performed on 3 post-mortem human cervical spinal cords at level C5-C6. The MR data was used to measure the angle between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus. MR images were complemented by probabilistic tractography results. Then, the orientation of fibers within the DREZ was quantified by use of PLI microscopy. 
RESULTS: Median angle between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus, as measured on MR-images, was found to be 40.1° (ranging from 34.2-49.1°) and 39.8°  (ranging from 31.1-47.8°) in the left and right hemicord, respectively. Median fiber orientation within the DREZ, as quantified by PLI, was 28.5° (ranging from 12.0-44.3°) and 27.7° (ranging from 8.5-38.1°) in the left and right hemicord, respectively. 
CONCLUSION: Our study, which provides an improved understanding of the anatomy of the DREZ, the angle between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus and the median fiber orientation within the DREZ, could contribute to safer DREZ-lesioning surgery to treat chronic neuropathic pain in the future.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cerebral Blood Flow in Community-Based Older Twins Is Moderately Heritable: An Arterial Spin Labeling Perfusion Imaging Study</title>

	<description>Adequate cerebral blood flow (CBF) is necessary to maintain brain metabolism and function. Arterial spin labelling (ASL) is an emerging MRI technique offering a non-invasive and reliable quantification of CBF. The genetic basis of CBF has not been well documented, and one approach to investigate this is to examine its heritability. The current study aimed to examine the heritability of CBF using ASL data from a cohort of community-dwelling older twins (41 monozygotic and 25 dizygotic twin pairs; age range, 65-93 years; 56.4% female). Results showed that the cortex had higher CBF than subcortical grey matter (GM) regions, and CBF in the GM regions of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territory was lower than that of the middle (MCA) and posterior (PCA) cerebral arteries. After accounting for the effects of age, sex and scanner, moderate heritability was identified for global CBF (h2 = 0.611; 95% CI = 0.380-0.761), as well as for cortical and subcortical GM and the GM in the major arterial territories (h2 = 0.500-0.612). Strong genetic correlations were found between CBF in subcortical and cortical GM regions, as well as among the three arterial territories (ACA, MCA, PCA), suggesting a largely convergent genetic control for the CBF in brain GM. The moderate heritability of CBF warrants future investigations to uncover the genetic variants and genes that regulate CBF.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Differential Associations Between Distinct Components of Cognitive Function and Mobility: Implications for Understanding Aging, Turning and Dual-Task Walking</title>

	<description>Objective: Cognition and mobility are interrelated. However, this association can be impacted by the specific facets of cognition and mobility that are measured, and further by the different task conditions, single- versus dual-task walking, under which these associations are evaluated. Systematically studying the multiple facets of cognitive-mobility associations under both the task conditions is critical because both cognition and mobility change with age and pose significant risks associated with falls, morbidity, and disability. Methods: Using a cross-sectional, prospective study design, data from 124 healthy adults (mean age (SD) = 61.51 (11.90); mean education (SD) = 15.94 (2.18)) was collected. A comprehensive battery of cognitive tests was administered, and gait was assessed using a small, lightweight, three-axis accelerometer with a gyroscope. Analytical Plan: Data was transformed, and only relatively strong relationships survived after strict statistical criteria adjusting for multiple comparisons was applied. Spearman rho correlation coefficients were used to examine the matrix of correlations between the cognitive-motor variables while adjusting for age and gender. Results: Executive functions, processing speed, and language were associated with distinct facets of variability, pace, asymmetry, especially under the dual-task walking condition. Both turns and transitions were also associated with cognition during the Timed Up and Go task. Conclusion: Our results extend converging evidence for the involvement of executive functions and processing speed in specific aspects of mobility, along with the role of language. The study has important implications for aging in terms of both assessment and rehabilitation of cognition and gait as well as for the emerging dual-tasking theories and the role of the neural pathways involved in mobility.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Prefrontal Cortex Activation During Dual Task With Increasing Cognitive Load in Subacute Stroke Patients: A Pilot Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00160</guid>

	<description>Stroke patients often exhibit difficulties performing a cognitive task while walking, defined as a dual task (DT). Their prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity is higher in DT than in single task (ST). The effects of an increasing load on PFC activity during DT in subacute stroke patients remains unexplored. Our objective was to assess the effects of N-back tasks (low/high load) on cerebral activity, gait parameters and cognitive performances. Eleven subacute stroke patients (days post-stroke 45.8±31.6) participated in this study (71.4±10 yrs, BMI 26.7±4.8 kg.m-2, Barthel index 81.8±11.0). Patients completed a STwalk, and 4 conditions with 1-back (low load) and 2-back (high load): STlow, SThigh, DTlow and DThigh. Overground walking was performed at a comfortable pace and -N-back conditions were carried out verbally. Both gait (speed, stride variability) and cognitive (rate of correct answers) performances were recorded. Changes in PFC oxyhemoglobin (∆O2Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (∆HHb) were measured by functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Results showed an increase of ∆O2Hb while walking, which was not augmented by cognitive loads in DT. Walking speed was reduced by low and high cognitive loads in DT compared to STwalk (P&amp;lt;0.05), but was not different between DTlow and DThigh. Cognitive performances were negatively impacted by both walking (P&amp;lt;0.05) and cognitive load (between ‘low’ and ‘high’, P&amp;lt;0.001). These data highlight a “ceiling” effect in ∆O2Hb levels while walking, leaving no available resources for simultaneous cognitive tasks, during the early recovery period following stroke. In these patients, cognitive, but not motor, performances declined with a higher cognitive load.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Greater Anteroposterior Default Mode Network Functional Connectivity in Long-Term Elderly Yoga Practitioners</title>

	<description>Large-scale brain networks exhibit changes in functional connectivity during the aging process. Recent literature data suggests that Yoga and other contemplative practices may revert, at least in part, some of the aging effects in brain functional connectivity, including of the Default Mode Network (DMN). The aim of this cross-sectional investigation was to compare resting-state functional connectivity of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex - precuneus (PCC-Precuneus) in long-term elderly Yoga practitioners and healthy paired Yoga-naïve controls. Two paired groups: yoga (Y-20 women, Hatha Yoga practitioners; minimum twice a week of practice frequency for at least 8 years) and control group (C-20 women, Yoga-naïve, matched by age, years of formal education, and physical activity) were evaluated for: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), and open-eyes resting-state fMRI - seed to voxel connectivity analysis (CONN toolbox 17.f) with pre-processing - realignment and unwarping, slice-timing correction, segmentation, normalization, outlier detection, and spatial filtering. Analysis included a priori regions of interest (ROI) of DMN main nodes – MPFC and PCC-Precuneus. There was no difference between groups for: age, years of formal education, MMSE, BDI and IADL. Yoga group had higher correlation between MPFC and right angular gyrus, compared to controls. Elderly women with at least 8 years of yoga practice presented greater intra-network anteroposterior brain functional connectivity of the default mode network. This finding may contribute for the understanding of the influences of Yoga practice for a healthier cognitive aging process.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Decoding the Role of Platelets and Related MicroRNAs in Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders</title>

	<description>Platelets are anucleate cells that circulate in blood and are essential components of the hemostatic system. During aging, platelet numbers decrease and their aggregation capacity is reduced. Platelet dysfunctions associated with aging can be linked to molecular alterations affecting several cellular systems that include cytoskeleton rearrangements, signal transduction, vesicular trafficking and protein degradation. Age platelets may adopt a phenotype characterized by robust secretion of extracellular vesicles that could in turn account for about 70-90% of blood circulating vesicles. Interestingly these extracellular vesicles are loaded with messenger RNAs and microRNAs that may have a profound impact on protein physiology at the systems level. Age platelet dysfunction is also associated with accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Thereby understanding the mechanisms of aging in platelets as well as their age-dependent dysfunctions may be of interest when evaluating the contribution of aging to the onset of age-dependent pathologies, such as those affecting the nervous system. In this review we summarize the findings that link platelet dysfunctions to neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Huntington’s Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. We discuss the role of platelets as drivers of protein dysfunctions observed in these pathologies, their association with aging and the potential clinical significance of platelets, and related miRNAs, as peripheral biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Subjective Cognitive Decline and Nighttime Sleep Alterations, a Longitudinal Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00142</guid>

	<description>Abstract

Objective: the purpose of this study was to analyze quantitative sleep changes and their implication in subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Objective sleep pattern was investigated through actigraphy recorded at the baseline and at the follow-up after two years. The aim of the study was to examine specific sleep alterations in SCD. 

Background: sleep disorders are very common among average elderly adults and an altered sleep pattern is known to be a risk factor for future development of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia. Recent studies have shown how sleep is objectively altered in average senior adults with Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD), without any other significant change in cognition and behavior or brain structure. Considering that both SCD and disrupted sleep are risk factors for future MCI and dementia, with sleep only as a modifiable risk factor, further research is required to deeply investigate the interaction between sleep and SCD.

Methods:  among seventy community-dwelling elderly individuals who had been enrolled at baseline, thirty-five (64.6 5.6 y, 15M/20F) underwent a complete neuropsychological battery and one-week wrist actigraphy recording two years later during the follow-up stage.  Individuals were divided into two groups according to their Subjective Cognitive Decline Questionnaire (SCD-Q) score. Sleep hours, sleep efficiency and onset latency, napping and time awake after sleep onset (WASO) were collected. All individuals underwent structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination to exclude brain disorders. Data collection was performed at baseline and after two years at the follow-up phase.

Results:  a significantly different night sleep time between the two groups was observed: SCD showed a lower total sleep time (TST) than non-SCD subjects. Moreover, a total time spent in bed (TIB) was significantly lower in SCD subjects over two years of observation.

Conclusions:  objective changes over time of the sleep pattern, specifically total time spent in bed and total sleep time, are present in SCD individuals. The results of the study show that sleep alterations are common in SCD and underline the clinical importance of screening in order to assess sleep alterations as well as improve sleep in average adults with SCD complaints.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Cryo-EM of dynein microtubule-binding domains shows how an axonemal dynein distorts the microtubule</title>

	<description>Dyneins are motor proteins responsible for transport in the cytoplasm and the beating of axonemes in cilia and flagella. They bind and release microtubules via a compact microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) at the end of a coiled-coil stalk. We address how cytoplasmic and axonemal dynein MTBDs bind microtubules at near atomic resolution. We decorated microtubules with MTBDs of cytoplasmic dynein-1 and axonemal dynein DNAH7 and determined their cryo-EM structures using helical Relion. The majority of the MTBD is rigid upon binding, with the transition to the high affinity state controlled by the movement of a single helix at the MTBD interface. DNAH7 contains an 18-residue insertion, found in many axonemal dyneins, that contacts the adjacent protofilament. Unexpectedly we observe that DNAH7, but not dynein-1, induces large distortions in the microtubule cross-sectional curvature. This raises the possibility that dynein coordination in axonemes is mediated via conformational changes in the microtubule.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Contractile acto-myosin network on nuclear envelope remnants positions human chromosomes for mitosis</title>

	<description>To ensure proper segregation during mitosis, chromosomes must be efficiently captured by spindle microtubules and subsequently aligned on the mitotic spindle. The efficacy of chromosome interaction with the spindle can be influenced by how widely chromosomes are scattered in space. Here, we quantify chromosome-scattering volume (CSV) and find that it is reduced soon after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) in human cells. The CSV reduction occurs primarily independently of microtubules and is therefore not an outcome of interactions between chromosomes and the spindle. We find that, prior to NEBD, an acto-myosin network is assembled in a LINC complex-dependent manner on the cytoplasmic surface of the nuclear envelope. This acto-myosin network remains on nuclear envelope remnants soon after NEBD, and its myosin-II-mediated contraction reduces CSV and facilitates timely chromosome congression and correct segregation. Thus we find a novel mechanism that positions chromosomes in early mitosis to ensure efficient and correct chromosome-spindle interactions.</description>

	<description>Intrinsically disordered regions make up a large part of the proteome, but the sequence-to-function relationship in these regions is poorly understood, in part because the primary amino acid sequences of these regions are poorly conserved in alignments. Here we use an evolutionary approach to detect molecular features that are preserved in the amino acid sequences of orthologous intrinsically disordered regions. We find that most disordered regions contain multiple molecular features that are preserved, and we define these as 'evolutionary signatures' of disordered regions. We demonstrate that intrinsically disordered regions with similar evolutionary signatures can rescue function &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, and that groups of intrinsically disordered regions with similar evolutionary signatures are strongly enriched for functional annotations and phenotypes. We propose that evolutionary signatures can be used to predict function for many disordered regions from their amino acid sequences.</description>

	<description>Serotonin plays different roles across networks within the same sensory modality. Previously, we used whole-cell electrophysiology in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; to show that serotonergic neurons innervating the first olfactory relay are inhibited by odorants (Zhang and Gaudry, 2016). Here we show that network-spanning serotonergic neurons segregate information about stimulus features, odor intensity and identity, by using opposing coding schemes in different olfactory neuropil. A pair of serotonergic neurons (the CSDns) innervate the antennal lobe and lateral horn, which are first and second order neuropils. CSDn processes in the antennal lobe are inhibited by odors in an identity independent manner. In the lateral horn, CSDn processes are excited in an odor identity dependent manner. Using functional imaging, modeling, and EM reconstruction, we demonstrate that antennal lobe derived inhibition arises from local GABAergic inputs and acts as a means of gain control on branch specific inputs that the CSDns receive within the lateral horn.</description>

	<description>Perceptual choices depend not only on the current sensory input but also on the behavioral context, such as the history of one’s own choices. Yet, it remains unknown how such history signals shape the dynamics of later decision formation. In models of decision formation, it is commonly assumed that choice history shifts the starting point of accumulation toward the bound reflecting the previous choice. We here present results that challenge this idea. We fit bounded-accumulation decision models to human perceptual choice data, and estimated bias parameters that depended on observers’ previous choices. Across multiple task protocols and sensory modalities, individual history biases in overt behavior were consistently explained by a history-dependent change in the evidence accumulation, rather than in its starting point. Choice history signals thus seem to bias the interpretation of current sensory input, akin to shifting endogenous attention toward (or away from) the previously selected interpretation.</description>

	<description>Humans usually assess things not according to their absolute value, but relative to reference points – a main tenant of Prospect Theory. For example, people rate a new salary relative to previous salaries and salaries of their peers, rather than absolute income. We demonstrate a similar effect in an insect: ants expecting to find low-quality food showed higher acceptance of medium-quality food than ants expecting medium quality, and vice versa for high expectations. Further experiments demonstrate that these contrast effects arise from cognitive rather than mere sensory or pre-cognitive perceptual causes. Social information gained inside the nest can also serve as a reference point: the quality of food received from other ants affected the perceived value of food found later. Value judgement is a key element in decision making, and thus relative value perception strongly influences which option is chosen and ultimately how all animals make decisions.</description>

	<description>Several enzymes can simultaneously interact with multiple intracellular metabolites, however, how the allosteric effects of distinct ligands are integrated to coordinately control enzymatic activity remains poorly understood. We addressed this question using, as a model system, the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). We show that the PKM2 activator fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) alone promotes tetramerisation and increases PKM2 activity, but addition of the inhibitor L-phenylalanine (Phe) prevents maximal activation of FBP-bound PKM2 tetramers. We developed a method, AlloHubMat, that uses eigenvalue decomposition of mutual information derived from molecular dynamics trajectories to identify residues that mediate FBP-induced allostery. Experimental mutagenesis of these residues identified PKM2 variants in which activation by FBP remains intact but cannot be attenuated by Phe. Our findings reveal residues involved in FBP-induced allostery that enable the integration of allosteric input from Phe and provide a paradigm for the coordinate regulation of enzymatic activity by simultaneous allosteric inputs.</description>

	<description>Adolescence is a common time for initiation of alcohol use and development of alcohol use disorders. The present study investigates neuroanatomical predictors for trajectories of future alcohol use based on a novel voxel-wise whole-brain structural equation modeling framework. In 1814 healthy adolescents of the IMAGEN sample, the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) was acquired at three measurement occasions across five years. Based on a two-part latent growth curve model, we conducted whole-brain analyses on structural MRI data at age 14, predicting change in alcohol use score over time. Higher grey-matter volumes in the caudate nucleus and the left cerebellum at age 14 years were predictive of stronger increase in alcohol use score over 5 years. The study is the first to demonstrate the feasibility of running separate voxel-wise structural equation models thereby opening new avenues for data analysis in brain imaging.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The Makorin lep-2 and the lncRNA lep-5 regulate lin-28 to schedule sexual maturation of the C. elegans nervous system</title>

	<description>Sexual maturation must occur on a controlled developmental schedule. In mammals, Makorin3 (&lt;i&gt;MKRN3&lt;/i&gt;) and the miRNA regulators &lt;i&gt;LIN28A/B&lt;/i&gt; are key regulators of this process, but how they act is unclear. In &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;, sexual maturation of the nervous system includes the functional remodeling of postmitotic neurons and the onset of adult-specific behaviors. Here, we find that the &lt;i&gt;lin-28–let-7&lt;/i&gt; axis (the ‘heterochronic pathway’) determines the timing of these events. Upstream of &lt;i&gt;lin-28&lt;/i&gt;, the Makorin &lt;i&gt;lep-2&lt;/i&gt; and the lncRNA &lt;i&gt;lep-5&lt;/i&gt; regulate maturation cell-autonomously, indicating that distributed clocks, not a central timer, coordinate sexual differentiation of the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; nervous system. Overexpression of human &lt;i&gt;MKRN3&lt;/i&gt; delays aspects of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; sexual maturation, suggesting the conservation of Makorin function. These studies reveal roles for a Makorin and a lncRNA in timing of sexual differentiation; moreover, they demonstrate deep conservation of the &lt;i&gt;lin-28–let-7&lt;/i&gt; system in controlling the functional maturation of the nervous system.</description>

	<description>Concerns have been expressed about the robustness of experimental findings in several areas of science, but these matters have not been evaluated at scale. Here we identify a large sample of published drug-gene interaction claims curated in the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (for example, benzo(a)pyrene decreases expression of SLC22A3) and evaluate these claims by connecting them with high-throughput experiments from the LINCS L1000 program. Our sample included 60,159 supporting findings and 4253 opposing findings about 51,292 drug-gene interaction claims in 3363 scientific articles. We show that claims reported in a single paper replicate 19.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.9–21.2%) more frequently than expected, while claims reported in multiple papers replicate 45.5% (95% CI, 21.8–74.2%) more frequently than expected. We also analyze the subsample of interactions with two or more published findings (2493 claims; 6272 supporting findings; 339 opposing findings; 1282 research articles), and show that centralized scientific communities, which use similar methods and involve shared authors who contribute to many articles, propagate less replicable claims than decentralized communities, which use more diverse methods and contain more independent teams. Our findings suggest how policies that foster decentralized collaboration will increase the robustness of scientific findings in biomedical research.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Human Posterior Superior Temporal Sulcus Samples Visual Space Differently From Other Face-Selective Regions</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neuroimaging studies show that ventral face-selective regions, including the fusiform face area (FFA) and occipital face area (OFA), preferentially respond to faces presented in the contralateral visual field (VF). In the current study we measured the VF response of the face-selective posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Across 3 functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments, participants viewed face videos presented in different parts of the VF. Consistent with prior results, we observed a contralateral VF bias in bilateral FFA, right OFA (rOFA), and bilateral human motion-selective area MT+. Intriguingly, this contralateral VF bias was absent in the bilateral pSTS. We then delivered transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over right pSTS (rpSTS) and rOFA, while participants matched facial expressions in both hemifields. TMS delivered over the rpSTS disrupted performance in both hemifields, but TMS delivered over the rOFA disrupted performance in the contralateral hemifield only. These converging results demonstrate that the contralateral bias for faces observed in ventral face-selective areas is absent in the pSTS. This difference in VF response is consistent with face processing models proposing 2 functionally distinct pathways. It further suggests that these models should account for differences in interhemispheric connections between the face-selective areas across these 2 pathways.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Foveal feedback supports peripheral perception of both object color and form</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/690305v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/690305v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Evidence from neuroimaging and brain stimulation studies suggest that visual information about objects in the periphery is fed back to foveal retinotopic cortex in a separate representation that is essential for peripheral perception. The characteristics of this phenomenon has important theoretical implications for the role fovea-specific feedback might play in perception. In this work, we employed a recently developed behavioral paradigm to explore whether late disruption to central visual space impaired perception of color. First, participants performed a shape discrimination task on colored novel objects in the periphery while fixating centrally. Consistent with the results from previous work, a visual distractor presented at fixation ~100ms after presentation of the peripheral stimuli impaired sensitivity to differences in peripheral shapes more than a visual distractor presented at other stimulus onset asynchronies. In a second experiment, participants performed a color discrimination task on the same colored objects. In a third experiment, we further tested for the foveal distractor effect with stimuli restricted to a low-level feature by using homogenous color patches. These two latter experiments resulted in a similar pattern of behavior: a central distractor presented at the critical stimulus onset asynchrony impaired sensitivity to peripheral color differences, but, importantly, the magnitude of the effect depended on whether peripheral objects contained complex shape information. These results taken together suggest that feedback to the foveal confluence is a component of visual processing supporting perception of both object form and color.</description>

Here, we simulated placental ischemia-hypoxemia via oxytocin-induced uterine hypercontractility to show a profound decrease in placental perfusion/oxygenation, oxidative stress in the fetal brain, sex-dependent differences in gene expression mediating oxidative stress, and persistent upregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation proteins in the anterior cingulate cortex along with social behavioral impairment especially in male offspring.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Critical slowing as a biomarker for seizure susceptibility</title>

	<description>The human brain has the capacity to rapidly change state, and in epilepsy these state changes can be catastrophic, resulting in loss of consciousness, injury and even death. Theoretical interpretations considering the brain as a dynamical system would suggest that prior to a seizure recorded brain signals may exhibit critical slowing, a warning signal preceding many critical transitions in dynamical systems. Using long-term intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from fourteen patients with focal epilepsy, we found key signatures of critical slowing prior to seizures. Signals related to a critically slowing process fluctuated over temporally long scales (hours to days), longer than would be detectable in standard clinical evaluation settings. Seizure risk was associated with a combination of these signals together with epileptiform discharges. These results provide strong validation of theoretical models and demonstrate that critical slowing is a reliable indicator that could be used in seizure forecasting algorithms.</description>

	<description>Persons suffering from opioid use disorder (OUD) experience long-lasting dysphoric symptoms well into extended periods of withdrawal. This protracted withdrawal syndrome is notably characterized by heightened anxiety. Here we investigate if an exacerbated withdrawal model of acute morphine dependence results in lasting behavioral adaptation 6 weeks into forced abstinence. We found that our exacerbated morphine withdrawal paradigm produced distinct impairments in elevated-plus maze, open field, and social interaction tests in male and female mice. These findings will be relevant for future investigation examining the neural mechanisms underlying these behaviors, and will aid in uncovering physiological sex differences in response to opioid withdrawal.</description>

	<description>Specific deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) are the current best models of ventral visual processing and object recognition behavior in monkeys. We here explore whether models of non-human primate vision generalize to visual processing in the human primate brain. Specifically, we asked if model match to monkey IT is a predictor of model match to human IT, even when scoring those matches on different images. We found that the model match to monkey IT is a positive predictor of the model match to human IT (R = 0.36), and that this approach outperforms the current standard predictor of model accuracy on ImageNet. This suggests a more powerful approach for pre-selecting models as hypotheses of human brain processing.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dendritic speeding of synaptic potentials in an auditory brainstem principal neuron</title>

	<description>Principal cells of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) in the mammalian auditory brainstem receive most of their strong synaptic inputs directly on the cell soma. However, these neurons also grow extensive dendrites during the first four postnatal weeks. What are the functional roles of these dendrites? We studied the morphology and growth of the dendrites in the mouse MNTB using both electron microscopy and confocal fluorescence imaging from postnatal day 9 (P9; pre-hearing) to P30. The soma of principal cells sprouted 1 to 3 thin dendrites (diameter ~ 1.5 microns) by P21 to P30. Each dendrite bifurcated into 2-3 branches and spanned an overall distance of about 80 to 200 microns. By contrast, at P9-11 the soma had 1 to 2 dendrites that extended for only 25 microns on average. Patch clamp experiments revealed that the growth of dendrites during development correlates with a progressive decrease in the input resistance, whereas acute removal of dendrites during brain slicing leads to higher input resistances. Accordingly, recordings of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked by afferent fiber stimulation show that EPSP decay is faster in P21-24 neurons with intact dendrites than in neurons without dendrites. This dendritic speeding of the EPSP reduces the decay time constant 5-fold, which will impact significantly synaptic current summation and the ability to fire high-frequency spike trains. These data suggest a novel role for dendrites in auditory brainstem neurons: the speeding of EPSPs for faster and more precise output signal transfer.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Thalamic and extra-thalamic connections of the Globus Pallidus in the human brain: The ultradirect pathway</title>

	<description>A dominant framework for understanding loss and recovery of consciousness, particularly in the context of severe brain injury, focuses on corticosubcortical recurrent interactions, with a strong emphasis on excitatory thalamofugal projections. Recent work in healthy volunteers and patients, however, suggests a previously unappreciated role for the globus pallidus pars externa in maintaining a state of consciousness, a finding that is consistent with non-human animal work demonstrating the existence of direct (i.e., extrathalamic) pallidocortical projections as well as their involvement in modulating electrocortical arousal and sleep. Leveraging on the high-quality Human Connectome Project dataset, we report for the first time in humans, in vivo evidence of (direct) pallidocortical and pallidothalamic projections, distinguishing between internal and external pallidal regions. Our data confirm, in humans, the existence of an ultradirect extra-thalamic pallidocortical pathway, with the pars externa connecting preferentially, and extensively, to prefrontal cortex and the pars interna primarily connecting to sensorimotor cortical areas. Furthermore, we also report, for the first time in humans, the likely existence of a direct pathway uniting the globus pallidus pars externa and the mediodorsal areas of thalamus often implicated in maintenance and recovery of consciousness. Consistent with the pallidocortical connectivity results, the pars interna appeared to predominantly connect with the sensorimotor areas of thalamus. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the existence in humans of an extra thalamic ultradirect pallidocortical pathway and suggest a central role of the external segment of the globus pallidum in supporting consciousness.</description>

	<description>The nascent field of bioelectronic medicine seeks to decode and modulate peripheral nervous system signals to obtain therapeutic control of targeted end organs and effectors. Current approaches rely heavily on electrode-based devices, but size scalability, material and microfabrication challenges, limited surgical accessibility, and the biomechanically dynamic implantation environment are significant impediments to developing and deploying advanced peripheral interfacing technologies. Here, we present a microscale implantable device - the nanoclip - for chronic interfacing with fine peripheral nerves in small animal models that begins to meet these constraints. We demonstrate the capability to make stable, high-resolution recordings of behaviorally-linked nerve activity over multi-week timescales. In addition, we show that multi-channel, current-steering-based stimulation can achieve a high degree of functionally-relevant modulatory specificity within the small scale of the device. These results highlight the potential of new microscale design and fabrication techniques for the realization of viable implantable devices for long-term peripheral interfacing.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Norepinephrine Metabolite DOPEGAL Confers Locus Coeruleus Tau Vulnerability and Propagation via Asparagine Endopeptidase</title>

	<description>Aberrant Tau inclusions in the locus coeruleus (LC) are the earliest detectable Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neuropathology in the human brain; however, why LC neurons are selectively vulnerable to developing early Tau pathology and degenerating later in disease and whether the LC might seed the stereotypical spread of Tau pathology to the rest of the brain remain unclear. Here we show that 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde (DOPEGAL), which is produced exclusively in noradrenergic neurons by monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) metabolism of norepinephrine (NE), activates asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) that cleaves Tau at residue N368 into aggregation- and propagation-prone forms, thereby leading to LC degeneration and the spread of Tau pathology. DOPEGAL triggers AEP-cleaved Tau aggregation in vitro and in intact cells, resulting in LC neurotoxicity and propagation of pathology to the forebrain. Thus, our findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism underlying the selective vulnerability of LC neurons in AD.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: In-silico evidence that increased cortico-thalamic connectivity and superficial pyramidal disinhibition underlie broadband task-related spectral changes induced by ketamine</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/688044v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Cortical recordings of task-induced oscillations following subanaesthetic ketamine administration demonstrate alterations in amplitude, including increases at high-frequencies (gamma) and reductions at low frequencies (theta, alpha). To investigate the population-level interactions underlying these changes, we implemented a thalamo-cortical model capable of recapitulating broadband spectral responses. Compared with placebo, ketamine was found to increase the decay rate of NMDA receptor currents, decrease the decay rate of GABA-B receptor currents, but had no effect on AMPA or GABA-A currents. Furthermore, ketamine decreased the inhibitory self-modulation of superficial pyramidal populations, increased the inhibitory self-modulation of inhibitory interneurons and increased the strength of the cortico-thalamic projection from layer 6 into thalamus. In-silico rectification of each of these parameters to their placebo state revealed the accompanying spectral changes. Similar broadband effects were demonstrated for the NMDA constant and intrinsic connectivity changes, whereby rectification resulted in normalising the amplitude of alpha (increased) and gamma (decreased). While supporting theories of superficial pyramidal disinhibition following ketamine administration, our results suggest a role for altered cortico-thalamic connectivity relevant to understanding ketamine induced cortical responses and potentially identifies a system-level mechanism contributing to its antidepressant effects.</description>

	<description>GABAergic interneurons can be subdivided into three subclasses: parvalbumin positive (PV), somatostatin positive (SOM) and serotonin positive neurons. With principal cells (PCs) they form complex networks. We examine PCs and PV responses in mouse anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) and barrel cortex (S1) upon PV photostimulation in vivo. In layer 5, the PV response is paradoxical: photoexcitation reduces their activity. This is not the case in ALM layer 2/3. We combine analytical calculations and numerical simulations to investigate how these results constrain the architecture. Two-population models cannot account for the results. Networks with three inhibitory populations and V1-like architecture account for the data in ALM layer 2/3. Our data in layer 5 can be accounted for if SOM neurons receive inputs only from PCs and PV neurons. In both four-population models, the paradoxical effect implies not too strong recurrent excitation. It is not evidence for stabilization by inhibition.</description>

	<description>Despite the general controversy regarding the existence and physiological relevance of Class A GPCR dimerization, there is substantial evidence for functional interactions between dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) and adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR). A2AR-D2R complexes have been detected in rodent brains by proximity ligation assay (PLA), but their existence in the human brain is yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we used brightfield PLA, combined with a systematic sampling and a parameter-free naive Bayesian classifier, and demonstrated proximity between D2R and A2AR in the adult human ventral striatum, consistent with their colocalization within complexes and the possible existence of D2R-A2AR heteromers. These methods are applicable to the quantitative analysis of proximity of two proteins and the expression of individual proteins.</description>

	<description>Visual and auditory representations in the human brain have been studied with encoding, decoding and reconstruction models. Representations from convolutional neural networks have been used as explanatory models for these stimulus-induced hierarchical brain activations. However, none of the fMRI datasets currently available has adequate amounts of data for sufficiently sampling their representations. We recorded a densely sampled large fMRI dataset (TR=700 ms) in a single individual exposed to spatio-temporal visual and auditory naturalistic stimuli (30 episodes of BBC's Doctor Who). The data consists of 120.830 whole-brain volumes (approx. 23 h) of single-presentation data (full episodes, training set) and 1.178 volumes (11 min) of repeated narrative short episodes (test set, 22 repetitions), recorded with fixation over a period of six months. This rich dataset can be used widely to study the way the brain represents audiovisual input across its sensory hierarchies.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Bach2 is a potent repressor of Nrf2-mediated antioxidant enzyme expression in dopaminergic neurons</title>

	<description>Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcriptional activator of antioxidant response elements (ARE), which function to increase expression of antioxidant enzymes. Recent works suggests Nrf2 activation is a promising protective mechanism against the progressive neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). While Nrf2 inducers show some promising results in animal models of PD, the response is limit in dopaminergic neurons with the protection mostly conferred by surrounding glia. The present study characterizes ARE transcriptional repressors Bach1 and Bach 2 (Broad complex-Tramtrack-Bric-a-brac and Cap n' Collar homology, basic leucine zipper transcription factors 1 and 2) as a potential explanation for limited Nrf2 activity in these neurons. The current work identified Bach1 and Bach2 in dopaminergic neurons of the human substantia nigra by immunocytochemical analyses. We further identified Bach2 as a more robust inhibitor of Nrf2 responses. The effects of both Bach1 and Bach2 were dependent on their DNA-binding domains, but the DNA-binding domains did not entirely explain the differences in their relative repressor activities. Using IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells, we found differentiation into a dopaminergic neuronal phenotype resulted in increased Bach2 expression, decreased full-length Bach1 expression, increased truncated Bach1, and blunted Nrf2-mediated responses. Bach inhibitors cobalt protoporphyrin or cadmium chloride, which were more effective against Bach1 than Bach2, did not rescue Nrf2 responses. These results provide a novel mechanism for the lack of antioxidant responses and sensitivity of dopaminergic neurons to oxidative damage, in addition to proposing Bach2 as a novel drug target for the treatment of PD.</description>

	<description>Perception reflects not only input from the sensory periphery, but also the endogenous neural state when sensory inputs enter the brain. Whether endogenous neural states influence perception only through global mechanisms, such as arousal, or can also perception in a neural circuit and stimulus specific manner remains largely unknown. Intracranial recordings from 30 pre-surgical epilepsy patients showed that endogenous activity independently modulated the strength of trial-by-trial neural tuning of different visual category-selective neural circuits. Furthermore, the same aspect of the endogenous activity that influenced tuning in a particular neural circuit also correlated with reaction time only for trials with the category of image that circuit was selective for. These results suggest that endogenous activity may influence neural tuning and perception through circuit-specific predictive coding processes.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Da Zhou, Yue Luo, David Dingli, Arne Traulsen&lt;/p&gt;

Many fast renewing tissues are characterized by a hierarchical cellular architecture, with tissue specific stem cells at the root of the cellular hierarchy, differentiating into a whole range of specialized cells. There is increasing evidence that tumors are structured in a very similar way, mirroring the hierarchical structure of the host tissue. In some tissues, differentiated cells can also revert to the stem cell phenotype, which increases the risk that mutant cells lead to long lasting clones in the tissue. However, it is unclear under which circumstances de-differentiating cells will invade a tissue. To address this, we developed mathematical models to investigate how de-differentiation is selected as an adaptive mechanism in the context of cellular hierarchies. We derive thresholds for which de-differentiation is expected to emerge, and it is shown that the selection of de-differentiation is a result of the combination of the properties of cellular hierarchy and de-differentiation patterns. Our results suggest that de-differentiation is most likely to be favored provided stem cells having the largest effective self-renewal rate. Moreover, jumpwise de-differentiation provides a wider range of favorable conditions than stepwise de-differentiation. Finally, the effect of de-differentiation on the redistribution of self-renewal and differentiation probabilities also greatly influences the selection for de-differentiation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/L8i-4SZ3AJQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: DART-ID increases single-cell proteome coverage</title>

Analysis by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) can identify and quantify thousands of proteins in microgram-level samples, such as those comprised of thousands of cells. This process, however, remains challenging for smaller samples, such as the proteomes of single mammalian cells, because reduced protein levels reduce the number of confidently sequenced peptides. To alleviate this reduction, we developed Data-driven Alignment of Retention Times for IDentification (DART-ID). DART-ID implements principled Bayesian frameworks for global retention time (RT) alignment and for incorporating RT estimates towards improved confidence estimates of peptide-spectrum-matches. When applied to bulk or to single-cell samples, DART-ID increased the number of data points by 30–50% at 1% FDR, and thus decreased missing data. Benchmarks indicate excellent quantification of peptides upgraded by DART-ID and support their utility for quantitative analysis, such as identifying cell types and cell-type specific proteins. The additional datapoints provided by DART-ID boost the statistical power and double the number of proteins identified as differentially abundant in monocytes and T-cells. DART-ID can be applied to diverse experimental designs and is freely available at http://dart-id.slavovlab.net.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pO3US3FVnoc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aging is the highest risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD). Under physiological conditions, spermidine and spermine experimentally enhance longevity via autophagy induction. Accordingly, we evaluated the ability of each polyamine metabolite to act as an age‐related, diagnostic, and severity‐associated PD biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive metabolome analysis of plasma was performed in Cohort A (controls, n = 45; PD, n = 145), followed by analysis of 7 polyamine metabolites in Cohort B (controls, n = 49; PD, n = 186; progressive supranuclear palsy, n = 19; Alzheimer disease, n = 23). Furthermore, 20 patients with PD who were successively examined within Cohort B were studied using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Association of each polyamine metabolite with disease severity was assessed according to Hoehn and Yahr stage (H&amp;amp;Y) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor section (UPDRS‐III). Additionally, the autophagy induction ability of each polyamine metabolite was examined in vitro in various cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Cohort A, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;8‐acetylspermidine and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;‐acetylputrescine levels were significantly and mildly elevated in PD, respectively. In Cohort B, spermine levels and spermine/spermidine ratio were significantly reduced in PD, concomitant with hyperacetylation. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;1,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;8‐diacetylspermidine levels had the highest diagnostic value, and correlated with H&amp;amp;Y, UPDRS‐III, and axonal degeneration quantified by DTI. The spermine/spermidine ratio in controls declined with age, but was consistently suppressed in PD. Among polyamine metabolites, spermine was the strongest autophagy inducer, especially in SH‐SY5Y cells. No significant genetic variations in 5 genes encoding enzymes associated with spermine/spermidine metabolism were detected compared with controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spermine synthesis and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;1,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;8‐diacetylspermidine may respectively be useful diagnostic and severity‐associated biomarkers for PD. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sex differences in cognitive flexibility and resting brain networks in middle-aged marmosets</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Sex differences in human cognitive performance are well characterized. However, the neural correlates of these differences remain elusive. This issue may be clarified using nonhuman primates, for which sociocultural influences are minimized. We used the marmoset (&lt;i&gt;Callithrix jacchus&lt;/i&gt;) to investigate sex differences in two aspects of executive function: Reversal Learning and Intradimensional/Extradimensional (ID/ED) set shifting. Stress reactivity and motor function were also assessed. In agreement with human literature, females needed more trials than males to acquire the reversals. No sex differences in ED set shifting or motivational measures were observed. The findings suggest enhanced habit formation in females, perhaps due to striatal estrogenic effects. Both sexes showed increased urinary cortisol during social separation stressor, but females showed an earlier increase in cortisol and a greater increase in agitated locomotion, possibly indicating enhanced stress reactivity. Independent of sex, basal cortisol predicted cognitive performance. No sex differences were found in motor performance. Associations between brain networks and reversal learning performance were investigated using resting state fMRI. Resting state functional connectivity analyses revealed sex differences in cognitive networks, with differences in overall neural network metrics and specific regions, including the prefrontal cortex, caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens. Correlations between cognitive flexibility and neural connectivity indicate that sex differences in cognitive flexibility are related to sex-dependent patterns of resting brain networks. Overall, our findings reveal sex differences in reversal learning, brain networks, and their relationship in the marmoset, positioning this species as an excellent model to investigate the biological basis of cognitive sex differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We examined sex differences in multiple outcomes (cognition, motor function, stress reactivity and resting state functional connectivity) in middle-aged marmosets. We found that female marmosets had poorer reversal learning relative to males. Resting state functional connectivity analyses revealed substantial sex differences in cognitive networks, with differences in both overall neural network metrics and specific regions, including the prefrontal cortex, caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens. Sex-dependent correlations between reversal learning and neural connectivity measures indicate that the sex difference in cognitive performance is related to sex-dependent patterns of resting brain networks. Although these data are correlational and cannot determine causal effects, they are consistent with human resting state data, supporting the idea that cognitive sex differences have identifiable intrinsic neural correlates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Genetic risk for alzheimer disease is distinct from genetic risk for amyloid deposition</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25530?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25530?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is responsible for a huge and growing health care burden in the developed and developing world. The polygenic risk score (PRS) approach has shown 75 to 84% prediction accuracy of identifying individuals with AD risk.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we tested the prediction accuracy of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and amyloid deposition risks with PRS, including and excluding &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; genotypes in a large publicly available dataset with extensive phenotypic data, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Among MCI individuals with amyloid‐positive status, we examined PRS prediction accuracy in those who converted to AD. In addition, we divided polygenic risk score by biological pathways and tested them independently for distinguishing between AD, MCI, and amyloid deposition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that AD and MCI are predicted by both &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; genotype and PRS (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.82% and 68%, respectively). Amyloid deposition is predicted by &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; only (AUC = 79%). Further progression to AD of individuals with MCI and amyloid‐positive status is predicted by PRS over and above &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; (AUC = 67%). In pathway‐specific PRS analyses, the protein–lipid complex has the strongest association with AD and amyloid deposition even when genes in the &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; region were removed (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0055 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0079, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed different pattern of &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; contribution in PRS risk predictions of AD/MCI and amyloid deposition. Our study suggests that &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; mostly contributes to amyloid accumulation and the PRS affects risk of further conversion to AD. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: PDXK mutations cause polyneuropathy responsive to pyridoxal 5′‐phosphate supplementation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25524?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify disease‐causing variants in autosomal recessive axonal polyneuropathy with optic atrophy and provide targeted replacement therapy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed genome‐wide sequencing, homozygosity mapping, and segregation analysis for novel disease‐causing gene discovery. We used circular dichroism to show secondary structure changes and isothermal titration calorimetry to investigate the impact of variants on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding. Pathogenicity was further supported by enzymatic assays and mass spectroscopy on recombinant protein, patient‐derived fibroblasts, plasma, and erythrocytes. Response to supplementation was measured with clinical validated rating scales, electrophysiology, and biochemical quantification.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified biallelic mutations in &lt;i&gt;PDXK&lt;/i&gt; in 5 individuals from 2 unrelated families with primary axonal polyneuropathy and optic atrophy. The natural history of this disorder suggests that untreated, affected individuals become wheelchair‐bound and blind. We identified conformational rearrangement in the mutant enzyme around the ATP‐binding pocket. Low PDXK ATP binding resulted in decreased erythrocyte PDXK activity and low pyridoxal 5′‐phosphate (PLP) concentrations. We rescued the clinical and biochemical profile with PLP supplementation in 1 family, improvement in power, pain, and fatigue contributing to patients regaining their ability to walk independently during the first year of PLP normalization.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that mutations in &lt;i&gt;PDXK&lt;/i&gt; cause autosomal recessive axonal peripheral polyneuropathy leading to disease via reduced PDXK enzymatic activity and low PLP. We show that the biochemical profile can be rescued with PLP supplementation associated with clinical improvement. As B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is a cofactor in diverse essential biological pathways, our findings may have direct implications for neuropathies of unknown etiology characterized by reduced PLP levels.

	<description>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric illness characterized by obsessions and/or compulsions. Its pathophysiology is still not well understood but it's known that the cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical (CSTC) circuitry plays an important role. Here we used a multi-method MRI approach combining proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H1-MRS) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) techniques to investigate both the metabolic and the microstructural white matter changes of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in OCD patients as compared to healthy controls. Twenty-three OCD patients and 21 age, sex, and education matched healthy volunteers participated in the study. Our 1H-MRS findings shows increased levels of Glx in ACC in OCD. Further, significantly lower FA values were observed in OCD patients left cingulate bundle (CB) as compared to healthy controls. Finally, there was a negative correlation between FA in the left CB and level of obsessions, as well as the duration of the illness. Our findings reinforce the involvement of CSTC bundles in pathophysiology of OCD, pointing to a specific role of glutamate (glutamine) and white matter integrity.</description>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25525?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Distinct clinical syndromes have been associated with pathogenic &lt;i&gt;MT‐ATP6&lt;/i&gt; variants. In this cohort study, we identified 125 individuals (60 families) including 88 clinically affected individuals and 37 asymptomatic carriers. Thirty‐one individuals presented with Leigh syndrome and 7 with neuropathy ataxia retinitis pigmentosa. The remaining 50 patients presented with variable nonsyndromic features including ataxia, neuropathy, and learning disability. We confirmed maternal inheritance in 39 families and demonstrated that tissue segregation patterns and phenotypic threshold are variant dependent. Our findings suggest that &lt;i&gt;MT‐ATP6&lt;/i&gt;–related mitochondrial DNA disease is best conceptualized as a mitochondrial disease spectrum disorder and should be routinely included in genetic ataxia and neuropathy gene panels.

Paul Greengard, co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2000, Vincent Astor Professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience at the Rockefeller University in New York City, died of an apparent heart attack at age 93. Paul will be remembered for his seminal contributions to neuroscience, for pioneering the field of neuronal signal transduction and for training hundreds of neuroscientists. For anyone who knew Paul it will come as no surprise that up until a few hours before his death, Paul was doing what he liked the best: working on a scientific manuscript.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/lVMMcSN8IDQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>The current review summarizes the pathobiology of nerve growth factor and its cognate receptors during the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Both protein and transcript data indicate that cholinotrophic neuronal dysfunction is related to an imbalance between TrkA-mediated survival signaling and proNGF/p75NTR-mediated pro-apoptotic signaling, which may be related to alteration in the metabolism of NGF. Data indicate a spatiotemporal pattern of degeneration related to the evolution of tau pathology within cholinotrophic neuronal subgroups located within the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM). Despite these degenerative events the cholinotrophic system is capable of cellular resilience and/or plasticity during the prodromal (and later stages of the disease. In addition to neurotrophin dysfunction, studies indicate alterations nuclear epigenetic proteins occur within cholinotrophic nbM neurons during the progression of AD, suggesting a mechanism that may underlie changes in transcript expression. Findings suggest that postmortem intraventricular or premortem CSF levels of proNGF mark the onset of MCI and the transition to AD suggesting this proneurotrophin to be a potential biomarker for the progression of MCI. Novel therapeutics to treat NGF dysfunction included NGF gene therapy and the development of small molecule agonists for the high affinity TrkA survival receptor and antagonists against the low affinity p75NTR death receptor for the treatment of AD.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The C. elegans Tubby homolog dynamically modulates olfactory cilia membrane morphogenesis and phospholipid composition</title>

	<description>Plasticity in sensory signaling is partly mediated via regulated trafficking of signaling molecules to and from primary cilia. Tubby-related proteins regulate ciliary protein transport; however, their roles in remodeling cilia properties are not fully understood. We find that the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; TUB-1 Tubby homolog regulates membrane morphogenesis and signaling protein transport in specialized sensory cilia. In particular, TUB-1 is essential for sensory signaling-dependent reshaping of olfactory cilia morphology. We show that compromised sensory signaling alters cilia membrane phosphoinositide composition via TUB-1-dependent trafficking of a PIP5 kinase. TUB-1 regulates localization of this lipid kinase at the cilia base in part via localization of the AP-2 adaptor complex subunit DPY-23. Our results describe new functions for Tubby proteins in the dynamic regulation of cilia membrane lipid composition, morphology, and signaling protein content, and suggest that this conserved family of proteins plays a critical role in mediating cilia structural and functional plasticity.</description>

	<description>Microbial colonies are fascinating structures in which growth and internal organization reflect complex morphogenetic processes. Here, we generated a microfluidics device with arrays of long monolayer yeast colonies to further global understanding of how intercellular metabolic interactions affect the internal structure of colonies within defined boundary conditions. We observed the emergence of stable glucose gradients using fluorescently labelled hexose transporters and quantified the spatial correlations with intra-colony growth rates and expression of other genes regulated by glucose availability. These landscapes depended on the external glucose concentration as well as secondary gradients, e.g., amino acid availability. This work demonstrates the regulatory genetic networks governing cellular physiological adaptation are the key to internal structuration of cellular assemblies. This approach could be used in the future to decipher the interplay between long-range metabolic interactions, cellular development and morphogenesis in more complex systems.</description>

	<description>Patterning is a critical step during organogenesis and is closely associated with the physiological function of organs. Tooth root shapes are finely tuned to provide precise occlusal support to facilitate the function of each tooth type. However, the mechanism regulating tooth root patterning and development is largely unknown. In this study, we provide the first in vivo evidence demonstrating that Ezh2 in the dental mesenchyme determines patterning and furcation formation during dental root development in mouse molars. Mechanistically, an antagonistic interaction between epigenetic regulators Ezh2 and Arid1a controls Cdkn2a expression in the dental mesenchyme to regulate dental root patterning and development. These findings indicate the importance of balanced epigenetic regulation in determining the tooth root pattern and the integration of roots with the jaw bones to achieve physiological function. Collectively, our study provides important clues about the regulation of organogenesis and has general implications for tooth regeneration in the future.</description>

	<description>Cancer cells usually exhibit aberrant cell signaling and metabolic reprogramming. However, mechanisms of crosstalk between these processes remain elusive. Here we show that in an &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;tumor model expressing oncogenic &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase (Hipk), tumor cells display elevated aerobic glycolysis. Mechanistically, elevated Hipk drives transcriptional upregulation of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;Myc (dMyc; MYC in vertebrates) likely through convergence of multiple perturbed signaling cascades. dMyc induces robust expression of &lt;i&gt;pfk2&lt;/i&gt; (encoding 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase; PFKFB in vertebrates) among other glycolytic genes. Pfk2 catalyzes the synthesis of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, which acts as a potent allosteric activator of Phosphofructokinase (Pfk) and thus stimulates glycolysis. Pfk2 and Pfk in turn are required to sustain dMyc protein accumulation post-transcriptionally, establishing a positive feedback loop. Disruption of the loop abrogates tumorous growth. Together, our study demonstrates a reciprocal stimulation of Myc and aerobic glycolysis and identifies the Pfk2-Pfk governed committed step of glycolysis as a metabolic vulnerability during tumorigenesis.</description>

	<description>Wound repair is controlled temporally and spatially to restore tissue homeostasis. Previously we reported that thermal damage of the larval zebrafish fin disrupts collagen organization and wound healing compared to tail transection (LeBert et al., 2018). Here we characterize different injury models in larval zebrafish to dissect temporal and spatial dynamics of repair in complex damage. We found that each damage model triggers distinct inflammatory and tissue responses, with Stat3 and TGFβ playing key roles in the regulation of mesenchymal cells during simple repair. While thermal injury disrupts collagen fibers initially, healing is recovered as inflammation resolves, and mesenchymal cells and collagen fibers align. By contrast, infected wounds lead to persistent inflammation and loss of mesenchymal cells, resulting in minimal tissue repair. These wound models have broad physiological relevance, thereby providing a valuable advance in our toolkit to probe the dynamics of inflammation and wound repair in complex tissue damage.</description>

	<description>Cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET) is emerging as a revolutionary method for resolving the structure of macromolecular complexes &lt;i&gt;in situ.&lt;/i&gt; However, sample preparation for &lt;i&gt;in situ &lt;/i&gt;Cryo-ET is labour-intensive and can require both cryo-lamella preparation through cryo-Focused Ion Beam (FIB) milling and correlative light microscopy to ensure that the event of interest is present in the lamella. Here, we present an integrated cryo-FIB and light microscope setup called the &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;hoton &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;on &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;lectron microscope (PIE-scope) that enables direct and rapid isolation of cellular regions containing protein complexes of interest. Specifically, we demonstrate the versatility of PIE-scope by preparing targeted cryo-lamellae from subcellular compartments of neurons from transgenic &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; expressing fluorescent proteins. We designed PIE-scope to enable retrofitting of existing microscopes, which will increase the throughput and accuracy on projects requiring correlative microscopy to target protein complexes. This new approach will make cryo-correlative workflow safer and more accessible.</description>

	<description>Cells must appropriately sense and integrate multiple metabolic resources to commit to proliferation. Here, we report that &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae &lt;/i&gt;cells regulate carbon and nitrogen metabolic homeostasis through tRNA U&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;-thiolation. Despite amino acid sufficiency, tRNA-thiolation deficient cells appear amino acid starved. In these cells, carbon flux towards nucleotide synthesis decreases, and trehalose synthesis increases, resulting in a starvation-like metabolic signature. Thiolation mutants have only minor translation defects. However, in these cells phosphate homeostasis genes are strongly down-regulated, resulting in an effectively phosphate-limited state. Reduced phosphate enforces a metabolic switch, where glucose-6-phosphate is routed towards storage carbohydrates. Notably, trehalose synthesis, which releases phosphate and thereby restores phosphate availability, is central to this metabolic rewiring. Thus, cells use thiolated tRNAs to perceive amino acid sufficiency, balance carbon and amino acid metabolic flux and grow optimally, by controlling phosphate availability. These results further biochemically explain how phosphate availability determines a switch to a 'starvation-state'.</description>

	<description>As a neurodevelopmental disorder with serious lifelong consequences, autism has received considerable attention from neuroscientists and geneticists. We present a hypothesis of mechanisms plausibly affected during brain development in autism, based on neural pathways that are associated with social behavior and connect the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to the basal ganglia (BG). We consider failure of social approach in autism as a special case of imbalance in the fundamental dichotomy between behavioral approach and avoidance.</description>

	<description>The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is an evolutionarily conserved, structural, and functional separation between circulating blood and the central nervous system (CNS). By controlling permeability into and out of the nervous system, the BBB has a critical role in the precise regulation of neural processes. Here, we review recent studies demonstrating that permeability at the BBB is dynamically controlled by circadian rhythms and sleep. An endogenous circadian rhythm in the BBB controls transporter function, regulating permeability across the BBB.</description>

	<description>According to the critical brain hypothesis, the brain is considered to operate near criticality and realize efficient neural computations. Despite the prior theoretical and empirical evidence in favor of the hypothesis, no direct link has been provided between human cognitive performance and the neural criticality. Here we provide such a key link by analyzing resting-state dynamics of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) networks at a whole-brain level. We develop a novel data-driven analysis method, inspired from statistical physics theory of spin systems, to map out the whole-brain neural dynamics onto a phase diagram. Using this tool, we show evidence that dynamics of more intelligent human participants are closer to a critical state, i.e., the boundary between the paramagnetic phase and the spin-glass (SG) phase. This result was specific to fluid intelligence as opposed to crystalized intelligence. The present results are also consistent with the notion of &quot;edge-of-chaos&quot; neural computation.nnAuthor summaryAccording to the critical brain hypothesis, the brain should be operating near criticality, i.e., a boundary between different states showing qualitatively different dynamical behaviors. Such a critical brain dynamics has been considered to realize efficient neural computations. Here we provide direct neural evidence in favor of this hypothesis by showing that the brain dynamics in more intelligent individuals are closer to the criticality. We reached this conclusion by deploying a novel data-analysis method based on statistical-physics theory of Ising spin systems to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data obtained from human participants. Specifically, our method maps multivariate fMRI data obtained from each participant to a point in a phase diagram akin to that of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of spin-glass systems. The brain dynamics for the participants having high fluid intelligence scores tended to be close to the phase boundary, which marks criticality, between the paramagnetic phase and the spin-glass phase, but not to the boundary between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases.</description>

	<description>How the brain makes correct inferences about its environment based on noisy and ambiguous observations, is one of the fundamental questions in Neuroscience. Prior knowledge about the probability with which certain events occur in the environment plays an important role in this process. Humans are able to incorporate such prior knowledge in an efficient, Bayes optimal, way in many situations, but it remains an open question how the brain acquires and represents this prior knowledge. The long time spans over which prior knowledge is acquired make it a challenging question to investigate experimentally. In order to guide future experiments with clear empirical predictions, we used a neural network model to learn two commonly used tasks in the experimental literature (i.e. orientation classification and orientation estimation) where the prior probability of observing a certain stimulus is manipulated. We show that a model population of neurons learns to correctly represent and incorporate prior knowledge, by only receiving feedback about the accuracy of their inference from trial-to-trial and without any probabilistic feedback. We identify different factors that can influence the neural responses to unexpected or expected stimuli, and find a novel mechanism that changes the activation threshold of neurons, depending on the prior probability of the encoded stimulus. In a task where estimating the exact stimulus value is important, more likely stimuli also led to denser tuning curve distributions and narrower tuning curves, allocating computational resources such that information processing is enhanced for more likely stimuli. These results can explain several different experimental findings and clarify why some contradicting observations concerning the neural responses to expected versus unexpected stimuli have been reported and pose some clear and testable predictions about the neural representation of prior knowledge that can guide future experiments.nnAuthor summaryThe probability with which certain events are observed in our environment plays an important role in how we perceive the world. In many situations humans use such knowledge about the environment efficiently to come to optimal inferences from the observations made. However, it remains unclear how the brain learns to incorporate such prior knowledge and what the neural representations are exactly. By simulating two tasks commonly used in experiments where we manipulate the probability of certain stimuli occurring we show that such prior knowledge can be acquired from feedback about the accuracy of individual observations, and does not need any explicit information about the probability of an event occurring. We identify different properties of the neural populations that can influence the neural responses in experiments and show how prior knowledge can influence these neural responses through different mechanisms. Interestingly, the networks learn to allocate neural resources efficiently to more likely stimuli in order to maximize task performance. These results give several interesting and testable predictions about the neural representation of prior knowledge in commonly used experimental paradigms that can guide future experiments.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Interleaved training prevents catastrophic forgetting in spiking neural networks</title>

	<description>Artificial neural networks suffer from the inability to learn new tasks sequentially without completely overwriting all memory of the previously learned tasks, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. However, biological neural networks are able to continuously learn many tasks over the course of the organisms lifetime, and typically learn the best when tasks are trained sequentially. Here we used a multi-layer spiking neural network with biologically plausible dynamics and learning rules to study synaptic mechanisms behind catastrophic forgetting and to discuss possible solutions to overcome the problem. The network utilized reward modulated and non-reward modulated STDP and implemented multiple mechanisms for homeostatic regulation of synaptic efficacy. We found that the network can learn to perform two complementary, complex foraging tasks, but underwent catastrophic forgetting upon sequential training due to a near complete overwriting of synaptic weights. Interleaved training was capable of mitigating catastrophic forgetting by partially preserving synaptic weights from the later task and recovering those from the earlier task. Moreover, interleaved training pushed the final synaptic weight configuration towards the decision boundary between the configurations associated with each task, striking an optimal balance between both task representations.nnAuthor SummaryThe human brain is capable of learning an immense number of complex tasks over the course of a lifetime without forgetting previous tasks. Although modern artificial neural networks used in machine learning are getting closer to matching human-level capabilities regarding the complexity of the task to be learned, these networks typically lose all ability to perform this task after being trained sequentially on a second task; a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. To better understand this phenomenon and how the brain overcomes it, we developed a spiking neural network which directly models the functioning of biological neurons and is updated according to biologically plausible learning rules. This network was able to learn to perform complementary complex foraging tasks but suffered from catastrophic forgetting when they were trained sequentially. Catastrophic forgetting was prevented if the new task was trained by interleaving it with trials from the original task. Significantly, we found that interleaved training accomplishes this by representing the two tasks as a single hybrid-task. This indicates that rather than learn to represent each task independently and appropriately toggle between these, the network compromised and found an optimal hybrid representation of synaptic weights which was sufficient to perform both tasks.</description>

	<description>Neocortical sensory areas are generally thought to faithfully represent external stimuli. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that cortical networks exhibit considerable functional plasticity over multiple temporal scales, allowing them to modify their output to reflect ongoing behavioral demands. Nevertheless, the dynamics of sensory and non-sensory representations during acquisition of stimulus-guided behavior are not well understood. We performed longitudinal 2-photon imaging of activity in primary visual cortex (V1) of mice learning a conditioned eyeblink task. We found that both excitatory and inhibitory neurons robustly encode the visual stimulus throughout training despite a significant experience-dependent reduction in response magnitude. In contrast, both pyramidal neurons and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons exhibit emergence of behavioral representation during learning. The plasticity of visual response magnitude and behavioral representation is abolished following loss of NMDA-type glutamate receptors. Overall, our findings demonstrate that V1 networks can dynamically multiplex distinct behaviorally relevant representations over the course of learning.</description>

	<description>Oscillations are a hallmark of neural population activity in various brain regions with a spectrum covering a wide range of frequencies. Within this spectrum gamma oscillations have received particular attention due to their ubiquitous nature and to their correlation with higher brain functions. Recently, it has been reported that gamma oscillations in the hippocampus of behaving rodents are segregated in two distinct frequency bands: slow and fast. These two gamma rhythms correspond to different states of the network, but their origin has been not yet clarified. Here, we show theoretically and numerically that a single inhibitory population can give rise to coexisting slow and fast gamma rhythms corresponding to collective oscillations of a balanced spiking network. The slow and fast gamma rhythms are generated via two different mechanisms: the fast one being driven by the coordinated tonic neural firing and the slow one by endogenous fluctuations due to irregular neural activity. We show that almost instantaneous stimulations can switch the collective gamma oscillations from slow to fast and vice versa. Furthermore, to make a closer contact with the experimental observations, we consider the modulation of the gamma rhythms induced by a slower (theta) rhythm driving the network dynamics. In this context, depending on the strength of the forcing, we observe phase-amplitude and phase-phase coupling between the fast and slow gamma oscillations and the theta forcing. Phase-phase coupling reveals different theta-phases preferences for the two coexisting gamma rhythms.</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Postnatal Increases in Axonal Conduction Velocity of an Identified Drosophila Interneuron Require Fast Sodium, L-Type Calcium and Shaker Potassium Channels</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;During early postnatal life, speed up of signal propagation through many central and peripheral neurons has been associated with an increase in axon diameter or/and myelination. Especially in unmyelinated axons postnatal adjustments of axonal membrane conductances is potentially a third mechanism but solid evidence is lacking. Here we show that axonal action potential conduction velocity in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; giant fiber interneuron (GF), that is required for fast long distance signal conduction through the escape circuit, is increased by 80% during the first day of adult life. Genetic manipulations indicate that this postnatal increase in action potential conduction velocity in the unmyelinated GF axon is likely owed to adjustments of ion channel expression or properties rather than axon diameter increases. Specifically, targeted RNAi knockdown of either Para fast voltage-gated sodium, Shaker potassium (&lt;i&gt;Kv1&lt;/i&gt; homologue), or surprisingly, L-type like calcium channels counteracts postnatal increases in GF axonal conduction velocity. By contrast, the calcium-dependent potassium channel Slowpoke (BK) is not essential for postnatal speeding, though it also significantly increases conduction velocity. Therefore, we identified multiple ion channels that function to support fast axonal action potential conduction velocity, but only a subset of these are regulated during early postnatal life to maximize conduction velocity. Despite its large diameter (~ 7µm) and postnatal regulation of multiple ionic conductances, mature GF axonal conduction velocity is still 20-60 times slower than that of vertebrate Aβ sensory axons and α motoneurons, thus unraveling the limits of long range information transfer speed through invertebrate circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; An effective mechanism to increase information processing speed through neural circuits is enhancing plasma membrane insulation through optimizing myelination, a means that cannot be capitalized on un-myelinated invertebrate axons. We identify postnatal adjustments of the expression levels of fast sodium, Shaker potassium, and L-type calcium channels as a mechanism to almost double axonal conduction velocity in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; giant fiber axon, the core component for long range information transfer through a neural circuit optimized for fast escape responses. However, despite the regulation of multiple ion channels, mature giant fiber axonal conduction velocity still lacks magnitudes of order behind that of myelinated vertebrate fibers, thus hinting to long distance information transfer as a size-constrain in the evolution of invertebrate circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;A crucial step in understanding visual input is its organization into meaningful components, in particular object contours and partially occluded background structures. This requires that all contours are assigned to either the foreground or the background (border ownership assignment). While earlier studies showed that neurons in primate extrastriate cortex signal border ownership for simple geometric shapes, recent studies show consistent border ownership coding also for complex natural scenes. In order to understand how the brain performs this task, we developed a biologically plausible recurrent neural network that is fully image computable. Our model uses local edge detector () cells and grouping () cells whose activity represents proto-objects based on the integration of local feature information.  cells send modulatory feedback connections to those  cells that caused their activation, making the  cells border ownership selective. We found close agreement between our model and neurophysiological results in terms of the timing of border ownership signals (BOSs) as well as the consistency of BOSs across scenes. We also benchmarked our model on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and achieved performance comparable to recent state-of-the-art computer vision approaches. Our proposed model provides insight into the cortical mechanisms of figure-ground organization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Copy number variation (CNV) at chromosomal region 15q11.2 is linked to increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and schizophrenia. A significant gene at this locus is cytoplasmic fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) interacting protein 1 (&lt;i&gt;CYFIP1&lt;/i&gt;). CYFIP1 protein interacts with FMRP, whose monogenic absence causes fragile X syndrome (FXS). &lt;i&gt;Fmrp&lt;/i&gt; knock-out has been shown to reduce tonic GABAergic inhibition by interacting with the -subunit of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R). Using &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization (ISH), qPCR, Western blotting techniques, and patch clamp electrophysiology in brain slices from a &lt;i&gt;Cyfip1&lt;/i&gt; haploinsufficient mouse, we examined -subunit mediated tonic inhibition in the dentate gyrus (DG). In wild-type (WT) mice, DG granule cells (DGGCs) responded to the -subunit-selective agonist THIP with significantly increased tonic currents. In heterozygous mice, no significant difference was observed in THIP-evoked currents in DGGCs. Phasic GABAergic inhibition in DGGC was also unaltered with no difference in properties of spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs). Additionally, we demonstrate that DG granule cell layer (GCL) parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-INs) have functional -subunit-mediated tonic GABAergic currents which, unlike DGGC, are also modulated by the α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-selective drug zolpidem. Similar to DGGC, both IPSCs and THIP-evoked currents in PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-INs were not different between &lt;i&gt;Cyfip1&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous and WT mice. Supporting our electrophysiological data, we found no significant change in hippocampal -subunit mRNA expression or protein level and no change in α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/α&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-subunit mRNA expression. Thus, &lt;i&gt;Cyfip1&lt;/i&gt; haploinsufficiency, mimicking human 15q11.2 microdeletion syndrome, does not alter hippocampal phasic or tonic GABAergic inhibition, substantially differing from the &lt;i&gt;Fmrp&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Nerve injuries are a common clinical problem and cause inconvenience in daily life. It is of great importance to get a full understanding of the biological processes and molecular mechanisms underlying nerve injury to find and target specific molecules in nerve regeneration. Numerous studies have shown that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) participate in diverse biological processes and diseases. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) are two major groups of ncRNAs, which attract growing attention. The expression of lncRNAs and circRNAs are altered following nerve injury and are associated with nerve regeneration. This review will give a brief introduction of the origins, characteristics and classifications of lncRNAs and circRNAs. We then summarize the current studies on lncRNAs and circRNAs following peripheral nerve injury and spinal cord injury. Typical lncRNAs and circRNAs are introduced to illustrate the diverse molecular mechanisms. In addition, we also discuss some issues to be addressed in future investigations on lncRNAs and circRNAs.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Recruitment, Retainment, and Biomarkers of Response; A Pilot Trial of Lithium in Humans With Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>

	<description>Lithium has been used for decades to treat Bipolar Disorder. Some of its therapeutic benefits may be through inhibition of Glycogen Synthase Kinase (GSK)-3. Enhanced GSK3 activity associates with development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), therefore lithium is a currently used therapeutic with potential to be repurposed for prevention of Dementia. An important step towards a clinical trial for AD prevention using lithium is to establish the dose of lithium that blocks GSK3 in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a high-risk condition for progression to AD. We investigated volunteer recruitment, retention and tolerance in this population, and assessed biomarkers of GSK3 in MCI compared to control and after lithium treatment.
Recruitment was close to target, with higher than anticipated interest. Drop out was not related to lithium blood concentration. Indeed, 33% of the withdrawals were in the first week of very low dose lithium. Most made it through to the highest dose of lithium with no adverse events. We analysed 18 potential biomarkers of GSK3 biology in rat PBMCs, but only 4 of these gave a robust reproducible baseline signal. The only biomarker that was modified by acute lithium injection in the rat was the inhibitory phosphorylation of Ser9 of GSK3beta (enhanced in PBMCs) and this associated with reduced activity of GSK3beta. In contrast to the rat PBMC preparations the protein quality of the human PBMC preparations was extremely variable. There was no difference between GSK3 biomarkers in MCI and control PBMC preparations and no significant effect of chronic lithium on the robust GSK3 biomarkers, indicating that the dose reached may not be sufficient to modify these markers. 
In summary, the high interest from the MCI population, and the lack of any adverse events, suggest that it would be relatively straightforward and safe to recruit to a larger clinical trial within this dosing regimen. However, it is clear that we will need an improved PBMC isolation process along with more robust, sensitive and validated biomarkers of GSK3 function, in order to use GSK3 pathway regulation in human PBMC preparations as a biomarker of GSK3 inhibitor efficacy, within a clinical trial setting.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Can Brain Waves Really Tell If a Product Will Be Purchased? Inferring Consumer Preferences From Single-Item Brain Potentials</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00019</guid>

	<description>Recent research has shown that event-related brain potentials (ERPs) recorded while participants view lists of different consumer goods can be modulated by their preferences towards these products. However, it remains largely unknown whether ERP activity specific to a single consumer item can be informative about whether or not this item will be preferred in a shopping context. In this study, we examined whether single-item ERPs could reliably predict consumer preferences towards specific consumer goods. We recorded scalp EEG from 40 participants while they were viewing pictures of consumer goods and we subsequently asked them to indicate their preferences for each of these items. Replicating previous results, we found that ERP activity averaged over the six most preferred products was significantly differentiated from ERP activity averaged across the six least preferred products for three ERP components: The N200, the late positive potential (LPP) and positive slow waves (PSW). We also found that using single-item ERPs to infer behavioural preferences about specific consumer goods led to an overall accuracy of 71%, although this figure varied according to which ERPs were targeted. Later positivities such as the late posterior positivity (LPP) and positive slow waves (PSW) yielded relatively higher predictive accuracy rates than the frontal N200.  Our results suggest that ERPs related to single consumer items can be relatively accurate predictors of behavioural preferences depending on which type of ERP effects are chosen by the researcher, and ultimately on the level of prediction errors that users choose to tolerate.</description>

	<description>Brand extension is a marketing strategy leveraging well-established brand to promote new offerings provided as goods or service. The previous neurophysiological studies on goods-to-goods brand extension have proposed that categorization and semantic memory processes are involved in brand extension evaluation. However, it is unknown whether these same processes also underlie service-to-service brand extension. The present study, therefore, aims to investigate neural processes in consumers underlying their judgement of service-to-service brand extension. Specifically, we investigated human electroencephalographic responses to extended services that were commonly considered to fit well or badly with parent brand among consumers. For this purpose, we proposed a new stimulus grouping method to find commonly acceptable or unacceptable service extensions. In the experiment, participants reported the acceptability of fifty-six brand extension pairs, consisting of parent brand name (S1) and extended service name (S2). From individual acceptability responses, we assigned each pair to one of the three fit levels: high- (i.e. highly acceptable), low-, and mid-fit. Next, we selected stimuli that received high/low-fit evaluations from a majority of participants (i.e. &amp;gt; 85%) and assigned them to a high/low population-fit group. A comparison of event-related potentials (ERPs) between population-fit groups through a paired t-test showed significant differences in the fronto-central N2 and fronto-parietal P300 amplitudes. We further evaluated inter-subject variability of these ERP components by a decoding analysis that classified N2 and/or P300 amplitudes into a high, or low population-fit class using a support vector machine. Leave-one-subject-out validation revealed classification accuracy of 60.35% with N2 amplitudes, 78.95 % with P300 and 73.68% with both, indicating a relatively high inter-subject variability of N2 but low for P300. This validation showed that fronto-parietal P300 reflected neural processes more consistent across subjects in service-to-service brand extension. We further observed that the left frontal P300 amplitude was increased as fit-level increased across stimuli, indicating a semantic retrieval process to evaluate a semantic link between S1 and S2. Parietal P300 showed a higher amplitude in the high population-fit group, reflecting a similarity-based categorization process. In sum, our results suggest that service-to-service brand extension evaluation may share similar neural processes with goods-to-goods brand extension.</description>

	<description>In Huntington’s disease (HD), while the ubiquitously expressed mutant Huntingtin (mtHTT) protein primarily compromises striatal and cortical neurons, glia also undergo disease-contributing alterations. Existing HD models using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have not extensively characterized the role of mtHTT in patient-derived astrocytes. Here physiologically mature astrocytes are generated from HD patient iPSCs. These human astrocytes exhibit hallmark HD phenotypes that occur in mouse models, including impaired inwards rectifying K+ currents, lengthened spontaneous Ca2+ waves and reduced cell membrane capacitance. HD astrocytes in co-culture provided reduced support for the maturation of iPSC-derived neurons. In addition, neurons exposed to chronic glutamate stimulation are not protected by HD astrocytes. This iPSC-based HD model demonstrates the critical effects of mtHTT on human astrocytes, which not only broadens the understanding of disease susceptibility beyond cortical and striatal neurons but also increases potential drug targets.</description>

	<description>Animal behavior is the final and integrated output of brain activity. Thus, recording and analyzing behavior is critical to understand the underlying brain function. While recording animal behavior has become easier than ever with the development of compact and inexpensive devices, detailed behavioral data analysis requires sufficient previous knowledge and/or high content data such as video images of animal postures, which makes it difficult for most of the animal behavioral data to be efficiently analyzed to understand brain function. Here, we report a versatile method using a hybrid supervised/unsupervised machine learning approach to efficiently estimate behavioral states and to extract important behavioral features only from low-content animal trajectory data. As proof of principle experiments, we analyzed trajectory data of worms, fruit flies, rats, and bats in the laboratories, and penguins and flying seabirds in the wild, which were recorded with various methods and span a wide range of spatiotemporal scales—from mm to 1000 km in space and from sub-seconds to days in time. We estimated several states during behavior and comprehensively extracted characteristic features from a behavioral state and/or a specific experimental condition. Physiological and genetic experiments in worms revealed that the extracted behavioral features reflected specific neural or gene activities. Thus, our method provides a versatile and unbiased way to extract behavioral features from simple trajectory data to understand brain function.</description>

	<description>K-complexes identification is a challenging task in sleep research. The detection of k-complexes in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals based on visual inspection is time-consuming, prone to errors, and requires well-trained knowledge. Many existing methods for k-complexes detection rely mainly on analysing EEG signals in time and frequency domains. In this study, an efficient method is proposed to detect k-complexes from EEG signals based on the fractal dimension (FD) of time-frequency (T-F) images coupled with undirected graph features. Firstly, the EEG signal is partitioned into smaller segments using a sliding window technique. Each EEG segment is passed through a spectrogram of short time Fourier transform (STFT) to obtain T-F images. Secondly, the box-counting method is applied to each T-F image to estimate and discover the FDs in EEG signals. A vector of FD features are extracted from each T-F image and then mapped into an undirected graph.  The structural properties of the graphs are used as the representative features of the original EEG signals for the input of a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier. Key graphic features are extracted from the undirected graphs. The extracted graph features are forwarded to the LS-SVM for classification. To investigate the classification ability of the proposed feature extraction combined with the LS-SVM classifier, the extracted features are also forwarded to a k-means classifier for comparison. The proposed method is compared with several existing k-complexes detection methods in which the same datasets were used. The findings of this study shows that the proposed method yields better classification results than other existing methods in the literature. An average accuracy of 97% for the detection of the k-complexes is obtained using the proposed method. The proposed method could lead to an efficient tool for the scoring of automatic sleep stages which could be useful for doctors and neurologists in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders and for sleep research</description>

	<description>Indentifying lateralization of bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a challenging issue, scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and routine band electrocorticography (ECoG) fail to reveal the epileptogenic focus for further temporal lobectomy treatment. HFOs can be utilized as a biomarker for lateralizing the onset zone in suspected bitemporal epilepsy. Except subjective vision detect the HFOs, objective verification should be performed to raising the accuracy. In present research, we prospectively studied 10 patients with refractory temporal seizures and underwent electrocorticography (ECoG) with wide-band frequency amplifiers (2048Hz), all patients had a Class I outcome after temporal resection. Pre- and ictal HFOs will be analyzed by wavelet transform (WT) and Granger causality (GC) for objectively verifying lateralization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). WT analysis showed ictal HFOs in 10 patients mainly covered from 80Hz to 115 Hz (average, 92.59 ± 10.23Hz ), and there was distinct band-pass boundary between pre-ictal HFOs and ictal HFOs. GC analysis showed 5 patients (2, 4, 5, 6, 7), no matter pre-ictal or ictal state, had highest GC degree in SOZ itself. The remaining patients (1, 3, 8, 9, 10) had highest GC degree in SOZ with its adjacent regions in pre-ictal and ictal stage. GC analysis further confirmed the result of WT, and suggested HFOs is initiated and propagated in local brain region mainly, afterwards, transmitting to adjacent brain regions. These results indicated that combination of WT and GC analysis significantly contribute to accurate lateralizing patients with suspected bitemporal epilepsy.</description>

	<description>Time is a continuous, homogeneous, one-way and independent signal that cannot be modified by human will. Nearly 2,500 ago, Aristotle contended that, “time is the most unknown of all unknown things.” However, both humans and other animals have the ability to perceive time, and it is extremely easy to reproduce the time interval between two consecutive events. This ability to sense time is the basis of many normal cognitive activities, such as listening, speaking, and motion control. Although we constantly use our ability to perceive time, we do not know how our brain processes it. At present, time processing is generally divided into three categories: millisecond scale processing, second scale processing, and circadian rhythms. Different time processing scales correspond to different time processing mechanisms. The millisecond-scale processing range we have studied has a great effect on human perception and motion processing. This paper presents a model that uses spike neuron to construct a complete circuit for temporal processing. By combining the time-adaptive drift-diffusion model (TDDMs) with the transmission of impulse information between neurons, this new model is able to successfully reproduce the synchronization-continuation tapping task (SCT) experiments results. We also discovered that the neurons we used exhibited some of the firing properties of the time-related neurons detected by electrophysiological experiments. Therefore we believe that our model is closer to the neural circuit in the biological brain and can explain some of the phenomena in the temporal perception process.</description>

	<description>The successful introduction of innovative treatment strategies into clinical practice strongly depends on the availability of effective experimental models and their reliable pre-clinical assessment. Considering pre-clinical research for peripheral nerve repair and reconstruction, the far most used nerve regeneration model in the last decades is the sciatic nerve injury and repair model. More recently, the use of the median nerve injury and repair model has gained increasing attention due to some significant advantages it provides compared to sciatic nerve injury. Outstanding advantages are the availability of reliable behavioural tests for assessing posttraumatic voluntary motor recovery and a much lower impact on the animal wellbeing. In this article, the potential application of the median nerve injury and repair model in pre-clinical research is reviewed. In addition, we provide a synthetic overview of a variety of methods that can be applied in this model for nerve regeneration assessment. This article is aimed at helping researchers in adequately adopting this in vivo model for pre-clinical evaluation of peripheral nerve reconstruction as well as for interpreting the results in a translational perspective.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neuropathic Pain Induced Alterations in the Opioidergic Modulation of a Descending Pain Facilitatory Area of the Brain</title>

	<description>Opioids play a major role at descending pain modulation but the effects of neuropathic pain on the brain opioidergic system remain understudied. Since descending facilitation is enhanced during neuropathic pain, we studied the opioidergic modulation of the dorsal reticular nucleus (DRt), a medullary pain facilitatory area, in the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain. We first performed a series of behavioral experiments in naïve-animals to establish the role of MOR in the effects of endogenous and exogenous opioids at the DRt. Specifically, we showed that lentiviral-mediated MOR-knockdown at the DRt increased sensitivity to thermal and mechanical stimuli while the MOR agonist DAMGO induced the opposite effects. Additionally, we showed that MOR-knock down and the pharmacological blockade of MOR by CATP at the DRt decreased and inhibited, respectively, the analgesic effects of systemic morphine. Then, we performed in vivo microdialysis to measure enkephalin peptides in the DRt and evaluated mu-opioid receptor (MOR) expression in the DRt at mRNA, protein and phosphorylated form levels by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. SNI-animals, compared to sham control, showed higher levels of enkephalin peptides, lower MOR-labelled cells without alterations in MOR mRNA levels, and higher phosphorylated MOR-labeled cells. Finally, we performed behavioral studies in SNI animals to determine the potency of systemic morphine and the effects of the pharmacologic and genetic manipulation of MOR at the DRt. We showed a reduced potency of the antiallodynic effects of systemic morphine in SNI-animals compared to the antinociceptive effects in sham animals. Increasing MOR-cells at the DRt of SNI-animals by lentiviral-mediated MOR-overexpression produced no effects on mechanical allodynia. DAMGO induced antiallodynia only after MOR-overexpression. These results show that MOR inhibits DRt pain facilitatory actions and that this action contributes to the analgesic effects of systemic opioids. We further show that the inhibitory function of MOR is impaired during neuropathic pain. This is likely due to desensitization and degradation of MOR which are adaptations of the receptor that can be triggered by MOR phosphorylation. Skipping counter-regulatory pathways involved in MOR adaptations might restore the opioidergic inhibition at pain facilitatory areas.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Pericytes and Neurovascular Function in the Healthy and Diseased Brain</title>

	<description>Pericytes are multi-functional cells embedded within the walls of capillaries throughout the body, including the brain. Pericytes were first identified in the 1870s, but little attention was paid to them during the following century. More recently, numerous vascular functions of pericytes have been identified including regulation of cerebral blood flow, maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, and control of vascular development and angiogenesis. Pericytes can also facilitate neuroinflammatory processes and possess stem cell-like properties. Pericytes form part of the neurovascular unit, a collection of cells that control interactions between neurons and the cerebral vasculature to meet the energy demands of the brain. Pericyte structure, expression profile, and function in the brain differ depending on their location along the vascular bed. Until recently, it has been difficult to accurately define the sub-types of pericytes, or to specifically target pericytes with pharmaceutical agents, but emerging techniques both in vitro and in vivo will improve investigation of pericytes and allow for the identification of their possible roles in diseases. Pericyte dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a contributor to the progression of vascular diseases such as stroke and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. The therapeutic potential of pericytes to repair cerebral blood vessels and promote angiogenesis due to their ability to behave like stem cells has recently been brought to light. Here, we review the history of pericyte research, the present techniques used to study pericytes in the brain, and current research advancements to characterize and therapeutically target pericytes in the future.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Novel Experimental Model to Determine the Axon-Promoting Effects of Grafted Cells After Peripheral Nerve Injury</title>

	<description>Although peripheral nerves can regenerate, clinical outcomes after peripheral nerve injuries are not always satisfactory, especially in cases of severe or proximal injuries. Further, autologous nerve grafting remains the gold standard for the reconstruction of peripheral nerves, although this method is still accompanied by issues of donor-site morbidity and limited supply. Cell therapy is a potential approach to overcome these issues. However, the optimal cell type for promoting axon regeneration remains unknown. Here, we report a novel experimental model dedicated to elucidation of the axon-promoting effects of candidate cell types using simple and standardized techniques. This model uses rat sciatic nerves and consists of a 25 mm-long acellular region and a crush site at each end. The acellular region was made by repeated freeze/thaw procedures with liquid nitrogen. Importantly, the new model does not require microsurgical procedures, which are technically demanding and greatly affect axon regeneration. To test the actual utility of this model, red fluorescent protein-expressing syngeneic Schwann cells (SCs), marrow stromal cells, or fibroblasts were grafted into the acellular area, followed by perfusion of the rat 2 weeks later. All types of grafted cells survived well. Quantification of regenerating axons demonstrated that SCs, but not the other cell types, promoted axon regeneration with minimum variability. Thus, this model is useful for differentiating the effects of various grafted cell types in axon regeneration. Interestingly, regardless of the grafted cell type, host SCs migrated into the acellular area, and the extent of axon regeneration was strongly correlated with the number of SCs. Moreover, all regenerating axons were closely associated with SCs. These findings suggest a critical role for SCs in peripheral nerve axon regeneration. Collectively, this novel experimental model is useful for elucidating the axon-promoting effects of grafted cells and for analyzing the biology of peripheral nerve axon regeneration.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Glutaminase C Regulates Microglial Activation and Pro-inflammatory Exosome Release: Relevance to the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>Microglia activation is a key pathogenic process at the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Identifying regulators of microglia activation bears great potential in elucidating causes and mechanisms of AD and determining candidates for early intervention. Previous studies demonstrate abnormal elevation of glutaminase C (GAC) in HIV-infected or immune-activated microglia. However, whether GAC elevation causes microglia activation remains unknown. In this study, we found heightened expression levels of GAC in early AD mouse brain tissues compared with those in control littermates. Investigations on cell types involved revealed that GAC is increased in primary mouse microglia following pro-inflammatory stimulation. To model GAC elevation we overexpressed GAC by plasmid transfection and observed that GAC-overexpression shift the microglial phenotype to a pro-inflammatory state. Treatment with BPTES, a glutaminase inhibitor, reversed LPS-induced microglia activation and inflammation. Furthermore, we discovered that GAC overexpression in mouse microglia increased exosome release and changed exosome content, which includes specific packaging of pro-inflammatory miRNAs that activate microglia. Together, our results demonstrate a causal effect of GAC elevation on microglia activation and exosome release, which promote the establishment of pro-inflammatory environment. Therefore, GAC may serve as a promising candidate for early diagnosis and intervention of AD.</description>

	<description>The aim of this review is to summarize the effect of human intestinal microbiome on cognitive impairments and to focus primarily on the impact of diet and eating habits on learning processes. Better understanding of the microbiome could revolutionize the possibilities of therapy for many diseases. The authors performed a literature review of available studies on the research topic describing influence of human microbiome and diet on cognitive impairment or learning processes found in the world’s acknowledged databases Web of Science, PubMed, Springer, and Scopus. The digestive tube is populated by billions of living microorganisms including viruses, bacteria, protozoa, helminths, and microscopic fungi. In adulthood, under physiological conditions, the intestinal microbiome appears to be relatively steady. However, it is not true that it would not be influenced, both in the positive sense of the word and in the negative one. The basic pillars that maintain a steady microbiome are genetics, lifestyle, diet and eating habits, geography, and age. It is reported that the gastrointestinal tract and the brain communicate with each other through several pathways and one can speak about gut-brain axis. New evidence is published every year about the association of intestinal dysbiosis and neurological/psychiatric diseases. On the other hand, specific diets and eating habits can have positive effect on a balanced microbiota composition and thus contribute to the enhancement of cognitive functions, which are important for any learning process.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Markers of Novelty Processing in Older Adults Are Stable and Reliable</title>

	<description>Exploratory behavior and responsiveness to novelty play an important role in maintaining cognitive function in older adults. Inferences about age- or disease-related differences in neural and behavioral responses to novelty are most often based on results from single experimental testing sessions. There has been very limited research on whether such findings represent stable characteristics of populations studied, which is essential if investigators are to determine the result of interventions aimed at promoting exploratory behaviors or draw appropriate conclusions about differences in the processing of novelty across diverse clinical groups. The goal of the current study was to investigate the short-term test-retest reliability of event-related potential (ERP) and behavioral responses to novel stimuli in cognitively normal older adults. ERPs and viewing durations were recorded in 70 healthy older adults participating in a subject-controlled visual novelty oddball task during two sessions occurring seven weeks apart. Mean midline P3 amplitude and latency, mean midline amplitude during successive 50ms intervals, temporospatial factors derived from principal component analysis, and viewing duration in response to novel stimuli were measured during each session.  ANOVAs revealed no reliable differences in the value of any measurements between time 1 and 2. Intraclass correlations (ICCs) between time 1 and 2 were excellent for mean P3 amplitude (ICC = .86), the temporospatial factors consistent with the P3 components (ICC of .88 and .76 respectively) and viewing duration of novel stimuli (ICC=.81). Reliability was only fair for P3 peak latency (ICC=.56). Successive 50ms mean amplitude measures from 100-1000ms yielded fair to excellent reliabilities, and all but one of the 12 temporospatial factors identified demonstrated ICCs in the good to excellent range. We conclude that older adults demonstrate substantial stability in ERP and behavioral responses to novel visual stimuli over a seven-week period. These results suggest that older adults may have a characteristic way of processing novelty that appears resistant to transient changes in their environment or internal states, which can be indexed during a single testing session. The establishment of reliable measures of novelty processing will allow investigators to determine whether proposed interventions have an impact on this important aspect of behavior.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Long Term Cosmetic Application Improves Tactile Discrimination in the Elderly; a New Psychophysical Approach</title>

	<description>Introduction: Tactile sensitivity is impaired in older adults, which contributes to the loss of manual dexterity and mobility function. The reliability of classical psychophysical tests, such as two-point gap discrimination, has been questioned. Here we tested a new method to determine tactile acuity during dynamic touch, which is more functional than static touch. The aim was to validate a method providing a high level of discrimination of tactile acuity in the elderly.
Methods: We tested the ability of subjects to evaluating the distance between bands printed on poly-methyl-methacrylate sheets. Pairs of sheets were compared in two groups of participants aged from 60 to 74 years; the test group was required to apply a cosmetic foam with an active ingredient on both their hands twice a day for one month, the control group had an identical task, but used the same cosmetic foam without any active ingredient. The tests were run in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 
Results: The tactile discrimination threshold decreased by 83 µm after one month of cosmetic application in the group using the active ingredient while it was unchanged in the control group. 
Discussion: The test presented here provided highly accurate results and should be useful to determine tactile performance. It allows the monitoring of tactile rehabilitation and/or skin treatments used to restore tactile acuity in the elderly.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Gray Matter Densities in Limbic Areas and APOE4 Independently Predict Cognitive Decline in Normal Brain Aging</title>

	<description>Cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies reported significant associations between gray matter (GM) density changes in various limbic and neocortical areas and worst cognitive performances in elderly controls. Longitudinal studies in this field remain scarce and led to conflicting data. We report a clinico-radiological investigation of 380 cognitively preserved individuals who undergo neuropsychological assessment at baseline and after 18 months. All cases were assessed using a continuous cognitive score taking into account the global evolution of neuropsychological performances. The vast majority of Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) 29 and 30 cases showed equal or worst performance at follow-up due to a ceiling effect. GM densities, white matter hyperintensities and arterial spin labeling (ASL) values were assessed in the hippocampus, amygdala, mesial temporal and parietal cortex at inclusion using 3 Tesla MRI Scans. Florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid was available in a representative subsample of 64 cases. Regional amyloid uptake ratios (SUVr), mean cortical SUVr values (mcSUVr) and corresponding z-scores were calculated. Linear regression models were built to explore the association between the continuous cognitive score and imaging variables. The presence of an APOE-ε4 allele was negatively related to the continuous cognitive score. Among the areas studied, significant associations were found between GM densities in the hippocampus and amygdala but not mesial temporal and parietal areas and continuous cognitive score. Neither ASL values, Fazekas score nor mean and regional PET amyloid load were related to the cognitive score. In multivariate models, the presence of APOE-ε4 allele and GM densities in the hippocampus and amygdala were independently associated with worst cognitive evolution at follow-up. Our data support the idea that early GM damage in the hippocampus and amygdala occur long before the emergence of the very first signs of cognitive failure in brain aging.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Executive Functioning, Muscle Power and Reactive Balance Are Major Contributors to Gait Adaptability in People With Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>BACKGROUND AND AIM: The ability to adapt gait when negotiating unexpected hazards is crucial to maintain stability and avoid falling. This study investigated cognitive, physical and psychological factors associated with gait adaptability required for obstacle and stepping target negotiation in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD).
METHODS: Fifty-four people with PD were instructed to either (a) avoid an obstacle at usual step distance or (b) step onto a target at either a short or long step distance projected on a walkway two heel strikes ahead and then continue walking. Participants also completed clinical (Hoehn and Yahr rating scale; Movement Disorders Society version of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale motor section [MDS-UPDRS-III]), cognitive (simple reaction time, Trail Making and Stroop stepping [difference between incongruent and standard choice stepping reaction time] tests), physical (hip abductor muscle power and reactive balance [pull test from the MDS-UPDRS-III]) and psychological (Fall Efficacy Scale–International) assessments.
RESULTS: Discriminant function analysis revealed Stroop stepping test (inhibitory control) performance was the best predictor of stepping errors across the gait adaptability test conditions. Poorer executive function (Trail Making test) and reactive balance predicted poorer stepping accuracy in the short target condition; poorer reactive balance predicted increased number of steps taken to approach the obstacle and the long target; and poorer executive function predicted obstacle avoidance. Weaker hip abductor muscle power, poorer reactive balance, slower reaction time, poorer executive function and higher concern about falling were significant predictors of shorter step length while negotiating the obstacle/targets.
CONCLUSIONS: Superior executive function, effective reactive balance and good muscle power were associated with successful gait adaptability. Executive function and reactive balance appear particularly important for precise foot placements; and cognitive capacity for step length adjustments for avoiding obstacles. These findings suggest that impaired inhibitory control contributes to stepping errors and may increase fall risk in people with PD. These findings help elucidate mechanisms for why people with PD fall and may facilitate fall risk assessments and fall prevention strategies for this group.</description>

	<description>Previous studies investigating working memory performance in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have mainly focused on the neural mechanisms of alterations in activation. To date, very few studies have investigated background network alterations in the working memory state. Therefore, the present study investigated the static and temporal dynamic changes in the background network in MCI patients during a working memory task.
A hybrid delayed-match-to-sample task was used to examine working memory performance in MCI patients. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected and the marker of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) was used to investigate alterations in the background network.
The present study demonstrated static and dynamic alterations of ALFF in MCI patients during working memory tasks, relative to the resting state. Traditional static analysis revealed that ALFF decreased in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and left supplementary motor area for normal controls (NCs) in the working memory state. However, the same regions showed increased ALFF in MCI patients. Furthermore, relative to NCs, MCI patients demonstrated altered performance-related functional connectivity (FC) patterns, with the right VLPFC and right DLPFC as ROIs. In terms of temporal dynamic analysis, the present study found that in the working memory state dynamic ALFF of bilateral thalamus regions was increased in NCs but decreased in MCI patients. Additionally, MCI patients demonstrated altered performance-related coefficient of variation patterns; the regions in MCI patients were larger, and more widely distributed in the parietal and temporal lobes, relative to NCs.
This is the first study to examine static and temporal dynamic alterations of ALFF in the background network of MCI patients in working memory states. The results extend previous studies by providing a new perspective on the neural mechanisms of working memory deficits in MCI patients.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Interactions between a subset of substrate side chains and AAA+ motor pore loops determine grip during protein unfolding</title>

	<description>Most AAA+ remodeling motors denature proteins by pulling on the peptide termini of folded substrates, but it is not well-understood how motors produce grip when resisting a folded domain. Here, at single amino-acid resolution, we identify the determinants of grip by measuring how substrate tail sequences alter the unfolding activity of the unfoldase-protease ClpXP. The seven amino acids abutting a stable substrate domain are key, with residues 2-6 forming a core that contributes most significantly to grip. ClpX grips large hydrophobic and aromatic side chains strongly and small, polar, or charged side chains weakly. Multiple side chains interact with pore loops synergistically to strengthen grip. In combination with recent structures, our results support a mechanism in which unfolding grip is primarily mediated by non-specific van der Waal's interactions between core side chains of the substrate tail and a subset of YVG loops at the top of the ClpX axial pore.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sex Classification by Resting State Brain Connectivity</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;A large amount of brain imaging research has focused on group studies delineating differences between males and females with respect to both cognitive performance as well as structural and functional brain organization. To supplement existing findings, the present study employed a machine learning approach to assess how accurately participants’ sex can be classified based on spatially specific resting state (RS) brain connectivity, using 2 samples from the Human Connectome Project (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;1 = 434, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;2 = 310) and 1 fully independent sample from the 1000BRAINS study (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 941). The classifier, which was trained on 1 sample and tested on the other 2, was able to reliably classify sex, both within sample and across independent samples, differing both with respect to imaging parameters and sample characteristics. Brain regions displaying highest sex classification accuracies were mainly located along the cingulate cortex, medial and lateral frontal cortex, temporoparietal regions, insula, and precuneus. These areas were stable across samples and match well with previously described sex differences in functional brain organization. While our data show a clear link between sex and regionally specific brain connectivity, they do not support a clear-cut dimorphism in functional brain organization that is driven by sex alone.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

To make good judgments people gather information. An important problem an agent needs to solve is when to continue sampling data and when to stop gathering evidence. We examine whether and how the desire to hold a certain belief influences the amount of information participants require to form that belief. Participants completed a sequential sampling task in which they were incentivized to accurately judge whether they were in a desirable state, which was associated with greater rewards than losses, or an undesirable state, which was associated with greater losses than rewards. While one state was better than the other, participants had no control over which they were in, and to maximize rewards they had to maximize accuracy. Results show that participants’ judgments were biased towards believing they were in the desirable state. They required a smaller proportion of supporting evidence to reach that conclusion and ceased gathering samples earlier when reaching the desirable conclusion. The findings were replicated in an additional sample of participants. To examine how this behavior was generated we modeled the data using a drift-diffusion model. This enabled us to assess two potential mechanisms which could be underlying the behavior: (i) a valence-dependent response bias and/or (ii) a valence-dependent process bias. We found that a valence-dependent model, with both a response bias and a process bias, fit the data better than a range of other alternatives, including valence-independent models and models with only a response or process bias. Moreover, the valence-dependent model provided better out-of-sample prediction accuracy than the valence-independent model. Our results provide an account for how the motivation to hold a certain belief decreases the need for supporting evidence. The findings also highlight the advantage of incorporating valence into evidence accumulation models to better explain and predict behavior.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Cl8U-dis_gE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Telling ecological networks apart by their structure: A computational challenge</title>

Ecologists have been compiling ecological networks for over a century, detailing the interactions between species in a variety of ecosystems. To this end, they have built networks for mutualistic (e.g., pollination, seed dispersal) as well as antagonistic (e.g., herbivory, parasitism) interactions. The type of interaction being represented is believed to be reflected in the structure of the network, which would differ substantially between mutualistic and antagonistic networks. Here, we put this notion to the test by attempting to determine the type of interaction represented in a network based solely on its structure. We find that, although it is easy to separate different kinds of nonecological networks, ecological networks display much structural variation, making it difficult to distinguish between mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. We therefore frame the problem as a challenge for the community of scientists interested in computational biology and machine learning. We discuss the features a good solution to this problem should possess and the obstacles that need to be overcome to achieve this goal.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jFX_1UQ6w0A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Emerging RNA-based approaches to disease detection and gene therapy require RNA sequences that fold into specific base-pairing patterns, but computational algorithms generally remain inadequate for these secondary structure design tasks. The Eterna project has crowdsourced RNA design to human video game players in the form of puzzles that reach extraordinary difficulty. Here, we demonstrate that Eterna participants’ moves and strategies can be leveraged to improve automated computational RNA design. We present an eternamoves-large repository consisting of 1.8 million of player moves on 12 of the most-played Eterna puzzles as well as an eternamoves-select repository of 30,477 moves from the top 72 players on a select set of more advanced puzzles. On eternamoves-select, we present a multilayer convolutional neural network (CNN) EternaBrain that achieves test accuracies of 51% and 34% in base prediction and location prediction, respectively, suggesting that top players’ moves are partially stereotyped. Pipelining this CNN’s move predictions with single-action-playout (SAP) of six strategies compiled by human players solves 61 out of 100 independent puzzles in the Eterna100 benchmark. EternaBrain-SAP outperforms previously published RNA design algorithms and achieves similar or better performance than a newer generation of deep learning methods, while being largely orthogonal to these other methods. Our study provides useful lessons for future efforts to achieve human-competitive performance with automated RNA design algorithms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eVwsgg3j8ts&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling the temporal dynamics of the gut microbial community in adults and infants</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006960</guid>

Given the highly dynamic and complex nature of the human gut microbial community, the ability to identify and predict time-dependent compositional patterns of microbes is crucial to our understanding of the structure and functions of this ecosystem. One factor that could affect such time-dependent patterns is microbial interactions, wherein community composition at a given time point affects the microbial composition at a later time point. However, the field has not yet settled on the degree of this effect. Specifically, it has been recently suggested that only a minority of taxa depend on the microbial composition in earlier times. To address the issue of identifying and predicting temporal microbial patterns we developed a new model, &lt;i&gt;MTV-LMM&lt;/i&gt; (Microbial Temporal Variability Linear Mixed Model), a linear mixed model for the prediction of microbial community temporal dynamics. &lt;i&gt;MTV-LMM&lt;/i&gt; can identify time-dependent microbes (i.e., microbes whose abundance can be predicted based on the previous microbial composition) in longitudinal studies, which can then be used to analyze the trajectory of the microbiome over time. We evaluated the performance of &lt;i&gt;MTV-LMM&lt;/i&gt; on real and synthetic time series datasets, and found that &lt;i&gt;MTV-LMM&lt;/i&gt; outperforms commonly used methods for microbiome time series modeling. Particularly, we demonstrate that the effect of the microbial composition in previous time points on the abundance of taxa at later time points is underestimated by a factor of at least 10 when applying previous approaches. Using &lt;i&gt;MTV-LMM&lt;/i&gt;, we demonstrate that a considerable portion of the human gut microbiome, both in infants and adults, has a significant time-dependent component that can be predicted based on microbiome composition in earlier time points. This suggests that microbiome composition at a given time point is a major factor in defining future microbiome composition and that this phenomenon is considerably more common than previously reported for the human gut microbiome.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bUNHI71-cmM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: From trainees to trainers to instructors: Sustainably building a national capacity in bioinformatics training</title>

Demand for training life scientists in bioinformatics skills led to the development of a train-the-trainer collaboration between the European Molecular Biology Laboratory–European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) and 2 Australian organisations, Bioplatforms Australia and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in 2012. The goal of the collaboration was to establish a group of trained instructors who could develop and deliver short bioinformatics courses nationally. A train-the-trainer course introduces instructors to aspects of andragogy and evidence-based learning principles to help them better design, develop, and deliver high-quality training. Since then, both the number of trainers in the network and the course portfolio have grown. Best practises have been developed and shared between the Australian cohort and EMBL-EBI to address common challenges in bioinformatics training. The Australian trainer cohort undertook a train-the-trainer instructor course, again with EMBL-EBI, and subsequently successfully delivered train-the-trainer courses to interested bioinformatics trainers within Australia. We conclude that a train-the-trainer approach can help build national capacity and maintain a critical mass of trained instructors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0orNwXygMTY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Neural correlates of sparse coding and dimensionality reduction</title>

Supported by recent computational studies, there is increasing evidence that a wide range of neuronal responses can be understood as an emergent property of nonnegative sparse coding (NSC), an efficient population coding scheme based on dimensionality reduction and sparsity constraints. We review evidence that NSC might be employed by sensory areas to efficiently encode external stimulus spaces, by some associative areas to conjunctively represent multiple behaviorally relevant variables, and possibly by the basal ganglia to coordinate movement. In addition, NSC might provide a useful theoretical framework under which to understand the often complex and nonintuitive response properties of neurons in other brain areas. Although NSC might not apply to all brain areas (for example, motor or executive function areas) the success of NSC-based models, especially in sensory areas, warrants further investigation for neural correlates in other regions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ju3LoE2aLno&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Augmenting subnetwork inference with information extracted from the scientific literature</title>

Many biological studies involve either (i) manipulating some aspect of a cell or its environment and then simultaneously measuring the effect on thousands of genes, or (ii) systematically manipulating each gene and then measuring the effect on some response of interest. A common challenge that arises in these studies is to explain how genes identified as relevant in the given experiment are organized into a subnetwork that accounts for the response of interest. The task of inferring a subnetwork is typically dependent on the information available in publicly available, structured databases, which suffer from incompleteness. However, a wealth of potentially relevant information resides in the scientific literature, such as information about genes associated with certain concepts of interest, as well as interactions that occur among various biological entities. We contend that by exploiting this information, we can improve the explanatory power and accuracy of subnetwork inference in multiple applications. Here we propose and investigate several ways in which information extracted from the scientific literature can be used to augment subnetwork inference. We show that we can use literature-extracted information to (i) augment the set of entities identified as being relevant in a subnetwork inference task, (ii) augment the set of interactions used in the process, and (iii) support targeted browsing of a large inferred subnetwork by identifying entities and interactions that are closely related to concepts of interest. We use this approach to uncover the pathways involved in interactions between a virus and a host cell, and the pathways that are regulated by a transcription factor associated with breast cancer. Our experimental results demonstrate that these approaches can provide more accurate and more interpretable subnetworks. Integer program code, background network data, and pathfinding code are available at https://github.com/Craven-Biostat-Lab/subnetwork_inference&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Xw51dbK6bek&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We have now reached the genomics era within medicine; genomics is being used to personalise treatment, make diagnoses, prognoses, and predict adverse outcomes resulting from treatment with certain drugs. Genomic data is now abundant in healthcare, and the newly created profession of clinical bioinformaticians are responsible for its analysis. In the United Kingdom, clinical bioinformaticians are trained within a 3-year programme, integrating a work-based placement with a part-time Master’s degree. As this profession is still developing, trainees can feel isolated from their peers whom are located in other hospitals and can find it difficult to gain the mentorship that they require to complete their training. Building strong networks or communities of practice (CoPs) and allowing sharing of knowledge and experiences is one solution to addressing this isolation. Within the Master’s delivered at the University of Manchester, we have integrated group-centred problem-based learning (PBL) using real clinical case studies worked on during each course unit. This approach is combined with a flipped style of teaching providing access to online content in our Virtual Learning Environment before the course. The face-to-face teaching is used to focus on the application of the students’ knowledge to clinical case studies. In this study, we conducted semistructured interviews with 8 students, spanning 3 cohorts of students. We evaluated the effectiveness of this style of teaching and whether it had contributed to the formation of CoPs between our students. Our findings demonstrated that this style of teaching was preferred by our students to a more traditional lecture-based format and that the problem-based learning approach enabled the formation of CoPs within these cohorts. These CoPs are valuable in the development of this new profession and assist with the production of new guidelines and policies that are helping to professionalise this new group of healthcare scientists.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hsFq88ds5HU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In mammalian olfaction, inhalation drives the temporal patterning of neural activity that underlies early olfactory processing. It remains poorly understood how the neural circuits that process incoming olfactory information are engaged in the context of inhalation-linked dynamics. Here, we used artificial inhalation and two-photon calcium imaging to compare the dynamics of activity evoked by odorant inhalation across major cell types of the mouse olfactory bulb (OB). We expressed GCaMP6f or jRGECO1a in mitral and tufted cell (MTC) subpopulations, olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), and two major juxtaglomerular interneuron classes and imaged responses to a single inhalation of odorant. Activity in all cell types was strongly linked to inhalation, and all cell types showed some variance in the latency, rise times, and durations of their inhalation-linked response. Juxtaglomerular interneuron dynamics closely matched that of sensory inputs, while MTCs showed the highest diversity in responses, with a range of latencies and durations that could not be accounted for by heterogeneity in sensory input dynamics. Diversity was apparent even among &quot;sister&quot; tufted cells innervating the same glomerulus. Surprisingly, inhalation-linked responses of MTCs were highly overlapping and could not be distinguished on the basis of their inhalation-linked dynamics, with the exception of a subpopulation of superficial tufted cells expressing cholecystokinin (CCK). Our results are consistent with a model in which diversity in inhalation-linked patterning of OB output arises first at the level of sensory input and is enhanced by feedforward inhibition from juxtaglomerular interneurons which differentially impact different subpopulations of OB output neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel plays a pivotal role in phototransduction and cellular calcium homeostasis. Mutations in the cone photoreceptor CNG channel subunits CNGA3 and CNGB3 are associated with achromatopsia and cone dystrophies. CNG channel deficiency leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated cone apoptosis, protein mislocalization, and ER calcium dysregulation. This work investigated the potential mechanisms of protein mislocalization associated with ER calcium dysregulation using &lt;i&gt;Cnga3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice lacking ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) specifically in cones. Deletion of &lt;i&gt;Ryr2&lt;/i&gt; improved outer segment (OS) localization of the cone proteins M-opsin, S-opsin, and cone phosphodiesterase subunit α' (PDE6C) and decreased inner segment localization. One-month-old &lt;i&gt;Cnga3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice showed ~30% of M-opsin, 55% of S-opsin, and 50% of PDE6C localized to the OS. &lt;i&gt;Cnga3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice with &lt;i&gt;Ryr2&lt;/i&gt; deletion at the same age showed almost 60% of M-opsin, 70% of S-opsin, and 70% of PDE6C localized to the OS. Deletion of &lt;i&gt;Ryr2&lt;/i&gt; nearly completely reversed elevations of the ER stress markers phospho-IRE1α and phospho-eIF2α and suppressed cone apoptosis. Consistent with the improved cone protein localization and reduced ER stress/cone apoptosis, cone survival was improved by deletion of &lt;i&gt;Ryr2&lt;/i&gt;. The number of cones was increased by ~28% in 2- to 4-month-old &lt;i&gt;Cnga3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice with &lt;i&gt;Ryr2&lt;/i&gt; deletion compared with age-matched &lt;i&gt;Cnga3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. This work demonstrates a role of RyR2/ER calcium dysregulation in protein mislocalization, ER stress, and cone death. The findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of photoreceptor degeneration and support strategies targeting ER calcium regulation to manage retinal degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Learning results in various forms of neuronal plasticity that provide a lasting representation of past events, and understanding the mechanisms supporting lasting memories has been a primary pursuit of the neurobiological study of memory. However, learning also alters the capacity for future learning, an observation that likely reflects its adaptive significance. In the laboratory, we can study this essential property of memory by assessing how prior experience alters the capacity for subsequent learning. Previous studies have indicated that while a single weak fear conditioning trial is insufficient to support long-term memory (LTM), it can facilitate future learning such that another trial delivered within a protracted time window results in a robust memory. Here, we sought to determine whether or not manipulating neural activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) during or after the initial learning trial would affect the ability of the initial trial to facilitate subsequent learning. Our results show that inhibiting the BLA in rats prior to the first trial prevented the ability of that trial to facilitate learning when a second trial was presented the next day. Inhibition of the BLA immediately after the first trial using DREADDs was not effective, nor was pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) or the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). These findings indicate that the neural mechanisms that permit an initial subthreshold fear conditioning trial to alter later learning develop rapidly and do not appear to require a typical post-learning consolidation period.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Characterizing how the brain responds to stimuli has been a goal of sensory neuroscience for decades. One key approach has been to fit linear models to describe the relationship between sensory inputs and neural responses. This has included models aimed at predicting spike trains, local field potentials, BOLD responses, and EEG/MEG. In the case of EEG/MEG, one explicit use of this linear modeling approach has been the fitting of so-called temporal response functions (TRFs). TRFs have been used to study how auditory cortex tracks the amplitude envelope of acoustic stimuli, including continuous speech. However, such linear models typically assume that variations in the amplitude of the stimulus feature (i.e., the envelope) produce variations in the magnitude but not the latency or morphology of the resulting neural response. Here, we show that by amplitude binning the stimulus envelope, and then using it to fit a multivariate TRF, we can better account for these amplitude-dependent changes, and that this leads to a significant improvement in model performance for both amplitude-modulated noise and continuous speech in humans. We also show that this performance can be further improved through the inclusion of an additional envelope representation that emphasizes onsets and positive changes in the stimulus, consistent with the idea that while some neurons track the entire envelope, others respond preferentially to onsets in the stimulus. We contend that these results have practical implications for researchers interested in modeling brain responses to amplitude modulated sounds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Presymptomatic spinal cord pathology in c9orf72 mutation carriers: A longitudinal neuroimaging study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25520?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; hexanucleotide repeats expansions account for almost half of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases. Recent imaging studies in asymptomatic &lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; carriers have demonstrated cerebral white (WM) and gray matter (GM) degeneration before the age of 40 years. The objective of this study was to characterize cervical spinal cord (SC) changes in asymptomatic &lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; hexanucleotide carriers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventy‐two asymptomatic individuals were enrolled in a prospective study of first‐degree relatives of ALS and FTD patients carrying the &lt;i&gt;c9orf72&lt;/i&gt; hexanucleotide expansion. Forty of them carried the pathogenic mutation (C9&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Each subject underwent quantitative cervical cord imaging. Structural GM and WM metrics and diffusivity parameters were evaluated at baseline and 18 months later. Data were analyzed in C9&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and C9&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; subgroups, and C9&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; subjects were further stratified by age.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At baseline, significant WM atrophy was detected at each cervical vertebral level in C9&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; subjects older than 40 years without associated changes in GM and diffusion tensor imaging parameters. At 18‐month follow‐up, WM atrophy was accompanied by significant corticospinal tract (CST) fractional anisotropy (FA) reductions. Intriguingly, asymptomatic C9&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; subjects older than 40 years with family history of ALS (as opposed to FTD) also exhibited significant CST FA reduction at baseline.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cervical SC imaging detects WM atrophy exclusively in C9&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; subjects older than 40 years, and progressive CST FA reductions can be identified on 18‐month follow‐up. Cervical SC magnetic resonance imaging readily captures presymptomatic pathological changes and disease propagation in &lt;i&gt;c9orf72&lt;/i&gt;‐associated conditions.

These drug-induced epigenetic adaptations mediate enduring changes in brain function which contribute to life-long, drug-related behavioral abnormalities that define addiction. Targeting these epigenetic alterations will enhance our understanding of the biological basis of addiction and might even yield more effective anti-addiction therapies. However, the complexity of the neuroepigenetic landscape makes it difficult to determine which drug-induced epigenetic changes causally contribute to the pathogenic mechanisms of drug addiction. In this review, we highlight the evidence that epigenetic modifications, specifically histone modifications, within key brain reward regions are correlated with addiction. We then discuss the emerging field of locus-specific neuroepigenetic editing, which is a promising method for determining the causal epigenetic molecular mechanisms that drive an addicted state. Such approaches will substantially increase the field’s ability to establish the precise epigenetic mechanisms underlying drug addiction, and could lead to novel treatments for addictive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Here, we review recent genome-scale chromosome conformation mappings (‘Hi-C’) in developing and adult human and mouse brain. Neural differentiation is associated with widespread remodeling of the chromosomal contact map, reflecting dynamic changes in cell-type-specific gene expression programs, with a massive (estimated 20–50%) net loss of chromosomal contacts that is specific for the neuronal lineage. Hi-C datasets provided an unexpected link between locus-specific abnormal expansion of repeat sequences positioned at the boundaries of self-associating topological chromatin domains, and monogenic neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, integrative cell-type-specific Hi-C and transcriptomic analysis uncovered an expanded genomic risk space for sequences conferring liability for schizophrenia and other cognitive disease. We predict that spatial genome exploration will deliver radically new insights into the brain nucleome in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

This neurogenesis process requires intricate genetic regulation involving a combination of cell intrinsic transcription factors and extrinsic signaling molecules, and many critical factors have been identified that influence the timing and composition of the developing retina. Adding complexity to the process, over the past decade, a variety of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms have been shown to influence neurogenesis, and these include changes in histone modifications and the chromatin landscape and changes in DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation patterns. This review summarizes recent findings in the genetic and epigenetic regulation of retinal development, with an emphasis on the zebrafish model system, and it outlines future areas of investigation that will continue to push the field forward into the epigenomics era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>Spinocerebellar ataxia 3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), is a rare autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the ATXN3 gene. In the present study, we performed a global metabolomic analysis to identity pathogenic biochemical pathways and novel biomarkers implicated in SCA3 patients. Metabolic profiling of serum samples from 13 preclinical SCA3 patients, 13 symptomatic SCA3 patients, and 15 healthy controls were mapped using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques. The symptomatic SCA3 patients showed a metabolic profile significantly distinct from those of the preclinical SCA3 patients and healthy controls. The principal differential metabolites were involved in the amino acid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism pathways. In addition, four candidate serum biomarkers, FFA 16:1 (palmitoleic acid), FFA 18:3 (linolenic acid), L-Proline and L-Tryptophan, were selected to discriminate between symptomatic SCA3 patients and healthy controls by receiver operator curve analysis with area under the curve of 0.979. Our study demonstrates that symptomatic SCA3 patients present distinct metabolic profiles with perturbed amino acid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism, and FFA 16:1, FFA 18:3, L-Proline and L-Tryptophan are identified as potential disease biomarkers.</description>

	<description>PARK20, an early onset autosomal recessive parkinsonism is due to mutations in the phosphatidylinositol-phosphatase Synaptojanin 1 (Synj1).
We have recently shown that the early endosomal compartments are profoundly altered in PARK20 fibroblasts as well as the endosomal trafficking. Here, we report that PARK20 fibroblasts also display a drastic alteration of the architecture and function of the early secretory compartments. Our results show that the exit machinery from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and the ER-to-Golgi trafficking are markedly compromised in patient cells. As a consequence, PARK20 fibroblasts accumulate large amounts of cargo proteins within the ER, leading to the induction of ER stress. Interestingly, this stressful state is coupled to the activation of the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP pathway of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). In addition, PARK20 fibroblasts reveal upregulation of oxidative stress markers and total ROS production with concomitant alteration of the morphology of the mitochondrial network. Interestingly, treatment of PARK20 cells with GSK2606414 (GSK), a specific inhibitor of PERK activity, restores the level of ROS, signalling a direct correlation between ER stress and the induction of oxidative stress in the PARK20 cells. 
All together, these findings suggest that dysfunction of early secretory pathway might contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease.</description>

	<description>With the increasing use of functional brain network properties as markers of brain disorders, efficient visualisation and evaluation methods have become essential. Eigenvector centrality mapping (ECM) of functional MRI (fMRI) data enables the representation of per-node graph theoretical measures as brain maps. This paper studies the use of centrality dynamics for measuring group differences in imaging studies.

Imaging data were used from a publicly available imaging study, which included resting fMRI data.  After warping the images to a standard space and masking cortical regions, ECM were computed in a sliding window. The dual regression method was used to identify dynamic centrality differences inside well-known resting state networks between gender and age groups.

Gender-related differences were found in the medial and lateral visual, motor, default mode, and executive control RSN, where male subjects had more consistent centrality variations within the network. Age-related differences between the youngest and oldest subjects, based on a median split, were found in the medial visual, executive control and left frontoparietal networks, where younger subjects had more consistent centrality variations within the network.

Our findings show that centrality dynamics can be used to identify between-group functional brain network centrality differences, and that age and gender distributions studies need to be taken into account in functional imaging studies.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Characterizing Whole Brain Temporal Variation of Functional Connectivity via Zero and First Order Derivatives of Sliding Window Correlations</title>

	<description>Brain functional connectivity has been shown to change over time during resting state fMRI experiments. Close examination of temporal changes have revealed a small set of whole-brain connectivity patterns called dynamic states. Dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) studies have demonstrated that it is possible to replicate the dynamic states across several resting state experiments. However, estimation of states and their temporal dynamicity still suffers from noisy and imperfect estimations. In regular dFNC implementations, states are estimated by comparing connectivity patterns through the data without considering time, in other words only zero order changes are examined. In this work we propose a method that includes first order variations of dFNC in the searching scheme of dynamic connectivity patterns. Our approach, referred to as temporal variation of functional network connectivity (tvFNC), estimates the derivative of dFNC, and then searches for reoccurring patterns of concurrent dFNC states and their derivatives. The tvFNC method is first validated using a simulated dataset and then applied to a resting-state fMRI sample including healthy controls (HC) and schizophrenia (SZ) patients and compared to the standard dFNC approach. Our dynamic approach reveals extra patterns in the connectivity derivatives complementing the already reported state patterns. State derivatives consist of additional information about increment and decrement of connectivity among brain networks not observed by the original dFNC method. The tvFNC shows more sensitivity than regular dFNC by uncovering additional FNC differences between the HC and SZ groups in each state. In summary, the tvFNC method provides a new and enhanced approach to examine time-varying functional connectivity.</description>

	<description>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the death of both upper and lower motor neurons (MNs) in the brain, brainstem and spinal cord. The neurodegenerative mechanisms leading to MN loss in ALS are not fully understood. Importantly, the reasons why MNs are specifically targeted in this disorder are unclear, when the proteins associated genetically or pathologically with ALS are expressed ubiquitously. Furthermore, MNs themselves are not affected equally; specific MNs subpopulations are more susceptible than others in both animal models and human patient tissues. Corticospinal MNs and lower somatic MNs, which innervate voluntary muscles, degenerate more readily than specific subgroups of lower MNs, which remain resistant to degeneration, reflecting the clinical manifestations of ALS. In this review, we discuss the possible factors intrinsic to MNs that render them uniquely susceptible to neurodegeneration in ALS. We also speculate why some MN subpopulations are more vulnerable than others, focussing on both their molecular and physiological properties. Finally, we review the anatomical network and neuronal microenvironment as determinants of MN subtype vulnerability and hence the progression of ALS.</description>

	<description>This study examined mood enhancement effects from four-week focusing attention (FA) meditation and four-week open monitoring (OM) meditation in an eight-week mindfulness training program designed ¬for ordinary individuals. 40 participants were randomly assigned to a training  or a control group. All participants were asked to perform cognitive tasks and subjective scale tests at three-time points (pre-, mid, and post-tests). Compared with the participants in the control group,  the meditation training group showed significantly decreased anxiety, depression and emotional  rumination scores, significantly increased mindfulness scores, and significantly reduced reaction times for the Stroop task in the incongruent condition. The present study demonstrated that eight-week mindfulness meditation training could effectively enhance the level of mindfulness and improve emotional states. Moreover, FA meditation could partially improve individual levels of mindfulness and effectively improve mood, while OM meditation could further improve individual levels of mindfulness and maintain a positive mood.</description>

	<description>Music is commonly used to modify mood and has attracted attention as a potential therapeutic intervention. Despite the well-recognized effects of music on mood, changes in affective perception due to music remain majorly unknown. Here, we examined if the perception of aversive stimuli could be altered by mood-changing background music. Using subjective scoring data from 17 healthy volunteers, we assessed the effect of relaxing background music, busy background music, or no background music conditions on response to aversive white noise stimulation. Interestingly, affective response to the white noise was selectively alleviated, and white noise-related P3 component amplitude was reduced in busy background music. However, affective responses as well as P3 amplitude to reference pure tone stimuli were similar regardless of background music conditions. Interestingly, heart rate increased in busy background music, whereas no increase in heart rate was found in similar distress, no background music condition. These findings suggest that increase in heart rate, which happens during busy background music exposure, can be a reflecting feature of music that ameliorate the affective response to aversive stimuli, possibly through selective reduction in neurophysiological responses.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Stability of Glutamatergic Synapses Is Independent of Activity Level, but Predicted by Synapse Size</title>

	<description>Neuronal activity is thought to drive the remodeling of circuits in the mammalian cerebral cortex. However, its precise function in the underlying formation and elimination of glutamatergic synapses has remained controversial. To clarify the role of activity in synapse turnover, we have assessed the effects of inhibition of glutamate release from a sparse subset of cultured hippocampal neurons on synapse turnover. Sustained chemogenetic attenuation of release through presynaptic expression of a designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) had no effect on the formation or elimination of glutamatergic synapses. Sparse expression of tetanus neurotoxin light chain (TeNT-LC), a synaptobrevin-cleaving protease that completely abolishes neurotransmitter release, likewise did not lead to changes in the rate of synapse elimination, although it reduced the rate of synapse formation. The stability of active and silenced synapses correlated with measures of synapse size. While not excluding a modulatory role in synapse elimination, our findings show that synaptic activity is neither required for the removal nor the maintenance of glutamatergic synapses between hippocampal neurons. Our results also demonstrate that the stability of glutamatergic synapses scales with their size irrespective of their activity.</description>

	<description>The magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) integrate incoming signals to secrete oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (VP) from their nerve terminals in the posterior pituitary gland. In the absence of gama-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) and cannabinoids 1 (CB1) receptor activity, we used whole-cell patch-clamp recording, single-cell reverse transcription-multiplex polymerase chain reaction (SC-RT-mPCR), biocytin histochemistry and pharmacological methods to examine the mechanism of high frequency stimulus (HFS, 100 Hz)-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) at glutamatergic synapses in the  PVN MNCs of juvenile male rats. Our results showed that HFS-induced LTP at glutamatergic synapses was accompanied by a decrease in the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of the PVN MNCs. In these MNCs, HFS-induced LTP persisted in the presence of a group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1) antagonist; however, it was abolished by an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor blocker. Notably, HFS-induced LTP in the PVN MNCs was completely prevented by a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor. The application of an NO donor not only induced the LTP of excitatory glutamatergic inputs in the PVN MNCs, but also occluded the HFS-induced LTP in these MNCs. Moreover, HFS-induced LTP in the PVN MNCs was also abolished by a specific protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, KT5720. SC-RT-m-PCR analysis revealed that 64.5% (62/96) of MNCs expressed OT mRNA. Our results indicate that a HFS can induce an NMDA receptor and NO cascades dependent on presynaptic glutamatergic LTP in the PVN MNCs via a PKA signaling pathway.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Dilated Saliency U-Net for White Matter Hyperintensities Segmentation Using Irregularity Age Map</title>

	<description>White matter hyperintensities (WMH) appear as regions of abnormally high signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI) sequences. In particular, WMH have been noteworthy in age-related neuroscience for being a crucial biomarker for all types of dementia and brain aging processes. The automatic WMH segmentation is challenging because of their variable intensity range, size and shape. U-Net tackles this problem through the dense prediction and has shown competitive performances not only on WMH segmentation/detection but also on varied image segmentation tasks. However, its network architecture is highly complex. In this study we propose the use of Saliency U-Net and irregularity age map (IAM) to decrease the U-Net architectural complexity without performance loss. We trained Saliency U-Net using both: a T2-FLAIR MRI sequence and its correspondent IAM. Since IAM guides locating image intensity irregularities, in which WMH are possibly included, in the MRI slice, Saliency U-Net performs better than the original U-Net trained only using T2-FLAIR. The best performance was achieved with fewer parameters and shorter training time. Moreover, the application of dilated convolution enhanced Saliency U-Net by recognising the shape of large WMH more accurately through multi-scale context learning. This network named Dilated Saliency U-Net improved Dice coefficient score to 0.5588 which was the best score among our experimental models, and recorded a relatively good sensitivity of 0.4747 with the shortest training time and the least number of parameters. In conclusion, based on our experimental results, incorporating IAM through Dilated Saliency U-Net resulted an appropriate approach for WMH segmentation.</description>

	<description>Subclinical cerebrovascular disease is frequently identified in neuroimaging studies and is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of cognitive disorders. However, the role of these neuroimaging findings in the context of normal cognitive aging is poorly understood. Identifying the etiologies of different types of lesions may help investigators differentiate between age-related and pathological cerebrovascular damage in cognitive aging. In this review, we aim to describe the epidemiology and etiology of various brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of vascular damage in cognitively normal, older adult populations. We focus here on population-based prospective cohort studies of cognitively unimpaired older adults, as well as discuss the heterogeneity of MRI findings and their relationships with cognition. This review emphasizes the need for a better understanding of subclinical cerebrovascular disease in cognitively normal populations, in order to more effectively identify and prevent cognitive decline in our rapidly aging population.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; grooming possesses syntax with distinct rules at different temporal scales</title>

Mathematical modeling of behavioral sequences yields insight into the rules and mechanisms underlying sequence generation. Grooming in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; is characterized by repeated execution of distinct, stereotyped actions in variable order. Experiments demonstrate that, following stimulation by an irritant, grooming progresses gradually from an early phase dominated by anterior cleaning to a later phase with increased walking and posterior cleaning. We also observe that, at an intermediate temporal scale, there is a strong relationship between the amount of time spent performing body-directed grooming actions and leg-directed actions. We then develop a series of data-driven Markov models that isolate and identify the behavioral features governing transitions between individual grooming bouts. We identify action order as the primary driver of probabilistic, but non-random, syntax structure, as has previously been identified. Subsequent models incorporate grooming bout duration, which also contributes significantly to sequence structure. Our results show that, surprisingly, the syntactic rules underlying probabilistic grooming transitions possess action duration-dependent structure, suggesting that sensory input-independent mechanisms guide grooming behavior at short time scales. Finally, the inclusion of a simple rule that modifies grooming transition probabilities over time yields a generative model that recapitulates the key features of observed grooming sequences at several time scales. These discoveries suggest that sensory input guides action selection by modulating internally generated dynamics. Additionally, the discovery of these principles governing grooming in &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; demonstrates the utility of incorporating temporal information when characterizing the syntax of behavioral sequences.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fwAAXXVTVxw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Predicting gastrointestinal drug effects using contextualized metabolic models</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Marouen Ben Guebila, Ines Thiele&lt;/p&gt;

Gastrointestinal side effects are among the most common classes of adverse reactions associated with orally absorbed drugs. These effects decrease patient compliance with the treatment and induce undesirable physiological effects. The prediction of drug action on the gut wall based on &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; data solely can improve the safety of marketed drugs and first-in-human trials of new chemical entities. We used publicly available data of drug-induced gene expression changes to build drug-specific small intestine epithelial cell metabolic models. The combination of measured &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; gene expression and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; predicted metabolic rates in the gut wall was used as features for a multilabel support vector machine to predict the occurrence of side effects. We showed that combining local gut wall-specific metabolism with gene expression performs better than gene expression alone, which indicates the role of small intestine metabolism in the development of adverse reactions. Furthermore, we reclassified FDA-labeled drugs with respect to their genetic and metabolic profiles to show hidden similarities between seemingly different drugs. The linkage of xenobiotics to their transcriptomic and metabolic profiles could take pharmacology far beyond the usual indication-based classifications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sb7N_SCSmmA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Optimization of surgical intervention outside the epileptogenic zone in the Virtual Epileptic Patient (VEP)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Sora An, Fabrice Bartolomei, Maxime Guye, Viktor Jirsa&lt;/p&gt;

Studies to improve the efficacy of epilepsy surgery have focused on better refining the localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) with the aim of effectively resecting it. However, in a considerable number of patients, EZs are distributed across multiple brain regions and may involve eloquent areas that cannot be removed due to the risk of neurological complications. There is a clear need for developing alternative approaches to induce seizure relief, but minimal impact on normal brain functions. Here, we develop a personalized in-silico network approach, that suggests effective and safe surgical interventions for each patient. Based on the clinically identified EZ, we employ modularity analysis to identify target brain regions and fiber tracts involved in seizure propagation. We then construct and simulate a patient-specific brain network model comprising phenomenological neural mass models at the nodes, and patient-specific structural brain connectivity using the neuroinformatics platform The Virtual Brain (TVB), in order to evaluate effectiveness and safety of the target zones (TZs). In particular, we assess safety via electrical stimulation for pre- and post-surgical condition to quantify the impact on the signal transmission properties of the network. We demonstrate the existence of a large repertoire of efficient surgical interventions resulting in reduction of degree of seizure spread, but only a small subset of them proves safe. The identification of novel surgical interventions through modularity analysis and brain network simulations may provide exciting solutions to the treatment of inoperable epilepsies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_1AVKvmI1xc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Energetic costs of cellular and therapeutic control of stochastic mitochondrial DNA populations</title>

The dynamics of the cellular proportion of mutant mtDNA molecules is crucial for mitochondrial diseases. Cellular populations of mitochondria are under homeostatic control, but the details of the control mechanisms involved remain elusive. Here, we use stochastic modelling to derive general results for the impact of cellular control on mtDNA populations, the cost to the cell of different mtDNA states, and the optimisation of therapeutic control of mtDNA populations. This formalism yields a wealth of biological results, including that an increasing mtDNA variance can increase the energetic cost of maintaining a tissue, that intermediate levels of heteroplasmy can be more detrimental than homoplasmy even for a dysfunctional mutant, that heteroplasmy distribution (not mean alone) is crucial for the success of gene therapies, and that long-term rather than short intense gene therapies are more likely to beneficially impact mtDNA populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QsEEORt_xd0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Autism and developmental disability caused by KCNQ3 gain‐of‐function variants</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25522?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25522?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent reports have described single individuals with neurodevelopmental disability (NDD) harboring heterozygous &lt;i&gt;KCNQ3&lt;/i&gt; de novo variants (DNVs). We sought to assess whether pathogenic variants in &lt;i&gt;KCNQ3&lt;/i&gt; cause NDD and to elucidate the associated phenotype and molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with NDD and &lt;i&gt;KCNQ3&lt;/i&gt; DNVs were identified through an international collaboration. Phenotypes were characterized by clinical assessment, review of charts, electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, and parental interview. Functional consequences of variants were analyzed in vitro by patch‐clamp recording.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleven patients were assessed. They had recurrent heterozygous DNVs in &lt;i&gt;KCNQ3&lt;/i&gt; affecting residues R230 (R230C, R230H, R230S) and R227 (R227Q). All patients exhibited global developmental delay within the first 2 years of life. Most (8/11, 73%) were nonverbal or had a few words only. All patients had autistic features, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was diagnosed in 5 of 11 (45%). EEGs performed before 10 years of age revealed frequent sleep‐activated multifocal epileptiform discharges in 8 of 11 (73%). For 6 of 9 (67%) recorded between 1.5 and 6 years of age, spikes became near‐continuous during sleep. Interestingly, most patients (9/11, 82%) did not have seizures, and no patient had seizures in the neonatal period. Voltage‐clamp recordings of the mutant KCNQ3 channels revealed gain‐of‐function (GoF) effects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific GoF variants in &lt;i&gt;KCNQ3&lt;/i&gt; cause NDD, ASD, and abundant sleep‐activated spikes. This new phenotype contrasts both with self‐limited neonatal epilepsy due to &lt;i&gt;KCNQ3&lt;/i&gt; partial loss of function, and with the neonatal or infantile onset epileptic encephalopathies due to &lt;i&gt;KCNQ2&lt;/i&gt; GoF.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cholinergic Neurons of the Medial Septum Are Crucial for Sensorimotor Gating</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hypofunction of NMDA receptors has been considered a possible cause for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. More recently, indirect ways to regulate NMDA that would be less disruptive have been proposed and metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) represents one such candidate. To characterize the cell populations involved, we demonstrated here that knock-out (KO) of mGluR5 in cholinergic, but not glutamatergic or parvalbumin (PV)-positive GABAergic, neurons reduced prepulse inhibition of the startle response (PPI) and enhanced sensitivity to MK801-induced locomotor activity. Inhibition of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum by DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) resulted in reduced PPI further demonstrating the importance of these neurons in sensorimotor gating. Volume imaging and quantification were used to compare PV and cholinergic cell distribution, density, and total cell counts in the different cell-type-specific KO lines. Electrophysiological studies showed reduced NMDA receptor-mediated currents in cholinergic neurons of the medial septum in mGluR5 KO mice. These results obtained from male and female mice indicate that cholinergic neurons in the medial septum represent a key cell type involved in sensorimotor gating and are relevant to pathologies associated with disrupted sensorimotor gating such as schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mechanistic complexity underlying psychiatric disorders remains a major challenge that is hindering the drug discovery process. Here, we generated genetically modified mouse lines to better characterize the involvement of the receptor mGluR5 in the fine-tuning of NMDA receptors, specifically in the context of sensorimotor gating. We evaluated the importance of knocking-out mGluR5 in three different cell types in two brain regions and performed different sets of experiments including behavioral testing and electrophysiological recordings. We demonstrated that cholinergic neurons in the medial septum represent a key cell-type involved in sensorimotor gating. We are proposing that pathologies associated with disrupted sensorimotor gating, such as with schizophrenia, could benefit from further evaluating strategies to modulate specifically cholinergic neurons in the medial septum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Transcriptional Regulation of Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels Contributes to GM-CSF-Induced Pain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induces the production of granulocyte and macrophage populations from the hematopoietic progenitor cells; it is one of the most common growth factors in the blood. GM-CSF is also involved in bone cancer pain development by regulating tumor–nerve interactions, remodeling of peripheral nerves, and sensitization of damage-sensing (nociceptive) nerves. However, the precise mechanism for GM-CSF-dependent pain is unclear. In this study, we found that GM-CSF is highly expressed in human malignant osteosarcoma. Female Sprague Dawley rats implanted with bone cancer cells develop mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia, but antagonizing GM-CSF in these animals significantly reduced such hypersensitivity. The voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9 were found to be selectively upregulated in rat DRG neurons treated with GM-CSF, which resulted in enhanced excitability. GM-CSF activated the Janus kinase 2 (Jak2)–signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 (Stat3) signaling pathway, which promoted the transcription of Nav1.7–1.9 in DRG neurons. Accordingly, targeted knocking down of either Nav1.7–1.9 or Jak2/Stat3 in DRG neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; alleviated the hyperalgesia in male Sprague Dawley rats. Our findings describe a novel bone cancer pain mechanism and provide a new insight into the physiological and pathological functions of GM-CSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It has been reported that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) plays a key role in bone cancer pain, yet the underlying mechanisms involved in the GM-CSF-mediated signaling pathway in nociceptors is not fully understood. Here, we showed that GM-CSF promotes bone cancer-associated pain by enhancing the excitability of DRG neurons via the Janus kinase 2 (Jak2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 (Stat3)-mediated upregulation of expression of nociceptor-specific voltage-gated sodium channels. Our study provides a detailed understanding of the roles that sodium channels and the Jak2/Stat3 pathway play in the GM-CSF-mediated bone cancer pain; our data also highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting GM-CSF.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Enhanced Dendritic Inhibition and Impaired NMDAR Activation in a Mouse Model of Down Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/26/5210?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Down syndrome (DS) or Trisomy 21 is a developmental disorder leading to cognitive deficits, including disruption of hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Enhanced inhibition has been suggested to underlie these deficits in DS based on studies using the Ts65Dn mouse model. Here we show that, in this mouse model, GABAergic synaptic inhibition onto dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal cells is increased. By contrast, somatic inhibition was not altered. In addition, synaptic NMDAR currents were reduced. Furthermore, dendritic inhibition was mediated via nonlinear α5-subunit containing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs that closely matched the kinetics and voltage dependence of NMDARs. Thus, enhanced dendritic inhibition and reduced NMDA currents strongly decreased burst-induced NMDAR-mediated depolarization and impaired LTP induction. Finally, selective reduction of α5-GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R-mediated inhibition rescued both burst-induced synaptic NMDAR activation and synaptic plasticity. These results demonstrate that reduced synaptic NMDAR activation and synaptic plasticity in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS can be corrected by specifically targeting nonlinear dendritic inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Mild to moderate intellectual disability is a prominent feature of Down syndrome. Previous studies in mouse models suggest that increased synaptic inhibition is a main factor for decreased synaptic plasticity, the cellular phenomenon underlying memory. The present study shows that increased inhibition specifically onto dendrites together with reduced NMDAR content in excitatory synapses may be the cause. Reducing a slow nonlinear component that is specific to dendritic inhibitory inputs and mediated by α5 subunit-containing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors rescues both NMDAR activation and synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Salience-Driven Value Construction for Adaptive Choice under Risk</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Decisions we face in real life are inherently risky and can result in one of many possible outcomes. However, most of what we know about choice under risk is based on studies that use options with only two possible outcomes (simple gambles), so it remains unclear how the brain constructs reward values for more complex risky options faced in real life. To address this question, we combined experimental and modeling approaches to examine choice between pairs of simple gambles and pairs of three-outcome gambles in male and female human subjects. We found that subjects evaluated individual outcomes of three-outcome gambles by multiplying functions of reward magnitude and probability. To construct the overall value of each gamble, however, most subjects differentially weighted possible outcomes based on either reward magnitude or probability. These results reveal a novel dissociation between how reward information is processed when evaluating complex gambles: valuation of each outcome is based on a combination of reward information whereas weighting of possible outcomes mainly relies on a single piece of reward information. We show that differential weighting of possible outcomes could enable subjects to make decisions more easily and quickly. Together, our findings reveal a plausible mechanism for how salience, in terms of possible reward magnitude or probability, can influence the construction of subjective values for complex gambles. They also point to separable neural mechanisms for how reward value controls choice and attention to allow for more adaptive decision making under risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Real-life decisions are inherently risky and can result in one of many possible outcomes, but how does the brain integrate information from all these outcomes to make decisions? To address this question, we examined choice between pairs of gambles with multiple outcomes using various computational models. We found that subjects evaluated individual outcomes by multiplying functions of reward magnitude and probability. To construct the overall value of each gamble, however, they differentially weighted possible outcomes based on either reward magnitude or probability. By doing so, they were able to make decisions more easily and quickly. Our findings illustrate how salience, in terms of possible reward magnitude or probability, can influence the construction of subjective values for more adaptive choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Frequent experience with regularities in our environment allows us to use predictive information to guide our decision process. However, contingencies in our environment are not always explicitly present and sometimes need to be inferred. Heretofore, it remained unknown how predictive information guides decision-making when explicit knowledge is absent and how the brain shapes such implicit inferences. In the present experiment, 17 human participants (9 females) performed a discrimination task in which a target stimulus was preceded by a predictive cue. Critically, participants had no explicit knowledge that some of the cues signaled an upcoming target, allowing us to investigate how implicit inferences emerge and guide decision-making. Despite unawareness of the cue–target contingencies, participants were able to use implicit information to improve performance. Concurrent EEG recordings demonstrate that implicit inferences rely upon interactions between internally and externally oriented networks, whereby prefrontal regions inhibit parietal cortex under internal implicit control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Regularities in our environment can guide our behavior providing information about upcoming events. Interestingly, such predictive information does not need to be explicitly represented to effectively guide our decision process. Here, we show how the brain engages in such real-world &quot;data mining&quot; and how implicit inferences emerge. We used a contingency cueing task and demonstrated that implicit inferences influenced responses to subsequent targets despite a lack of awareness of cue–target contingencies. Further, we show that these implicit inferences emerge through interactions between internally and externally oriented neural networks. The current results highlight the importance of prefrontal processes in transforming external events into predictive internalized models of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is a key brain area to encoding and storing memories. Hippocampal place cells encode the position of an animal in space by firing when the subject is at a specific location in the environment. Therefore, place cells are considered essential to spatial memory and navigation. It has recently been revealed that place-cell activity is not constant even in a familiar environment, but changes dynamically over time. However, the mechanism behind these changes in activity is not yet fully understood. In this study, the activity of hippocampal CA1 neurons of male mice was tracked during repeated performances of a spatial task in a virtual reality environment. By comparing place-cell ensemble representations among repeated performance of the task, the overlap rate of the active place-cell population was found to be time dependent but independent of the number of tasks within a fixed time. These findings suggest that place codes change automatically and at a constant speed. Furthermore, the dynamics of place-cell activity were found to be suppressed by an NMDA receptor antagonist. In summary, the spontaneously dynamic nature of place-cell activity is at least in part regulated by NMDA receptors, and the dynamics may encode temporal information of episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Place-cell activity in the hippocampal CA1 area is not stable even in a familiar environment, but changes dynamically over time. However, the mechanism behind these changes is unknown. Using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; calcium imaging, activity of CA1 neurons were tracked during multiple sessions with variable intervals. The overlap rate of the active place-cell population was constant regardless of the number of tasks within a fixed time. Furthermore, the dynamics were suppressed by an NMDA receptor antagonist. This NMDA receptor-dependent, continuous change in the place-cell activity may encode temporal information of episodes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Computing Social Value Conversion in the Human Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social signals play powerful roles in shaping self-oriented reward valuation and decision making. These signals activate social and valuation/decision areas, but the core computation for their integration into the self-oriented decision machinery remains unclear. Here, we study how a fundamental social signal, social value (others' reward value), is converted into self-oriented decision making in the human brain. Using behavioral analysis, modeling, and neuroimaging, we show three-stage processing of social value conversion from the offer to the effective value and then to the final decision value. First, a value of others' bonus on offer, called offered value, was encoded uniquely in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) and also in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (ldlPFC), which is commonly activated by offered self-bonus value. The effective value, an intermediate value representing the effective influence of the offer on the decision, was represented in the right anterior insula (rAI), and the final decision value was encoded in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Second, using psychophysiological interaction and dynamic causal modeling analyses, we demonstrated three-stage feedforward processing from the rTPJ and ldPFC to the rAI and then from rAI to the mPFC. Further, we showed that these characteristics of social conversion underlie distinct sociobehavioral phenotypes. We demonstrate that the variability in the conversion underlies the difference between prosocial and selfish subjects, as seen from the differential strength of the rAI and ldlPFC coupling to the mPFC responses, respectively. Together, these findings identified fundamental neural computation processes for social value conversion underlying complex social decision making behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In daily life, we make decisions based on self-interest, but also in consideration for others' status. These social influences modulate valuation and decision signals in the brain, suggesting a fundamental process called value conversion that translates social information into self-referenced decisions. However, little is known about the conversion process and its underlying brain mechanisms. We investigated value conversion using human fMRI with computational modeling and found three essential stages in a progressive brain circuit from social to empathic and decision areas. Interestingly, the brain mechanism of conversion differed between prosocial and individualistic subjects. These findings reveal how the brain processes and merges social information into the elemental flow of self-interested decision making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Early Blindness Shapes Cortical Representations of Auditory Frequency within Auditory Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Early loss of vision is classically linked to large-scale cross-modal plasticity within occipital cortex. Much less is known about the effects of early blindness on auditory cortex. Here, we examine the effects of early blindness on the cortical representation of auditory frequency within human primary and secondary auditory areas using fMRI. We observe that 4 individuals with early blindness (2 females), and a group of 5 individuals with anophthalmia (1 female), a condition in which both eyes fail to develop, have lower response amplitudes and narrower voxelwise tuning bandwidths compared with a group of typically sighted individuals. These results provide some of the first evidence in human participants for compensatory plasticity within nondeprived sensory areas as a result of sensory loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Early blindness has been linked to enhanced perception of the auditory world, including auditory localization and pitch perception. Here we used fMRI to compare neural responses with auditory stimuli within auditory cortex across sighted, early blind, and anophthalmic individuals, in whom both eyes fail to develop. We find more refined frequency tuning in blind subjects, providing some of the first evidence in human subjects for compensation within nondeprived primary sensory areas as a result of blindness early in life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Spontaneous Cingulate High-Current Spikes Signal Normal and Pathological Pain States</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prominent 7–12 Hz oscillations in frontal cortical networks in rats have been reported. However, the mechanism of generation and the physiological function of this brain rhythm have not yet been clarified. Multichannel extracellular field potentials of the ACC were recorded and analyzed using the current source density method in halothane-anesthetized rats. Spontaneous high-current spikes (HCSs) were localized in the deep part of layer II/III and upper part of layer V of the ACC. The frequency of HCSs in the ACC was 7–12 Hz, with an amplitude of 6.5 ± 0.76 mV/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and duration of 55.24 ± 2.43 ms. The power density significantly decreased (84.56 ± 6.93%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; test) after pinching the hindpaw and significantly increased (149.28 ± 15.96%) after treatment with morphine. The suppressive effect of pinching was reversed by naloxone (0.7 mg/kg, i.p.). HCSs coincided with initiation of the depolarization of cingulate neurons and remained in a depolarized upstate. The occurrence of cingulate HCSs was persistently preceded by a hyperpolarization phase and a burst of multiunit spike activity in the medial dorsal thalamic nucleus. Spontaneous field-potential oscillations changed from 10 Hz to a lower band (i.e., ~7.5 Hz) when a central poststroke pain condition was induced. The central poststroke pain group had a higher average coherence coefficient compared with the control group. Our results indicate that spontaneous cingulate cortical HCSs could be initiated by thalamocortical synaptic inputs from the medial dorsal thalamic nucleus and maintained by intracortical neuronal upstate mechanisms in physiological and pathological pain states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study elucidated the mechanism of generation and physiological function of prominent 7–12 Hz frequency oscillations in frontal cortical networks in rats. Spontaneous cingulate cortical high-current spikes in anesthetized rats could be initiated by thalamocortical synaptic inputs from the medial dorsal thalamic nucleus and maintained by intracortical neuronal upstate mechanisms. Suppression of the anterior cingulate cortex-filtered EEG during noxious stimulation may have resulted from the desynchronization of high-current spikes in the ACC. The enhancement of fast Fourier transform power after a systemic morphine injection suggested that the opioid system may play an important role in synchronizing cingulate cortical neuronal networks. Spontaneous cingulate high-current spikes may also play an important role in thalamocortical dysrhythmia in central poststroke pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Contribution of Sensory Encoding to Measured Bias</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/26/5115?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/26/5115?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Signal detection theory (SDT) is a widely used theoretical framework that describes how variable sensory signals are integrated with a decision criterion to support perceptual decision-making. SDT provides two key measurements: sensitivity (&lt;i&gt;d'&lt;/i&gt;) and bias (&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;), which reflect the separability of decision variable distributions (signal and noise) and the position of the decision criterion relative to optimal, respectively. Although changes in the subject's decision criterion can be reflected in changes in bias, decision criterion placement is not the sole contributor to measured bias. Indeed, neuronal representations of bias have been observed in sensory areas, suggesting that some changes in bias are because of effects on sensory encoding. To directly test whether the sensory encoding process can influence bias, we optogenetically manipulated neuronal excitability in primary visual cortex (V1) in mice of both sexes during either an orientation discrimination or a contrast detection task. Increasing excitability in V1 significantly decreased behavioral bias, whereas decreasing excitability had the opposite effect. To determine whether this change in bias is consistent with effects on sensory encoding, we made extracellular recordings from V1 neurons in passively viewing mice. Indeed, we found that optogenetic manipulation of excitability shifted the neuronal bias in the same direction as the behavioral bias. Moreover, manipulating the quality of V1 encoding by changing stimulus contrast or interstimulus interval also resulted in consistent changes in both behavioral and neuronal bias. Thus, changes in sensory encoding are sufficient to drive changes in bias measured using SDT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Perceptual decision-making involves sensory integration followed by application of a cognitive criterion. Using signal detection theory, one can extract features of the underlying decision variables and rule: sensitivity (&lt;i&gt;d'&lt;/i&gt;) and bias (&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;). Because bias is measured as the difference between the optimal and actual criterion, it is sensitive to both the sensory encoding processes and the placement of the decision criterion. Here, we use behavioral and electrophysiological approaches to demonstrate that measures of bias depend on sensory processes. Optogenetic manipulations of V1 in mice bidirectionally affect both behavioral and neuronal measures of bias with little effect on sensitivity. Thus, changes in sensory encoding influence bias, and the absence of changes in sensitivity do not preclude changes in sensory encoding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: STIM1 Is Required for Remodeling of the Endoplasmic Reticulum and Microtubule Cytoskeleton in Steering Growth Cones</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The spatial and temporal regulation of calcium signaling in neuronal growth cones is essential for axon guidance. In growth cones, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a significant source of calcium signals. However, it is not clear whether the ER is remodeled during motile events to localize calcium signals in steering growth cones. The expression of the ER-calcium sensor, stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM1) is necessary for growth cone steering toward the calcium-dependent guidance cue BDNF, with STIM1 functioning to sustain calcium signals through store-operated calcium entry. However, STIM1 is also required for growth cone steering away from semaphorin-3a, a guidance cue that does not activate ER-calcium release, suggesting multiple functions of STIM1 within growth cones (Mitchell et al., 2012). STIM1 also interacts with microtubule plus-end binding proteins EB1/EB3 (Grigoriev et al., 2008). Here, we show that STIM1 associates with EB1/EB3 in growth cones and that STIM1 expression is critical for microtubule recruitment and subsequent ER remodeling to the motile side of steering growth cones. Furthermore, we extend our data &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, demonstrating that zSTIM1 is required for axon guidance in actively navigating zebrafish motor neurons, regulating calcium signaling and filopodial formation. These data demonstrate that, in response to multiple guidance cues, STIM1 couples microtubule organization and ER-derived calcium signals, thereby providing a mechanism where STIM1-mediated ER remodeling, particularly in filopodia, regulates spatiotemporal calcium signals during axon guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Defects in both axon guidance and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function are implicated in a range of developmental disorders. During neuronal circuit development, the spatial localization of calcium signals controls the growth cone cytoskeleton to direct motility. We demonstrate a novel role for stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM1) in regulating microtubule and subsequent ER remodeling in navigating growth cones. We show that STIM1, an activator of store-operated calcium entry, regulates the dynamics of microtubule-binding proteins EB1/EB3, coupling ER to microtubules, within filopodia, thereby steering growth cones. The STIM1-microtubule-ER interaction provides a new model for spatial localization of calcium signals in navigating growth cones in the nascent nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: {alpha}-Synuclein ({alpha}Syn) Preformed Fibrils Induce Endogenous {alpha}Syn Aggregation, Compromise Synaptic Activity and Enhance Synapse Loss in Cultured Excitatory Hippocampal Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synucleinopathies are characterized by the accumulation of insoluble α-synuclein (αSyn). To test whether αSyn aggregates modulate synaptic activity, we used a recently developed model in primary neurons for inducing αSyn pathology. We demonstrated that preformed fibrils (PFFs) generated with recombinant human αSyn compromised synaptic activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner and that the magnitude of these deficits correlated with the formation of αSyn pathology in cultured excitatory hippocampal neurons from both sexes of mice. Remarkably, acute passive infusion of αSyn PFFs from whole-cell patch-clamp pipette decreased mEPSC frequency within 10 min followed by induction of αSyn pathology within 1 d. Moreover, by direct addition of αSyn PFFs into culture medium, the formation of misfolded αSyn inclusions dramatically compromised the colocalization of synaptic markers and altered dynamic changes of dendritic spines, but the viability of neurons was not affected up to 7 d post-treatment with αSyn PFFs. Our data indicate that intraneuronal αSyn fibrils impaired the initiation of synaptogenesis and their physiological functions, thereby suggesting that targeting synaptic dysfunction in synucleinopathies may provide a promising therapeutic direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Under pathological conditions, the presynaptic protein α-synuclein (αSyn) aggregates to form intraneuronal inclusions. To understand how and to what extent αSyn aggregates modulate synaptic activity before neuron loss, we demonstrate that αSyn preformed fibrils (PFFs) reduced synaptic activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The magnitude of these deficits correlated with the deposition of αSyn pathology, which dramatically compromised the colocalization of synaptic markers and altered the dendritic spine dynamics. The present work further highlights the impact of αSyn PFFs on synaptogenesis and physiological function, which may be applicable to other types of synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Antagonizing Increased miR-135a Levels at the Chronic Stage of Experimental TLE Reduces Spontaneous Recurrent Seizures</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/26/5064?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) is a chronic neurological disease characterized by recurrent seizures. The antiepileptic drugs currently available to treat mTLE are ineffective in one-third of patients and lack disease-modifying effects. miRNAs, a class of small noncoding RNAs which control gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, play a key role in the pathogenesis of mTLE and other epilepsies. Although manipulation of miRNAs at acute stages has been reported to reduce subsequent spontaneous seizures, it is uncertain whether targeting miRNAs at chronic stages of mTLE can also reduce seizures. Furthermore, the functional role and downstream targets of most epilepsy-associated miRNAs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that &lt;i&gt;miR-135a&lt;/i&gt; is selectively upregulated within neurons in epileptic brain and report that targeting &lt;i&gt;miR-135a in vivo&lt;/i&gt; using antagomirs after onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures can reduce seizure activity at the chronic stage of experimental mTLE in male mice. Further, by using an unbiased approach combining immunoprecipitation and RNA sequencing, we identify several novel neuronal targets of &lt;i&gt;miR-135a&lt;/i&gt;, including &lt;i&gt;Mef2a&lt;/i&gt;. Mef2 proteins are key regulators of excitatory synapse density. Mef2a and &lt;i&gt;miR-135a&lt;/i&gt; show reciprocal expression regulation in human (of both sexes) and experimental TLE, and &lt;i&gt;miR-135a&lt;/i&gt; regulates dendritic spine number and type through Mef2. Together, our data show that &lt;i&gt;miR-135a&lt;/i&gt; is target for reducing seizure activity in chronic epilepsy, and that deregulation of &lt;i&gt;miR-135a&lt;/i&gt; in epilepsy may alter &lt;i&gt;Mef2a&lt;/i&gt; expression and thereby affect synaptic function and plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; miRNAs are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression with roles in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. However, the precise mechanism of action and therapeutic potential of most epilepsy-associated miRNAs remain poorly understood. Our study reveals dramatic upregulation of the key neuronal miRNA &lt;i&gt;miR-135a&lt;/i&gt; in both experimental and human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Silencing &lt;i&gt;miR-135a&lt;/i&gt; in experimental temporal lobe epilepsy reduces seizure activity at the spontaneous recurrent seizure stage. These data support the exciting possibility that miRNAs can be targeted to combat seizures after spontaneous seizure activity has been established. Further, by using unbiased approaches novel neuronal targets of &lt;i&gt;miR-135a&lt;/i&gt;, including members of the Mef2 protein family, are identified that begin to explain how deregulation of &lt;i&gt;miR-135a&lt;/i&gt; may contribute to epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Robustness to Axon Initial Segment Variation Is Explained by Somatodendritic Excitability in Rat Substantia Nigra Dopaminergic Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In many neuronal types, axon initial segment (AIS) geometry critically influences neuronal excitability. Interestingly, the axon of rat SNc dopaminergic (DA) neurons displays a highly variable location and most often arises from an axon-bearing dendrite (ABD). We combined current-clamp somatic and dendritic recordings, outside-out recordings of dendritic sodium and potassium currents, morphological reconstructions and multicompartment modeling on male and female rat SNc DA neurons to determine cell-to-cell variations in AIS and ABD geometry, and their influence on neuronal output (spontaneous pacemaking frequency, action potential [AP] shape). Both AIS and ABD geometries were found to be highly variable from neuron to neuron. Surprisingly, we found that AP shape and pacemaking frequency were independent of AIS geometry. Modeling realistic morphological and biophysical variations helped us clarify this result: in SNc DA neurons, the complexity of the ABD combined with its excitability predominantly define pacemaking frequency and AP shape, such that large variations in AIS geometry negligibly affect neuronal output and are tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In many neuronal types, axon initial segment (AIS) geometry critically influences neuronal excitability. In the current study, we describe large cell-to-cell variations in AIS length or distance from the soma in rat substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons. Using neuronal reconstruction and electrophysiological recordings, we show that this morphological variability does not seem to affect their electrophysiological output, as neither action potential properties nor pacemaking frequency is correlated with AIS morphology. Realistic multicompartment modeling suggests that this robustness to AIS variation is mainly explained by the complexity and excitability of the somatodendritic compartment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Reward modulation (M1) could be exploited in developing an autonomously updating brain-computer interface (BCI) based on a reinforcement learning (RL) architecture. For an autonomously updating RL-based BCI system, we would need a reward prediction error, or a state-value representation from the user’s neural activity, which the RL-BCI agent could use to update its BCI decoder. In order to understand the multifaceted effects of reward on M1 activity, we investigated how neural spiking, oscillatory activities and their functional interactions are modulated by conditioned stimuli related reward expectation. To do so, local field potentials (LFPs) and single/multi-unit activities were recorded simultaneously and bilaterally from M1 cortices while four non-human primates (NHPs) performed cued center-out reaching or grip force tasks either manually using their right arm/hand or observed passively. We found that reward expectation influenced the strength of α (8–14 Hz) power, α- comodulation, α spike-field coherence (SFC), and firing rates (FRs) in general in M1. Furthermore, we found that an increase in α-band power was correlated with a decrease in neural spiking activity, that FRs were highest at the trough of the α-band cycle and lowest at the peak of its cycle. These findings imply that α oscillations modulated by reward expectation have an influence on spike FR and spike timing during both reaching and grasping tasks in M1. These LFP, spike, and spike-field interactions could be used to follow the M1 neural state in order to enhance BCI decoding (An et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs) are the major mediators of synaptic inhibition in the brain. Aberrant GABAAR activity or regulation is observed in various neurodevelopmental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and mental illnesses, including epilepsy, Alzheimer’s and schizophrenia. Benzodiazepines, anesthetics and other pharmaceutics targeting these receptors find broad clinical use, but their inherent lack of receptor subtype specificity causes unavoidable side effects, raising a need for new or adjuvant medications. In this review we introduce a new strategy to modulate GABAeric signaling: Targeting the intracellular protein interactors of GABAARs. Of special interest are scaffolding, anchoring and supporting proteins that display high GABAAR subtype specificity. Recent efforts to target gephyrin, the major intracellular integrator of GABAergic signaling, confirm that GABAAR-associated proteins can be successfully targeted through diverse molecules, including recombinant proteins, intrabodies, peptide-based probes and small molecules. Small-molecule artemisinins and peptides derived from endogenous interactors, that specifically target the universal receptor binding site of gephyrin, acutely affect synaptic GABAAR numbers and clustering, modifying neuronal transmission. Interference with GABAAR trafficking provides another way to modulate inhibitory signaling. Peptides blocking the binding site of GABAAR to AP2 increase the surface concentration of GABAAR clusters and enhance GABAergic signaling. Engineering of gephyrin binding peptides delivered superior means to interrogate neuronal structure and function. Fluorescent peptides, designed from gephyrin binders, enable live neuronal staining and visualization of gephyrin in the post synaptic sites with nanometer resolution. We anticipate that in the future, novel fluorescent probes, with improved size and binding efficiency, may find wide application in super resolution microscopy studies, enlightening the nanoscale architecture of the inhibitory synapse. Broader studies on GABAAR accessory proteins and the identification of the exact molecular binding interfaces and affinities will advance the development of novel GABAAR modulators and following in-vivo studies will reveal their clinical potential as adjuvant or stand-alone drugs.</description>

	<description>The diversity of inhibitory interneurons allows for the coordination and modulation of excitatory principal cell firing. Interneurons that release GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) onto the soma and axon exert powerful control by virtue of proximity to the site of action potential generation at the axon initial segment (AIS). Here we review and examine the cellular and molecular regulation of soma and axon targeting GABAergic synapses in the cortex and hippocampus. We also describe their role in controlling network activity in normal and pathological states. Recent studies have demonstrated a specific role for postsynaptic dystroglycan in the formation and maintenance of cholecystokinin positive basket cell terminals contacting the soma, and postsynaptic collybistin in parvalbumin positive chandelier cell contacts onto the AIS. Unique presynaptic molecular contributors, LGI2 and FGF13, expressed in parvalbumin positive basket cells and chandelier cells respectively, have also recently been identified. Mutations in the genes encoding proteins critical for somatic and AIS inhibitory synapses have been associated with human disorders of the nervous system. Dystroglycan dysfunction in some congenital muscular dystrophies is associated with developmental brain malformations, intellectual disability, and rare epilepsy. Collybistin dysfunction has been linked to hyperekplexia, epilepsy, intellectual disability, and developmental disorders. Both LGI2 and FGF13 mutations are implicated in syndromes with epilepsy as a component. Advancing our understanding of the powerful roles of somatic and axonic GABAergic contacts in controlling activity patterns in the cortex and hippocampus will provide insight into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy.</description>

	<description>Neurogenesis in developing and adult mammalian brain is a tightly regulated process that relies on neural stem cell activity. There is increasing evidence that mitochondrial metabolism affects neural stem cell homeostasis and differentiation but the precise role of mitochondrial function in the neurogenic process requires further investigation. Here, we have analyzed how mitochondrial complex I (MCI) dysfunction affects neural stem cell viability, proliferation and differentiation, as well as survival of the neural progeny. We have generated a conditional knockout model (hGFAP-NDUFS2 mice) in which expression of the NDUFS2 protein, essential for MCI function, is suppressed in cells expressing the Cre recombinase under the human glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter, active in mouse radial glial cells and in neural stem cells that reside in adult neurogenic niches. In this model we observed that survival of central neural stem cell population does not appear to be severely affected by MCI dysfunction. However, perinatal brain development was markedly inhibited and Ndufs2 knockout mice died before the tenth postnatal day. In addition, in vitro studies of subventricular zone neural stem cells showed that active neural progenitors require a functional MCI to produce ATP and to proliferate. In vitro differentiation of neural precursors into neurons and oligodendrocytes was also profoundly affected. These data indicate the need of a correct MCI function and oxidative phosphorylation for glia-like neural stem cell proliferation, differentiation and subsequent oligodendrocyte or neuronal maturation.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurogenesis section | New and Recent Articles: Comparison of Hypnotic Suggestion and Transcranial Direct-Current Stimulation Effects on Pain Perception and the Descending Pain Modulating System: A Crossover Randomized Clinical Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00662</guid>

	<description>Abstract 
Objectives: This paper aims to determine if hypnotic suggestion analgesia and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) have a differential effect on pain perception. We hypothesized that tDCS would be more effective than hypnotic suggestion at changing the descending pain modulating system (DPMS), whereas the hypnotic suggestion would have a greater effect in quantitative sensory testing (QST). 
Design: This research was conducted as a randomized, blind and crossover trial. 
Settings: All the stages of this clinical trial were performed at the Laboratory of Pain and Neuromodulation of the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre.
Subjects: Were included 24 healthy females aged from 18 to 45 years old, with a high susceptibility to hypnosis, according to the Waterloo-Stanford Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility, Form C (15). 
Methods: The subjects received a random and crossover tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (2mA for 20min) and hypnotic analgesia (20min). 
Results: Only hypnotic suggestion produced changes that are statistically significant from pre- to post-intervention in the following outcomes measures: heat pain threshold (HPT), heat pain tolerance (HPTo), cold pressure test (CPT) and serum brain-derivate-neurotrophic-factor (BDNF). The analysis showed a significant main effect for treatment (F=4.32; P=0.04) when we compared the delta-(Δ) of CPM task between the tDCS and hypnotic suggestion groups. Also, the change in the Δ-BDNF was positively correlated with the CPM task. 
Conclusions: The results confirm a differential effect between hypnotic suggestion and tDCS on the pain measures. They suggest that the impact of the interventions has differential neural mechanisms, since the hypnotic suggestion improved pain perception, whereas the tDCS increased inhibition in the DPMS.

Registration information clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03744897.

Perspective: These findings highlight the effect of hypnotic suggestion on contra-regulating mechanisms involved in pain perception, while the tDCS increased inhibition in the DPMS. They could help clinicians comprehend the mechanisms involved in hypnotic analgesia and tDCS and thus may contribute to pain and disability management.

Keywords: Hypnotic analgesia, tDCS, Pain threshold, CPM, BDNF, Pain.</description>

	<description>Occupational or environmental exposure to manganese (Mn) can lead to the development of “Manganism”, a neurological condition showing certain motor symptoms similar to Parkinson’s disease (PD). Like PD, Mn toxicity is seen in the central nervous system mainly affecting nigrostriatal neuronal circuitry and subsequent behavioral and motor impairments. Since the first report of Mn-induced toxicity in 1837, various experimental and epidemiological studies have been conducted to understand this disorder. While early investigations focused on the impact of high concentrations of Mn on the mitochondria and subsequent oxidative stress, current studies have attempted to elucidate the cellular and molecular pathways involved in Mn toxicity. In fact, recent reports suggest the involvement of Mn in the misfolding of proteins such as α-synuclein and amyloid, thus providing credence to the theory that environmental exposure to toxicants can either initiate or propagate neurodegenerative processes by interfering with disease-specific proteins.  Besides manganism and PD, Mn has also been implicated in other neurological diseases such as Huntington’s and Prion diseases. While many reviews have focused on Mn homeostasis, the aim of this review is to concisely synthesize what we know about its effect primarily on the nervous system with respect to its role in protein misfolding, mitochondrial dysfunction, and consequently, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Based on the current evidence, we propose a ‘Mn Mechanistic Neurotoxic Triad’ comprising 1) mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, 2) protein trafficking and misfolding, and 3) neuroinflammation.</description>

	<description>In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), lesions composed of hyperphosphorylated and aggregated tau, spread from the transentorhinal cortex to the hippocampal formation and neocortex. Growing evidence indicates that tau pathology propagates trans-synaptically, implying that pathological tau released by pre-synaptic neurons is taken up by post-synaptic neurons where it accumulates and aggregates. Observations such as the presence of tau in the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) from control individuals and intyryh the CSF of transgenic mice overexpressing human tau before the detection of neuronal death indicate that tau can be secreted by neurons. The increase of tau in the CSF in pathological conditions such as AD suggests that tau secretion is enhanced and/or other secretory pathways take place when neuronal function is compromised. In physiological conditions, extracellular tau could exert beneficial effects as observed for other cytosolic proteins also released in the extracellular space. In such a case, blocking tau secretion could have negative effects on neurons unless the mechanism of tau secretion are different in physiological and pathological conditions allowing the prevention of pathological tau secretion without affecting the secretion of physiological tau. Furthermore, distinct extracellular tau species could be secreted in physiological and pathological conditions, species having the capacity to induce tau pathology being only secreted in the latter condition. In the present review, we will focus on the mechanisms and function of tau secretion in both physiological and pathological conditions and how this information can help elaborate an efficient therapeutic strategy to prevent tau pathology and its propagation.</description>

	<description>Goal-directed movements are predictive and multimodal in nature, especially for moving targets. For instance, during a reaching movement for a moving target, humans need to predict both motion of the target and movement of the limb. Recent computational studies show that the cerebellum predicts current and future states of the body and its environment using internal forward models. Sensory feedback signals from the periphery have delays in reaching the central nervous system, ranging between tens to hundreds of milliseconds. It is well known in engineering that feedback control based on time-delayed inputs can result in oscillatory and often unstable movements. In contrast, the brain predicts a current state from a previous state using forward models. This predictive mechanism most likely underpins stable and dexterous control of reaching movements. Although the cerebro-cerebellum has long been suggested as loci of various forward models, few methods are available to evaluate accuracy of the forward models in patients with cerebellar ataxia. Recently, we developed a non-invasive method to analyze receipt of motor commands in terms of movement kinematics for the wrist joint (Br/Kr ratio). In the present study, we have identified two components (F1 and F2) of the smooth pursuit movement. We found that the two components were in different control modes with different Br/Kr ratios. The major F1 component in a lower frequency range encodes both velocity and position of the moving target (higher Br/Kr ratio) to synchronize movement of the wrist joint with motion of the target in a predictive manner. The minor F2 component in a higher frequency range is biased to position control in order to generate intermittent small step-wise movements. In cerebellar patients, the F1 component shows a selective decrease in the Br/Kr ratio, which is correlated with decrease in accuracy of the pursuit movement. We conclude that the Br/Kr ratio of the F1 component provides a unique parameter to evaluate accuracy of the predictive control. We also discuss the pathophysiological and clinical implications for clinical ataxiology.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: On the Sparse Structure of Natural Sounds and Natural Images: Similarities, Differences, and Implications for Neural Coding</title>

	<description>Sparse coding models of natural images and sounds have been able to predict several response properties of neurons in the visual and auditory systems. While the success of these models suggests that the structure they capture is universal across domains to some degree, it is not yet clear which aspects of this structure are universal and which vary across sensory modalities. To address this, we fit complete and highly overcomplete sparse coding models to natural images and spectrograms of speech and report on differences in the statistics learned by these models. We find several types of sparse features in natural images, which all appear in similar, approximately Laplacian distributions, whereas the many types of sparse features in speech exhibit a broad range of sparse distributions, many of which are highly asymmetric. Moreover, individual sparse coding units tend to exhibit higher lifetime sparseness for overcomplete models trained on images compared to those trained on speech. Conversely, population sparseness tends to be greater for these networks trained on speech compared with sparse coding models of natural images. To illustrate the relevance of these findings to neural coding, we studied how they impact a biologically plausible sparse coding network's representations in each sensory modality. In particular, a sparse coding network with synaptically local plasticity rules learns different sparse features from speech data than are found by more conventional sparse coding algorithms, but the learned features are qualitatively the same for these models when trained on natural images.</description>

	<description>Noise induces a broad spectrum of pathological injuries to the cochlea, reflecting both mechanical damage to the delicate architecture of the structures of the organ of Corti and metabolic damage within the organ of Corti and lateral wall tissues.  Unlike ototoxic medications, the blood-labyrinth barrier does not offer protection against noise injury.  The blood-labyrinth barrier is a target of noise injury, and can be weakened as part of the metabolic pathologies in the cochlea.  However, it also offers a potential for therapeutic intervention with oto-protective compounds.  Because the blood-labyrinth barrier is weakened by noise, penetration of blood-borne oto-protective compounds could be higher. However, systemic dosing for cochlear protection from noise offers other significant challenges.  An alternative option to systemic dosing is local administration to the cochlea through the round window membrane using a variety of drug delivery techniques.  The review will discuss noise-induced cochlear pathology, including alterations to the blood-labyrinth barrier, and then transition into discussing approaches for delivery of oto-protective compounds to reduce cochlear injury from noise.</description>

	<description>Magnocellular neurons in the supraoptic nucleus (SON), which synthesize and release arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT), express several subtypes of ATP-stimulated purinergic P2X receptors (P2XR) that modulate neuronal activity as well as neurotransmitter and hormone release. However, the physiological impact of this modulation is not well understood. Here, we tested a hypothesis that P2XRs play a role in the sustained release of hormones from SON neurons stimulated through fasting/refeeding. We studied the effect of 2 h of refeeding after 48 h of fasting on P2XR and P2YR mRNA expression and ATP-induced presynaptic and postsynaptic responses in the SON of 30-day-old rats. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the expression of P2X2R and AVP mRNA was upregulated, whereas P2X4R, P2X7R, P2Y2R and OT mRNA levels were not significantly changed and P2Y1R mRNA expression was decreased. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings performed on isolated rat brain slices showed that the amplitude of the ATP-stimulated somatic current and the ATP-induced increases in the frequency of spontaneous GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents were significantly higher in SON neurons from fasted/refed rats than in SON neurons from normally fed rats. No evidence was found for changes in the presynaptic effect of ATP in SON neurons not expressing somatic P2XRs. These results suggest that the increased activity of SON neurons synthesizing AVP is associated with enhanced expression of P2X2Rs on neuronal cell bodies and their GABAergic presynaptic nerve terminals.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effect of Autophagy Modulators on Vascular, Glial, and Neuronal Alterations in the Oxygen-Induced Retinopathy Mouse Model</title>

	<description>Hypoxia is one of the main insults in proliferative retinopathies, leading to neovascularization and neurodegeneration. To maintain homeostasis, neurons require efficient degradation and recycling systems. Autophagy participates in retinal cell death, but it is also a cell survival mechanism. Here, we analysed the role of autophagy at the three characteristic time periods in the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mouse model and determined if its modulation can improve vascular and non-vascular alterations. Experiments were performed with chloroquine (CQ) in order to monitor autophagosome accumulation by lysosomal blockade. Postnatal day (P)17 OIR mouse retinas showed a significant increase in autophagy flux. In particular, an intense LC3B and p62 staining was observed in inner layers of the retina, mainly proliferating endothelial cells. After a single intraocular injection of Rapamycin at P12 OIR, a decreased neovascular area and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein expression were observed at P17 OIR. In addition, whereas the increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was reversed at P26 OIR, the functional alterations persisted. Using a similar therapeutic schedule, we analyzed the effect of anti-VEGF therapy on autophagy flux. Like Rapamycin, VEGF inhibitor treatment not only reduced the amount of neovascular tufts, but also activated autophagy flux at P17 OIR, mainly in ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner nuclear layer (INL). Finally, the effects of the disruption of autophagy by Spautin-1, were evaluated at vascular, glial and neuronal levels. After a single dose of Spautin-1, Western blot analysis showed a significant decrease in LC3B II and p62 protein expression at P13 OIR, returning both autophagy markers to OIR control levels at P17. In addition, neither gliosis nor functional alterations were attenuated. In line with these results, TUNEL staining showed a slight increase in the number of positive cells in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) at P17 OIR. Overall, our results demonstrate that all treatments of induction or inhibition of the autophagic flux reduced neovascular area but were unable to completely reverse the neuronal damage. Besides, compared to current treatments, rapamycin provides a more promising therapeutic strategy as it reduces both neovascular tufts and persistent gliosis.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Deletion of the Ca2+ Channel Subunit α2δ3 Differentially Affects Cav2.1 and Cav2.2 Currents in Cultured Spiral Ganglion Neurons Before and After the Onset of Hearing</title>

	<description>Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are composed of a pore-forming α1 subunit and auxiliary β and α2δ subunits, which modulate Ca2+ current properties and channel trafficking. So far, the partial redundancy and specificity of α1 for α2δ subunits in the CNS have remained largely elusive. Mature spiral ganglion (SG) neurons express α2δ subunit isoforms 1, 2, and 3 and multiple Ca2+ channel subtypes. Differentiation and in-vivo functions of their endbulb of Held synapses, which rely on presynaptic P/Q channels (Lin et al., 2011), require the α2δ3 subunit (Pirone et al., 2014). This led us to hypothesize that P/Q channels may preferentially co-assemble with α2δ3. Using a dissociated primary culture, we analyzed the effects of α2δ3 deletion on somatic Ca2+ currents (ICa) of SG neurons isolated at postnatal day 20 (P20), when the cochlea is regarded to be mature. P/Q currents were the dominating steady-state Ca2+ currents (54 % of total) followed by T-type, L-type, N-type, and R-type currents. Deletion of α2δ3 reduced P/Q and R-type currents by 60 % and 38 %, respectively, whereas L-type, N-type and T-type currents were not altered. A subset of ICa types was also analyzed in SG neurons isolated at P5, i.e. before the onset of hearing (P12). Both L-type and N-type current amplitudes of wildtype SG neurons were larger at P5 compared with P20. Deletion of α2δ3 reduced L-type and N-type currents by 23 % and 44 %, respectively. In contrast, small P/Q currents, which were just being up-regulated at P5, were unaffected by the lack of α2δ3. In summary, α2δ3 regulates amplitudes of L- and N-type currents of immature cultured SG neurons, whereas it regulates P/Q- and R-type currents at P20. Our data indicate a developmental switch from dominating somatic N- to P/Q-type currents in cultured SG neurons. A switch from N- to P/Q-type channels, which has been observed at several central synapses, may also occur at developing endbulbs of Held. In this case, reduction of both neonatal N- (P5) and more mature P/Q-type currents (around/after hearing onset) may contribute to the impaired morphology and function of endbulb synapses in α2δ3-deficient mice.</description>

	<description>A new label-free method is presented for measuring myeloarchitecture of the murine cerebral cortex in vivo and ex vivo. Growing evidence suggests that cortical myelination plays significant roles in neuronal plasticity and pathologies, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), but illuminating the mechanism requires longitudinal imaging of the same brains. Here we demonstrate imaging unlabeled myelinated fibers in a live mouse brain by third-harmonic generation (THG). Contrary to other label-free microscopies based on reflectance, fibers of all orientations could be visualized, i.e., radial and tangential to the pia, which is suitable for revealing the three-dimensional connectivity. The depth of THG imaging in an intact brain was approximately 200 µm, so the network of myelinated fibers could be captured into layers 2/3 in vivo. THG provides a novel base for reconstruction of morphology. Semi-automatic tracing of THG-positive axons unraveled the depth-dependent distribution of myelin lattice. Finally, a unique light property of THG was exploited for the estimation of the g-ratio. The demonstrated THG morphometry of the length density, orientation, and sheath thickness of cortical myelin could be useful for elucidating the function and how it is modulated during learning and diseases.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Synaptopathy as a Mechanism for Age-Related Vestibular Dysfunction in Mice</title>

	<description>Aged related decline of inner ear function contributes to both hearing loss and balance disorders, which lead to impaired quality of life and falls that can result in injury and even death. The cellular mechanisms responsible for the ear’s functional decline have been controversial, but hair cell loss has been considered the key cause for a long time. However, recent studies showed that in the cochlea, loss of inner hair cell synapses precedes hair cell or neuronal loss, and this synaptopathy is an early step in the functional decline. Whether a similar process occurs in the vestibular organ, its timing and its relationship to organ dysfunction remained unknown. We compared the time course of age-related deterioration in vestibular and cochlear functions in mice as well as characterized the age-associated changes in their utricles at the histological level. We found that in the mouse, as in humans, age-related decline in vestibular evoked potentials (VsEPs) occurs later than hearing loss. As in the cochlea, deterioration of VsEPs correlates with the loss of utricular ribbon synapses but not hair cells or neuronal cell bodies. Furthermore, the age-related synaptic loss is restricted to calyceal innervations in the utricular extrastriolar region. Hence, our findings suggest that loss of extrastriolar calyceal synapses has a key role in age-related vestibular dysfunction.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Flavonoids as Prospective Neuroprotectants and Their Therapeutic Propensity in Aging Associated Neurological Disorders</title>

	<description>Modern research revealed that dietary consumption of flavonoids and flavonoids-rich foods significantly improves cognitive capabilities, inhibits or delays the senescence process and related neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The flavonoids rich foods such as green tea, cocoa, blue berry and other foods appear to improve states of cognitive hypofunction, AD and dementia-like pathological symptoms in different animal models. The mechanism of flavonoids are principally mediated via inhibition of cholinesterases (AChE, BChE), beta secretase (BACE1), free radicals and modulation of signaling pathways implicated in cognitive and neuroprotective performance. Flavonoids interact with several signaling protein pathways like ERK and PI3-kinase/Akt and modulate their actions, leading to their neuroprotective effects. Moreover, they enhance vascular blood flow and instigate neurogenesis particularly in the hippocampus area of the brain in animal models investigated so for. Flavonoids also hamper the progression of pathological symptoms of neuro-degenerative disorders via inhibition of neuronal apoptosis induced byneurotoxic substances including free radicals and beta amyloid proteins (Aβ). All these functions contribute to the maintenance of number, quality of neurons and their synaptic connectivity in the brain. Thus flavonoids can thwart the progression of age related disorders and can be a potential source for the development of new drugs effective in cognitive disabilities disorders.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Post-amyloid Era in Alzheimer's Disease: Trust Your Gut Feeling</title>

	<description>Amyloid hypothesis, the assumption that beta-amyloid toxicity is the primary cause of neuronal and synaptic loss, has been the mainstream research concept in Alzheimer’s disease for the past two decades. Currently, this model is quietly being replaced by a more holistic, “systemic disease” paradigm which, like the aging process, affects multiple body tissues and organs, including the gut microbiota.
It is well-established that inflammation is a hallmark of cellular senescence, however the infection-senescence link has been less explored.  Microbiota-induced senescence is a gradually emerging concept promoted by the discovery of pathogens and their products in Alzheimer’s disease brains associated with senescent neurons, glia and endothelial cells.
Infectious agents have previously been associated with Alzheimer’s disease, but the cause vs. effect issue could not be established.  A recent study may have settled this debate as it shows that gingipain, a Porphyromonas gingivalis toxin, can be detected not only in Alzheimer’s disease but also in the brains of older individuals deceased prior to developing the illness.
In this review we take the position that gut microbes and their molecules reach the brain by triggering intestinal and blood brain barrier senescence and disruption.  We also surmise that novel Alzheimer’s disease findings, including neuronal somatic mosaicism, iron dyshomeostasis, aggressive glial phenotypes and loss of aerobic glycolysis can be explained by the infection-senescence model. In addition, we discuss potential cellular senescence targets and therapeutic strategies, including iron chelators, inflammasome inhibitors, senolytic antibiotics, mitophagy and epigenetic metabolic reprograming.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Epigenomic Convergence of Neural-Immune Risk Factors in Neurodevelopmental Disorder Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) affect 7–14% of all children in developed countries and are one of the leading causes of lifelong disability. Epigenetic modifications are poised at the interface between genes and environment and are predicted to reveal insight into NDD etiology. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing was used to examine DNA cytosine methylation in 49 human cortex samples from 3 different NDDs (autism spectrum disorder, Rett syndrome, and Dup15q syndrome) and matched controls. Integration of methylation changes across NDDs with relevant genomic and genetic datasets revealed differentially methylated regions (DMRs) unique to each type of NDD but with shared regulatory functions in neurons and microglia. NDD DMRs were enriched within promoter regions and for transcription factor binding sites with identified methylation sensitivity. DMRs from all 3 disorders were enriched for ontologies related to nervous system development and genes with disrupted expression in brain from neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorders. Genes associated with NDD DMRs showed expression patterns indicating an important role for altered microglial function during brain development. These findings demonstrate an NDD epigenomic signature in human cortex that will aid in defining therapeutic targets and early biomarkers at the interface of genetic and environmental NDD risk factors.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Categorical Encoding of Vowels in Primary Auditory Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz112</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Speech perception involves mapping from a continuous and variable acoustic speech signal to discrete, linguistically meaningful units. However, it is unclear where in the auditory processing stream speech sound representations cease to be veridical (faithfully encoding precise acoustic properties) and become categorical (encoding sounds as linguistic categories). In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivariate pattern analysis to determine whether tonotopic primary auditory cortex (PAC), defined as tonotopic voxels falling within Heschl’s gyrus, represents one class of speech sounds—vowels—veridically or categorically. For each of 15 participants, 4 individualized synthetic vowel stimuli were generated such that the vowels were equidistant in acoustic space, yet straddled a categorical boundary (with the first 2 vowels perceived as [i] and the last 2 perceived as [&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;]). Each participant’s 4 vowels were then presented in a block design with an irrelevant but attention-demanding level change detection task. We found that in PAC bilaterally, neural discrimination between pairs of vowels that crossed the categorical boundary was more accurate than neural discrimination between equivalently spaced vowel pairs that fell within a category. These findings suggest that PAC does not represent vowel sounds veridically, but that encoding of vowels is shaped by linguistically relevant phonemic categories.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Exposures to life stressors accumulate across the lifespan, with possible impact on brain health. Little is known, however, about the mechanisms mediating age-related changes in brain structure. We use a lifespan sample of participants (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 21 251; 4–97 years) to investigate the relationship between the thickness of cerebral cortex and the expression of the glucocorticoid- and the mineralocorticoid-receptor genes (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NR3C1&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NR3C2&lt;/span&gt;, respectively), obtained from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. In all participants, cortical thickness correlated negatively with the expression of both &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NR3C1&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NR3C2&lt;/span&gt; across 34 cortical regions. The magnitude of this correlation varied across the lifespan. From childhood through early adulthood, the profile similarity (between &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NR3C1&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NR3C2&lt;/span&gt; expression and thickness) increased with age. Conversely, both profile similarities decreased with age in late life. These variations do not reflect age-related changes in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NR3C1&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NR3C2&lt;/span&gt; expression, as observed in 5 databases of gene expression in the human cerebral cortex (502 donors). Based on the co-expression of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NR3C1&lt;/span&gt; (and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NR3C2&lt;/span&gt;) with genes specific to neural cell types, we determine the potential involvement of microglia, astrocytes, and CA1 pyramidal cells in mediating the relationship between corticosteroid exposure and cortical thickness. Therefore, corticosteroids may influence brain structure to a variable degree throughout life.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: PTEN Activity Defines an Axis for Plasticity at Cortico-Amygdala Synapses and Influences Social Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz103</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor and autism-associated gene that exerts an important influence over neuronal structure and function during development. In addition, it participates in synaptic plasticity processes in adulthood. As an attempt to assess synaptic and developmental mechanisms by which PTEN can modulate cognitive function, we studied the consequences of 2 different genetic manipulations in mice: presence of additional genomic copies of the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Pten&lt;/span&gt; gene (Pten&lt;sup&gt;tg&lt;/sup&gt;) and knock-in of a truncated &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Pten&lt;/span&gt; gene lacking its PDZ motif (Pten-ΔPDZ), which is required for interaction with synaptic proteins. Pten&lt;sup&gt;tg&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibit substantial microcephaly, structural hypoconnectivity, enhanced synaptic depression at cortico-amygdala synapses, reduced anxiety, and intensified social interactions. In contrast, Pten-ΔPDZ mice have a much more restricted phenotype, with normal synaptic connectivity, but impaired synaptic depression at cortico-amygdala synapses and virtually abolished social interactions. These results suggest that synaptic actions of PTEN in the amygdala contribute to specific behavioral traits, such as sociability. Also, PTEN appears to function as a bidirectional rheostat in the amygdala: reduction in PTEN activity at synapses is associated with less sociability, whereas enhanced PTEN activity accompanies hypersocial behavior.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>The precise modulation of regional cerebral blood flow during neural activation is important for matching local energetic demand and supply and clearing brain metabolites. Here we discuss advances facilitated by high-resolution optical in vivo imaging techniques that for the first time have provided direct visualization of capillary blood flow and its modulation by neural activity. We focus primarily on studies of microvascular flow, mural cell control of vessel diameter, and oxygen level-dependent changes in red blood cell deformability.</description>

	<description>Parental care is essential for the survival of offspring in altricial mammalian species. However, in most mammals, virgin females tend to avoid or attack infants. Moreover, most males demonstrate avoidance and aggression toward infants, and have little to no involvement in parental care. What mechanisms suppress avoidance, and support approach towards pups, to promote maternal care? In biparental and cooperatively breeding species, what mechanisms allow nonmothers (i.e., fathers and alloparents) to demonstrate parental care? In this review we consider the mechanisms that subserve parental care in mothers, fathers, and others (i.e., alloparents).</description>

Estimation of liver function is important to monitor progression of chronic liver disease (CLD). A promising method is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with gadoxetate, a liver-specific contrast agent. For this method, we have previously developed a model for an average healthy human. Herein, we extended this model, by combining it with a patient-specific non-linear mixed-effects modeling framework. We validated the model by recruiting 100 patients with CLD of varying severity and etiologies. The model explained all MRI data and adequately predicted both timepoints saved for validation and gadoxetate concentrations in both plasma and biopsies. The validated model provides a new and deeper look into how the mechanisms of liver function vary across a wide variety of liver diseases. The basic mechanisms remain the same, but increasing fibrosis reduces uptake and increases excretion of gadoxetate. These mechanisms are shared across many liver functions and can now be estimated from standard clinical images.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cjqsa6D7Mm8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A large variety of severe medical conditions involve alterations in microvascular circulation. Hence, measurements or simulation of circulation and perfusion has considerable clinical value and can be used for diagnostics, evaluation of treatment efficacy, and for surgical planning. However, the accuracy of traditional tracer kinetic one-compartment models is limited due to scale dependency. As a remedy, we propose a scale invariant mathematical framework for simulating whole brain perfusion. The suggested framework is based on a segmentation of anatomical geometry down to imaging voxel resolution. Large vessels in the arterial and venous network are identified from time-of-flight (ToF) and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Macro-scale flow in the large-vessel-network is accurately modelled using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, whereas capillary flow is treated as two-compartment porous media flow. Macro-scale flow is coupled with micro-scale flow by a spatially distributing support function in the terminal endings. Perfusion is defined as the transition of fluid from the arterial to the venous compartment. We demonstrate a whole brain simulation of tracer propagation on a realistic geometric model of the human brain, where the model comprises distinct areas of grey and white matter, as well as large vessels in the arterial and venous vascular network. Our proposed framework is an accurate and viable alternative to traditional compartment models, with high relevance for simulation of brain perfusion and also for restoration of field parameters in clinical brain perfusion applications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2FRNwJZdUDo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Neurons of the PNS are able to regenerate injured axons, a process requiring significant cellular resources to establish and maintain long-distance growth. Genetic activation of mTORC1, a potent regulator of cellular metabolism and protein translation, improves axon regeneration of peripheral neurons by an unresolved mechanism. To gain insight into this process, we activated mTORC1 signaling in mouse nociceptors via genetic deletion of its negative regulator Tsc2. Perinatal deletion of Tsc2 in nociceptors enhanced initial axon growth after sciatic nerve crush, however by 3 d post-injury axon elongation rate became similar to controls. mTORC1 inhibition prior to nerve injury was required to suppress the enhanced axon growth. Gene expression analysis in purified nociceptors revealed that Tsc2-deficient nociceptors had increased activity of regeneration-associated transcription factors (RATFs), including cJun and Atf3, in the absence of injury. Additionally, nociceptor deletion of Tsc2 activated satellite glial cells and macrophages in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in a similar manner to nerve injury. Surprisingly, these changes improved axon length but not percentage of initiating axons in dissociated cultures. The pro-regenerative environment in naïve DRG was recapitulated by AAV8-mediated deletion of Tsc2 in adult mice, suggesting that this phenotype does not result from a developmental effect. Consistently, AAV8-mediated Tsc2 deletion did not improve behavioral recovery after a sciatic nerve crush injury despite initially enhanced axon growth. Together, these data show that neuronal mTORC1 activation induces an incomplete pro-regenerative environment in the DRG that improves initial but not later axon growth after nerve injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) with clopidogrel plus aspirin has been suggested by AHA/ASA guidelines for minor stroke (MS) and transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients. The purpose of this study was to find the potential subgroups that benefit from the DAT. We aimed to compare the efficacy of clopidogrel‐aspirin therapy with aspirin therapy in MS/TIA patients stratified by CYP2C19 genotype and risk profiles.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CYP2C19 loss‐of‐function allele (LoFA) carriers were defined as patients with either LoFA of *2 or *3. Low and high risk profile was defined as Essen stroke risk score (ESRS)&amp;lt;3 and ≥3, respectively. Stroke recurrence at one year was defined as primary outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total 2933 MS/TIA patients, there were 1726 (58.8%) LoFA carriers and 1068 (36.4%) patients at high risk (ESRS≥3). No significant difference for stroke recurrence between clopidogrel‐aspirin group and aspirin alone group was found in LoFA carriers (11.2% vs 13.3%, HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.64~1.09). In Stratified analyses by CYP2C19 genotype and ESRS, HRs (95% CIs) of the clopidogrel‐aspirin therapy for stroke recurrence were 1.00 (0.70~1.42), 0.63 (0.41~0.97), 0.62 (0.40~0.96) and 0.52 (0.31~0.88) among subgroups of LoFA carriers at low risk, LoFA carriers at high risk, LoFA non‐carriers at low risk and LoFA non‐carriers at high risk, respectively, with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=0.021 for interaction.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall LoFA carriers do not benefit from DAT, but there is significant benefit for LoFA carriers who are at high risk. The benefit of clopidogrel in Chinese MS/TIA patients depends on CYP2C19 genotype and risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used the Mendelian randomization design to explore the potential causal association of smoking with ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage using summary statistics data for 34,217 ischemic stroke cases and 404,630 noncases and 1545 cases of intracerebral hemorrhage and 1481 noncases. Genetic predisposition to smoking initiation (ever smoking regularly), based on up to 372 single‐nucleotide polymorphisms, was statistically significantly positively associated with any ischemic stroke, large artery stroke, and small vessel stroke but not cardioembolic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage. This study provides genetic support for a causal association of smoking with ischemic stroke, particularly large artery and small vessel stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

During neuronal differentiation, spatially and temporally regulated transcription allows neuronal migration, the growth of dendrites and axons, and at later stages, synaptic formation and the establishment of neuronal circuitry. Genome topology and relocation of gene loci within the nucleus are now regarded as key factors that contribute to transcriptional regulation. Here, we review recent work supporting the hypothesis that the dynamic organization of chromatin within the nucleus impacts gene activation in response to extrinsic signalling and during neuronal differentiation. The consequences of disruption of the genome architecture on neuronal health will be also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

However, the relationship between epigenetic regulation and neuropathology is largely correlational due to the presence of mixed cell populations within brain regions and the genome-wide effects of classical approaches to manipulate the epigenome. Locus-specific epigenetic editing allows direct epigenetic regulation of specific genes to elucidate the direct causal relationship between epigenetic modifications and transcription. This review discusses some of the latest innovations in the efficacy and flexibility in this approach that hold promise for neurobiological application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Neuroligins are highly conserved across evolution with important roles in the formation, maturation and function of synaptic structures. Mutations in the genes that encode for neuroligins have been linked to a number of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, which stem from synaptic pathologies. Owing to their essential functions in regulating synaptic connectivity and their link to synaptic dysfunction in disease, previous studies on neuroligins have focused on neurons. Yet a recent work reveals that neuroligins are also expressed in the central nervous system by glial cells, such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and perform important roles in controlling synaptic connectivity in a non-cell autonomous manner. In this review, we will highlight these recent findings demonstrating the important roles of glial neuroligins in regulating the development and connectivity of healthy and diseased brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Known exceptions include canonical imprinted genes, random X-chromosome inactivation, olfactory receptors and clustered protocadherins. Here, we highlight recent studies showing that allele-specific expression is frequent in the genome and involves subtypes of epigenetic allelic effects that differ in terms of heritability, clonality and stability over time. Different forms of epigenetic allele regulation could have different roles in brain development, function, and disease. An emerging area involves understanding allelic effects in a cell-type and developmental stage-specific manner and determining how these effects influence the impact of genetic variants and mutations on the brain. A deeper understanding of epigenetics at the allele and cellular level in the brain could help clarify the mechanisms underlying phenotypic variance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

While much effort has been devoted to understanding the capacity and role for local protein synthesis in dendrites and spines, local mRNA translation in mature axons, projecting over distances up to a meter, has received much less attention. Also, little is known about the spatio-temporal dynamics of axonal and dendritic gene expression as function of mRNA abundance, protein synthesis and degradation. Here, we summarize key recent findings that have shaped our knowledge of the precise location of local protein production and discuss unique strategies used by neurons to shape presynaptic and postsynaptic proteomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

This region is densely packed with thousands of proteins that are involved in extensive interactions. During synaptic plasticity, the PSD undergoes changes in size and composition along with changes in synaptic strength that lead to long term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD). It is therefore essential to understand the organization principles underlying PSD assembly and rearrangement. Here, we review exciting new findings from recent &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; reconstitution studies and propose a hypothesis that liquid–liquid phase separation mediates PSD formation and regulation. We also discuss how the properties of PSD formed via phase separation might contribute to the biological functions observed from decades of researches. Finally, we highlight unanswered questions regarding PSD organization and how &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; reconstitution systems may help to answer these questions in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

These processes rely on a subtle interplay between the set of genes inherited from the parents, the surrounding environment and epigenetic regulation. Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) has been shown to recognize epigenetic states and regulate gene expression by reading methylated DNA. Here, we will review the recent findings revealing the role of MeCP2 during postnatal CPs of development using mouse models of Rett (RTT) syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

How these processes are initiated and coordinated are open questions. Synapse specificity, or synaptic partner selection, is widely understood to be determined by the trans-synaptic binding of cell adhesion molecules. However, &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; evidence that cell adhesion molecules subsequently function to initiate synapse assembly, as initially proposed, is lacking. Here, we present a summary of our current understanding of synaptogenic pathways that mediate presynaptic and postsynaptic assembly and the coordination of these processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

In the last several years, technological advances improving our ability to identify mRNA modifications, coupled with the discovery of proteins that add and remove these marks, have substantially expanded our knowledge of how the epitranscriptome shapes gene expression. Efforts to uncover functional roles for mRNA modifications have begun to reveal important roles for some marks within the nervous system, and animal models have emerged which demonstrate severe neurodevelopmental and neurocognitive abnormalities resulting from the loss of mRNA modification machinery. Here, we review the recent advances in the field of neuroepitranscriptomics, with a particular emphasis on how modifications to mRNAs within the brain contribute to synaptic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Autophagosomes and endosomes sequester cellular cargo through different mechanisms, but these pathways converge upon fusion with lysosomes. Both pathways are spatially regulated, with distinct features evident in the soma, axons, and dendrites, possibly as an adaptation to the unique morphology of neurons and the specific demands of each compartment. Relatively little is known about how autophagy and endo-lysosomal degradation interact and how their activities may be coordinated. We review our current understanding of autophagy and endo-lysosomal degradation in neurons, highlighting common features and differences as well as the intersection of these two essential cellular pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

These include gains or losses of activity-responsiveness of certain genes and differences in gene induction profiles. Here, we discuss a possible origin of dissimilarities in activity-regulated transcription between species. We highlight that while synapse-to-nucleus signalling pathways are evolutionarily conserved, &lt;em&gt;cis&lt;/em&gt;-regulatory plasticity has been driving species-specific remodelling of the activity-controlled enhancer landscape, thereby affecting gene regulation. In particular, evolutionary rearrangements of transcription factor binding site placements together with potential species-dependent developmental stage- and/or cell type-specific epigenetic and other &lt;em&gt;trans&lt;/em&gt;-acting mechanisms are most likely at least in part accountable for between-species diversity in activity-regulated transcription. It is conceivable that &lt;em&gt;cis&lt;/em&gt;-regulatory plasticity may have equipped the synaptic activity-driven adaptive gene program in human neurons with unique, species-specific qualities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The BBB regulates molecular flux to maintain an optimal environment for neuronal function and protects the brain from toxins and pathogens. Endothelial cells forming the walls of CNS blood vessels constitute the BBB. CNS endothelial cells exhibit two features that underlie the restrictive properties of the BBB: specialized tight junctions that prevent paracellular passage between the blood and the brain, and unusually low levels of vesicle trafficking that limit transcellular transport or transcytosis. While the prevailing view in the field was that specialized tight junctions contributed to CNS barrier properties, recent findings have revealed the importance of maintaining low rates of transcytosis at the BBB. It is now clear that suppression of transcytosis at the BBB is an active process and CNS-specific genetic programs inhibit this pathway to maintain a functional barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

This simple concept underlies rapid electrical signaling in the brain as well as several important aspects of neural plasticity. Although the soma accounts for less than 1% of many neurons by membrane area, it has been the major site of measuring ion channel function. However, the axon is one of the longest processes found in cellular biology and hosts a multitude of critical signaling functions in the brain. Not only does the axon initiate and rapidly propagate action potentials (APs) across the brain but it also forms the presynaptic terminals that convert these electrical inputs into chemical outputs. Here, we review recent advances in the physiological role of ion channels within the diverse landscape of the axon and presynaptic terminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Characterization of Inflammation in Delayed Cortical Transplantation</title>

	<description>We previously reported that embryonic motor cortical neurons transplanted one-week after lesions in the adult mouse motor cortex significantly enhances graft vascularization, survival, and proliferation of grafted cells, the density of projections developed by grafted neurons and improves functional repair and recovery. The purpose of the present study is to understand the extent to which post-traumatic inflammation following cortical lesion could influence the survival of grafted neurons and the development of their projections to target brain regions and conversely how transplanted cells can modulate host inflammation. For this, embryonic motor cortical tissue was grafted either immediately or with a one-week delay into the lesioned motor cortex of adult mice. Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed to determine the density and cell morphology of resident and peripheral infiltrating immune cells. Then, in-situ hybridization was performed to analyze the distribution and temporal mRNA expression pattern of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines following cortical lesion. In parallel, we analyzed the protein expression of both M1- and M2-associated markers to study the M1/M2 balance switch. We have shown that one-week after the lesion, the number of astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and CD45+ cells was significantly increased along with characteristics of M2 microglia phenotype. Interestingly, the majority of microglia co-expressed TGF-β1, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, supporting the hypothesis that microglial activation is also neuroprotective. Our results suggest that the modulation of post-traumatic inflammation one-week after cortical lesion might be implicated in the improvement of graft vascularization, survival, and density of projections developed by grafted neurons.</description>

	<description>Behavior and higher cognition rely on the transfer of information between neurons through specialized contact sites termed synapses. Plasticity of neuronal circuits, a prerequisite to respond to environmental changes, is inseparably coupled with the nerve cell’s ability to form, structurally modulate or remove synapses. Consequently, the synaptic proteome undergoes dynamic alteration on demand in a spatiotemporally restricted manner. Therefore, proper protein localization at synapses is essential for synaptic function. This process is regulated by (i) protein transport and recruitment, (ii) local protein synthesis and (iii) synaptic protein degradation. These processes shape the transmission efficiency of excitatory synapses. Whether and how these processes influence synaptic inhibition is, however, widely unknown. Here, we summarize findings on fundamental regulatory processes that can be extrapolated to inhibitory synapses. We therefore focus on known aspects of posttranscriptional regulation and protein dynamics of the GABA receptor. We propose that local (co)-translational control mechanism might control transmission of inhibitory synapses.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Modulation of Functional Connectivity Between Dopamine Neurons of the Rat Ventral Tegmental Area in vitro</title>

	<description>Micro Electrode Arrays were used to simultaneously record spontaneous extracellular action potentials from 10-30 dopamine neurons in acute brain slices from the lateral Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) of the rat. The spike train of an individual neuron was used to characterize the firing pattern: firing rate, firing irregularity and oscillation frequency. Functional connectivity between a pair of neurons was quantified by the Paired Phase Consistency (PPC), taking the oscillation frequency as reference. Under baseline conditions the PPC was significantly different from zero and 42 of the 386 pairs of VTA neurons showed significant coupling. 50%of the recorded dopamine neurons were part of the coupled VTA network. Raising extracellular potassium from 3.5 mM to 5 mM increased the mean firing rate of the dopamine neurons by 45%. The same increase could be induced by bath application of 300 uM glutamate. High potassium reduced the PPC, but it did not change during the glutamate application. Our findings imply that manipulating excitability has distinct and specific consequences for functional connectivity in the VTA network that cannot be directly predicted from the changes in neuronal firing rates. Functional connectivity reflects the spatial organization and synchronization of the VTA output and thus represents a unique element of the message that is sent to the mesolimbic projection area. It adds a dimension to pharmacological manipulation of the VTA micro circuit that might help to understand the pharmacological (side) effects of e.g. anti-psychotic drugs.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Quercetin Enhances Inhibitory Synaptic Inputs and Reduces Excitatory Synaptic Inputs to OFF- and ON-Type Retinal Ganglion Cells in a Chronic Glaucoma Rat Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00672</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00672</link>
	<description>Background: Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease caused by excitotoxic injury of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). It has been proved that an important natural dietary flavonoid compound (quercetin) can improve RGC function in our previous high intraocular pressure model prepared by magnetic bead injection into anterior chamber. However, it is unclear whether quercetin can improve the function of RGCs and how quercetin regulates synaptic transmission in chronic glaucoma rat models. 
Methods: Rat model of chronic glaucoma was prepared by electrocoagulation of superior scleral vein. Electrophysiological electroretinogram was used to detect the photopic negative response (PhNR). Whole-cell patch clamp was used to clamp ON- and OFF-type RGC in normal and 4 weeks retinal sections of glaucoma. 
Results: Quercetin can restore the decrease of PhNR amplitude caused by chronic glaucoma. The basic miniature GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in RGCs frequency of glaucomatous retinal slices was lower than that of the control group. The frequencies of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were not significantly different between control and glaucomatous RGCs. The baseline frequencies of GABAergic mIPSCs and mEPSCs in OFF-type glaucomatous RGCs were greater than those in ON-type glaucomatous RGCs. Quercetin increased miniature GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission to RGCs and decreased miniature glutamatergic excitatory neurotransmission, reduced the excitability of the RGC itself, thus alleviating the excitability of RGCs in glaucomatous slices. 
Conclusions: Quercetin may be a promising therapeutic agent for improving RGC survival and function in glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Quercetin exerted direct protective effects on RGCs by increasing inhibitory neurotransmission and decreasing excitatory neurotransmission to RGCs, thus reducing excitotoxic damage to those cells in glaucoma.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurogenesis section | New and Recent Articles: Silencing of SNHG12 Enhanced the Effectiveness of MSCs in Alleviating Ischemia/Reperfusion Injuries via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathway</title>

	<description>Previous studies have reported that long non-coding RNA SNHG12 (lncRNA SNHG12) plays critical role in regulating biofunction of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), but the effect of lncRNA SNHG12 in MSCs in brain injury is still rarely reported. Hence, the protective effect and mechanism of a lncRNA SNHG12 modified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was explored in treating brain injury under an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) condition in this study. I/R rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) were cocultured with MSCs or I/R pretreated MSCs. Then, proliferation of BMECs was detected using CCK-8 and EdU assays and apoptosis of cells was determined using flow cytometry and Hoechst. Autophagy of BMECs was determined using immunofluorescence and associated pathway was measured using western blotting. Moreover, proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy of BMECs was also determined after co-culturing with shSNHG12-MSCs. In addition, a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model rat model treated with MSCs injection was also used to confirm the findings in cells. I/R treatment significantly decreased the proliferation, but increase SNHG12 expression as well as the apoptosis and autophagy of BMECs. However, co-culturing with MSCs markedly alleviated the reduction of proliferation and increase of apoptosis and autophagy, as well as the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR, in BMECs induced by I/R and shSNHG12 remarkably enhanced the effect of MSCs. In addition, MSCs injection also alleviated the infarct area and apoptosis of MACO rats, as well as the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR. Moreover, shSNHG12 enhanced the ameliorative effect of MSCs in treating brain injury in MACO model.In conclusions, silencing SNHG12 enhanced the effect of MSCs in ameliorating apoptosis and autophagy of BMECs induced by PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.</description>

	<description>Multi-electrode arrays, both active or passive, emerged as ideal technologies to unveil intricated electrophysiological dynamics of cells and tissues. Active MEAs, designed using complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology (CMOS), stand over passive devices thanks to the possibility of achieving single-cell resolution, the reduced electrode size, the reduced crosstalk and the higher functionality and portability. Nevertheless, most of the reported CMOS MEA systems mainly rely on a single operational modality, which strongly hampers the applicability range of a single device. This can be a limiting factor considering that most biological and electrophysiological dynamics are often based on the synergy of multiple and complex mechanisms acting from different angles on the same phenomena. Here, we designed a CMOS MEA chip with 16,384 titanium nitride electrodes, 6 independent operational modalities and 1,024 parallel recording channels for neuro-electrophysiological studies. Sixteen independent active areas are patterned on the chip surface forming a 4x4 matrix, each one including 1,024 electrodes. Electrodes of four different sizes are present on the chip surface, ranging from 2.5x3.5 µm^2 up to 10.5x11.0 µm^2, with 15 µm pitch. In this paper, we exploited the impedance monitoring and voltage recording modalities not only to monitor the growth and development of primary rat hippocampal neurons, but also to assess their electrophysiological activity over time showing a mean spike amplitude of 144.8 ± 84.6 µV. Fixed frequency (1 kHz) and high sampling rate (30 kHz) impedance measurements were used to evaluate the cellular adhesion and growth on the chip surface. Thanks to the high-density configuration of the electrodes, as well as their dimension and pitch, the chip can appreciate the evolutions of the cell culture morphology starting from the moment of the seeding up to mature culture conditions. The measurements were confirmed by fluorescent staining. The effect of the different electrode sizes on the spike amplitudes and noise were also discussed. The multi-modality of the presented CMOS MEA allows for the simultaneous assessment of different physiological properties of the cultured neurons. Therefore, it can pave the way both to answer complex fundamental neuroscience questions as well as to aid the current drug -development paradigm.</description>

	<description>ABSTRACT
Although amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has been considered as a disorder of the motor neuron cell body, recent evidences show the non-cell-autonomous pathogenic nature of the disease. Axonal degeneration, loss of peripheral axons and destruction of nerve terminals are early events in the disease pathogenic cascade, anticipating motor neuron degeneration and the onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, although Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and peripheral axonal neuropathies should be differentiated in clinical practice, they also share damage to common molecular pathways, including axonal transport, RNA metabolism and proteostasis. Thus, an extensive evaluation of the molecular events occurring in the peripheral nervous system could be fundamental to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, favouring the discovery of potential disease biomarkers and new therapeutic targets.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Systematic Differences Between Perceptually Relevant Image Statistics of Brain MRI and Natural Images</title>

	<description>It is well-known that the human visual system is adapted to the statistical structure of natural scenes. Yet there are important classes of images – for example, medical images -- that are not natural scenes, and therefore, that are expected to have statistical properties that deviate from the class of images that shaped the evolution and development of human vision. Here, focusing on structural brain MRI images, we quantify and characterize these deviations in terms of a set of local image statistics to which human visual sensitivity has been well-characterized, and that has previously been used for natural image analysis. We analyzed MRI images in multiple databases including T1-weighted and FLAIR sequence types, and simulated MRI images based on a published image simulation procedure for T1 images, which we also modified to generate FLAIR images. We first computed the power spectra of MRI images; spectral slopes were in the range -2.6 to -3.1 for T1 sequences, and -2.2 to -2.7 for FLAIR sequences. Analysis of local image statistics was then carried out on whitened images. For all of the databases as well as for the simulated images, we found that the three-point correlations contributed substantially to the differences between the “texture” of randomly-selected ROIs. The informative nature of three-point correlations for brain MRI was greater than for natural images, and also disproportionate to human visual sensitivity. As this finding was consistent across databases, it is likely to result from brain geometry at the scale of brain MRI resolution, rather than characteristics of specific imaging and reconstruction methods.</description>

	<description>Radiologists rely principally on visual inspection to detect, describe, and classify findings in medical images. As most interpretive errors in radiology are perceptual in nature, understanding the path to radiologic expertise during image analysis is essential to educate future generations of radiologists. We review the perceptual tasks and challenges in radiologic diagnosis, discuss models of radiologic image perception, consider the application of perceptual learning methods in medical training, and suggest a new approach to understanding perceptional expertise. Specific principled enhancements to educational practices in radiology promise to deepen perceptual expertise among radiologists with the goal of improving training and reducing medical error.</description>

	<description>Abstract
The orbitofrontal cortex is known for being involved in distinctive cognitive and behavioural operations. Damage to the orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortices often occurs following traumatic brain injury and can lead to disorders of personality, affect, motivation, impulsive behaviour, and social cognition. Here we focus on cognitive systems specifically for social behaviour following mild to moderate traumatic brain injury.  We performed a music-supported intervention on patients with impairment in social interaction and cognitive deficits following mild to moderate traumatic brain injury. The patients were in a stable phase of acquired brain injury two years post injury. Additional two control groups of healthy participants were included in the study. We assessed the participants with neuropsychological tests, fMRI pre-post intervention, and semi-structured interviews to obtain subjective behavioural data.  We present significant evidence for a qualitative increase of social interaction in the patient group and normalization of activation in orbitofrontal cortex after intervention. We propose a causal relationship between the training of piano playing and neuroplastic changes in orbitofrontal cortex followed by improved social functioning and enhanced cognitive performance.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Embodied Brain of SOVEREIGN2: From Space-Variant Conscious Percepts During Visual Search and Navigation to Learning Invariant Object Categories and Cognitive-Emotional Plans for Acquiring Valued Goals</title>

	<description>This article further develops a model of how reactive and planned behaviors interact in real time. Controllers for both animals and mobile robots, or animats, need reactive mechanisms for exploration, and learned plans to reach goal objects once an environment becomes familiar. Sequences of such behaviors need to be released at appropriate times during autonomous navigation to realize valued goals. The SOVEREIGN model of Gnadt and Grossberg (2008) embodied these capabilities, and was tested in a 3D virtual reality environment. Some SOVEREIGN processes were realized algorithmically. Other processes needed to achieve a more comprehensive adaptive intelligence in an embodied mobile system were not included at all. This article describes recent neural models of important missing capabilities with enough detail to define a research program that that can consistently incorporate them into an enhanced model called SOVEREIGN2. SOVEREIGN2 includes several interacting systems that model computationally complementary properties of the cortical What and Where processing streams, and homologous mechanisms for spatial navigation and arm movement control. Visual inputs are processed by networks that are sensitive to visual form and motion. View-, position-, and size-invariant recognition categories are learned in the What stream. Estimates of target and present position are computed in the Where stream, and can activate approach movements toward the target. Motion cues can elicit orienting movements to bring a new target into view. Approach and orienting movements are alternately performed. Cumulative estimates of each movement are derived from visual and vestibular cues. Sequences of experienced visual objects are stored in a cognitive working memory, whereas movement sequences are stored in a spatial/motor working memory. Stored sequences trigger learning of cognitive and spatial/motor list chunk categories, or plans, which together control planned movements towards valued goal objects. Predictively effective chunk combinations are selectively enhanced or suppressed via reinforcement and motivational learning by rewards and punishments, respectively. Expected vs. unexpected non-occurrences, or disconfirmations, of rewards or punishments also regulate these enhancement and suppressive processes. These several kinds of learning effect a gradual transition from variable reactive exploratory movements to efficient goal-oriented planned movement sequences.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Pin1 Is Regulated by CaMKII Activation in Glutamate-Induced Retinal Neuronal Regulated Necrosis</title>

	<description>In our previous study, we reported that peptidyl-prolyl isomerase 1 (Pin1)-modulated regulated necrosis (RN) occurred in cultured retinal neurons after glutamate injury. In the current study, we investigated the role of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in Pin1-modulated RN in cultured rat retinal neurons, and in an animal in vivo model. We first demonstrated that glutamate might lead to calcium overloading mainly through ionotropic glutamate receptors activation. Furthermore, CaMKII activation induced by overloaded calcium leads to Pin1 activation and subsequent RN. Inactivation of CaMKII by KN-93 (KN, i.e., a specific CaMKII inhibitor) application can decrease the glutamate-induced retinal neuronal RN. Finally, by using an animal in vivo model, we also demonstrated the important role of CaMKII in glutamate-induced RN in rat retina. In addition, flash electroretinogram results provided evidence that the impaired visual function induced by glutamate can recover after CaMKII inhibition. In conclusion, CaMKII is an up-regulator of Pin1 and responsible for the RN induced by glutamate. This study provides further understanding of the regulatory pathway of RN and is a complementary mechanism for Pin1 activation mediated necrosis. This finding will provide a potential target to protect neurons from necrosis in neurodegenerative diseases, such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and even central nervous system diseases.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Combined Cyclosporin A and Hypothermia Treatment Inhibits Activation of BV-2 Microglia but Induces an Inflammatory Response in an Ischemia/Reperfusion Hippocampal Slice Culture Model</title>

	<description>Hypothermia attenuates cerebral ischemia-induced neuronal cell death associated with neuroinflammation. The calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) has been shown to be neuroprotective by minimizing activation of inflammatory pathways. Therefore, we investigated whether the combination of hypothermia and treatment with CsA has neuroprotective effects in an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) injury model in neuronal and BV 2 microglia monocultures, as well as in an organotypic hippocampal slice culture (OHSC).

Murine primary neurons, BV 2 microglia, and OHSC were pretreated with CsA and exposed to 1 h OGD (0.2 % O2) followed by reperfusion at normothermia (37 °C) or hypothermia (33.5 °C). Cytotoxicity was measured by lactate dehydrogenase and glutamate releases. Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), and cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP) were detected in cultured supernatant by western blot analysis. Interleukin-6 (IL 6), Interleukin-1α and -1β (IL 1α/ IL1 β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF α), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), glia activation factors ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1), and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF β1) gene expressions were analyzed by RT-qPCR.

Exposure to OGD plus 10 µM CsA was sufficient to induce necrotic cell death and subsequent release of DAMPs in neurons but not BV 2 microglia. Moreover, OGD/R-induced secondary injury was also observed only in the neurons, which was not attenuated by cooling and no increased toxicity by CsA was observed. BV-2 microglia were not sensitive to OGD/R-induced injury but were susceptible to CsA-induced toxicity in a dose dependent manner, which was minimized by hypothermia. CsA attenuated IL 1β and Iba1 expressions in BV 2 microglia exposed to OGD/R. Hypothermia reduced IL 1β and iNOS expressions but induced TNF α and Iba1 expressions in the microglia. However, these observations did not translate to the ex vivo OHCS model, as general high expressions of most cytokines investigated were observed.

Treatment with CsA has neurotoxic effects on primary neurons exposed to OGD but could inhibit BV 2 microglia activation. However, CsA and hypothermia treatment after ischemia/reperfusion injury results in cytotoxic neuroinflammation in the complex ex vivo OHSC</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Middle Ear Administration of a Particulate Chitosan Gel in an in vivo Model of Cisplatin Ototoxicity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00268</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00268</link>
	<description>Background
Middle ear (intratympanic; IT) administration is a promising therapeutic method as it offers the possibility of achieving high inner ear drug concentrations while maintaining low levels in the systemic compartment, thus minimizing the risk of systemic side-effects and drug-drug interactions. The issue of premature elimination through the Eustachian tube may be reduced by stabilizing drug solutions with a hydrogel. However, this raises the secondary issue of conductive hearing loss.
Aim
This study aimed to investigate the properties of a chitosan-based particulate hydrogel formulation when used as a drug carrier for IT administration in an in vivo model of ototoxicity.
Material and methods
Two particulate chitosan-based IT delivery systems, Thio-25 and Thio-40, were investigated in albino guinea pigs (n=94). Both contained the hearing protecting drug candidate sodium thiosulfate but differed in terms of the concentration of chitosan gel particles (25% versus 40%). The safety of the two systems was explored in vivo. The most promising system was thereafter investigated in guinea pigs subjected to a single intravenous injection of the anticancer drug cisplatin (8 mg/kg b.w.), which has ototoxic side-effects. Hearing status was evaluated with acoustically-evoked frequency-specific auditory brainstem response (ABR) and hair cell counting. Finally, in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to study the distribution and elimination of the chitosan-based system from the middle ear cavity; this was analyzed and compared to a hyaluronan-based system.
Results
Both chitosan-based IT delivery systems caused ABR threshold elevations (p&amp;lt;0.05) that remained after 10 days (p&amp;lt;0.05) without evidence of hair cell loss, although the elevations induced by Thio-25 were significantly lower than Thio-40 (p&amp;lt;0.05). Thio-25 significantly reduced cisplatin-induced ABR threshold elevations (p&amp;lt;0.05) and the loss of outer hair cells (p&amp;lt;0.05). IT injection of the chitosan- and hyaluronan-based systems filled up most of the middle ear space. There were no significant differences in terms of the distribution and elimination of the two systems. 
Conclusion
Particulate chitosan is a promising drug carrier for IT administration. Future studies should attempt to demonstrate whether the physical properties of this technique allow for a reduced injection volume and thereby a less pronounced loss of conductive hearing.</description>

	<description>Most studies targeting age-association of memory functions report a decline in recognition hits and an increase in false alarms. The goal of the present study was to assess these findings in tasks with day-to-day relevance. We investigated healthy young (YA; age 26.90 ± 3.55 years) and old (OA; age 69.80 ± 5.85 years) adults. Participants were asked to watch six news and six commercials and complete a recognition task relating to the information presented in the videos. OA had a lower hit rate in both news and commercials compared to YA. However, the number of false alarms was the same in both age groups. Applying signal detection theory, we found age differences in discriminability for both news and commercials paradigm. The groups showed no differences in bias and both chose a liberal answering tendency. We interpret our finding as a result of complex recognition items in an ecologically valid task. Multi-feature items offer an advantage in correct rejection – it is enough to know that at least one feature of an item is false. This benefit does not extend to hits, where all features of an item need to be recognised. This indicates that recognition memory of naturalistic stimuli in OA is porous, but not distorted.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Altered Global Synchronizations in Patients With Parkinson’s Disease: A Resting-State fMRI Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00139</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00139</link>
	<description>Background: Abnormalities of cognitive and movement functions are widely reported in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The mechanisms therein are complicated and assumed to a coordination of various brain regions. This study explored the alterations of global synchronizations of brain activities and investigated the neural correlations of cognitive and movement function in PD patients. 

Methods: Age-match of 35 patients with PD and 35 normal controls (NC) were enrolled in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. Degree centrality (DC) were calculated to measure the global synchronizations of brain activity for two groups. Neural correlations between DC and cognitive function (Frontal Assessment Battery, FAB) as well as movement function (Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale, UPDRS-III) were examined across the whole brain within Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) templates. 

Results: In PD group, increased DC was observed in left fusiform gyrus extending to inferior temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus and angular gyrus, while it was decreased in right inferior opercular-frontal gyrus extending to superior temporal gyrus. The DC in significant region of fusiform gyrus was positively correlated with UPDRS-III scores in PD (r = 0.41, p = 0.0145). Higher FAB scores were shown in NC than PD (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Correlative analysis of PD between DC and FAB showed negative results (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in frontal cortex, whereas positive in insula and cerebellum. As for the correlations between DC and UPDRS-III, negative correlation (p &amp;lt; 0.05) was observed in bilateral inferior parietal lobule and right cerebellum, whereas positive correlation (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in bilateral hippocampus and para-hippocampus gyrus (p &amp;lt; 0.01). 

Conclusion: The altered global synchronizations revealed altered cognitive and movement functions in PD. The findings suggested that the global functional connectivity in fusiform gyrus, cerebellum and hippocampus gyrus are critical regions in the identification of cognitive and movement functions in PD. This study provides new insights on the interactions among global coordination of brain activity, cognitive and movement functions in PD.</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;FOXG1 syndrome is a severe encephalopathy that exhibit intellectual disability, emotional disorder, and limited social communication. To elucidate the contribution of somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs) to the cellular basis underlying FOXG1 syndrome, here, by crossing &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;SST-cre&lt;/span&gt; with a &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1fl/fl&lt;/span&gt; line, we selectively ablated &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt;. Loss of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt; resulted in an obvious reduction in the number of SST-INs, accompanied by an altered ratio of subtypes. &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt;-deficient SST-INs exhibited decreased membrane excitability and a changed ratio of electrophysiological firing patterns, which subsequently led to an excitatory/inhibitory imbalance. Moreover, cognitive defects, limited social interactions, and depression-like behaviors were detected in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt; cKO mice. Treatment with low-dose of clonazepam effectively alleviated the defects. These results identify a link of SST-IN development to the aberrant emotion, cognition, and social capacities in patients. Our findings identify a novel role of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt; in SST-IN development and put new insights into the cellular basis of FOXG1 syndrome.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A neural network model predicts community-level signaling states in a diverse microbial community</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Kalinga Pavan T. Silva, James Q. Boedicker&lt;/p&gt;

Signal crosstalk within biological communication networks is common, and such crosstalk can have unexpected consequences for decision making in heterogeneous communities of cells. Here we examined crosstalk within a bacterial community composed of five strains of &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, with each strain producing a variant of the quorum sensing peptide ComX. In isolation, each strain produced one variant of the ComX signal to induce expression of genes associated with bacterial competence. When strains were combined, a mixture of ComX variants was produced resulting in variable levels of gene expression. To examine gene regulation in mixed communities, we implemented a neural network model. Experimental quantification of asymmetric crosstalk between pairs of strains parametrized the model, enabling the accurate prediction of activity within the full five-strain network. Unlike the single strain system in which quorum sensing activated upon exceeding a threshold concentration of the signal, crosstalk within the five-strain community resulted in multiple community-level quorum sensing states, each with a unique combination of quorum sensing activation among the five strains. Quorum sensing activity of the strains within the community was influenced by the combination and ratio of strains as well as community dynamics. The community-level signaling state was altered through an external signal perturbation, and the output state depended on the timing of the perturbation. Given the ubiquity of signal crosstalk in diverse microbial communities, the application of such neural network models will increase accuracy of predicting activity within microbial consortia and enable new strategies for control and design of bacterial signaling networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0Yr3KJuonAw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Open, collaborative research is a powerful paradigm that can immensely strengthen the scientific process by integrating broad and diverse expertise. However, traditional research and multi-author writing processes break down at scale. We present new software named Manubot, available at https://manubot.org, to address the challenges of open scholarly writing. Manubot adopts the contribution workflow used by many large-scale open source software projects to enable collaborative authoring of scholarly manuscripts. With Manubot, manuscripts are written in Markdown and stored in a Git repository to precisely track changes over time. By hosting manuscript repositories publicly, such as on GitHub, multiple authors can simultaneously propose and review changes. A cloud service automatically evaluates proposed changes to catch errors. Publication with Manubot is continuous: When a manuscript’s source changes, the rendered outputs are rebuilt and republished to a web page. Manubot automates bibliographic tasks by implementing citation by identifier, where users cite persistent identifiers (e.g. DOIs, PubMed IDs, ISBNs, URLs), whose metadata is then retrieved and converted to a user-specified style. Manubot modernizes publishing to align with the ideals of open science by making it transparent, reproducible, immediate, versioned, collaborative, and free of charge.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Dn3MXW5I6qo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Humans and other animals are able to discover underlying statistical structure in their environments and exploit it to achieve efficient and effective performance. However, such structure is often difficult to learn and use because it is obscure, involving long-range temporal dependencies. Here, we analysed behavioural data from an extended experiment with rats, showing that the subjects learned the underlying statistical structure, albeit suffering at times from immediate inferential imperfections as to their current state within it. We accounted for their behaviour using a Hidden Markov Model, in which recent observations are integrated with evidence from the past. We found that over the course of training, subjects came to track their progress through the task more accurately, a change that our model largely attributed to improved integration of past evidence. This learning reflected the structure of the task, decreasing reliance on recent observations, which were potentially misleading.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mXjaocoQ3Z8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Contribution of FEF to Attentional Periodicity during Visual Search: A TMS Study</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Visual search, looking for a target embedded among distractors, has long been used to study attention. Current theories postulate a two-stage process in which early visual areas perform feature extraction, whereas higher-order regions perform attentional selection. Such a model implies iterative communication between low- and high-level regions to sequentially select candidate targets in the array, focus attention on these elements, and eventually permit target recognition. This leads to two independent predictions: (1) high-level, attentional regions and (2) early visual regions should both be involved periodically during the search. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over the frontal eye field (FEF) in humans, known to be involved in attentional selection, at various delays while observers performed a difficult, attentional search task. We observed a periodic pattern of interference at ~6 Hz (theta) suggesting that the FEF is periodically involved during this difficult search task. We further compared this result with two previous studies (Dugué et al., 2011, 2015a) in which a similar TMS procedure was applied over the early visual cortex (V1) while observers performed the same task. This analysis revealed the same pattern of interference, i.e., V1 is periodically involved during this difficult search task, at the theta frequency. Past V1 evidence reappraised for this paper, together with our current FEF results, confirm both of our independent predictions, and suggest that difficult search is supported by low- and high-level regions, each involved periodically at the theta frequency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Rodent Activity Detector (RAD) - an open source device for measuring activity in rodent home cages</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is a critical behavioral variable in many research studies, and is therefore important to quantify. However, existing methods for measuring physical activity have limitations which include high expense, specialized caging or equipment, and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present an open-source, cost-effective, device for measuring rodent activity. Our device is battery powered and designed to be placed in vivarium home cages to enable high-throughput, long-term operation with minimal investigator intervention. The primary aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of using passive infrared (PIR) sensors and microcontroller-based dataloggers in a rodent home cages to collect physical activity records. To this end, we developed an open-source PIR based data-logging device called the Rodent Activity Detector (RAD). We publish the design files and code so others can readily build the RAD in their own labs. To demonstrate its utility, we used the RAD to collect physical activity data from 40 individually housed mice for up to 10 weeks. This dataset demonstrates the ability of the RAD to 1) operate in a high-throughput installation, 2) detect high-fat diet induced changes in physical activity, and 3) quantify circadian rhythms in individual animals. We further validated the data output of the RAD with simultaneous video-tracking of mice in multiple caging configurations, to determine the features of physical activity that it detects. The RAD is easy to build, economical, and fits in vivarium caging. The scalability of such devices will enable high-throughput studies of physical activity in research studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Physical activity is an important determinant of human health, which reduces the risk of cardiovascular, metabolic and neurological disorders. Better methods for tracking physical activity in research studies may lead to insights that improve physical activity levels in people. To this end, we designed and built an inexpensive device to continuously track home cage activity levels in rodents. Our device, RAD, allows for high-throughput activity monitoring with minimal investigator intervention, presenting an economical and efficient option for investigating physical activity levels in research studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Differential changes in the lateralized activity of identified projection neurons of motor cortex in hemiparkinsonian rats</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In the parkinsonian state, the motor cortex and basal ganglia undergo dynamic remodeling of movement representation. One such change is the loss of the normal contralateral lateralized activity pattern. The increase in the number of movement-related neurons responding to ipsilateral or bilateral limb movements may cause motor problems, including impaired balance, reduced bimanual coordination, and abnormal mirror movements. However, it remains unknown how individual types of motor cortical neurons organize this reconstruction. To explore the effect of dopamine depletion on lateralized activity in the parkinsonian state, we used a partial hemiparkinsonian model (6-hydroxydopamine lesion) in Long-Evans rats performing unilateral movements in a right–left pedal task, while recording from primary (M1) and secondary motor cortex (M2). The lesion decreased contralateral preferred activity in both M1 and M2. In addition, this change differed among identified intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal tract (PT) cortical projection neurons, depending on the cortical area. We detected a decrease in lateralized activity only in PT neurons in M1, whereas in M2, this change was observed in IT neurons, with no change in the PT population. Our results suggest a differential effect of dopamine depletion in the lateralized activity of the motor cortex, and suggest possible compensatory changes in the contralateral hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The motor cortex normally exhibits preferred activation during contralateral, but not ipsilateral, movements. In the parkinsonian state, this contralateral preference may be affected, resulting in impaired bimanual coordination or abnormal mirror movements. However, it remains unknown how individual types of motor cortical neurons are reorganized in the parkinsonian state. Using multiunit recording in hemiparkinsonian rats during unilateral forelimb movements, we observed a reduction in contralateral preference in both primary and secondary motor cortices in the lesioned hemisphere. Moreover, using a light-induced spike collision test, we demonstrated that these decreases in lateralized activity were present in PT neurons exclusively in the primary motor cortex, but only in IT neurons in the secondary motor cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala executes the parallel processes of avoidance and palatability in the retrieval of conditioned taste aversion in male rats</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) is an essential behavior for animal survival. Conditioned animals show avoidance and decreased palatability to a conditioned stimulus (CS) on CTA retrieval. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) is involved in CTA retrieval and whether avoidance and palatability in CTA retrieval are processed in the BLA. We developed an experimental chamber for time-course analysis of the behavior to approach a spout and lick a CS. In this experimental chamber, we analyzed the behavior of male rats following microinjections of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor agonist muscimol or saline into the BLA. The rats showed two types of approach behavior: they either (1) approached and licked the spout or (2) approached but did not lick the spout. Muscimol injection into the BLA decreased the frequency of the latter type of approach behavior, indicating that BLA inactivation reduced avoidance to the CS. The muscimol injection into the BLA also significantly increased the consumption of the CS. Lick microstructure analysis demonstrated that intra-BLA muscimol significantly increased licking burst number and size, indicating that BLA inactivation attenuated aversion to the CS as large burst licking is an indicator of high palatability. These results suggest that the increase in CS consumption with intra-BLA muscimol injection was due to alterations in approach and aversive responses to the CS. Therefore, we conclude that the BLA plays an essential role in CTA retrieval by parallel processing of avoidance and palatability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significant statements&lt;/b&gt; To understand the role of the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) in the retrieval of conditioned taste aversion (CTA), we developed a new behavioral paradigm that overcomes the limitations of traditional behavioral procedures in CTA studies. In male rats, we measured time stamps of the approach behavior to a conditioned stimulus (CS) and licking of a spout. BLA inactivation not only increased CS consumption but also decreased avoidance and aversion to the CS. These results reveal that the BLA is essential for CTA retrieval by processing two distinct behavioral responses in parallel: avoidance and palatability. We further demonstrate that multi-dimensional analysis of animal behavior is an important factor for elucidating brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25518?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To provide evidence that early electroencephalography (EEG) allows for reliable prediction of poor or good outcome after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 5‐center prospective cohort study, we included consecutive, comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. Continuous EEG recordings were started as soon as possible and continued up to 5 days. Five‐minute EEG epochs were assessed by 2 reviewers, independently, at 8 predefined time points from 6 hours to 5 days after cardiac arrest, blinded for patients’ actual condition, treatment, and outcome. EEG patterns were categorized as generalized suppression (&amp;lt;10 μV), synchronous patterns with ≥50% suppression, continuous, or other. Outcome at 6 months was categorized as good (Cerebral Performance Category [CPC] = 1–2) or poor (CPC = 3–5).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 850 patients, of whom 46% had a good outcome. Generalized suppression and synchronous patterns with ≥50% suppression predicted poor outcome without false positives at ≥6 hours after cardiac arrest. Their summed sensitivity was 0.47 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.42–0.51) at 12 hours and 0.30 (95% CI = 0.26–0.33) at 24 hours after cardiac arrest, with specificity of 1.00 (95% CI = 0.99–1.00) at both time points. At 36 hours or later, sensitivity for poor outcome was ≤0.22. Continuous EEG patterns at 12 hours predicted good outcome, with sensitivity of 0.50 (95% CI = 0.46–0.55) and specificity of 0.91 (95% CI = 0.88–0.93); at 24 hours or later, specificity for the prediction of good outcome was &amp;lt;0.90.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EEG allows for reliable prediction of poor outcome after cardiac arrest, with maximum sensitivity in the first 24 hours. Continuous EEG patterns at 12 hours after cardiac arrest are associated with good recovery. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Since first described in the early 1900s, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has risen exponentially in prevalence and concern. Research still drives to understand the etiology and pathogenesis of this disease and what risk factors can attribute to AD. With a majority of AD cases being of sporadic origin, the increasing exponential growth of an aged population and a lack of treatment, it is imperative to discover an easy accessible preventative method for AD. Some risk factors can increase the propensity of AD such as aging, sex, and genetics. Moreover, there are also modifiable risk factors - in terms of treatable medical conditions and lifestyle choices - that play a role in developing AD. These risk factors have their own biological mechanisms that may contribute to AD etiology and pathological consequences. In this review, we will discuss modifiable risk factors and discuss the current literature of how each of these factors interplay into AD development and progression and if strategically analyzed and treated, could aid in protection against this neurodegenerative disease.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Brain Entropy is Associated with Divergent Thinking</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Creativity is the ability to generate original and useful products, and it is considered central to the progression of human civilization. As a noninherited emerging process, creativity may stem from temporally dynamic brain activity, which, however, has not been well studied. The purpose of this study was to measure brain dynamics using entropy and to examine the associations between brain entropy (BEN) and divergent thinking in a large healthy sample. The results showed that divergent thinking was consistently positively correlated with regional BEN in the left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/pre-supplementary motor area and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, suggesting that creativity is closely related to the functional dynamics of the control networks involved in cognitive flexibility and inhibitory control. Importantly, our main results were cross-validated in two independent cohorts from two different cultures. Additionally, three dimensions of divergent thinking (fluency, flexibility, and originality) were positively correlated with regional BEN in the left inferior frontal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus, suggesting that more highly creative individuals possess more flexible semantic associative networks. Taken together, our findings provide the first evidence of the associations of regional BEN with individual variations in divergent thinking and show that BEN is sensitive to detecting variations in important cognitive abilities in healthy subjects.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Target engagement in an alzheimer trial: Crenezumab lowers amyloid β oligomers in cerebrospinal fluid</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25513?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25513?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oligomeric forms of amyloid β protein (oAβ) are believed to be principally responsible for neurotoxicity in Alzheimer disease (AD), but it is not known whether anti‐Aβ antibodies are capable of lowering oAβ levels in humans.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed an ultrasensitive immunoassay and used it to measure oAβ in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 104 AD subjects participating in the ABBY and BLAZE phase 2 trials of the anti‐Aβ antibody crenezumab. Patients received subcutaneous (SC) crenezumab (300mg) or placebo every 2 weeks, or intravenous (IV) crenezumab (15mg/kg) or placebo every 4 weeks for 68 weeks. Ninety‐eight of the 104 patients had measurable baseline oAβ levels, and these were compared to levels at week 69 in placebo (n = 28), SC (n = 35), and IV (n = 35) treated patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those receiving crenezumab, 89% of SC and 86% of IV patients had lower levels of oAβ at week 69 versus baseline. The difference in the proportion of patients with decreasing levels was significant for both treatment arms: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0035 for SC and p = 0.01 for IV crenezumab versus placebo. The median percentage change was −48% in the SC arm and −43% in the IV arm. No systematic change was observed in the placebo group, with a median change of −13% and equivalent portions with negative and positive change.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crenezumab lowered CSF oAβ levels in the large majority of treated patients tested. These results support engagement of the principal pathobiological target in AD and identify CSF oAβ as a novel pharmacodynamic biomarker for use in trials of anti‐Aβ agents.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Nusinersen in type 1 Spinal Muscular Atrophy: 12‐month real world data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25533?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25533?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the study was to report 12‐month changes after treatment with Nusinersen in a cohort of 85 type I Spinal Muscular Atrophy patients of age ranging from 2 months to 15 years and 11 months.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All patients were assessed using the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP INTEND) and the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination‐Section 2 (HINE‐2).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the 85 had 1 &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; copy, 61 had 2 copies, 18 had 3 copies. In 4 patients the &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; copy number was not available. At baseline the mean CHOP INTEND scores ranged between 0 and 52 (mean: 15.66, SD: &lt;span&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;13.48), and the mean HINE‐2 score between 0 and 5 (mean: 0.69, SD:&lt;span&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;1.23).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a difference between baseline and the 12‐month scores on both the CHOP INTEND and the HINE‐2 for the whole group (p&amp;lt;0.001) as well as for the subgroups with 2 &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; copies (p&amp;lt;0.001), and for those with 3 &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; copies (p&amp;lt;0.001). The difference was found not only in patients younger than 210 days at baseline (p&amp;lt;0.001) but also in those younger than 5 years on the CHOP INTEND and younger than 2 years on the HINE‐2.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results, expanding the age range and the severity of type I patients treated with Nusinersen over one year, provide additional data on the range of efficacy of the drug that will be helpful to make an informed decision on whether to start treatment in patients of different age and severity.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Epstein‐Barr virus and multiple sclerosis risk in the Finnish Maternity Cohort</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25532?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether maternal Epstein‐Barr virus (EBV) IgG antibody levels are associated with risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the offspring.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a prospective nested case‐control study in the Finnish Maternity Cohort (FMC) with serum samples from over 800,000 women collected during pregnancy since 1983. Cases of MS among offspring born between 1983 and 1991 were identified via hospital and prescription registries; 176 cases were matched to up to 3 controls (n=326) on region and dates of birth, sample collection, and mother's birth. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate relative risks (RR) and adjusted models for sex of the child, gestational age at sample collection, and maternal serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D and cotinine levels. Similar analyses were conducted among 1,049 women with MS and 1,867 matched controls in the FMC.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maternal viral capsid antigen IgG levels during pregnancy were associated with an increased MS risk among offspring (RR&lt;sub&gt;top vs. bottom quintile&lt;/sub&gt;=2.44, 95%CI: 1.20‐5.00, p trend=0.004); no associations were found between maternal EBNA‐1, EA‐D, or cytomegalovirus IgG levels and offspring MS risk. Among women in the FMC, those in the highest versus lowest quintile of EBNA‐1 IgG levels had a 3‐fold higher risk of MS (RR=3.21, 95%CI: 2.37‐4.35, p trend &amp;lt;1.11e‐16). These associations were not confounded or modified by 25‐hydroxyvitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offspring of mothers with high VCA IgG during pregnancy appear to have an increased risk of MS. The increase in MS risk among women with elevated pre‐diagnostic EBNA‐1 IgG levels is consistent with previous results.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Abstract: Neural crest cells arise in the embryo from the neural plate border and migrate throughout the body, giving rise to many different tissue types such as bones and cartilage of the face, smooth muscles, neurons and melanocytes. While studied extensively in animal models, neural crest development and disease have been poorly described in human due to the challenges in accessing embryonic tissues. In recent years, patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have become easier to generate, and several streamlined protocols have enabled robust differentiation of hiPSCs to the neural crest lineage. Thus, a unique opportunity is offered for modelling neurocristopathies using patient specific stem cell lines. In this work, we make use of hiPSCs derived from patients affected by the Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) ciliopathy. BBS patients often exhibit subclinical craniofacial dysmorphisms that are likely to be associated with the neural crest-derived facial skeleton. We focus on hiPSCs carrying variants in the BBS10 gene, which encodes a protein forming part of a chaperonin-like complex associated with the cilium. Here, we establish a pipeline for profiling hiPSCs during differentiation toward the neural crest stem cell fate. This can be used to characterise the differentiation properties of the neural crest-like cells. Two different BBS10 mutant lines showed a reduction in expression of the characteristic neural crest gene expression profile. Further analysis of both BBS10 mutant lines highlighted the inability of these mutant lines to differentiate towards a neural crest fate, which was also characterised by a decreased WNT and BMP response. Altogether, our study suggests a requirement for wild-type BBS10 in human neural crest development. In the long term, approaches such as the one we describe will allow direct comparison of disease-specific cell lines. This will provide valuable insights into the relationships between genetic background and heterogeneity in cellular models. The possibility of integrating laboratory data with clinical phenotypes will move us towards precision medicine approaches.</description>

	<description>Alzheimer disease (AD) represents an oncoming epidemic that without an effective treatment promises to exact extraordinary human and financial burdens. Studies of pathogenesis are essential for defining targets for discovering disease-modifying treatments. Past studies of AD neuropathology provided valuable, albeit limited, insights. Nevertheless, building on these findings, recent studies have provided an increasingly rich harvest of genetic, molecular and cellular data that are creating unprecedented opportunities to both understand and treat AD. Among the most significant are those documenting the presence within the AD brain of toxic oligomeric species of Aβ and tau. Existing data support the view that such species can propagate and spread within neural circuits. To place these findings in context we first review the genetics and neuropathology of AD, including AD in Down syndrome. We detail studies that support the existence of toxic oligomeric species while noting the significant unanswered questions concerning their precise structures, the means by which they spread and undergo amplification and how they induce neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. We conclude by offering a speculative synthesis for how oligomers of Aβ and tau initiate and drive pathogenesis. While 100 years after Alzheimer’s first report there is much still to learn about pathogenesis and the discovery of disease-modifying treatments, the application of new concepts and sophisticated new tools are poised to deliver important advances for combatting AD.</description>

	<description>Despite the current diagnostic criteria, early diagnostics of behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) has remained challenging. Patients with bvFTD often present with misleading psychiatric phenotype, and, on the other hand, impairment in memory functions have increasingly been reported. However, impaired episodic memory is currently considered as an exclusion criterion for bvFTD. Single biofluid-based or imaging biomarkers do not currently provide sufficient sensitivity or specificity for early bvFTD diagnosis at single-subject level, although studies have suggested improved accuracy with different biomarker combinations. In this mini-review, we evaluate the core clinical features of early bvFTD and summarize the most potential imaging and fluid biomarkers for bvFTD diagnostics.</description>

	<description>Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) estimates time-dependent associations between pairs of brain region time series as typically acquired during functional MRI.  dFC changes are most commonly quantified by pairwise correlation coefficients between the time series within a sliding window.  Here, we applied a recently developed bootstrap-based technique (Kudela et al. 2017) to robustly estimate subject-level dFC and its confidence intervals in a task-based fMRI study (24 subjects who tasted their most frequently consumed beer and Gatorade as an appetitive control).  We then combined information across subjects and scans utilizing semiparametric mixed models to obtain a group-level dFC estimate for each pair of brain regions, flavor, and the difference between flavors.  The proposed approach relies on the estimated group-level dFC accounting for complex correlation structures of the fMRI data, multiple repeated observations per subject, experimental design, and subject-specific variability.  It also provides condition-specific dFC and confidence intervals for the whole brain at the group level. As a summary dFC metric, we used the proportion of time when the estimated associations were either significantly positive or negative.  For both flavors, our fully-data driven approach yielded regional associations that reflected known, biologically meaningful brain organization as shown in prior work, as well as closely resembled resting state networks (RSNs).  Specifically, beer flavor-potentiated associations were detected between several reward-related regions, including the right ventral striatum (VST), lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and ventral anterior insular cortex (vAIC).  The enhancement of right VST-vAIC association by a taste of beer independently validated the main activation-based finding (Oberlin et al. 2016).  Most notably, our novel dFC methodology uncovered numerous associations undetected by the traditional static FC analysis. The data-driven, novel dFC methodology presented here can be used for a wide range of task-based fMRI designs to estimate the dFC at multiple levels – group-, individual- and task-specific, utilizing a combination of well-established statistical methods.</description>

	<description>The complex development of the human nervous system has been traditionally studied using a combination of animal models, human post-mortem brain tissue, and human genetics studies.  However, there has been a lack of experimental human cellular models that would allow for a more precise elucidation of the intricate dynamics of early human brain development. The development of stem cell technologies, both embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells, has given neuroscientists access to the previously inaccessible early stages of human brain development.  In particular, the recent development of three-dimensional culturing methodologies provides a platform to study the differentiation of stem cells in both normal development and disease states in a more in-vivo like context.  Three-dimensional neural models or cerebral organoids possess an innate advantage over two-dimensional neural cultures as they can recapitulate tissue organization and cell type diversity that resemble the developing brain.  Brain organoids also provide the exciting opportunity to model the integration of different brain regions in vitro.  Furthermore, recent advances in the differentiation of non-neuronal tissue from stem cells provides the opportunity to study the interaction between the developing nervous system and other non-neuronal systems that impact neuronal function.  In this review, we discuss the potential and limitations of the organoid system to study in vitro neurological diseases that arise in the neuroendocrine and the enteric nervous system or from interactions with the immune system.</description>

	<description>Awe is an emotional response to perceptually vast stimuli that transcend current frames of reference. Narrative and experimental work has characterized two distinct variants of awe: positive and negative; however, little is known about the structural neural basis associated with the differences of these two variants of awe. In this study, we investigated the structural neural basis of positive and negative awe underlying individual differences among 62 young healthy adults. Specifically, we assessed the association between regional gray matter volume (rGMV) and the two different variants of awe using the voxel-based morphometry (VBM). A partial correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between rGMV and behavioral positive and negative awe, while controlling for sex, age and total GMV. VBM indicated that positive awe was positively correlated with GMV in the precuneus, and negatively correlated with GMV in the left fusiform and the right calcarine. Negative awe was negatively correlated with GMV in the left and right insula, and the left superior temporal gyrus. These results provide a neural explanation for the differences of these two variants of awe.</description>

	<description>Based on stimulation with plaid patterns, neurons in the Middle Temporal (MT) area of primate visual cortex are divided into two types: pattern and component cells. The prevailing theory suggests that pattern selectivity results from the summation of the outputs of component cells as part of a hierarchical visual pathway. We present a computational model of the visual pathway from primary visual cortex (V1) to MT that suggests an alternate model where the progression from component to pattern selectivity is not required. Using standard orientation-selective V1 cells, end-stopped V1 cells, and V1 cells with extra-classical receptive fields (RFs) as inputs to MT, the model shows that the degree of pattern or component preference in MT could arise from the relative strengths of the three V1 input types. Dominance of end-stopped V1 neurons in the model leads to pattern selectivity in MT, while dominance of V1 cells with extra-classical RFs result in component selectivity. This model may assist in designing experiments to further understand motion processing mechanisms in primate MT.</description>

	<description>Gamma frequency oscillations (γ, 30–100 Hz) have been suggested to underlie various cognitive and motor functions. Methamphetamine (MA), a commonly used recreational drug, enhances brain γ oscillations associated with changes in psychomotor state. Little is known about the cellular mechanism of MA modulation on γ oscillations. We explored the effects of multiple intracellular kinases on MA modulation of γ oscillations in rat hippocampal CA3 area induced by kainate. We found that dopamine receptor 2 (DR2) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists prevented the enhancing effect of MA on γ oscillation, whereas none of them affected baseline γ oscillation strength. Dopamine receptor 1 (DR1) antagonist and the serine/threonine kinase PKB/Akt inhibitor alone increased γ oscillations but prevented MA enhancement of γ. Protein kinase A, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK) inhibitors had no effect on MA. We propose that the DR1/DR2-Akt-NMDAR pathway play a critical role for the MA enhancement of γ oscillations. Our study provides an insight into the mechanism of acute MA on brain function and a clue for the intervention of MA addiction.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Electroacupuncture Pretreatment Ameliorates PTSD-Like Behaviors in Rats by Enhancing Hippocampal Neurogenesis via the Keap1/Nrf2 Antioxidant Signaling Pathway</title>

	<description>Electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment is a clinically useful therapy for several brain disorders. However, whether and via which exact molecular mechanisms it ameliorates posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains unclear. In the present study, rats received EA stimulation for 7 consecutive days before exposure to enhanced single prolonged stress (ESPS). Anxiety-like and fear learning behaviors; hippocampal neurogenesis; the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (keap1), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1); and the activity of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) were evaluated at 14 days after ESPS. EA pretreatment improved hippocampal neurogenesis and ameliorated anxiety-like behaviors in ESPS-treated rats. EA pretreatment also increased the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 and the activity of AMPK. Furthermore, Nrf2 knockdown by a short hairpin RNA affected anxiety-like behaviors and expression of neuroprotective markers (BDNF, DCX) in a manner similar to ESPS alone and dampened the neuroprotective effects of EA pretreatment. In contrast, Keap1 knockdown increased the expression of HO-1, improved hippocampal neurogenesis, and alleviated PTSD-like behaviors. Altogether, our results suggest that EA pretreatment ameliorates ESPS-induced anxiety-like behaviors and prevents hippocampal neurogenesis disruption in a rat model of PTSD possibly through regulation of the keap1/Nrf2 antioxidant defense pathway.</description>

	<description>Mapping the neural circuit facilitates understanding the brain’s working mechanism. Pseudorabies virus (Bartha stain) as a tracer can infect neurons and retrogradely transport in neural circuits. To illuminate the network, tracers express reporter genes at high level are needed. In this study, we optimized the expression level of reporter gene, and constructed two new retrograde trans-multisynaptic tracers PRV531 and PRV724，which separately expresses more robust green and red fluorescent proteins than the existing retrograde tracers PRV152 and PRV614. The PRV531 and PRV724 can be used for mapping the neural circuit of central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. Overall, our work adds two valuable tracers into the toolbox for mapping neural circuit.</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Temporal dynamics of inhalation-linked activity across defined subpopulations of mouse olfactory bulb neurons imaged in vivo</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;In mammalian olfaction, inhalation drives the temporal patterning of neural activity that underlies early olfactory processing. It remains poorly understood how the neural circuits that process incoming olfactory information are engaged in the context of inhalation-linked dynamics. Here, we used artificial inhalation and two-photon calcium imaging to compare the dynamics of activity evoked by odorant inhalation across major cell types of the mouse olfactory bulb (OB). We expressed GCaMP6f or jRGECO1a in mitral and tufted cell subpopulations, olfactory sensory neurons, and two major juxtaglomerular interneuron classes, and imaged responses to a single inhalation of odorant. Activity in all cell types was strongly linked to inhalation, and all cell types showed some variance in the latency, rise-times, and durations of their inhalation-linked response. Juxtaglomerular interneuron dynamics closely matched that of sensory inputs, while mitral and tufted cells showed the highest diversity in responses, with a range of latencies and durations that could not be accounted for by heterogeneity in sensory input dynamics. Diversity was apparent even among 'sister' tufted cells innervating the same glomerulus. Surprisingly, inhalation-linked responses of mitral and tufted cells were highly overlapping and could not be distinguished on the basis of their inhalation-linked dynamics, with the exception of a subpopulation of superficial tufted cells expressing cholecystokinin. Our results are consistent with a model in which diversity in inhalation-linked patterning of OB output arises first at the level of sensory input and is enhanced by feedforward inhibition from juxtaglomerular interneurons which differentially impact different subpopulations of OB output neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Inhalation drives the temporal patterning of neural activity that underlies olfactory processing and rapid odor perception, yet the dynamics of the neural circuit elements mediating this processing are poorly understood. By comparing inhalation-linked dynamics of major olfactory bulb subpopulations, we find that diversity in the timing of neural activation arises at the level of sensory input, which is then mirrored by inhibitory interneurons in the glomerular layer. Temporal diversity is higher among olfactory bulb output neurons, with different subpopulations showing distinct but nonetheless highly overlapping ranges of inhalation-linked dynamics. These results implicate feedforward inhibition by glomerular-layer interneurons in diversifying temporal responses among output neurons, which may be important for generating and shaping timing-based odor representations during natural odor sampling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The future of medicine lies in disease modification and prevention. The science of preclinical detection is young, but moving rapidly. Preclinical interventions offer the hope to decrease the severity of a disease or delay the development of a disorder substantially. With such promise, the research and practice of detecting brain disorders at a preclinical stage present unique ethical challenges, challenges that must be addressed to ensure the benefit of these technologies. Direct brain interventions have potential to impact not just what a patient has but who they are and who they could become. Further receiving an assessment for a preclinical or prodromal state has potential to impact perceptions about capacity, autonomy and personhood and could become entangled with stigma and discrimination. Discussion of the risks and benefits of the emerging technology will focus on how to ensure beneficence by presenting the limitations of preclinical detection and by contextualizing the risk associated with preclinical status. Exploring ethical issues alongside and integrated into the experimental design and research of these technologies is critical. This review will highlight ethical issues attendant to the current and near future states of preclinical detection across the life span, specifically as it relates to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Preclinical interventions in developing brain disorders offer the strongest promise of delaying, modifying, or preventing the development of clinical disorders. Although promising, intervening at early stages in disorders inherently linked to identity and personhood presents unique ethical challenges. These challenges must be addressed before the practices are implemented. Both the treatment and the diagnosis itself have the potential to profoundly impact patients. We contextualize the risk of diagnosing preclinical states and present the limitations of preclinical interventions to guide research and policy as the field of preclinical detection rapidly expands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Subthreshold fear conditioning produces a rapidly developing neural mechanism that primes subsequent learning</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Learning results in various forms of neuronal plasticity that provide a lasting representation of past events, and understanding the mechanisms supporting lasting memories has been a primary pursuit of the neurobiological study of memory. However, learning also alters the capacity for future learning, an observation that likely reflects its adaptive significance. In the laboratory we can study this essential property of memory by assessing how prior experience alters the capacity for subsequent learning. Previous studies have indicated that while a single weak fear conditioning trial is insufficient to support long-term memory, it can facilitate future learning such that another trial delivered within a protracted time window results in a robust memory. Here, we sought to determine whether or not manipulating neural activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) during or after the initial learning trial would affect the ability of the initial trial to facilitate subsequent learning. Our results show that inhibiting the BLA in rats prior to the first trial prevented the ability of that trial to facilitate learning when a second trial was presented the next day. Inhibition of the BLA immediately after the first trial using DREADDs was not effective, nor was pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase A or the mitogen activated protein kinase. These findings indicate that the neural mechanisms that permit an initial subthreshold fear conditioning trial to alter later learning develop rapidly and do not appear to require a typical post-learning consolidation period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Laboratory studies of memory are typically designed to identify mechanisms that allow the brain to represent past experience. The purpose of this ability is likely so that prior learning can direct future behavior, however studies are most often focused on the storage aspects of memory and less on how later experience is altered. We used a fear conditioning paradigm in which a single trial, subthreshold for producing long-term behavioral change, primes future learning when a second trial is later encountered. Neural activity in the amygdala was required for long-term memory priming, however post-training disruption of neural activity or cell signaling events had no effect. These results provide insight into the mechanisms that allow prior aversive experience to modify new learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Spinal Interleukin-1β Inhibits Astrocyte Cytochrome P450c17 Expression Which Controls the Development of Mechanical Allodynia in a Mouse Model of Neuropathic Pain</title>

	<description>We have recently demonstrated that sciatic nerve injury increases the expression of spinal cytochrome P450c17, a key neurosteroidogenic enzyme, which plays a critical role in the development of peripheral neuropathic pain. However, the modulatory mechanisms responsible for the expression of spinal P450c17 have yet to be examined. Here we investigated the possible involvement of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in altering P450c17 expression during the induction phase of neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain was produced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the right sciatic nerve in mice and mechanical allodynia was evaluated in the hind paws using a von-Frey filament (0.16 g). Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to assess the expression of spinal IL-1β, interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1), P450c17, and GFAP. Spinal IL-1β was significantly increased on day 1 post-surgery and its receptor, IL-1R1 was expressed in GFAP-positive astrocytes. Intrathecal administration of the recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra, 20 ng) on days 0 and 1 post-surgery enhanced GFAP expression on day 1 post-surgery and induced an early increase in P450c17 expression in astrocytes, but not in neurons. Administration of IL-1β (10 ng) on days 0 and 1 post-surgery blocked the enhancement of both spinal P450c17 and GFAP expression induced by IL-1ra (20 ng) administration. Intrathecal administration of IL-1ra (20 ng) on days 0 to 3 post-surgery also facilitated the CCI-induced development of mechanical allodynia, and this early developed pain was dose-dependently attenuated by the administration of the P450c17 inhibitor, ketoconazole (1, 3 or 10 nmol) or the astrocyte metabolic inhibitor, fluorocitrate (0.01, 0.03 or 0.1 nmol). These results demonstrate that early increases in spinal IL-1β temporally inhibit astrocyte P450c17 expression and astrocyte activation ultimately controlling the development of mechanical allodynia induced by peripheral nerve injury. These findings imply that spinal IL-1β plays an important role as an early, but transient, control mechanism in the development of peripheral neuropathic pain via the inhibition of astrocyte P450c17 expression and astrocyte activation.</description>

	<description>In the last few decades, brain functional connectivity (FC) has been extensively assessed using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI), which is able to identify temporally correlated brain regions known as RS functional networks. Fundamental insights into the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative conditions have been provided by studies in this field. However, most of these studies are based on the assumption of temporal stationarity of RS functional networks, despite recent evidence suggests that the spatial patterns of RS networks may change periodically over the time of an fMRI scan acquisition. For this reason, dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis has been recently implemented and proposed in order to consider the temporal fluctuations of FC. These approaches hold promise to provide fundamental information for the identification of pathophysiological and diagnostic markers in the vast field of neurodegenerative diseases. This review summarizes the main currently available approaches for dFC analysis and reports their recent applications for the assessment of the most common neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia. Critical state-of-the-art findings, limitations, and future perspectives regarding the analysis of dFC in these diseases are provided from both a clinical and a technical point of view.</description>

	<description>Increasing evidence links proteins of the S100 family to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). S100 proteins are EF-hand calcium-binding proteins with intra- and extracellular functions related to regulation of proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and trace metal homeostasis, and are important modulators of inflammatory responses. For example, S100A6, S100A8 and S100B expression levels were found increased in inflammatory diseases, but also neurodegenerative disorders, and S100A8/A9 complexes may provide a mechanistic link between amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque formation and neuroinflammation. On the other hand, S100B, a proinflammatory protein that is chronically up-regulated in AD and whose elevation precedes plaque formation, was recently shown to suppress Aβ aggregation. Here, we report expression of S100A6 and S100B in astrocytes and less so in neurons, and low level of expression of S100A8 in both neurons and glial cells in vitro. In vivo, S100A8 expression is almost absent in the brain of aged wildtype mice, while S100A6 and S100B are expressed in all brain regions and most prominently in the cortex and cerebellum. S100B seems to be enriched in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. In contrast, in the brain of APP23 mice, a mouse model for Alzheimer’s disease, S100B, S100A6 and S100A8 show co-localization with Aβ plaques, compatible with astrocyte activation, and the expression level of S100A8 is increased in neural cells. While S100A6 and S100B are enriched in the periphery of plaques where less fibrillar Aβ is found, S100A8 is more intense within the center of the inclusion. In vitro assays show that, similarly to S100B, S100A6 and S100A8 also delay Aβ aggregation suggesting a regulatory action over protein aggregation. We posit that elevated expression levels and overlapping spatial distribution of brain S100 proteins and plaques translates functional relationships between these inflammatory mediators and AD pathophysiology processes that uncover important molecular mechanisms linking the aggregation and neuroinflammation cascades.</description>

	<description>Cultural attachment (CA) refers to processes that allow culture and its symbols to provide psychological security when facing threat. Epistemologically, although we currently have an adequate predictivist model of CA, it is necessary to prepare for a mechanistic approach that will not only predict, but also explain CA phenomena. Towards that direction, we first examine the concepts and mechanisms that are the building blocks of both prototypical maternal attachment and CA. Based on existing robust neuroscience models we associate these concepts and mechanisms with bona fide neurobiological functions to advance an integrative neurobiological model of CA. We end by discussing the unresolved relationship of CA to other similar socio-cognitive concepts. The aim of the paper is to highlight the importance of integrating CA theory into computational approaches to culture and evolution (such as predictive processing computations explaining niche construction) as this will allow a dynamic interpretation of cultural processes.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: From Synchrony to Asynchrony: Cerebellar–Basal Ganglia Functional Circuits in Young and Older Adults</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has indicated disruptions in functional connectivity in older adults (OA) relative to young adults (YA). While age differences in cortical networks are well studied, differences in subcortical networks are poorly understood. Both the cerebellum and the basal ganglia are of particular interest given their role in cognitive and motor functions, and work in nonhuman primates has demonstrated direct reciprocal connections between these regions. Here, our goal was twofold. First, we were interested in delineating connectivity patterns between distinct regions of the cerebellum and basal ganglia, known to have topologically distinct connectivity patterns with cortex. Our second goal was to quantify age differences in these cerebellar–striatal circuits. We performed a targeted rs-fMRI analysis of the cerebellum and basal ganglia in 33 YA and 31 OA individuals. In the YA, we found significant connectivity both within and between the cerebellum and basal ganglia, in patterns supporting semi-discrete circuits that may differentially subserve motor and cognitive performance. We found a shift in connectivity, from one of synchrony in YA, to asynchrony in OA, resulting in substantial age differences. Connectivity was also associated with behavior. These findings significantly advance our understanding of cerebellar–basal ganglia interactions in the human brain.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Auditory attention operates through top-down (TD) and bottom-up (BU) mechanisms that are supported by dorsal and ventral brain networks, respectively, with the main overlap in the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC). A good TD/BU balance is essential to be both task-efficient and aware of our environment, yet it is rarely investigated. Oscillatory activity is a novel method to probe the attentional dynamics with evidence that gamma activity (&amp;gt;30 Hz) could signal BU processing and thus would be a good candidate to support the activation of the ventral BU attention network. Magnetoencephalography data were collected from 21 young adults performing the competitive attention task, which enables simultaneous investigation of BU and TD attentional mechanisms. Distracting sounds elicited an increase in gamma activity in regions of the BU ventral network. TD attention modulated these gamma responses in regions of the inhibitory cognitive control system: the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. Finally, distracting-sound-induced gamma activity was synchronous between the auditory cortices and several distant brain regions, notably the lPFC. We provide novel insight into the role of gamma activity 1) in supporting the activation of the ventral BU attention network and 2) in subtending the TD/BU attention balance in the PFC.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

fear-learning models posit that amygdala–infralimbic connections facilitate extinction while amygdala–prelimbic prefrontal connections mediate fear expression. Analogous amygdala–prefrontal circuitry between rodents and primates is not established. Using paired small volumes of neural tracers injected into the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC; areas 24b and 32; a potential homologue to rodent prelimbic cortex) and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC, areas 25 and 14c; a potential homologue to rodent infralimbic cortex) in a single hemisphere, we mapped amygdala projections to the pgACC and sgACC within single subjects. All injections resulted in dense retrograde labeling specifically within the intermediate division of the basal nucleus (Bi) and the magnocellular division of the accessory basal nucleus (ABmc). Areal analysis revealed a bias for connectivity with the sgACC, with the ABmc showing a greater bias than the Bi. Double fluorescence analysis revealed that sgACC and pgACC projections were intermingled within the Bi and ABmc, where a proportion were double labeled. We conclude that amygdala inputs to the ACC largely originate from the Bi and ABmc, preferentially connect to the sgACC, and that a subset collaterally project to both sgACC and pgACC. These findings advance our understanding of fear extinction and fear expression circuitry across species. &lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Haploinsufficiency in the gene SCN2A, which encodes the sodium channel NaV1.2, has strong autism association. Spratt et al. show that Scn2a contributes to dendritic excitability in mature neocortical pyramidal cells, where its loss impairs excitatory synaptic function and plasticity.</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Mispositioned Neurokinin-1 Receptor-Expressing Neurons Underlie Heat Hyperalgesia in Disabled-1 Mutant Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/3/ENEURO.0131-19.2019?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reelin (Reln) and Disabled-1 (Dab1) participate in the Reln-signaling pathway and when either is deleted, mutant mice have the same spinally mediated behavioral abnormalities, increased sensitivity to noxious heat and a profound loss in mechanical sensitivity. Both Reln and Dab1 are highly expressed in dorsal horn areas that receive and convey nociceptive information, Laminae I–II, lateral Lamina V, and the lateral spinal nucleus (LSN). Lamina I contains both projection neurons and interneurons that express Neurokinin-1 receptors (NK1Rs) and they transmit information about noxious heat both within the dorsal horn and to the brain. Here, we ask whether the increased heat nociception in &lt;i&gt;Reln&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;dab1&lt;/i&gt; mutants is due to incorrectly positioned dorsal horn neurons that express NK1Rs. We found more NK1R-expressing neurons in &lt;i&gt;Reln&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;dab1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Laminae I–II than in their respective wild-type mice, and some NK1R neurons co-expressed Dab1 and the transcription factor Lmx1b, confirming their excitatory phenotype. Importantly, heat stimulation in &lt;i&gt;dab1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/i&gt;mice induced Fos in incorrectly positioned NK1R neurons in Laminae I–II. Next, we asked whether these ectopically placed and noxious-heat responsive NK1R neurons participated in pain behavior. Ablation of the superficial NK1Rs with an intrathecal injection of a substance P analog conjugated to the toxin saporin (SSP-SAP) eliminated the thermal hypersensitivity of &lt;i&gt;dab1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, without altering their mechanical insensitivity. These results suggest that ectopically positioned NK1R-expressing neurons underlie the heat hyperalgesia of Reelin-signaling pathway mutants, but do not contribute to their profound mechanical insensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Intrinsic Insular-Frontal Networks Predict Future Nicotine Dependence Severity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/5028?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although 60% of the US population have tried smoking cigarettes, only 16% smoke regularly. Identifying this susceptible subset of the population before the onset of nicotine dependence may encourage targeted early interventions to prevent regular smoking and/or minimize severity. While prospective neuroimaging in human populations can be challenging, preclinical neuroimaging models before chronic nicotine administration can help to develop translational biomarkers of disease risk. Chronic, intermittent nicotine (0, 1.2, or 4.8 mg/kg/d; &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 10–11/group) was administered to male Sprague Dawley rats for 14 d; dependence severity was quantified using precipitated withdrawal behaviors collected before, during, and following forced nicotine abstinence. Resting-state fMRI functional connectivity (FC) before drug administration was subjected to a graph theory analytical framework to form a predictive model of subsequent individual differences in nicotine dependence. Whole-brain modularity analysis identified five modules in the rat brain. A metric of intermodule connectivity, participation coefficient, of an identified insular–frontal cortical module predicted subsequent dependence severity, independent of nicotine dose. To better spatially isolate this effect, this module was subjected to a secondary exploratory modularity analysis, which segregated it into three submodules (frontal-motor, insular, and sensory). Higher FC among these three submodules and three of the five originally identified modules (striatal, frontal-executive, and sensory association) also predicted dependence severity. These data suggest that predispositional, intrinsic differences in circuit strength between insular-frontal-based brain networks before drug exposure may identify those at highest risk for the development of nicotine dependence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Developing biomarkers of individuals at high risk for addiction before the onset of this brain-based disease is essential for prevention, early intervention, and/or subsequent treatment decisions. Using a rodent model of nicotine dependence and a novel data-driven, network-based analysis of resting-state fMRI data collected before drug exposure, functional connections centered on an intrinsic insular-frontal module predicted the severity of nicotine dependence after drug exposure. The predictive capacity of baseline network measures was specific to inter-regional but not within-region connectivity. While insular and frontal regions have consistently been implicated in nicotine dependence, this is the first study to reveal that innate, individual differences in their circuit strength have the predictive capacity to identify those at greatest risk for and resilience to drug dependence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: White Matter Microstructure Reflects Individual Differences in Music Reward Sensitivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/5018?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;People show considerable variability in the degree of pleasure they experience from music. These individual differences in music reward sensitivity are driven by variability in functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), a key structure of the reward system, and the right superior temporal gyrus (STG). However, it is unknown whether a neuroanatomical basis exists for this variability. We used diffusion tensor imaging and probabilistic tractography to study the relationship between music reward sensitivity and white matter microstructure connecting these two regions via the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in 38 healthy human participants (24 females and 14 males). We found that right axial diffusivity (AD) in the STG–OFC connectivity inversely correlated with music reward sensitivity. Additionally, right mean diffusivity and left AD in the NAcc-OFC tract also showed an inverse correlation. Further, AD in this tract also correlated with previously acquired BOLD activity during music listening, but not for a control monetary reward task in the NAcc. Finally, we used mediation analysis to show that AD in the NAcc–OFC tract explains the influence of NAcc activation during a music task on music reward sensitivity. Overall, our results provide further support for the idea that the exchange of information among perceptual, integrative, and reward systems is important for musical pleasure, and that individual differences in the structure of the relevant anatomical connectivity influences the degree to which people are able to derive such pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Music is one of the most important sources of pleasure for many people, but at the same time there are important individual differences in the sensitivity to musical reward. Previous studies have revealed the critical involvement of the functional connectivity between perceptual and subcortical brain areas in the enjoyment of music. However, it is unknown whether individual differences in music sensitivity might arise from variability in the structural connectivity among these areas. Here we show that structural connectivity between supratemporal and orbitofrontal cortices, and between orbitofrontal and nucleus accumbens, predict individual differences in sensibility to music reward. These results provide evidence for the critical involvement of the interaction between the subcortical reward system and higher-order cortical areas in music-induced pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Reward Prediction Error Modulates Saccade Vigor</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/5010?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/5010?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Movement vigor, defined as the reciprocal of the latency from availability of reward to its acquisition, changes with reward magnitude: movements exhibit shorter reaction time and increased velocity when they are directed toward more rewarding stimuli. This invigoration may be due to release of dopamine before movement onset, which has been shown to be modulated by events that signal reward prediction error (RPE). Here, we generated an RPE event in the milliseconds before movement onset and tested whether there was a relationship between RPE and vigor. Human subjects (both sexes) made saccades toward an image. During execution of the primary saccade, we probabilistically changed the position and content of that image, encouraging a secondary saccade. On some trials, the content of the secondary image was more valuable than the first image, resulting in a positive RPE (+RPE) event that preceded the secondary saccade. On other trials, this content was less valuable (–RPE event). We found that reaction time of the secondary saccade was affected in an orderly fashion by the magnitude and direction of the preceding RPE event: the most vigorous saccades followed the largest +RPE, whereas the least vigorous saccades followed the largest –RPE. Presence of the secondary saccade indicated that the primary saccade had experienced a movement error, inducing trial-to-trial adaptation. However, this learning from movement error was not modulated by the RPE event. The data suggest that RPE events, which are thought to transiently alter the release of dopamine, modulate the vigor of the ensuing movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Does dopamine release in response to a stimulus serve to invigorate the ensuing movement? To test this hypothesis, we relied on the fact that reward prediction error (RPE) is a strong modulator of dopamine. Our innovation was a task in which an RPE event occurred precisely before onset of a stimulus-driven movement. We probabilistically produced a combination of large or small, negative or positive RPE events and observed that saccade vigor carried a robust signature of the preceding RPE event: high vigor saccades followed +RPE events, whereas low vigor saccades followed –RPE events. This suggests that in humans, vigor is partly controlled through release of dopamine in the moments before onset of a movement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Vasopressin cells in the rodent olfactory bulb resemble non-bursting superficial tufted cells and are primarily inhibited upon olfactory nerve stimulation</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The intrinsic vasopressin system of the olfactory bulb is involved in social odor processing and consists of glutamatergic vasopressin cells (VPCs) located at the medial border of the glomerular layer. To characterize VPCs in detail, we combined various electrophysiological, neuroanatomical and two-photon Ca2+ imaging techniques in acute bulb slices from juvenile transgenic rats with eGFP-labelled VPCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VPCs showed regular non-bursting firing patterns, and displayed slower membrane time constants and higher input resistances versus other glutamatergic tufted cell types. VPC axons spread deeply into the external plexiform and superficial granule cell layer. Axonal projections fell into two subclasses, with either denser local columnar collaterals or longer-ranging single projections running laterally within the internal plexiform layer and deeper within the granule cell layer. VPCs always featured lateral dendrites and a tortuous apical dendrite that innervated a single glomerulus with a homogenously branching tuft. These tufts lacked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in response to single somatically-evoked action potentials and showed a moderate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase upon prolonged action potential trains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, electrical olfactory nerve stimulation did not result in synaptic excitation of VPCs, but triggered substantial GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated IPSPs that masked excitatory barrages with yet longer latency. Exogenous vasopressin application reduced those IPSPs, as well as olfactory-nerve evoked EPSPs recorded from external tufted cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, VPCs can be classified as non-bursting, vertical superficial tufted cells. Moreover, our findings imply that sensory input alone cannot trigger excitation of VPCs, arguing for specific additional pathways for excitation or disinhibition in social contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Efficient sensing of conspecific odor signatures is essential for most rodent social behavior. Although olfactory bulb vasopressin was shown to be a potent facilitator of social odor processing, little is known on the cellular substrate of the intrinsic vasopressin system. Here we provide a detailed characterization of the anatomical and electrophysiological properties of the bulbar vasopressin cells. While we also identify several targets of vasopressin action, we find that stimulation of the sensory inputs to the bulb results primarily in vasopressin cell inhibition, implying that excitation of the bulbar vasopressin system requires additional still unknown excitatory or dis-inhibitory inputs which might confer social specificity. These insights may complement the knowledge on vasopressinergic modulation of social stimuli in limbic brain structures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding molecules that regulate a large number of genes for post-transcriptional repression by recognizing semi-complementary target sequences that are usually located in the 3′ UTR sequence of the mRNA. Altered miRNA expression has been associated with several pathological processes, including polyglutamine (Poly Q) diseases. Specific expression patterns in the brain parenchyma and circulating fluids have been highlighted as potential biomarkers for Poly Q disease diagnosis and prognosis. Several miRNAs have been consistently identified in various diseases, including Huntington’s disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). In this review, we describe the emerging role of miRNAs in Poly Q diseases and provide an overview on general miRNA biology, implications in pathophysiology, and their potential roles as future biomarkers and applications for therapy.</description>

	<description>Cerebral ischemia is a complex pathology involving a cascade of cellular mechanisms, which deregulate proteostasis and lead to neuronal death. Proteostasis refers to the equilibrium between protein synthesis, folding and transport; and protein degradation. Within the brain proteostasis plays key roles in learning and memory by controlling protein synthesis and degradation. Two important pathways are implicated in proteostasis’ regulation: the unfolded protein response (UPR) and macroautophagy (called hereafter autophagy). Both are necessary for cell survival, however their overactivation in time or intensity often leads to cell death. Moreover, UPR and autophagy can activate and potentiate each other to worsen the issue of cerebral ischemia. Better comprehension of autophagy and ER stress will allow therapeutic strategies for stroke both at the acute phase and during recovery.
The interest of this review is to summarize the latest therapeutic advances implicating ER stress or autophagy in cerebral ischemia. In addition, we discuss the interest to study proteostasis as a single pathway rather than studying either ER stress or autophagy in stroke.</description>

	<description>A central, unresolved problem in affective neuroscience is to understand how emotions are represented in activities of the nervous system. Many studies are striving to find the localization of basic emotions in the brain but failed. Thus many psychologists suspect the specific neural loci for basic emotions, instead, some proposed that there are specific neural structures for the core affects, such as arousal and hedonic value. The reason for this widespread difference might be that basic emotions used previously can be further divided into more “basic” emotions. Here we review brain imaging data and neuropsychological data, and try to address this question with an integrative model. In this model, we argue that basic emotions are not contrary to the dimensional studies of emotions (core affects). We propose that basic emotion should locate on the axis in the dimensions of emotion, and only represent one typical core affect (arousal or valence). Therefore, we propose four basic emotions: joy-on positive axis of hedonic dimension, sadness-on negative axis of hedonic dimension, fear and anger are twin emotions and locate on the top of vertical dimensions. This new model about basic emotions and construction model of emotions is promising  to improve and reformulate neurobiological models of basic emotions.</description>

	<description>Deep learning has great potential for imaging classification by extracting low to high-level features. Our aim was to train a convolution neural network (CNN) with single T2-weighted FLAIR sequence to classify different cognitive performances in patients with subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD). 
Totally 217 patients with SIVD (including 52 vascular dementia (VaD), 82 vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI), 83 non-cognitive impairment (NCI)) and 46 matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent MRI scans and neuropsychological assessment. 2D and 3D CNNs were trained to classify VaD, VaMCI, NCI and HCs based on FLAIR data.
For 3D-based model, loss curves of training set approached 0.017 after about 20 epochs, while the curves of testing set maintained at about 0.114. The accuracy of training set and testing set reached 99.7% and 96.9% after about 30 and 35 epochs, respectively. However, the accuracy of 2D-based model was only around 70%, which performed significantly worse than 3D-based model.
This experiment suggests us that deep learning, is a powerful and convenient method to classify different cognitive performances in SIVD by extracting the shift and scale invariant features of neuroimaging data with single FLAIR sequence. 3D-CNN is superior to 2D-CNN which proposes clinical evaluation with MRI multiplanar reformation or volume scanning.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Median Nerve Stimulation Based BCI: A New Approach to Detect Intraoperative Awareness During General Anesthesia</title>

	<description>Hundreds of millions of general anesthesia are performed each year on patients all over the world. Among these patients, 0.1-0.2 % are victims of Accidental Awareness during General Anesthesia (AAGA), i.e. an unexpected awakening during a surgical procedure under general anesthesia. Although anesthesiologists try to closely monitor patients using various techniques to prevent this terrifying phenomenon, there is currently no efficient solution to accurately detect its occurrence. We propose the conception of an innovative passive brain-computer interface (BCI) based on an intention of movement to prevent AAGA. Indeed, patients typically try to move to alert the medical  staff during an AAGA, only to discover that they are unable to. First, we examine the challenges of such a BCI, i.e. the lack of a trigger to facilitate when to look for an intention to move, as well as the necessity for a high classification accuracy. Then, we present a solution that incorporates Median Nerve Stimulation (MNS). We investigate the specific modulations that MNS causes in the motor cortex and confirm that they can be altered by an intention of movement. Finally, we perform experiments on 16 healthy participants to assess whether an MI-based BCI using MNS is able to generate high classification accuracies. Our results show that MNS may provide a foundation for an innovative BCI that would allow the detection of AAGA.</description>

	<description>Recent non-invasive brain stimulation techniques in combination with motor training can enhance neuroplasticity and learning. It is reasonable to assume that such neuroplasticity-based interventions constitute a useful rehabilitative tool for patients with Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Regarding motor skill training, many kinds of tasks that do not involve real motor movements have been applied to PD patients. The purpose of this study is to elucidate whether motor skill training using mirror visual feedback (MVF) is useful to patients with PD in order to improve untrained hand performance dependent on the time course of training; and whether MVF combined with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over primary motor cortex (M1) causes an additional effect based on increased motor cortical excitability. Eighteen right-handed patients with PD in the off-medication state and 10 age-matched healthy subjects (HS) performed four sessions of right-hand ball rotation using MVF (intervention) on two separate days, one week apart (Day1 and Day2). HS subjects received only sham stimulation. The intervention included four sessions of motor-skill training using MVF for 20 minutes comprised of four sets of training for 30 seconds each. PD patients were randomly divided into two intervention groups without or with anodal tDCS over the right M1 contralateral to the untrained hand. As the behavior evaluation, the number of ball rotations of the left hand was counted before (pre) and immediately after (post) intervention on both days (pre Day1, post Day1, pre Day2, and post Day2). Motor evoked potential (MEP), input-output function, and cortical silent period were recorded to evaluate the motor cortical excitatory and inhibitory system in M1 pre Day1 and post Day2. The number of ball rotations of the left hand and the facilitation of MEP by intervention were significantly impaired in patients with PD compared to HS. In contrast, if anodal tDCS was applied to right M1 of patients with PD, the number of ball rotations in accordance with I-O function at 150% intensity was significantly increased after Day1 and retained until Day2. This finding may help provide a new strategy for neurorehabilitation improving task-specific motor memory without real motor movements in PD.</description>

	<description>Despite the high prevalence and devastating outcome, only a few treatment options for cerebral ischemic stroke exist. Based on the nitric oxide (NO)-stimulating capacity of Non-Pulsed Sinusoidal Electromagnetic Field (NP-SEMF) and the possible neuroprotective role of NO in ischemic stroke, we hypothesized that NP-SEMF is able to enhance survival and neurological outcome in a rat model of cerebral ischemia. The animals in which ischemic injury was induced by occlusion of both common carotid arteries, received daily 20 minutes NP-SEMF of either 10 or 60 Hz for 4 days. NP-SEMF dramatically increased survival, reduced the size of the infarcted brain area and significantly improved the neurological score of the surviving rats. Corresponding to previous reports, NP-SEMF was able to induce NO production in vitro. The importance of NO as a key signaling molecule was highlighted by inhibition of the NP-SEMF beneficial effects in the rat stroke model after blocking NO synthase (NOS). Our results indicate for the first time that NP-SEMF exposure (13.5mT at 60 Hz and 10 Hz) improves the survival and neurological outcome of rats subjected to cerebral ischemia and that this effect is mediated by NO, underlining the great therapeutic potential of NP-SEMF as therapy for ischemic stroke.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effects of a Brain-Computer Interface With Virtual Reality (VR) Neurofeedback: A Pilot Study in Chronic Stroke Patients</title>

	<description>Rehabilitation for stroke patients with severe motor impairments is burdensome and demanding because most of the current rehabilitation options require some volitional movement to train the affected side. However, research has shown that survivors of severe stroke may receive modest benefits from action observation, virtual reality (VR), and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). These approaches have shown some success in strengthening key motor pathways thought to support motor recovery after stroke. The purpose of this study was to combine the principles of action observation, VR, and BCI in a platform called REINVENT and assess its effects on four chronic stroke patients across different levels of motor impairment. REINVENT acquires post-stroke EEG signals that indicate an attempt to move and drives the movement of a virtual avatar arm, allowing patient-driven action observation neurofeedback in VR. In addition, synchronous electromyography (EMG) data were also captured to monitor overt muscle activity. Our results show that this EEG-based BCI can be used by stroke survivors across a wide range of motor disabilities. Finally, individual results suggest that patients with more severe motor impairments benefit the most from EEG-based neurofeedback, while patients with more mild impairments may benefit more from EMG-based feedback, harnessing existing sensorimotor pathways. Future research is needed to confirm these findings in a larger and more diverse population.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: A Role for the Claustrum in Salience Processing?</title>

	<description>The claustrum (CLA) is a subcortical structure, present only in mammals, whose function remains uncertain. Previously, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in awake head-fixed rats, we found evidence that the CLA is part of the rodent homolog of the default mode network (Smith et al., 2017). This network emerged as strong functional connections between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), mediodorsal (MD) thalamus, and CLA in the awake state, which were not present following administration of isoflurane anesthesia. In the present report, we review evidence indicating that the rodent CLA also has connections with structures identified in the rodent homolog of the salience network, a circuit that directs attention towards the most relevant stimuli among a multitude of sensory inputs (Seeley et al., 2007; Menon and Uddin, 2010). In humans, this circuit consists of functional connections between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and a region that encompasses both the CLA and insular cortex. We further go on to review the similarities and differences between the functional and anatomical connections of the CLA and insula in rodents using both rs-fMRI and neuroanatomical tracing, respectively. We analyze in detail the connectivity of the CLA with the cingulate cortex, which is a major node in the salience network and has been shown to modulate attention. When considered with other recent behavior and physiology studies, the data reveal a role for the CLA in salience-guided orienting. More specifically, we hypothesize that limbic information from mPFC, MD thalamus, and the basolateral amygdala are integrated by the CLA to guide modality-related regions of motor and sensory cortex in directing attention towards relevant (i.e. salient) sensory events.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Step by Step Golgi-Cox Staining for Cryosection</title>

	<description>Golgi staining, though invented hundreds of years ago, is still a reliable method to study cytoarchitecture of the brain. Almost all published Golgi staining protocols and methods were for microtome, and it was rarely applied in cryosection, which restricted the application of this technique. Currently, several commercial Golgi-stain kits are available for both:  vibratome section and cryosection, but these kits are costly and it is still challenging for researchers to get fine results. In the present study, we described a protocol of Golgi-Cox Staining for Cryosection, with the modified cryosection protection solution based on the Golgi –Cox method, which makes cryosection easily applied  in the section of the Golgi-Cox impregnated tissue. Our methods provide a low-cost and simple option for Golgi staining, and it will facilitate researchers to get fine Golgi staining results for neuronal architecture studies.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Patterned Vascularization of Embryonic Mouse Forebrain, and Neuromeric Topology of Major Human Subarachnoidal Arterial Branches: A Prosomeric Mapping</title>

	<description>The prosomeric brain model contemplates progressive regionalization of the central nervous system from a molecular and morphological ontogenetic perspective. It defines the forebrain axis relative to the notochord, and contemplates intersecting longitudinal (zonal, columnar) and transversal (neuromeric) patterning mechanisms. A checkboard pattern of histogenetic units of the neural wall results, where each unit is differentially fated by an unique profile of active genes. These natural neural units later expand their radial dimension during neurogenesis, histogenesis, and correlative differential morphogenesis. This fundamental topologic framework is shared by all vertebrates, as a Bauplan, each lineage varying in some subtle aspects. So far the prosomeric model has been applied only to neural structures, but we attempt here a prosomeric analysis of the hypothesis that major vessels invade the brain wall in patterns that are congruent with its intrinsic natural developmental units, as postulated in the prosomeric model. Anatomic and embryologic studies of brain blood vessels have classically recorded a conserved pattern of branches (thus the conventional terminology), and clinical experience has discovered a standard topography of many brain arterial terminal fields. Such results were described under assumptions of the columnar forebrain model, prevalent during the last century, but this is found insufficient in depth and explanatory power in the modern molecular scenario. We have thus explored the possibility that brain vascularization in rodents and humans may relate systematically to genoarchitectonic forebrain subdivisions contemplated in the prosomeric model. Specifically, we examined first whether early vascular invasion of some molecularly characterized prosomeric domains shows heterochrony. We indeed found a heterochronic pattern of vascular invasion that distinguishes between adjacent brain areas with differential molecular profiles. We next mapped topologically on the prosomeric model the major arterial branches serving the human brain. The results of this approach bear on the possibility of a developmentally-based modern arterial terminology.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Shank3 Mice Carrying the Human Q321R Mutation Display Enhanced Self-Grooming, Abnormal Electroencephalogram Patterns, and Suppressed Neuronal Excitability and Seizure Susceptibility</title>

	<description>Shank3, a postsynaptic scaffolding protein involved in regulating excitatory synapse assembly and function, has been implicated in several brain disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), Phelan-McDermid syndrome, schizophrenia, intellectual disability, and mania. Here we generated and characterized a Shank3 knock-in mouse line carrying the Q321R mutation (Shank3Q321R mice) identified in a human individual with ASD that affects the ankyrin repeat region (ARR) domain of the Shank3 protein. Homozygous Shank3Q321R/Q321R mice show a selective decrease in the level of Shank3a, an ARR-containing protein variant, but not other variants. CA1 pyramidal neurons in the Shank3Q321R/Q321R hippocampus show decreased neuronal excitability but normal excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. Behaviorally, Shank3Q321R/Q321R mice show moderately enhanced self-grooming and anxiolytic-like behavior, but normal locomotion, social interaction, and object recognition and contextual fear memory. In addition, these mice show abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns and decreased susceptibility to induced seizures. These results indicate that the Q321R mutation alters Shank3 protein stability, neuronal excitability, repetitive and anxiety-like behavior, EEG patterns, and seizure susceptibility in mice.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurogenesis section | New and Recent Articles: A Critical Period for the Development of Schizophrenia-Like Pathology by Aberrant Postnatal Neurogenesis</title>

	<description>Schizophrenia is a complex and serious mental disorder, and patients with schizophrenia are characterized by psychological hallucinations, deregulated emotionality, and cognitive impairment. Evidence indicated that postnatal neurogenesis in the hippocampus is profoundly impaired in schizophrenic individuals but the role of such dysregulated neurodevelopmental processing in the pathophysiological progress of schizophrenia has not been well investigated. Here in this study, by using the rodent model of schizophrenia through maternal immune activation of poly (I:C) injection, we aimed to examine whether the postnatal neurogenesis might be involved in the development of schizophrenia-like pathology. Through the comprehensive behavioral analyses of multiple core symptoms of schizophrenia at different developmental stages (six-, nine-, and twelve-weeks after birth) of the affected offspring, we found a delayed onset of schizophrenia-like behaviors in poly (I:C) animals through the development. Meanwhile, there is an age-dependent alteration of postnatal neurogenesis in the poly (I:C) animals along different development stages by which the aberrant dendritic elaboration functionally correlated with the schizophrenia-like symptoms in nine-week old of age for the animals. Interestingly, increase in the neurogenesis during a critical period of neurodevelopment exacerbates the schizophrenia-like pathology. Conversely, temporal suppression of aberrant postnatal neurogenesis during the same period of neurodevelopment ameliorates the occurrence of schizophrenia-like symptoms. Together, these findings strongly suggested the aberrant dendritic growth of postnatal neurogenesis during the critical time window of development is essential for controlling the pathophysiological progression of schizophrenia-like symptoms. And pharmacological treatments that adjust these abnormalities may provide potential therapeutic benefits toward patients with schizophrenia in clinic.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Altered Insulin Signaling in Alzheimer’s Disease Brain – Special Emphasis on PI3K-Akt Pathway</title>

	<description>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are both diseases with increasing prevalence in aging populations. T2D, characterized by insulin resistance and defective insulin signaling, is a common co-morbidity and a risk factor for AD, increasing the risk approximately two- to four-fold. Insulin exerts a wide variety of effects as a growth factor as well as by regulating glucose, fatty acid and protein metabolism. Certain lifestyle factors, physical inactivity and typical Western diet (TWD) containing high fat and high sugar are strongly associated with insulin resistance and T2D. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is a major mediator of effects of insulin and plays a crucial role in T2D pathogenesis. Decreased levels of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) subunits as well as blunted Akt kinase phosphorylation have been observed in the AD brain, characterized by amyloid-β and tau pathologies. Furthermore, AD mouse models fed with TWD have shown to display altered levels of PI3K subunits. How impaired insulin-PI3K-Akt signaling in peripheral tissues or in the central nervous system (CNS) affects the development or progression of AD is currently poorly understood. Interestingly, enhancement of PI3K-Akt signaling in the CNS by intranasal insulin (IN) treatment has been shown to improve memory in vivo in mice and in human trials. Insulin is known to augment neuronal growth and synapse formation through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. However, PI3K-Akt pathway mediates signaling related to different functions also in other cell types, like microglia and astrocytes. In this review, we will discuss the most prominent molecular mechanisms related to the PI3K-Akt pathway in AD and how T2D and altered insulin signaling may affect the pathogenesis of AD.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Objective and Automated Detection of Diffuse White Matter Abnormality in Preterm Infants Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

	<description>Diffuse white matter abnormality (DWMA), or diffuse excessive high signal intensity is observed in 50-80% of very preterm infants at term-equivalent age. It is subjectively defined as higher than normal signal intensity in periventricular and subcortical white matter in comparison to normal unmyelinated white matter on T2-weighted MRI images. Despite the well-documented presence of DWMA, it remains debatable whether DWMA represents pathological tissue injury or a transient developmental phenomenon. Manual tracing of DWMA exhibits poor reliability and reproducibility and unduly increases image processing time. Thus, objective and ideally automatic assessment is critical to accurately elucidate the biologic nature of DWMA. We propose a deep learning approach to automatically identify DWMA regions on T2-weighted MRI images. Specifically, we formulated DWMA detection as an image voxel classification task; that is, the voxels on T2-weighted images are treated as samples and exclusively assigned as DWMA or normal white matter voxel classes. To utilize the spatial information of individual voxels, small image patches centered on the given voxels are retrieved. A deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) model was developed to differentiate DWMA and normal voxels. We tested our deep CNN in multiple validation experiments. First, we examined DWMA detection accuracy of our CNN model using computer simulations. This was followed by in vivo assessments in a cohort of very preterm infants (N=95) using cross-validation and holdout validation. Finally, we tested our approach on an independent preterm cohort (N=28) to externally validate our model. Our deep CNN model achieved Dice similarity index values ranging from 0.85 to 0.99 for DWMA detection in the aforementioned validation experiments. Our proposed deep CNN model exhibited significantly better performance than other popular machine learning models. We present an objective and automated approach for accurately identifying DWMA that may facilitate the clinical diagnosis of DWMA in very preterm infants.</description>

	<description>The endogenous potential of adult neurogenesis is of particular interest for the development of new strategies for recovery after stroke and traumatic brain injury. These pathological conditions affect endogenous neurogenesis in two aspects. On the one hand, injury usually initiates the migration of neuronal precursors (NPCs) to the lesion area from the already existing, in physiological conditions, neurogenic niche – the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) near the lateral ventricles. On the other hand, recent studies have convincingly demonstrated the local generation of new neurons near lesion areas in different brain locations. The striatum, cortex, and hippocampal CA1 region are considered to be locations of such new neurogenic zones in the damaged brain. This review focuses on the relative contribution of two types of NPCs of different origin, resident population in new neurogenic zones and cells migrating from the lateral ventricles, to post-stroke or post-traumatic enhancement of neurogenesis. The migratory pathways of NPCs have also been considered. In addition, the review highlights the advantages and limitations of different methodological approaches to the definition of NPC location and tracking of new neurons. In general, we suggest that despite the considerable number of studies, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of neurogenesis in the damaged brain. We believe that the advancement of methods for in vivo visualization and longitudinal observation of neurogenesis in the brain could fundamentally change the current situation in this field.</description>

	<description>Formation and aggregation of misfolded proteins in the central nervous system (CNS) is a key hallmark of several age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These diseases share key biophysical and biochemical characteristics with prion diseases. It is believed that PD is characterized by abnormal protein aggregation, mainly that of α-synuclein (α-syn). Of particular importance, there is growing evidence indicating that abnormal α-syn can spread to neighboring brain regions and cause aggregation of endogenous α-syn in these regions as seeds, in a “prion-like” manner. Abundant studies in vitro and in vivo have shown that α-syn goes through a templated conformational change, propagates from the original region to neighboring regions, and eventually cause neuron degeneration in the substantia nigra and striatum. The objective of this review is to summarize the mechanisms involved in the aggregation of abnormal intracellular α-syn and its subsequent cell-to-cell transmission. According to these findings, we look forward to effective therapeutic perspectives that can block the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Interpreting Prefrontal Recruitment During Walking After Stroke: Influence of Individual Differences in Mobility and Cognitive Function</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00194</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00194</link>
	<description>Background: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a valuable neuroimaging approach for studying cortical contributions to walking function. Recruitment of prefrontal cortex during walking has been a particular area of focus in the literature. The present study investigated whether task-related change in prefrontal recruitment measured by fNIRS is affected by individual differences in people post-stroke. The primary hypotheses were that poor mobility function would contribute to prefrontal over-recruitment during typical walking, and that poor cognitive function would contribute to a ceiling in prefrontal recruitment during dual-task walking (i.e., walking with a cognitive task).

Methods: Thirty-three adults with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis performed three tasks: typical walking at preferred speed (Walk), serial-7 subtraction (Serial7), and walking combined with serial-7 subtraction (Dual-Task). Prefrontal recruitment was measured with fNIRS and quantified as the change in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration (ΔO2Hb) between resting and active periods for each task. Spatiotemporal gait parameters were measured on an electronic walkway. Stepwise regression was used to assess how prefrontal recruitment was affected by individual differences including age, sex, stroke region, injured hemisphere, stroke chronicity, 10 meter walking speed, balance confidence measured by Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale, sensorimotor impairment measured by Fugl-Meyer Assessment, and cognitive function measured by Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE).

Results: For Walk, poor balance confidence (ABC Scale score) significantly predicted greater prefrontal recruitment (ΔO2Hb; R2 = 0.25, p = 0.003). For Dual-Task poor cognitive function (MMSE score) significantly predicted lower prefrontal recruitment (ΔO2Hb; R2 = 0.25, p = 0.002).  

Conclusions: Poor mobility function predicted higher prefrontal recruitment during typical walking, consistent with compensatory over-recruitment. Poor cognitive function predicted lower prefrontal recruitment during dual-task walking, consistent with a recruitment ceiling effect. These findings indicate that interpretation of prefrontal recruitment should carefully consider the characteristics of the person and demands of the task.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Abnormal Interactions of the Salience Network, Central Executive Network, and Default-Mode Network in Patients With Different Cognitive Impairment Loads Caused by Leukoaraiosis</title>

	<description>Leukoaraiosis (LA) is considered to be associated with cognitive impairment in the older people. This alteration can be reflected in functional connectivity (FC) based on resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). In this study, we used the triple brain network model to investigate altered changes in FC for LA with different cognitive impairment loads determined by the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Eighty-three subjects were divided into four groups based on their clinical diagnosis: the LA-normal cognition group (LA-NC) (n=14, 6 males), LA with mild cognitive impairment (LA-MCI) group (n=27, 13 males), LA with vascular dementia (LA-VD) group (n=12, 6 males) and matched healthy controls (HC) (n=30, 11 males). The triple brain network model includes the default-mode network (DMN), salience networks (SN) and the central executive network (CEN), which were extracted with independent components analysis (ICA) and region of interest (ROI)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    based analysis using the REST toolbox. LA group presented decreased FC for all these three brain networks, compared with matched healthy controls. For inter-brain network analysis, there were decreased negative FC between the SN and DMN in LA group. While there were enhanced inter-brain network FC between the SN and CEN as well as within the SN. The decrease of FC between SN and DMN may reflect the damage mechanism of cognitive impairment of LA, which can compensate with the enhanced inter-brain network between SN and CEN and intra-brain network FC within the SN.</description>

	<description>The nervous and immune systems are classically studied as two separate entities. However, their interactions are crucial for maintaining barrier functions at tissues constantly exposed to the external environment. We focus here on the role of neuronal signaling in regulating the immune system at two major barriers: the skin and respiratory tract. Barrier tissues are heavily innervated by sensory and autonomic nerves, and are densely populated by resident immune cells, allowing rapid, coordinated responses to noxious stimuli, as well as to bacterial and fungal pathogens.</description>

	<description>Although the evolutionarily conserved functions of the ventral striatal components have been used as a priori knowledge for further studies, whether these functions are conserved between species remains unclear. In particular, whether macroscopic connectivity supports this given the disproportionate volumetric differences between species in the brain regions that project to the ventral striatum, including the prefrontal and limbic areas, has not been established. The evolutionarily conserved functions of the ventral striatal components have been suggested and used as a priori knowledge for further studies. However, whether this hypothesis is supported by macroscopic connectivity remains unclear, especially when considering the disproportionate volumetric differences between species in the brain regions known to project to the ventral striatum, including the prefrontal and limbic areas. In this study, the human and macaque striatum was first tractographically parcellated to define the ventral striatum and its two subregions, the nucleus accumbens (Acb)-like and the neurochemically unique domains of the Acb and putamen (NUDAPs)-like divisions. Our results revealed a similar topographical distribution of the connectivity-based ventral striatal components in the two primate brains. Successively, a set of targets was extracted to construct a connectivity fingerprint to characterize these parcellation results, enabling cross-species comparisons. Our results indicated that the connectivity fingerprints of the ventral striatum-like divisions were dissimilar in the two species. We localized this difference to specific targets to analyze possible interspecies functional modifications. Our results also revealed interspecies-convergent connectivity ratio fingerprints of the target group to these two ventral striatum-like subregions. This convergence may suggest synchronous connectional changes of these ventral striatal components during primate evolution.</description>

	<description>Age-related hearing loss (ARHL), also called presbycusis, is a progressive disorder affecting hearing functions and among the elderly has been recognized as the third most frequent condition. Among ARHL components, the age-related central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) refers to changes in the auditory network, negatively impacting auditory perception and/or the speech communication performance. The relationship between auditory-perception and speech communication difficulties in age-related CAPD is difficult to establish, mainly because many older subjects have concomitant peripheral ARHL and age-related cognitive changes. In the last two decades, the association between cognitive impairment and ARHL has received great attention. Peripheral ARHL has recently been defined as the modifiable risk factor with the greatest impact on the development of dementia. Even if very few studies have analyzed the relationship between cognitive decline and age-related CAPD, a strong association was highlighted. Therefore, age-related CAPD could be a specific process related to neurodegeneration. Since these two disorders can be concomitant, drawing causal inferences is difficult. The assumption that ARHL, particularly age-related CAPD, may increase the risk of cognitive impairment in the elderly remains unchallenged. This review aims to summarize the evidence of associations between age-related CAPD and cognitive disorders and to define the diagnostic procedure of CAPD in the elderly. Finally, we highlight the importance of tailoring the rehabilitation strategy to this relationship. Future longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes and the use of adequate assessment tools that can disentangle cognitive dysfunction from sensory impairments are warranted.</description>

	<description>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) represents a unique molecular tool to get in vivo access to a wide spectrum of biological and neuropathological processes, of crucial relevance for neurodegenerative conditions. Although most PET findings are based on massive univariate approaches, in the last decade the increasing interest in multivariate methods has paved the way to the assessment of unexplored cerebral features, spanning from resting state brain networks to whole-brain connectome properties. Currently, the combination of molecular neuroimaging techniques with multivariate connectivity methods represents one of the most powerful, yet still emerging, approach to achieve novel insights into the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. In this Review, we will summarize the available evidence in the field of PET molecular connectivity, with the aim to provide an overview of how these studies may increase the understanding of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, over and above “traditional” structural/functional connectivity studies. Considering the available evidence, a major focus will be represented by molecular connectivity studies using [18F]FDG-PET, today applied in the major neuropathological spectra, from amyloidopathies and tauopathies to synucleinopathies and beyond. Pioneering studies using PET tracers targeting brain neuropathology and neurotransmission systems for connectivity studies will be discussed, and their strengths and limitations highlighted with reference to both applied methodology and results interpretation. The most common methods for molecular connectivity assessment will be reviewed, with particular emphasis on the available strategies to investigate molecular connectivity at the single-subject level, of potential relevance for not only research but also diagnostic purposes. Finally, we will highlight possible future perspectives in the field, with reference in particular to newly available PET tracers, which will expand the application of molecular connectivity to new, exciting, unforeseen possibilities.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: L-Dopa Modulation of Brain Connectivity in Parkinson’s Disease Patients: A Pilot EEG-fMRI Study</title>

	<description>Studies of functional neurosurgery and electroencephalography in Parkinson’s disease have demonstrated abnormally synchronous activity between basal ganglia and motor cortex. 
Functional neuroimaging studies investigated brain dysfunction during motor task or resting state and primarily have shown altered patterns of activation and connectivity for motor areas. L-dopa administration relatively normalized these functional alterations.
The aim of this pilot study was to examine the effects of L-dopa administration on functional connectivity in early-stage PD, as revealed by simultaneous recording of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalographic (EEG) data.
Six patients with diagnosis of probable PD underwent EEG-fMRI acquisitions (1.5 T MR scanner and 64-channel cap) before and immediately after the intake of L-dopa. Regions of interest in the primary motor and sensorimotor regions were used for resting state fMRI analysis. From the EEG data, weighted partial directed coherence was computed in the inverse space after the removal of gradient and cardioballistic artifacts.
FMRI results showed that the intake of L-dopa increased functional connectivity within the sensorimotor network, and between motor areas and both attention and default mode networks. 
EEG connectivity among regions of the motor network did not change significantly, while regions of the default mode network showed a strong tendency to increase their outflow toward the rest of the brain.
This pilot study provided a first insight into the potentiality of simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions in PD patients, showing for both techniques the analogous direction of increased connectivity after L-dopa intake, mainly involving motor, dorsal attention and default mode networks.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Hybrid Functional Brain Network With First-Order and Second-Order Information for Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Schizophrenia</title>

	<description>Brain functional connectivity network (BFCN) analysis has been widely used in diagnosis of mental disorder, such as schizophrenia. In BFCN methods, the brain network construction is one of the core tasks due to its great influence on the diagnosis result. Most of the existing BFCN construction methods only consider the first-order relationship existing in each pair of brain regions and ignore the useful high-order information, including multi-regions correlation in the whole brain. Some of the early schizophrenia patients have subtle changes in brain function networks, which cannot be detected in conventional BFCN construction methods. It is well known that the high-order method is usually more sensitive to the subtle changes in signal than the low-order method. For exploiting the high-order information among brain regions, we define the triplet correlation among three brain regions, and derive the second-order brain network based on the connectivity difference and ordinal information in each triplet. For making full use of the complementary information in different brain networks, we proposed a hybrid approach to fuse the first-order and second-order brain networks. The proposed method is applied to identifying the biomarkers of schizophrenia. The experimental results on six schizophrenia datasets (totally including 439 patients and 426 controls) show that the proposed method outperforms the existing brain network methods in diagnosis of schizophrenia.</description>

	<description>Tissue morphology and mechanics are crucial to the regulation of organ function. Investigating the exceptionally complex tissue of the brain at the sub-micron scale turns out to be challenging due to the complex structure and softness of this tissue despite the large interest of biologist, medical engineers, biophysicists and other sin this topic. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) both as an imaging and as a mechanical tool provides an excellent opportunity to study soft biological samples such as live brain tissues. Here we review the principles of AFM, the performance of AFM in tissue imaging and me-chanical mapping of cells and tissues, and finally opening the prospects and challenges of probing the biophysical properties of brain tissue using AFM.</description>
