	<description>&lt;p&gt;The MIT/IEEE/Amazon GraphChallenge.org encourages community approaches to
developing new solutions for analyzing graphs and sparse data. Sparse AI
analytics present unique scalability difficulties. The Sparse Deep Neural
Network (DNN) Challenge draws upon prior challenges from machine learning, high
performance computing, and visual analytics to create a challenge that is
reflective of emerging sparse AI systems. The sparse DNN challenge is based on
a mathematically well-defined DNN inference computation and can be implemented
in any programming environment. In 2019 several sparse DNN challenge
submissions were received from a wide range of authors and organizations. This
paper presents a performance analysis of the best performers of these
submissions. These submissions show that their state-of-the-art sparse DNN
execution time, $T_{\rm DNN}$, is a strong function of the number of DNN
operations performed, $N_{\rm op}$. The sparse DNN challenge provides a clear
picture of current sparse DNN systems and underscores the need for new
innovations to achieve high performance on very large sparse DNNs.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sequential neuronal activity underlies a wide range of processes in the
brain. Neuroscientific evidence for neuronal sequences has been reported in
domains as diverse as perception, motor control, speech, spatial navigation and
memory. Consequently, different dynamical principles have been proposed as
possible sequence-generating mechanisms. Combining experimental findings with
computational concepts like the Bayesian brain hypothesis and predictive coding
leads to the interesting possibility that predictive and inferential processes
in the brain are grounded on generative processes which maintain a sequential
structure. While probabilistic inference about ongoing sequences is a useful
computational model for both the analysis of neuroscientific data and a wide
range of problems in artificial recognition and motor control, research on the
subject is relatively scarce and distributed over different fields in the
neurosciences. Here we review key findings about neuronal sequences and relate
these to the concept of online inference on sequences as a model of
sensory-motor processing and recognition. We propose that describing sequential
neuronal activity as an expression of probabilistic inference over sequences
may lead to novel perspectives on brain function. Importantly, it is promising
to translate the key idea of probabilistic inference on sequences to machine
learning, in order to address challenges in the real-time recognition of speech
and human motion.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Projected Neural Network for a Class of Sparse Regression with Cardinality Penalty. (arXiv:2004.00858v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00858</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we consider a class of sparse regression problems, whose
objective function is the summation of a convex loss function and a cardinality
penalty. By constructing a smoothing function for the cardinality function, we
propose a projected neural network and design a correction method for solving
this problem. The solution of the proposed neural network is unique, global
existent, bounded and globally Lipschitz continuous. Besides, we prove that all
accumulation points of the proposed neural network have a common support set
and a unified lower bound for the nonzero entries. Combining the proposed
neural network with the correction method, any corrected accumulation point is
a local minimizer of the considered sparse regression problem. Moreover, we
analyze the equivalent relationship on the local minimizers between the
considered sparse regression problem and another sparse problem. Finally, some
numerical experiments are provided to show the efficiency of the proposed
neural networks in solving some sparse regression problems in practice.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Non-volatile memory arrays can deploy pre-trained neural network models for
edge inference. However, these systems are affected by device-level noise and
retention issues. Here, we examine damage caused by these effects, introduce a
mitigation strategy, and demonstrate its use in fabricated array of SONOS
(Silicon-Oxide-Nitride-Oxide-Silicon) devices. On MNIST, fashion-MNIST, and
CIFAR-10 tasks, our approach increases resilience to synaptic noise and drift.
We also show strong performance can be realized with ADCs of 5-8 bits
precision.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces a novel algorithmic framework for a deep neural network
(DNN), which in a mathematically rigorous manner, allows us to incorporate
history (or memory) into the network -- it ensures all layers are connected to
one another. This DNN, called Fractional-DNN, can be viewed as a
time-discretization of a fractional in time nonlinear ordinary differential
equation (ODE). The learning problem then is a minimization problem subject to
that fractional ODE as constraints. We emphasize that an analogy between the
existing DNN and ODEs, with standard time derivative, is well-known by now. The
focus of our work is the Fractional-DNN. Using the Lagrangian approach, we
provide a derivation of the backward propagation and the design equations. We
test our network on several datasets for classification problems.
Fractional-DNN offers various advantages over the existing DNN. The key
benefits are a significant improvement to the vanishing gradient issue due to
the memory effect, and better handling of nonsmooth data due to the network's
ability to approximate non-smooth functions.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inattentional blindness is the psychological phenomenon that causes one to
miss things in plain sight. It is a consequence of the selective attention in
perception that lets us remain focused on important parts of our world without
distraction from irrelevant details. Motivated by selective attention, we study
the properties of artificial agents that perceive the world through the lens of
a self-attention bottleneck. By constraining access to only a small fraction of
the visual input, we show that their policies are directly interpretable in
pixel space. We find neuroevolution ideal for training self-attention
architectures for vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, allowing us
to incorporate modules that can include discrete, non-differentiable operations
which are useful for our agent. We argue that self-attention has similar
properties as indirect encoding, in the sense that large implicit weight
matrices are generated from a small number of key-query parameters, thus
enabling our agent to solve challenging vision based tasks with at least 1000x
fewer parameters than existing methods. Since our agent attends to only task
critical visual hints, they are able to generalize to environments where task
irrelevant elements are modified while conventional methods fail. Videos of our
results and source code available at https://attentionagent.github.io/

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Automatic classification of epileptic seizure types in electroencephalograms
(EEGs) data can enable more precise diagnosis and efficient management of the
disease. This task is challenging due to factors such as low signal-to-noise
ratios, signal artefacts, high variance in seizure semiology among epileptic
patients, and limited availability of clinical data. To overcome these
challenges, in this paper, we present SeizureNet, a deep learning framework
which learns multi-spectral feature embeddings using an ensemble architecture
for accurate cross-patient seizure type classification. Experiments on the
recently released TUH EEG Seizure Corpus show that SeizureNet produces
state-of-the-art weighted F1 scores of 0.98 for seizure type classification
setting new benchmarks on the dataset. We also show that the high-level feature
embeddings learnt by SeizureNet considerably improve the classification
accuracy of smaller networks through knowledge distillation for applications
with low-memory and fast inference speed requirements.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A large body of compelling evidence has been accumulated demonstrating that
embodiment - the agent's physical setup, including its shape, materials,
sensors and actuators - is constitutive for any form of cognition and as a
consequence, models of cognition need to be embodied. In contrast to methods
from empirical sciences to study cognition, robots can be freely manipulated
and virtually all key variables of their embodiment and control programs can be
systematically varied. As such, they provide an extremely powerful tool of
investigation. We present a robotic bottom-up or developmental approach,
focusing on three stages: (a) low-level behaviors like walking and reflexes,
(b) learning regularities in sensorimotor spaces, and (c) human-like cognition.
We also show that robotic based research is not only a productive path to
deepening our understanding of cognition, but that robots can strongly benefit
from human-like cognition in order to become more autonomous, robust,
resilient, and safe.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05344</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We establish a general linear response relation for spiking neuronal
networks, based on chains with unbounded memory. This relation allows us to
predict the influence of a weak amplitude time-dependent external stimuli on
spatio-temporal spike correlations, from the spontaneous statistics (without
stimulus) in a general context where the memory in spike dynamics can extend
arbitrarily far in the past. Using this approach, we show how linear response
is explicitly related to neuronal dynamics with an example, the gIF model,
introduced by M. Rudolph and A. Destexhe. This example illustrates the
collective effect of the stimuli, intrinsic neuronal dynamics, and network
connectivity on spike statistics. We illustrate our results with numerical
simulations.

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Parkinson’s Disease—Near-Infrared Photobiomodulation as a Potential Therapeutic Strategy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00089</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00089</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;As the main driver of energy production in eukaryotes, mitochondria are invariably implicated in disorders of cellular bioenergetics. Given that dopaminergic neurons affected in Parkinson’s disease (PD) are particularly susceptible to energy fluctuations by their high basal energy demand, it is not surprising to note that mitochondrial dysfunction has emerged as a compelling candidate underlying PD. A recent approach towards forestalling dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD involves near-infrared (NIR) photobiomodulation (PBM), which is thought to enhance mitochondrial function of stimulated cells through augmenting the activity of cytochrome C oxidase. Notwithstanding this, our understanding of the neuroprotective mechanism of PBM remains far from complete. For example, studies focusing on the effects of PBM on gene transcription are limited, and the mechanism through which PBM exerts its effects on distant sites (i.e., its “abscopal effect”) remains unclear. Also, the clinical application of NIR in PD proves to be challenging. Efficacious delivery of NIR light to the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), the primary site of disease pathology in PD, is fraught with technical challenges. Concerted efforts focused on understanding the biological effects of PBM and improving the efficiency of intracranial NIR delivery are therefore essential for its successful clinical translation. Nonetheless, PBM represents a potential novel therapy for PD. In this review, we provide an update on the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD and how PBM may help mitigate the neurodegenerative process. We also discussed clinical translation aspects of this treatment modality using intracranially implanted NIR delivery devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Author summary: Conferences are great venues for disseminating algorithmic bioinformatics results, but they unfortunately do not offer an opportunity to make major revisions in the way that journals do. As a result, it is not possible for authors to fix mistakes that might be easily correctable but nevertheless can cause the paper to be rejected. As a reviewer, I wish that I had the opportunity to tell the authors, “Hey, you forgot to do this really important thing, without which it is hard to accept the paper, but if you could go back and fix it, you might have a great paper for the conference.” This lack of a back and forth can be especially problematic for first-time submitters or those from outside the field, e.g., biologists. In this article, I outline Ten Simple Rules to follow when writing an algorithmic bioinformatics conference paper to avoid having it rejected.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vz0yBVhdYvc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Multiscale modelling of infectious disease systems falls within the domain of complexity science—the study of complex systems. However, what should be made clear is that current progress in multiscale modelling of infectious disease dynamics is still as yet insufficient to present it as a mature sub-discipline of complexity science. In this article we present a methodology for development of multiscale models of infectious disease systems. This methodology is a set of partially ordered research and development activities that result in multiscale models of infectious disease systems built from different scientific approaches. Therefore, the conclusive result of this article is a methodology to design multiscale models of infectious diseases. Although this research and development process for multiscale models cannot be claimed to be unique and final, it constitutes a good starting point, which may be found useful as a basis for further refinement in the discourse for multiscale modelling of infectious disease dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x6ziJKg0pEU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The molecular mechanisms and functions in complex biological systems currently remain elusive. Recent high-throughput techniques, such as next-generation sequencing, have generated a wide variety of multiomics datasets that enable the identification of biological functions and mechanisms via multiple facets. However, integrating these large-scale multiomics data and discovering functional insights are, nevertheless, challenging tasks. To address these challenges, machine learning has been broadly applied to analyze multiomics. This review introduces multiview learning—an emerging machine learning field—and envisions its potentially powerful applications to multiomics. In particular, multiview learning is more effective than previous integrative methods for learning data’s heterogeneity and revealing cross-talk patterns. Although it has been applied to various contexts, such as computer vision and speech recognition, multiview learning has not yet been widely applied to biological data—specifically, multiomics data. Therefore, this paper firstly reviews recent multiview learning methods and unifies them in a framework called multiview empirical risk minimization (MV-ERM). We further discuss the potential applications of each method to multiomics, including genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics, in an aim to discover the functional and mechanistic interpretations across omics. Secondly, we explore possible applications to different biological systems, including human diseases (e.g., brain disorders and cancers), plants, and single-cell analysis, and discuss both the benefits and caveats of using multiview learning to discover the molecular mechanisms and functions of these systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DGnjThFhIv0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Author summary: The purpose of this quick guide is to help new modelers who have little or no background in comparative modeling yet are keen to produce high-resolution protein 3D structures for their study by following systematic good modeling practices, using affordable personal computers or online computational resources. Through the available experimental 3D-structure repositories, the modeler should be able to access and use the atomic coordinates for building homology models. We also aim to provide the modeler with a rationale behind making a simple list of atomic coordinates suitable for computational analysis abiding to principles of physics (e.g., molecular mechanics). Keeping that objective in mind, these quick tips cover the process of homology modeling and some postmodeling computations such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD). A brief section was left for modeling nonprotein molecules, and a short case study of homology modeling is discussed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/f1FXdcJi7Uo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Recent advances in animal tracking technology have ushered in a new era in biologging. However, the considerable size of many sophisticated biologging devices restricts their application to larger animals, whereas older techniques often still represent the state-of-the-art for studying small vertebrates. In industrial applications, low-power wireless sensor networks (WSNs) fulfill requirements similar to those needed to monitor animal behavior at high resolution and at low tag mass. We developed a wireless biologging network (WBN), which enables simultaneous direct proximity sensing, high-resolution tracking, and long-range remote data download at tag masses of 1 to 2 g. Deployments to study wild bats created social networks and flight trajectories of unprecedented quality. Our developments highlight the vast capabilities of WBNs and their potential to close an important gap in biologging: fully automated tracking and proximity sensing of small animals, even in closed habitats, at high spatial and temporal resolution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GWh2vVW6nuE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The extension of the human lifespan has not translated into a parallel extension of a &lt;i&gt;healthy&lt;/i&gt; lifespan (or healthspan). Cognitive impairment and dementia are the most common diagnoses that impact the healthspan as we age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science: A plants diet, surviving in a variable nutrient environment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/368/6486/eaba0196?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/368/6486/eaba0196?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;As primary producers, plants rely on a large aboveground surface area to collect carbon dioxide and sunlight and a large underground surface area to collect the water and mineral nutrients needed to support their growth and development. Accessibility of the essential nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the soil is affected by many factors that create a variable spatiotemporal landscape of their availability both at the local and global scale. Plants optimize uptake of the N and P available through modifications to their growth and development and engagement with microorganisms that facilitate their capture. The sensing of these nutrients, as well as the perception of overall nutrient status, shapes the plant’s response to its nutrient environment, coordinating its development with microbial engagement to optimize N and P capture and regulate overall plant growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science: Structural basis for allosteric PARP-1 retention on DNA breaks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The success of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase–1 (PARP-1) inhibitors (PARPi) to treat cancer relates to their ability to trap PARP-1 at the site of a DNA break. Although different forms of PARPi all target the catalytic center of the enzyme, they have variable abilities to trap PARP-1. We found that several structurally distinct PARPi drive PARP-1 allostery to promote release from a DNA break. Other inhibitors drive allostery to retain PARP-1 on a DNA break. Further, we generated a new PARPi compound, converting an allosteric pro-release compound to a pro-retention compound and increasing its ability to kill cancer cells. These developments are pertinent to clinical applications where PARP-1 trapping is either desirable or undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science: Contemporaneity of Australopithecus, Paranthropus, and early Homo erectus in South Africa</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the extinction of &lt;i&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/i&gt; and origins of &lt;i&gt;Paranthropus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Homo&lt;/i&gt; in South Africa has been hampered by the perceived complex geological context of hominin fossils, poor chronological resolution, and a lack of well-preserved early &lt;i&gt;Homo&lt;/i&gt; specimens. We describe, date, and contextualize the discovery of two hominin crania from Drimolen Main Quarry in South Africa. At ~2.04 million to 1.95 million years old, DNH 152 represents the earliest definitive occurrence of &lt;i&gt;Paranthropus robustus&lt;/i&gt;, and DNH 134 represents the earliest occurrence of a cranium with clear affinities to &lt;i&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/i&gt;. These crania also show that &lt;i&gt;Homo&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Paranthropus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/i&gt; were contemporaneous at ~2 million years ago. This high taxonomic diversity is also reflected in non-hominin species and provides evidence of endemic evolution and dispersal during a period of climatic variability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science: Facial expressions of emotion states and their neuronal correlates in mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/368/6486/89?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of emotion relies on objective readouts of the emotional state of an individual, which remains a major challenge especially in animal models. We found that mice exhibit stereotyped facial expressions in response to emotionally salient events, as well as upon targeted manipulations in emotion-relevant neuronal circuits. Facial expressions were classified into distinct categories using machine learning and reflected the changing intrinsic value of the same sensory stimulus encountered under different homeostatic or affective conditions. Facial expressions revealed emotion features such as intensity, valence, and persistence. Two-photon imaging uncovered insular cortical neuron activity that correlated with specific facial expressions and may encode distinct emotions. Facial expressions thus provide a means to infer emotion states and their neuronal correlates in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science: Cysteine depletion induces pancreatic tumor ferroptosis in mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/368/6486/85?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/368/6486/85?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a form of cell death that results from the catastrophic accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oncogenic signaling elevates lipid ROS production in many tumor types and is counteracted by metabolites that are derived from the amino acid cysteine. In this work, we show that the import of oxidized cysteine (cystine) via system x&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; is a critical dependency of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is a leading cause of cancer mortality. PDAC cells used cysteine to synthesize glutathione and coenzyme A, which, together, down-regulated ferroptosis. Studying genetically engineered mice, we found that the deletion of a system x&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; subunit, &lt;i&gt;Slc7a11&lt;/i&gt;, induced tumor-selective ferroptosis and inhibited PDAC growth. This was replicated through the administration of cyst(e)inase, a drug that depletes cysteine and cystine, demonstrating a translatable means to induce ferroptosis in PDAC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science: De novo design of protein logic gates</title>

	<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/368/6486/78?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The design of modular protein logic for regulating protein function at the posttranscriptional level is a challenge for synthetic biology. Here, we describe the design of two-input AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XNOR, and NOT gates built from de novo–designed proteins. These gates regulate the association of arbitrary protein units ranging from split enzymes to transcriptional machinery in vitro, in yeast and in primary human T cells, where they control the expression of the &lt;i&gt;TIM3&lt;/i&gt; gene related to T cell exhaustion. Designed binding interaction cooperativity, confirmed by native mass spectrometry, makes the gates largely insensitive to stoichiometric imbalances in the inputs, and the modularity of the approach enables ready extension to three-input OR, AND, and disjunctive normal form gates. The modularity and cooperativity of the control elements, coupled with the ability to de novo design an essentially unlimited number of protein components, should enable the design of sophisticated posttranslational control logic over a wide range of biological functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science: A slip law for glaciers on deformable beds</title>

	<link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/368/6486/76?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Slip of marine-terminating ice streams over beds of deformable till is responsible for most of the contribution of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to sea level rise. Flow models of the ice sheet and till-bedded glaciers elsewhere require a law that relates slip resistance, slip velocity, and water pressure at the bed. We present results of experiments in which pressurized ice at its melting temperature is slid over a water-saturated till bed. Steady-state slip resistance increases with slip velocity owing to sliding of ice across the bed, but above a threshold velocity, till shears at its rate-independent Coulomb strength. These results motivate a generalized slip law for glacier-flow models that combines processes of hard-bedded sliding and bed deformation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science: Extreme tensile strain states in La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 membranes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A defining feature of emergent phenomena in complex oxides is the competition and cooperation between ground states. In manganites, the balance between metallic and insulating phases can be tuned by the lattice; extending the range of lattice control would enhance the ability to access other phases. We stabilized uniform extreme tensile strain in nanoscale La&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; membranes, exceeding 8% uniaxially and 5% biaxially. Uniaxial and biaxial strain suppresses the ferromagnetic metal at distinctly different strain values, inducing an insulator that can be extinguished by a magnetic field. Electronic structure calculations indicate that the insulator consists of charge-ordered Mn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; with staggered strain-enhanced Jahn-Teller distortions within the plane. This highly tunable strained membrane approach provides a broad opportunity to design and manipulate correlated electron states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Hayabusa2 spacecraft investigated the small asteroid Ryugu, which has a rubble-pile structure. We describe an impact experiment on Ryugu using Hayabusa2’s Small Carry-on Impactor. The impact produced an artificial crater with a diameter &amp;gt;10 meters, which has a semicircular shape, an elevated rim, and a central pit. Images of the impact and resulting ejecta were recorded by the Deployable CAMera 3 for &amp;gt;8 minutes, showing the growth of an ejecta curtain (the outer edge of the ejecta) and deposition of ejecta onto the surface. The ejecta curtain was asymmetric and heterogeneous and it never fully detached from the surface. The crater formed in the gravity-dominated regime; in other words, crater growth was limited by gravity not surface strength. We discuss implications for Ryugu’s surface age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science: Critical differences in 3D atomic structure of individual ligand-protected nanocrystals in solution</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Precise three-dimensional (3D) atomic structure determination of individual nanocrystals is a prerequisite for understanding and predicting their physical properties. Nanocrystals from the same synthesis batch display what are often presumed to be small but possibly important differences in size, lattice distortions, and defects, which can only be understood by structural characterization with high spatial 3D resolution. We solved the structures of individual colloidal platinum nanocrystals by developing atomic-resolution 3D liquid-cell electron microscopy to reveal critical intrinsic heterogeneity of ligand-protected platinum nanocrystals in solution, including structural degeneracies, lattice parameter deviations, internal defects, and strain. These differences in structure lead to substantial contributions to free energies, consequential enough that they must be considered in any discussion of fundamental nanocrystal properties or applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) engages mitochondria at specialized ER domains known as mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs). Here, we used three-dimensional high-resolution imaging to investigate the formation of pleomorphic &quot;megamitochondria&quot; with altered MAMs in brown adipocytes lacking the Sel1L-Hrd1 protein complex of ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Mice with ERAD deficiency in brown adipocytes were cold sensitive and exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction. ERAD deficiency affected ER-mitochondria contacts and mitochondrial dynamics, at least in part, by regulating the turnover of the MAM protein, sigma receptor 1 (SigmaR1). Thus, our study provides molecular insights into ER-mitochondrial cross-talk and expands our understanding of the physiological importance of Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science: Maintenance of neural stem cell positional identity by mixed-lineage leukemia 1</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the developing and postnatal brain have distinct positional identities that dictate the types of neurons they generate. Although morphogens initially establish NSC positional identity in the neural tube, it is unclear how such regional differences are maintained as the forebrain grows much larger and more anatomically complex. We found that the maintenance of NSC positional identity in the murine brain requires a &lt;i&gt;mixed-lineage leukemia 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Mll1&lt;/i&gt;)–dependent epigenetic memory system. After establishment by sonic hedgehog, ventral NSC identity became independent of this morphogen. Even transient MLL1 inhibition caused a durable loss of ventral identity, resulting in the generation of neurons with the characteristics of dorsal NSCs in vivo. Thus, spatial information provided by morphogens can be transitioned to epigenetic mechanisms that maintain regionally distinct developmental programs in the forebrain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Axonal demyelination injury and neuronal degeneration are the primary causes of visual disability in multiple sclerosis (MS)-linked optic neuritis patients. Immunomodulatory therapies targeting inflammation have failed to avert the disease progression and no therapies exist to prevent the neuronal deficits seen in MS to date. Neuroprotective strategies targeting oligodendrocytes and astroglia have shown limited success due to a lack of axonal regeneration from injured neurons. In this study, we used the chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS to investigate the axonal regenerative approach to improve the neuronal function. Our approach focused on targeted knock-out (KO) of the developmentally regulated axon growth inhibitory Krüppel-like factor 4 (&lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt;) gene in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/i&gt;mice by intravitreal delivery of AAV2-Cre-ires-EGFP recombinant virus (1) at the time of EAE sensitization and (2) after the onset of optic neuritis-mediated visual defects in the mice. &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt; gene KO performed simultaneous with EAE sensitization prevented the visual loss as assessed by pattern electroretinograms (PERGs) in the mice and protected the RGCs from EAE-mediated death. More importantly, however, &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt; gene KO after the onset of optic neuritis also resulted in RGC neuroprotection with additional restoration of their function, thereby improving the visual function outcomes in the EAE model. This study establishes the efficacy of &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt; targeted knock-down in EAE even after the onset of disease symptoms, and thus should be further explored as a potential treatment strategy for MS/optic neuritis patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent days, the amount of Cyber Security text data shared via social
media resources mainly Twitter has increased. An accurate analysis of this data
can help to develop cyber threat situational awareness framework for a cyber
threat. This work proposes a deep learning based approach for tweet data
analysis. To convert the tweets into numerical representations, various text
representations are employed. These features are feed into deep learning
architecture for optimal feature extraction as well as classification. Various
hyperparameter tuning approaches are used for identifying optimal text
representation method as well as optimal network parameters and network
structures for deep learning models. For comparative analysis, the classical
text representation method with classical machine learning algorithm is
employed. From the detailed analysis of experiments, we found that the deep
learning architecture with advanced text representation methods performed
better than the classical text representation and classical machine learning
algorithms. The primary reason for this is that the advanced text
representation methods have the capability to learn sequential properties which
exist among the textual data and deep learning architectures learns the optimal
features along with decreasing the feature size.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the amount of Cyber Security data generated in the form of
unstructured texts, for example, social media resources, blogs, articles, and
so on has exceptionally increased. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an initial
step towards converting this unstructured data into structured data which can
be used by a lot of applications. The existing methods on NER for Cyber
Security data are based on rules and linguistic characteristics. A Deep
Learning (DL) based approach embedded with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) is
proposed in this paper. Several DL architectures are evaluated to find the most
optimal architecture. The combination of Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit
(Bi-GRU), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and CRF performed better compared
to various other DL frameworks on a publicly available benchmark dataset. This
may be due to the reason that the bidirectional structures preserve the
features related to the future and previous words in a sequence.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal networks provide living organisms with the ability to process
information. They are also characterized by abundant recurrent connections,
which give rise to strong feedback that dictates their dynamics and endows them
with fading (short-term) memory. The role of recurrence in long-term memory, on
the other hand, is still unclear. Here we use the neuronal network of the
roundworm C. elegans to show that recurrent architectures in living organisms
can exhibit long-term memory without relying on specific hard-wired modules. A
genetic algorithm reveals that the experimentally observed dynamics of the
worm's neuronal network exhibits maximal complexity (as measured by permutation
entropy). In that complex regime, the response of the system to repeated
presentations of a time-varying stimulus reveals a consistent behavior that can
be interpreted as soft-wired long-term memory.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00476</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper derives, under minimal modelling assumptions, a simple to use
theorem for obtaining both order-$1$ and order-$2$ stability criteria for a
common class of particle swarm optimization (PSO) variants. Specifically, PSO
variants that can be rewritten as a finite sum of stochastically weighted
difference vectors between a particle's position and swarm informers are
covered by the theorem. Additionally, the use of the derived theorem allows a
PSO practitioner to obtain stability criteria that contains no artificial
restriction on the relationship between control coefficients. Almost all
previous PSO stability results have provided stability criteria under the
restriction that the social and cognitive control coefficients are equal; such
restrictions are not present when using the derived theorem. Using the derived
theorem, as demonstration of its ease of use, stability criteria are derived
without the imposed restriction on the relation between the control
coefficients for three popular PSO variants.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Self-adaptation in non-Elitist Evolutionary Algorithms on Discrete Problems with Unknown Structure. (arXiv:2004.00327v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A key challenge to make effective use of evolutionary algorithms is to choose
appropriate settings for their parameters. However, the appropriate parameter
setting generally depends on the structure of the optimisation problem, which
is often unknown to the user. Non-deterministic parameter control mechanisms
adjust parameters using information obtained from the evolutionary process.
Self-adaptation -- where parameter settings are encoded in the chromosomes of
individuals and evolve through mutation and crossover -- is a popular parameter
control mechanism in evolutionary strategies. However, there is little
theoretical evidence that self-adaptation is effective, and self-adaptation has
largely been ignored by the discrete evolutionary computation community.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we show through a theoretical runtime analysis that a non-elitist,
discrete evolutionary algorithm which self-adapts its mutation rate not only
outperforms EAs which use static mutation rates on \leadingones, but also
improves asymptotically on an EA using a state-of-the-art control mechanism.
The structure of this problem depends on a parameter $k$, which is \emph{a
priori} unknown to the algorithm, and which is needed to appropriately set a
fixed mutation rate. The self-adaptive EA achieves the same asymptotic runtime
as if this parameter was known to the algorithm beforehand, which is an
asymptotic speedup for this problem compared to all other EAs previously
studied. An experimental study of how the mutation-rates evolve show that they
respond adequately to a diverse range of problem structures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that self-adaptation should be adopted more broadly as
a parameter control mechanism in discrete, non-elitist evolutionary algorithms.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The deployment of Machine Learning (ML) models is a difficult and
time-consuming job that comprises a series of sequential and correlated tasks
that go from the data pre-processing, and the design and extraction of
features, to the choice of the ML algorithm and its parameterisation. The task
is even more challenging considering that the design of features is in many
cases problem specific, and thus requires domain-expertise. To overcome these
limitations Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) methods seek to automate, with
few or no human-intervention, the design of pipelines, i.e., automate the
selection of the sequence of methods that have to be applied to the raw data.
These methods have the potential to enable non-expert users to use ML, and
provide expert users with solutions that they would unlikely consider. In
particular, this paper describes AutoML-DSGE - a novel grammar-based framework
that adapts Dynamic Structured Grammatical Evolution (DSGE) to the evolution of
Scikit-Learn classification pipelines. The experimental results include
comparing AutoML-DSGE to another grammar-based AutoML framework, Resilient
ClassificationPipeline Evolution (RECIPE), and show that the average
performance of the classification pipelines generated by AutoML-DSGE is always
superior to the average performance of RECIPE; the differences are
statistically significant in 3 out of the 10 used datasets.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;NeuroEvolution (NE) methods are known for applying Evolutionary Computation
to the optimisation of Artificial Neural Networks(ANNs). Despite aiding
non-expert users to design and train ANNs, the vast majority of NE approaches
disregard the knowledge that is gathered when solving other tasks, i.e.,
evolution starts from scratch for each problem, ultimately delaying the
evolutionary process. To overcome this drawback, we extend Fast Deep
Evolutionary Network Structured Representation (Fast-DENSER) to incremental
development. We hypothesise that by transferring the knowledge gained from
previous tasks we can attain superior results and speedup evolution. The
results show that the average performance of the models generated by
incremental development is statistically superior to the non-incremental
average performance. In case the number of evaluations performed by incremental
development is smaller than the performed by non-incremental development the
attained results are similar in performance, which indicates that incremental
development speeds up evolution. Lastly, the models generated using incremental
development generalise better, and thus, without further evolution, report a
superior performance on unseen problems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning is being adopted in settings where accurate and justifiable
predictions are required, ranging from finance to medical imaging. While there
has been recent work providing post-hoc explanations for model predictions,
there has been relatively little work exploring more directly interpretable
models that can match state-of-the-art accuracy. Historically, decision trees
have been the gold standard in balancing interpretability and accuracy.
However, recent attempts to combine decision trees with deep learning have
resulted in models that (1) achieve accuracies far lower than that of modern
neural networks (e.g. ResNet) even on small datasets (e.g. MNIST), and (2)
require significantly different architectures, forcing practitioners pick
between accuracy and interpretability. We forgo this dilemma by creating
Neural-Backed Decision Trees (NBDTs) that (1) achieve neural network accuracy
and (2) require no architectural changes to a neural network. NBDTs achieve
accuracy within 1% of the base neural network on CIFAR10, CIFAR100,
TinyImageNet, using recently state-of-the-art WideResNet; and within 2% of
EfficientNet on ImageNet. This yields state-of-the-art explainable models on
ImageNet, with NBDTs improving the baseline by ~14% to 75.30% top-1 accuracy.
Furthermore, we show interpretability of our model's decisions both
qualitatively and quantitatively via a semi-automatic process. Code and
pretrained NBDTs can be found at
https://github.com/alvinwan/neural-backed-decision-trees.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00151</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an emerging form of indirect
encoding. The GAN is trained to induce a latent space on training data, and a
real-valued evolutionary algorithm can search that latent space. Such Latent
Variable Evolution (LVE) has recently been applied to game levels. However, it
is hard for objective scores to capture level features that are appealing to
players. Therefore, this paper introduces a tool for interactive LVE of
tile-based levels for games. The tool also allows for direct exploration of the
latent dimensions, and allows users to play discovered levels. The tool works
for a variety of GAN models trained for both Super Mario Bros. and The Legend
of Zelda, and is easily generalizable to other games. A user study shows that
both the evolution and latent space exploration features are appreciated, with
a slight preference for direct exploration, but combining these features allows
users to discover even better levels. User feedback also indicates how this
system could eventually grow into a commercial design tool, with the addition
of a few enhancements.

complex, dynamical systems are typically deemed convenient, but ultimately
reducible to a complete causal account of the underlying micro constituents.
Yet, such a reductionist perspective is hard to square with several issues
related to autonomy and agency: (1) agents require (causal) borders that
separate them from the environment, (2) at least in a biological context,
agents are associated with macroscopic systems, and (3) agents are supposed to
act upon their environment. Integrated information theory (IIT) (Oizumi et al.,
2014) offers a quantitative account of causation based on a set of causal
principles, including notions such as causal specificity, composition, and
irreducibility, that challenges the reductionist perspective in multiple ways.
First, the IIT formalism provides a complete account of a system's causal
structure, including irreducible higher-order mechanisms constituted of
multiple system elements. Second, a system's amount of integrated information
($\Phi$) measures the causal constraints a system exerts onto itself and can
peak at a macro level of description (Hoel et al., 2016; Marshall et al.,
2018). Finally, the causal principles of IIT can also be employed to identify
and quantify the actual causes of events (&quot;what caused what&quot;), such as an
agent's actions (Albantakis et al., 2019). Here, we demonstrate this framework
by example of a simulated agent, equipped with a small neural network, that
forms a maximum of $\Phi$ at a macro scale.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mathematical proofs are both paradigms of certainty and some of the most
explicitly-justified arguments that we have in the cultural record. Their very
explicitness, however, leads to a paradox, because their probability of error
grows exponentially as the argument expands. Here we show that under a
cognitively-plausible belief formation mechanism that combines deductive and
abductive reasoning, mathematical arguments can undergo what we call an
epistemic phase transition: a dramatic and rapidly-propagating jump from
uncertainty to near-complete confidence at reasonable levels of claim-to-claim
error rates. To show this, we analyze an unusual dataset of forty-eight
machine-aided proofs from the formalized reasoning system Coq, including major
theorems ranging from ancient to 21st Century mathematics, along with four
hand-constructed cases from Euclid, Apollonius, Spinoza, and Andrew Wiles. Our
results bear both on recent work in the history and philosophy of mathematics,
and on a question, basic to cognitive science, of how we form beliefs, and
justify them to others.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In most network problems, the optimum behaviors of agents in the network are
not known before deployment. In addition to that, agents might be required to
adapt, i.e. change their behavior based on the environment conditions. In these
scenarios, offline optimization is usually costly and inefficient, while online
methods might be more suitable. In this work we propose a distributed embodied
evolutionary approach to optimize spatially distributed, locally interacting
agents by allowing them to exchange their behavior parameters and learn from
each other to adapt to a certain task within a given environment. Our numerical
results show that the local exchange of information, performed by means of
crossover of behavior parameters with neighbors, allows the network to converge
to the global optimum more efficiently than the cases where local interactions
are not allowed, even when there are large differences on the optimal behaviors
within a neighborhood.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have recently attracted significant research
interest as the third generation of artificial neural networks that can enable
low-power event-driven data analytics. The best performing SNNs for image
recognition tasks are obtained by converting a trained Analog Neural Network
(ANN), consisting of Rectified Linear Units (ReLU), to SNN composed of
integrate-and-fire neurons with &quot;proper&quot; firing thresholds. The converted SNNs
typically incur loss in accuracy compared to that provided by the original ANN
and require sizable number of inference time-steps to achieve the best
accuracy. We find that performance degradation in the converted SNN stems from
using &quot;hard reset&quot; spiking neuron that is driven to fixed reset potential once
its membrane potential exceeds the firing threshold, leading to information
loss during SNN inference. We propose ANN-SNN conversion using &quot;soft reset&quot;
spiking neuron model, referred to as Residual Membrane Potential (RMP) spiking
neuron, which retains the &quot;residual&quot; membrane potential above threshold at the
firing instants. We demonstrate near loss-less ANN-SNN conversion using RMP
neurons for VGG-16, ResNet-20, and ResNet-34 SNNs on challenging datasets
including CIFAR-10 (93.63% top-1), CIFAR-100 (70.93% top-1), and ImageNet
(73.09% top-1 accuracy). Our results also show that RMP-SNN surpasses the best
inference accuracy provided by the converted SNN with &quot;hard reset&quot; spiking
neurons using 2-8 times fewer inference time-steps across network architectures
and datasets.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;NeuroEvolution is one of the most competitive evolutionary learning
frameworks for designing novel neural networks for use in specific tasks, such
as logic circuit design and digital gaming. However, the application of
benchmark methods such as the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)
remains a challenge, in terms of their computational cost and search time
inefficiency. This paper advances a method which incorporates a type of
topological edge coding, named Reverse Encoding Tree (RET), for evolving
scalable neural networks efficiently. Using RET, two types of approaches --
NEAT with Binary search encoding (Bi-NEAT) and NEAT with Golden-Section search
encoding (GS-NEAT) -- have been designed to solve problems in benchmark
continuous learning environments such as logic gates, Cartpole, and Lunar
Lander, and tested against classical NEAT and FS-NEAT as baselines.
Additionally, we conduct a robustness test to evaluate the resilience of the
proposed NEAT algorithms. The results show that the two proposed strategies
deliver improved performance, characterized by (1) a higher accumulated reward
within a finite number of time steps; (2) using fewer episodes to solve
problems in targeted environments, and (3) maintaining adaptive robustness
under noisy perturbations, which outperform the baselines in all tested cases.
Our analysis also demonstrates that RET expends potential future research
directions in dynamic environments. Code is available from
https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/ReverseEncodingTree.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The massively parallel nature of biological information processing plays an
important role for its superiority to human-engineered computing devices. In
particular, it may hold the key to overcoming the von Neumann bottleneck that
limits contemporary computer architectures. Physical-model neuromorphic devices
seek to replicate not only this inherent parallelism, but also aspects of its
microscopic dynamics in analog circuits emulating neurons and synapses.
However, these machines require network models that are not only adept at
solving particular tasks, but that can also cope with the inherent
imperfections of analog substrates. We present a spiking network model that
performs Bayesian inference through sampling on the BrainScaleS neuromorphic
platform, where we use it for generative and discriminative computations on
visual data. By illustrating its functionality on this platform, we implicitly
demonstrate its robustness to various substrate-specific distortive effects, as
well as its accelerated capability for computation. These results showcase the
advantages of brain-inspired physical computation and provide important
building blocks for large-scale neuromorphic applications.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Cerebellar Development and Circuit Maturation: A Common Framework for Spinocerebellar Ataxias</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) affect the cerebellum and its afferent and efferent systems that degenerate during disease progression. In the cerebellum, Purkinje cells (PCs) are the most vulnerable and their prominent loss in the late phase of the pathology is the main characteristic of these neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the constant advancement in the discovery of affected molecules and cellular pathways, a comprehensive description of the events leading to the development of motor impairment and degeneration is still lacking. However, in the last years the possible causal role for altered cerebellar development and neuronal circuit wiring in SCAs has been emerging. Not only wiring and synaptic transmission deficits are a common trait of SCAs, but also preventing the expression of the mutant protein during cerebellar development seems to exert a protective role. By discussing this tight relationship between cerebellar development and SCAs, in this review, we aim to highlight the importance of cerebellar circuitry for the investigation of SCAs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Gene Expression Dynamics at the Neurovascular Unit During Early Regeneration After Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With increasing distribution of endovascular stroke therapies, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in mice now more than ever depicts a relevant patient population with recanalized M1 occlusion. In this case, the desired therapeutic effect of blood flow restauration is accompanied by breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and secondary reperfusion injury. The aim of this study was to elucidate short and intermediate-term transcriptional patterns and the involved pathways covering the different cellular players at the neurovascular unit after transient large vessel occlusion. To achieve this, male C57Bl/6J mice were treated according to an intensive post-stroke care protocol after 60 min occlusion of the middle cerebral artery or sham surgery to allow a high survival rate. After 24 h or 7 days, RNA from microvessel fragments from the ipsilateral and the contralateral hemispheres was isolated and used for mRNA sequencing. Bioinformatic analyses allowed us to depict gene expression changes at two timepoints of neurovascular post-stroke injury and regeneration. We validated our dataset by quantitative real time PCR of BBB-associated targets with well-characterized post-stroke dynamics. Hence, this study provides a well-controlled transcriptome dataset of a translationally relevant mouse model 24 h and 7 days after stroke which might help to discover future therapeutic targets in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stimulation of the pineal gland via its sympathetic innervation pathway results in the production of N-acetylserotonin and melatonin. Melatonin has many therapeutic roles and is heavily implicated in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. In addition, N-acetylserotonin has recently been reported to promote neurogenesis in the brain. Upregulation of these indoleamines is possible via neuromodulation of the pineal gland. This is achieved by electrical stimulation of structures or fibres in the pineal gland sympathetic innervation pathway. Many studies have performed such pineal neuromodulation using both invasive and non-invasive methods. However, the effects of various experimental variables and stimulation paradigms has not yet been reviewed and evaluated. This review summarises these studies and presents the optimal experimental protocols and stimulation parameters necessary for maximal upregulation of melatonin metabolic output.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Illuminating Relationships Between the Pre- and Post-synapse</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Excitatory synapses in the mammalian cortex are highly diverse, both in terms of their structure and function. However, relationships between synaptic features indicate they are highly coordinated entities. Imaging techniques, that enable physiology at the resolution of individual synapses to be investigated, have allowed the presynaptic activity level of the synapse to be related to postsynaptic function. This approach has revealed that neuronal activity induces the pre- and post-synapse to be functionally correlated and that subsets of synapses are more susceptible to certain forms of synaptic plasticity. As presynaptic function is often examined in isolation from postsynaptic properties, the effect it has on the post-synapse is not fully understood. However, since postsynaptic receptors at excitatory synapses respond to release of glutamate, it follows that they may be differentially regulated depending on the frequency of its release. Therefore, examining postsynaptic properties in the context of presynaptic function may be a useful way to approach a broad range of questions on synaptic physiology. In this review, we focus on how optophysiology tools have been utilized to study relationships between the pre- and the post-synapse. Multiple imaging techniques have revealed correlations in synaptic properties from the submicron to the dendritic level. Optical tools together with advanced imaging techniques are ideally suited to illuminate this area further, due to the spatial resolution and control they allow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Astrocytes Are Required for Oligodendrocyte Survival and Maintenance of Myelin Compaction and Integrity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00074</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00074</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes have been implicated in regulating oligodendrocyte development and myelination in vitro, although their functions in vivo remain less well defined. Using a novel approach to locally ablate GFAP+ astrocytes, we demonstrate that astrocytes are required for normal CNS myelin compaction during development, and for maintaining myelin integrity in the adult. Transient ablation of GFAP+ astrocytes in the mouse spinal cord during the first postnatal week reduced the numbers of mature oligodendrocytes and inhibited myelin formation, while prolonged ablation resulted in myelin that lacked compaction and structural integrity. Ablation of GFAP+ astrocytes in the adult spinal cord resulted in the rapid, local loss of myelin integrity and regional demyelination. The loss of myelin integrity induced by astrocyte ablation was greatly reduced by NMDA receptor antagonists, both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that myelin stability was affected by elevation of local glutamate levels following astrocyte ablation. Furthermore, targeted delivery of glutamate into adult spinal cord white matter resulted in reduction of myelin basic protein expression and localized disruption of myelin compaction which was also reduced by NMDA receptor blockade. The pathology induced by localized astrocyte loss and elevated exogenous glutamate, supports the concept that astrocytes are critical for maintenance of myelin integrity in the adult CNS and may be primary targets in the initiation of demyelinating diseases of the CNS, such as Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;To examine whether the influence of hypertension (HTN) status on longitudinal changes in brain glucose metabolism was modified by the apolipoprotein 4 (APOE4) status among older people with normal cognition.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In this study, we included 217 older individuals with normal cognition from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Participants were divided into the HTN and no HTN groups based on self-reported medical history. Brain glucose metabolism was assessed by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Linear mixed model was fitted to examine the association between the HTN × APOE4 interaction and longitudinal changes in brain glucose metabolism after controlling for several covariates.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In the present study, we found that the association between HTN status and longitudinal changes in brain glucose metabolism varied as a function of the APOE4 status, such that the HTN/APOE4+ group showed a steeper decline in FDG SUVR than all other groups (No HTN/APOE4-, HTN/APOE4-, and No HTN/APOE4+). Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in the rate of decline in FDG SUVR among other groups (No HTN/APOE4-, HTN/APOE4-, and No HTN/APOE4+).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The APOE4 genotype interacted with hypertension status to affect longitudinal changes in brain glucose metabolism among older individual with normal cognition, such that the HTN/APOE4+ group showed a steeper decline in FDG SUVR than other groups.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Identifying the immune interactions underlying HLA class I disease associations</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54558</link>
	<description>Variation in the risk and severity of many autoimmune diseases, malignancies and infections is strongly associated with polymorphisms in the HLA class I loci. These genetic associations provide a powerful opportunity for understanding the etiology of human disease. HLA class I associations are often interpreted in the light of 'protective' or 'detrimental' CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell responses which are restricted by the host HLA class I allotype. However, given the diverse receptors which are bound by HLA class I molecules, alternative interpretations are possible. As well as binding T cell receptors on CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, HLA class I molecules are important ligands for inhibitory and activating killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) which are found on natural killer cells and some T cells; for the CD94:NKG2 family of receptors also expressed mainly by NK cells and for leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRs) on myeloid cells. The aim of this study is to develop an immunogenetic approach for identifying and quantifying the relative contribution of different receptor-ligand interactions to a given HLA class I disease association and then to use this approach to investigate the immune interactions underlying HLA class I disease associations in three viral infections: Human T cell Leukemia Virus type 1, Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 and Hepatitis C Virus as well as in the inflammatory condition Crohn's disease.</description>

	<description>The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is a unique brain region maintaining neural stem cells (NCSs) and neurogenesis into adulthood. We used multiphoton imaging to visualize for genetically defined progenitor subpopulations in live slices across key stages of mouse DG development testing decades old static models of DG formation, with molecular identification, genetic-lineage tracing, and mutant analyses. We found novel progenitor migrations, timings, dynamic cell-cell interactions, signaling activities, and routes underlie mosaic DG formation. Intermediate progenitors (IPs, Tbr2+) pioneered migrations, supporting and guiding later emigrating NSCs (Sox9+) through multiple transient zones prior to converging at the nascent outer adult niche in a dynamic settling process, generating all prenatal and postnatal granule neurons in defined spatiotemporal order. IPs (Dll1+) extensively targeted contacts to mitotic NSCs (Notch active), revealing a substrate for cell-cell contact support during migrations, a developmental feature maintained in adults. Mouse DG formation shares conserved features of human neocortical expansion.</description>

	<description>Protein turnover, the net result of protein synthesis and degradation, enables cells to remodel their proteomes in response to internal and external cues. Previously, we analyzed protein turnover rates in cultured brain cells under basal neuronal activity and found that protein turnover is influenced by subcellular localization, protein function, complex association, cell type of origin, and by the cellular environment (Dörrbaum et al., 2018). Here, we advanced our experimental approach to quantify changes in protein synthesis and degradation, as well as the resulting changes in protein turnover or abundance in rat primary hippocampal cultures during homeostatic scaling. Our data demonstrate that a large fraction of the neuronal proteome shows changes in protein synthesis and/or degradation during homeostatic up- and down-scaling. More than half of the quantified synaptic proteins were regulated, including pre- as well as postsynaptic proteins with diverse molecular functions.</description>

	<description>Proper function and repair of the digestive system are vital to most animals. Deciphering the mechanisms involved in these processes requires an atlas of gene expression and cell types. Here, we applied laser-capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA-seq to characterize the intestinal transcriptome of &lt;i&gt;Schmidtea mediterranea&lt;/i&gt;, a planarian flatworm that can regenerate all organs, including the gut. We identified hundreds of genes with intestinal expression undetected by previous approaches. Systematic analyses revealed extensive conservation of digestive physiology and cell types with other animals, including humans. Furthermore, spatial LCM enabled us to uncover previously unappreciated regionalization of gene expression in the planarian intestine along the medio-lateral axis, especially among intestinal goblet cells. Finally, we identified two intestine-enriched transcription factors that specifically regulate regeneration (hedgehog signaling effector &lt;i&gt;gli-1&lt;/i&gt;) or maintenance (&lt;i&gt;RREB2&lt;/i&gt;) of goblet cells. Altogether, this work provides resources for further investigation of mechanisms involved in gastrointestinal function, repair and regeneration.</description>

	<description>NLGN4X and NLGN4Y are thought to have similar functions due to their ∼97% shared amino acid identity. Nguyen et al. demonstrate NLGN4Y has a deficit in trafficking due to one amino acid difference. The trafficking deficit phenotype is also found in a cluster of autism-associated variants in NLGN4X near the critical amino acid.</description>

	<description>An infant's lack of verbal communication makes it challenging to infer their sensory and emotional experiences. Improving our interpretation of their perceptions will enhance our understanding of human brain development and improve the clinical care of infants. Multivariate neuroimaging signatures have been validated and developed in adults, which capture aspects of the human pain experience. Here we translate these fMRI signatures to infants in order to draw inferences about their experience of nociceptive events. We find that the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS), which reflects the nociceptive and intensity encoding aspects of pain experience, is consistently activated in a cohort of adults (n=10) and in two cohorts of infants (n=15 &amp;amp; n=22). However, evidence of higher-level cognitive modulation of the nociceptive input, characterised by the Stimulus Intensity Independent Pain Signature (SIIPS1), is observed in adults but not observed in infants. This study expands the use of brain signatures to infer and deconstruct the experience of pain in non-verbal populations and provides a framework to better understand the early development of human sensory and emotional experience.</description>

	<description>Line Bisection is a simple task frequently used in stroke patients to diagnose disorders of spatial attention characterized by a directional bisection bias to the ipsilesional side. However, previous anatomical and behavioural findings are contradictory, and its diagnostic validity has been challenged over the last decade. We hereby aimed to re-analyse the anatomical foundation of pathological line bisection by using multivariate lesion-symptom mapping and disconnection-symptom mapping based on support vector regression in a sample of 163 right hemispheric acute stroke patients. Cortical damage primarily to right parietal areas, particularly the inferior parietal lobe, including the angular gyrus, as well as damage to the right basal ganglia contributed to the pathology. Within the right hemisphere, affection of the superior longitudinal (I, II and III) and arcuate fasciculi as well as the internal capsule led to line bisection errors. Moreover, white matter affection of interhemispheric fibre bundles, such as the anterior commissure and posterior parts of the corpus callosum, projecting into the left hemisphere, seem to play a role predicting pathological deviation. Our results indicate that pathological line bisection is not only related to a focal lesion location, but also to remote disconnection induced by focal damage.</description>

	<description>Kinases are highly tractable drug targets that have reached unparalleled success in fields such as cancer but whose potential has not yet been realized in neuroscience. There are currently 55 approved small molecule kinase-targeting drugs, 48 of which have an anti-cancer indication. The intrinsic complexity linked to central nervous system (CNS) drug development and a lack of validated targets has hindered progress in developing kinase inhibitors for CNS disorders when compared to other therapeutic areas such as oncology. Identification and/or characterization of new kinases as potential drug targets for neurodegenerative diseases will create opportunities for development of CNS drugs in the future. The track record of kinase inhibitors in other disease indications supports the idea that with the best targets identified small molecule kinase modulators will become impactful therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The role of thickness inhomogeneities in hierarchical cortical folding</title>

	<description>The morphology of the mammalian brain cortex is highly folded. For long it has been known that specific patterns of folding are necessary for an optimally functioning brain. On the extremes, lissencephaly, a lack of folds in humans, and polymicrogyria, an overly folded brain, can lead to severe mental retardation, short life expectancy, epileptic seizures, and tetraplegia. The construction of a quantitative model on how and why these folds appear during the development of the brain is the first step in understanding the cause of these conditions. In recent years, there have been various attempts to understand and model the mechanisms of brain folding. Previous works have shown that mechanical instabilities play a crucial role in the formation of brain folds, and that the geometry of the fetal brain is one of the main factors in dictating the folding characteristics. However, modeling higher-order folding, one of the main characteristics of the highly gyrencephalic brain, has not been fully tackled. The effects of thickness inhomogeneity in the gyrogenesis of the mammalian brain are studied in silico. Finite-element simulations of rectangular slabs are performed. The slabs are divided into two distinct regions, where the outer layer mimics the gray matter, and the inner layer the underlying white matter. Differential growth is introduced by growing the top layer tangentially, while keeping the underlying layer untouched. The brain tissue is modeled as a neo-Hookean hyperelastic material. Simulations are performed with both, homogeneous and inhomogeneous cortical thickness. The homogeneous cortex is shown to fold into a single wavelength, as is common for bilayered materials, while the inhomogeneous cortex folds into more complex conformations. In the early stages of development of the inhomogeneous cortex, structures reminiscent of the deep sulci in the brain are obtained. As the cortex continues to develop, secondary undulations, which are shallower and more variable than the structures obtained in earlier gyrification stage emerge, reproducing well-known characteristics of higher-order folding in the mammalian, and particularly the human, brain.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Homeostatic scaling is driven by a translation-dependent degradation axis that recruits miRISC remodelling</title>

	<description>Homeostatic scaling in neurons involve substantial proteome remodelling. Although dynamic changes to the proteome have been attributed to either translational or degradative control individually, there remains a lack of insight towards understanding how the interplay between translation and degradation modules effectuate cellular proteostasis during scaling. Here, we report that a mutual co-dependence of the two apparatus drive synaptic homeostasis in an RNA-dependent manner. We observed that abrogation of either translation or proteasomal activity prevents homeostasis and delineated the spatial features of their association. Members of the translation apparatus such as eIF4E, active forms of p70S6 kinase and miRISC-associated MOV10 were found to remain spatially linked with subunits of the catalytically active 26S proteasome subunits such as Rpt1, Rpt3, Rpt6, 7 and E3 ligase Trim32 on polysomes. We identified that paradigms of chronic downscaling involve miRISC remodelling and entails the degradation of MOV10 via the mTOR-dependent translation of Trim32. miRISC remodelling alone is sufficient to invoke downscaling through the removal of post-synaptic AMPA receptors. Our finding proposes a multifaceted model, where synaptic scaling is regulated by compositional changes in the miRISC via protein-synthesis-driven protein degradation.</description>

	<description>A pause in firing of nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) neurons is critical for reward consumption; however, the substrate driving this pause is unknown. While ventral pallidal (VP) activity encodes reward value, the specific roles of VP subpopulations in computation and expression of this value are poorly understood. Here, we establish that inhibitory input from the VP is crucial for reward-related inhibition of NAc firing. A sparse, non-canonical subpopulation of VP neurons, the so-called ventral arkypallidal (vArky) neurons makes inhibitory synaptic contacts throughout the NAcSh, and drives inhibition of NAcSh neurons in vivo. Moreover, endogenous calcium activity of vArky neurons predicted subsequent reward consumption behavior, while optogenetically activating this pathway increased reward consumption by amplifying hedonic value of reward. Classically, the VP is considered downstream of the NAc; however, our results challenge this view and establish that vArky neurons in the VP promote reward consumption via potent modulation of NAcSh firing.</description>

	<description>A crucial role of cortical networks is the conversion of sensory inputs into perception. In the cortical somatosensory network, neurons of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) show invariant sensory responses, while frontal lobe neuron responses correlate with the animals perceptual behavior. But, where in the cortical somatosensory network are the sensory inputs transformed into perceptual behavior? Here, we report that in the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), neurons with invariant sensory responses coexist with neurons whose responses correlate with the animals perceptual behavior. These distinct neural responses exhibit analogous timescales of intrinsic fluctuations, suggesting that they belong to the same hierarchical processing stage. Furthermore, during a non-demanding control task, the sensory responses remained unaltered while perceptual responses vanished. Conclusively, the S2 population responses exhibit intermediate dynamics between S1 and frontal lobe neurons. These results suggest that the conversion of touch into perception crucially depends on S2.</description>

	<description>The neocortex is disproportionately expanded in human compared to mouse, both in its total volume relative to subcortical structures and in the proportion occupied by supragranular layers that selectively make connections within the cortex and other telencephalic structures. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses of human and mouse cortex show an increased diversity of glutamatergic neuron types in supragranular cortex in human and pronounced gradients as a function of cortical depth. To probe the functional and anatomical correlates of this transcriptomic diversity, we describe a robust Patch-seq platform using neurosurgically-resected human tissues. We characterize the morphological and physiological properties of five transcriptomically defined human glutamatergic supragranular neuron types. Three of these types have properties that are specialized compared to the more homogeneous properties of transcriptomically defined homologous mouse neuron types. The two remaining supragranular neuron types, located exclusively in deep layer 3, do not have clear mouse homologues in supragranular cortex but are transcriptionally most similar to deep layer mouse intratelencephalic-projecting neuron types. Furthermore, we reveal the transcriptomic types in deep layer 3 that express high levels of non-phosphorylated heavy chain neurofilament protein that labels long-range neurons known to be selectively depleted in Alzheimer's disease. Together, these results demonstrate the power of transcriptomic cell type classification, provide a mechanistic underpinning for increased complexity of cortical function in human cortical evolution, and implicate discrete transcriptomic cell types as selectively vulnerable in disease.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Serial integration of sensory evidence for perceptual decisions and oculomotor responses</title>

	<description>Perceptual decisions often require the integration of noisy sensory evidence over time. This process is formalized with sequential sampling models, where evidence is accumulated up to a decision threshold before a choice is made. Although classical accounts grounded in cognitive psychology tend to consider the process of decision formation and the preparation of the motor response as occurring serially, neurophysiological studies have proposed that decision formation and response preparation occur in parallel and are inseparable (Cisek, 2007; Shadlen et al., 2008). To address this serial vs. parallel debate, we developed a behavioural, reverse correlation protocol, in which the stimuli that influence perceptual decisions can be distinguished from the stimuli that influence motor responses. We show that the temporal integration windows supporting these two processes are distinct and largely non-overlapping, suggesting that they proceed in a serial or cascaded fashion.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Spacing spheroids, curl-up and coiled neuritic plexus of the sacral spinal cord of aged dog: Hypothesis based on continued NADPH diaphorase histological observations</title>

	<description>NADPH diaphorase (N-d) neurons distribute in spinal cord and function for visceral sensation and autonomic regulation. N-d positive neurons innervate pelvic organs. In previous investigation, we report that aging-related N-d body (ANB) in the lumbosacral spinal cord in aged rat and megaloneurite in the sacral spinal cord in aged dog. This article was a continued data report of aging-related N-d alterations in aged dog. N-d positivity in aged spinal cord has revealed a certain of morphological profiles in the spinal cord of several species. However, we still found some denoted N-d neurodegenerative changes that we failed to notice in our previous studies when re-examination of the sacral spinal cord of aged dog. In the horizontal section, spacing spheroids in the superficial laminae of the dorsal horn, curl-up and coiled neurites in the intermediate zone were detected in the sacral spinal cord. The ANB and vacuolar neurite were also detected. Vacuolar degeneration also occurred in the dorsal ganglia at the sacral segment. The curl-up and coiled neurites did not occur in the lumbothoracic segment, but the ANB and vacuolar neurite were scatteringly detected in in the lumbothoracic segment of aged dog. The results suggested that the N-d sensory inputs interrupted and disconnected with integration of autonomic centers and output circuits of regulating urogenital organs during the aging. These specialized profiles were speculated that the N-d neurite deterioration of visceral sensory circuit implicated dysfunction of pelvic organs in the aging. Megaloneurite and fiber dilation may make backward reasoning to N-d fiber architecture under normal condition.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: SARS-CoV-2 receptor and entry genes are expressed by sustentacular cells in the human olfactory neuroepithelium</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.31.013268v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The recent emergence of the pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 initiated a worldwide health crisis. The entry of the virus into cells is mediated by the binding of the viral Spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), followed by its priming by the TMPRSS2 serine protease, both present on the cellular membrane of the target cells. In the respiratory tract, these targets are ciliated cells. Interestingly, various reports indicate an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and anosmia, suggesting an alteration not restricted to the respiratory tissue, but that might also include the olfactory sensory epithelium. We explored this possibility by generating RNA-seq libraries from human neuroepithelium, in which we found significant expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. To determine whether specific cell types of this chemosensory tissue may coexpress both of the virus entry genes, we analyzed a scRNA-seq dataset. We determined that sustentacular cells, which are in direct contact with the external world and maintain the integrity of olfactory sensory neurons, represents a prime candidate for SARS-CoV-2 infection via the nose, and possibly for SARS-CoV-2-induced anosmia.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Inhibitory interactions between the visual and motor systems during optokinetic stimulation and simultaneous dynamic handgrip exercise</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.31.011734v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Objectives: Inhibitory interactions between the visual and motor systems have been observed during transient stimulation of either system. However, it is unknown how inhibition operates during simultaneous and continuous engagement of both systems. Methods: We presented right-handed participants (n = 14) with optokinetic stimulation (OKS), with and without a simultaneous dynamic handgrip exercise. We assessed the EEG upper-alpha band (10-12 Hz) to investigate inhibitory interactions, and explored their effect on optokinetic nystagmus (OKN). Results: OKS + handgrip simultaneously produced motor activation and visual inhibition, compared to OKS alone. Meanwhile, the velocity of OKN increased, selectively during left handgrips. OKS without handgrip produced simultaneous visual activation and motor inhibition compared to an open-eyes baseline. The open-eyes baseline itself increased motor peak-frequency towards the inhibitory upper-alpha range compared to closed eyes. Conclusions: Motor activation inhibited the visual system even during visual stimulation. This inhibition likely disrupted visual processing, triggering an OKN speed-up to relocate the OKS. Increasing visual input produces increasing motor inhibition. Significance: These observations extend previous results in standard settings and confirm the reliability of EEG in conditions involving nystagmus, important in clinical vestibular research. Visual inhibition through handgrip could be a candidate for developing rehabilitation from visually induced dizziness.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A systematic pipeline for classifying bacterial operons reveals the evolutionary landscape of biofilm machineries</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007721</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Cedoljub Bundalovic-Torma, Gregory B. Whitfield, Lindsey S. Marmont, P. Lynne Howell, John Parkinson&lt;/p&gt;

In bacteria functionally related genes comprising metabolic pathways and protein complexes are frequently encoded in operons and are widely conserved across phylogenetically diverse species. The evolution of these operon-encoded processes is affected by diverse mechanisms such as gene duplication, loss, rearrangement, and horizontal transfer. These mechanisms can result in functional diversification, increasing the potential evolution of novel biological pathways, and enabling pre-existing pathways to adapt to the requirements of particular environments. Despite the fundamental importance that these mechanisms play in bacterial environmental adaptation, a systematic approach for studying the evolution of operon organization is lacking. Herein, we present a novel method to study the evolution of operons based on phylogenetic clustering of operon-encoded protein families and genomic-proximity network visualizations of operon architectures. We applied this approach to study the evolution of the synthase dependent exopolysaccharide (EPS) biosynthetic systems: cellulose, acetylated cellulose, poly-β-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (PNAG), Pel, and alginate. These polymers have important roles in biofilm formation, antibiotic tolerance, and as virulence factors in opportunistic pathogens. Our approach revealed the complex evolutionary landscape of EPS machineries, and enabled operons to be classified into evolutionarily distinct lineages. Cellulose operons show phyla-specific operon lineages resulting from gene loss, rearrangement, and the acquisition of accessory loci, and the occurrence of whole-operon duplications arising through horizonal gene transfer. Our evolution-based classification also distinguishes between PNAG production from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria on the basis of structural and functional evolution of the acetylation modification domains shared by PgaB and IcaB loci, respectively. We also predict several &lt;i&gt;pel&lt;/i&gt;-like operon lineages in Gram-positive bacteria and demonstrate in our companion paper (Whitfield &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt; PLoS Pathogens, in press) that &lt;i&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/i&gt; produces a Pel-dependent biofilm that is regulated by cyclic-3’,5’-dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/V0mOj-urAFQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Despite over a century of intensive efforts, the great gains promised by the War on Cancer nearly 50 years ago have not materialized. Since 1999, we have analyzed the lack of progress in explaining and “curing” cancer by examining the merits of the premises that determine how cancer is understood and treated. Our ongoing critical analyses have aimed at clarifying the sources of misunderstandings at the root of the cancer puzzle while providing a plausible and comprehensive biomedical perspective as well as a new theory of carcinogenesis that is compatible with evolutionary theory. In this essay, we explain how this new theory, the tissue organization field theory (TOFT), can help chart a path to progress for cancer researchers by explaining features of cancer that remain unexplainable from the perspective of the still hegemonic somatic mutation theory (SMT) and its variants. Of equal significance, the premises underlying the TOFT offer new perspectives on basic biological phenomena.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/d3ENxC6IJQE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Extra‐axial inflammatory signal in parameninges in migraine with visual aura</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25731?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25731?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortical spreading depression (CSD) underlies the neurobiology of migraine with aura (MWA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal studies reveal networks of microvessels linking brain‐meninges‐bone marrow. CSD activates the trigeminovascular system, evoking a meningeal inflammatory response. Accordingly, this study examines the upregulation of an inflammatory marker in extra‐axial tissues in migraine with visual aura.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used simultaneously acquired &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C‐PBR28 PET/MRI data of 18 kDa translocator protein (an inflammatory marker) in MWA patients (n = 11) who experienced headaches and visual aura in the preceding month. We measured mean tracer uptake (SUVR) in four regions of interest comprising the meninges plus the adjacent overlying skull bone (parameningeal tissues, PMT). These data were compared to healthy controls and patients with pain (chronic low‐back pain, CLBP).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MWA had significantly higher mean SUVR in PMT overlying occipital cortex than both other groups, though not in the PMT overlying three other cortical areas. A positive correlation was also found between the number of visual auras and tracer uptake in occipital PMT.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong persistent extra‐axial inflammatory signal was found in meninges and calvarial bone overlying the occipital lobe in migraine with visual auras. Our findings are reminiscent of CSD‐induced meningeal inflammation and provide the first imaging evidence implicating inflammation in the pathophysiology of migraine meningeal symptoms. We suspect that this inflammatory focus results from a signal that migrates from underlying brain and if so, may implicate newly discovered bridging vessels that crosstalk between brain and skull marrow, a finding of potential relevance to migraine plus other neuroinflammatory brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Science Advances: Molecular targeting of FATP4 transporter for oral delivery of therapeutic peptide</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaba0145?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaba0145?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Low oral bioavailability of peptide drugs has limited their application to parenteral administration, which suffers from poor patient compliance. Here, we show that molecular targeting of the FATP4 transporter is an effective approach to specifically transport long-chain fatty acid (LCFA)–conjugated peptides across the enterocytic membrane and, thus, enables oral delivery of drug peptides. We packaged LCFA-conjugated exendin-4 (LCFA-Ex4) into liposomes and coated with chitosan nanoparticles to form an orally deliverable Ex4 (OraEx4). OraEx4 protected LCFA-Ex4 from damage by the gastric fluid and released LCFA-Ex4 in the intestinal cavity, where LCFA-Ex4 was transported across the enterocyte membrane by the FAPT4 transporter. OraEx4 had a high bioavailability of 24.8% with respect to subcutaneous injection and exhibited a substantial hypoglycemic effect in murine models of diabetes mellitus. Thus, molecular targeting of the FATP4 transporter enhances oral absorption of therapeutic peptides and provides a platform for oral peptide drug development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science Advances: Pretargeted delivery of PI3K/mTOR small-molecule inhibitor-loaded nanoparticles for treatment of non-Hodgkins lymphoma</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Overactivation of the PI3K/mTOR signaling has been identified in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. BEZ235 is an effective dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, but it was withdrawn from early-phase clinical trials owing to poor solubility and on-target/off-tumor toxicity. Here, we developed a nanoparticle (NP)–based pretargeted system for the therapeutic delivery of BEZ235 to CD20- and HLA-DR–expressing lymphoma cells for targeted therapy. The pretargeted system is composed of dibenzocyclooctyne-functionalized anti-CD20 and anti-Lym1 antibodies as the tumor-targeting components and azide-functionalized BEZ235-encapsulated NPs as the effector drug carrier. Using lymphoma cell lines with different CD20 and HLA-DR antigen densities as examples, we demonstrate that the dual antibody pretargeted strategy effectively raises the number of NPs retained on the target tumor cells and improves the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of BEZ235 through the inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway. Our data demonstrate that the NP-based pretargeted system improves the therapeutic window of small-molecule kinase inhibitor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no methods available offering solutions to select and identify antibodies binding to a specific conformational epitope of an antigen. Here, we developed a method to allow epitope-directed antibody selection from a phage display library by photocrosslinking bound antibodies to a site that specifically incorporates a noncanonical amino acid, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (pBpa), on the target antigen epitope. By one or two rounds of panning against antibody phage display libraries, those hits that covalently bind to the proximity site of pBpa on specific epitopes of target antigens after ultraviolet irradiation are enriched and selected. This method was applied to specific epitopes on human interleukin-1β and complement 5a. In both cases, more than one-third of hits identified bind to the target epitopes, demonstrating the feasibility and versatility of this method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many viruses are known to form cellular compartments, also called viral factories. Paramyxoviruses, including measles virus, colocalize their proteomic and genomic material in puncta in infected cells. We demonstrate that purified nucleoproteins (N) and phosphoproteins (P) of measles virus form liquid-like membraneless organelles upon mixing in vitro. We identify weak interactions involving intrinsically disordered domains of N and P that are implicated in this process, one of which is essential for phase separation. Fluorescence allows us to follow the modulation of the dynamics of N and P upon droplet formation, while NMR is used to investigate the thermodynamics of this process. RNA colocalizes to droplets, where it triggers assembly of N protomers into nucleocapsid-like particles that encapsidate the RNA. The rate of encapsidation within droplets is enhanced compared to the dilute phase, revealing one of the roles of liquid-liquid phase separation in measles virus replication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science Advances: Australopithecus afarensis endocasts suggest ape-like brain organization and prolonged brain growth</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human brains are three times larger, are organized differently, and mature for a longer period of time than those of our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees. Together, these characteristics are important for human cognition and social behavior, but their evolutionary origins remain unclear. To study brain growth and organization in the hominin species &lt;i&gt;Australopithecus afarensis&lt;/i&gt; more than 3 million years ago, we scanned eight fossil crania using conventional and synchrotron computed tomography. We inferred key features of brain organization from endocranial imprints and explored the pattern of brain growth by combining new endocranial volume estimates with narrow age at death estimates for two infants. Contrary to previous claims, sulcal imprints reveal an ape-like brain organization and no features derived toward humans. A comparison of infant to adult endocranial volumes indicates protracted brain growth in &lt;i&gt;A. afarensis&lt;/i&gt;, likely critical for the evolution of a long period of childhood learning in hominins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science Advances: MAP6 is an intraluminal protein that induces neuronal microtubules to coil</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaaz4344?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal activities depend heavily on microtubules, which shape neuronal processes and transport myriad molecules within them. Although constantly remodeled through growth and shrinkage events, neuronal microtubules must be sufficiently stable to maintain nervous system wiring. This stability is somehow maintained by various microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), but little is known about how these proteins work. Here, we show that MAP6, previously known to confer cold stability to microtubules, promotes growth. More unexpectedly, MAP6 localizes in the lumen of microtubules, induces the microtubules to coil into a left-handed helix, and forms apertures in the lattice, likely to relieve mechanical stress. These features have not been seen in microtubules before and could play roles in maintaining axonal width or providing flexibility in the face of compressive forces during development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science Advances: Designer, injectable gels to prevent transplanted Schwann cell loss during spinal cord injury therapy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transplantation of patient-derived Schwann cells is a promising regenerative medicine therapy for spinal cord injuries; however, therapeutic efficacy is compromised by inefficient cell delivery. We present a materials-based strategy that addresses three common causes of transplanted cell death: (i) membrane damage during injection, (ii) cell leakage from the injection site, and (iii) apoptosis due to loss of endogenous matrix. Using protein engineering and peptide-based assembly, we designed injectable hydrogels with modular cell-adhesive and mechanical properties. In a cervical contusion model, our hydrogel matrix resulted in a greater than 700% improvement in successful Schwann cell transplantation. The combination therapy of cells and gel significantly improved the spatial distribution of transplanted cells within the endogenous tissue. A reduction in cystic cavitation and neuronal loss were also observed with substantial increases in forelimb strength and coordination. Using an injectable hydrogel matrix, therefore, can markedly improve the outcomes of cellular transplantation therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science Advances: A multifunctional surfactant catalyst inspired by hydrolases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaaz0404?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaaz0404?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The remarkable power of enzymes to undertake catalysis frequently stems from their grouping of multiple, complementary chemical units within close proximity around the enzyme active site. Motivated by this, we report here a bioinspired surfactant catalyst that incorporates a variety of chemical functionalities common to hydrolytic enzymes. The textbook hydrolase active site, the catalytic triad, is modeled by positioning the three groups of the triad (-OH, -imidazole, and -CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H) on a single, trifunctional surfactant molecule. To support this, we recreate the hydrogen bond donating arrangement of the oxyanion hole by imparting surfactant functionality to a guanidinium headgroup. Self-assembly of these amphiphiles in solution drives the collection of functional headgroups into close proximity around a hydrophobic nano-environment, affording hydrolysis of a model ester at rates that challenge α-chymotrypsin. Structural assessment via NMR and XRD, paired with MD simulation and QM calculation, reveals marked similarities of the co-micelle catalyst to native enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a highly dynamic network of membranes. Here, we combine live-cell microscopy with in situ cryo–electron tomography to directly visualize ER dynamics in several secretory cell types including pancreatic β-cells and neurons under near-native conditions. Using these imaging approaches, we identify a novel, mobile form of ER, ribosome-associated vesicles (RAVs), found primarily in the cell periphery, which is conserved across different cell types and species. We show that RAVs exist as distinct, highly dynamic structures separate from the intact ER reticular architecture that interact with mitochondria via direct intermembrane contacts. These findings describe a new ER subcompartment within cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science Advances: Biomechanical simulations reveal a trade-off between adaptation to glacial climate and dietary niche versatility in European cave bears</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cave bear is one of the best known extinct large mammals that inhabited Europe during the &quot;Ice Age,&quot; becoming extinct 24,000 years ago along with other members of the Pleistocene megafauna. Long-standing hypotheses speculate that many cave bears died during their long hibernation periods, which were necessary to overcome the severe and prolonged winters of the Last Glacial. Here, we investigate how long hibernation periods in cave bears would have directly affected their feeding biomechanics using CT-based biomechanical simulations of skulls of cave and extant bears. Our results demonstrate that although large paranasal sinuses were necessary for, and consistent with, long hibernation periods, trade-offs in sinus-associated cranial biomechanical traits restricted cave bears to feed exclusively on low energetic vegetal resources during the predormancy period. This biomechanical trade-off constitutes a new key factor to mechanistically explain the demise of this dominant Pleistocene megafaunal species as a direct consequence of climate cooling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science Advances: There is no liberal media bias in which news stories political journalists choose to cover</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Is the media biased against conservatives? Although a dominant majority of journalists identify as liberals/Democrats and many Americans and public officials frequently decry supposedly high and increasing levels of media bias, little compelling evidence exists as to (i) the ideological or partisan leanings of the many journalists who fail to answer surveys and/or identify as independents and (ii) whether journalists’ political leanings bleed into the choice of which stories to cover that Americans ultimately consume. Using a unique combination of a large-scale survey of political journalists, data from journalists’ Twitter networks, election returns, a large-scale correspondence experiment, and a conjoint survey experiment, we show definitively that the media exhibits no bias against conservatives (or liberals for that matter) in what news that they choose to cover. This shows that journalists’ individual ideological leanings have unexpectedly little effect on the vitally important, but, up to this point, unexplored, early stage of political news generation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science Advances: Force-induced gene up-regulation does not follow the weak power law but depends on H3K9 demethylation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mechanical forces play important roles in development, physiology, and diseases, but how force is transduced into gene transcription remains elusive. Here, we show that transcription of transgene &lt;i&gt;DHFR&lt;/i&gt; or endogenous genes &lt;i&gt;egr-1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cav1&lt;/i&gt; is rapidly up-regulated in response to cyclic forces applied via integrins at low frequencies but not at 100 Hz. Gene up-regulation does not follow the weak power law with force frequency. Force-induced transcription up-regulation at the nuclear interior is associated with demethylation of histone H3 lysine-9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), whereas no transcription up-regulation near the nuclear periphery is associated with H3K9me3 that inhibits Pol II recruitment to the promoter site. H3K9me3 demethylation induces Pol II recruitment and increases force-induced transcription of &lt;i&gt;egr-1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cav1&lt;/i&gt; at the nuclear interior and activates mechano-nonresponsive gene &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; near the nuclear periphery, whereas H3K9me3 hypermethylation has opposite effects. Our findings demonstrate that rapid up-regulation of endogenous mechanoresponsive genes depends on H3K9me3 demethylation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science Advances: ENL initiates multivalent phase separation of the super elongation complex (SEC) in controlling rapid transcriptional activation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Release of paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II) requires incorporation of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) into the super elongation complex (SEC), thus resulting in rapid yet synchronous transcriptional activation. However, the mechanism underlying dynamic transition of P-TEFb from inactive to active state remains unclear. Here, we found that the SEC components are able to compartmentalize and concentrate P-TEFb via liquid-liquid phase separation from the soluble inactive HEXIM1 containing the P-TEFb complex. Specifically, ENL or its intrinsically disordered region is sufficient to initiate the liquid droplet formation of SEC. AFF4 functions together with ENL in fluidizing SEC droplets. SEC droplets are fast and dynamically formed upon serum exposure and required for rapid transcriptional induction. We also found that the fusion of ENL with MLL can boost SEC phase separation. In summary, our results suggest a critical role of multivalent phase separation of SEC in controlling transcriptional pause release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science Advances: The unconventional biogenesis of Kv7.1-KCNE1 complexes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaay4472?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaay4472?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The potassium channel Kv7.1 associates with the KCNE1 regulatory subunit to trigger cardiac &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Ks&lt;/sub&gt; currents. Although the Kv7.1/KCNE1 complex has received much attention, the subcellular compartment hosting the assembly is the subject of ongoing debate. Evidence suggests that the complex forms either earlier in the endoplasmic reticulum or directly at the plasma membrane. Kv7.1 and KCNE1 mutations, responsible for long QT syndromes, impair association and traffic, thereby altering &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Ks&lt;/sub&gt; currents. We found that Kv7.1 and KCNE1 do not assemble in the first stages of their biogenesis. Data support an unconventional secretory pathway for Kv7.1-KCNE1 that bypasses Golgi. This route targets channels to endoplasmic reticulum–plasma membrane junctions, where Kv7.1-KCNE1 assemble. This mechanism helps to resolve the ongoing controversy about the subcellular compartment hosting the association. Our results also provide new insights into &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Ks&lt;/sub&gt; channel localization at endoplasmic reticulum–plasma membrane junctions, highlighting an alternative anterograde trafficking mechanism for oligomeric ion channels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science Advances: IL-27 signaling activates skin cells to induce innate antiviral proteins and protects against Zika virus infection</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the skin, antiviral proteins and other immune molecules serve as the first line of innate antiviral defense. Here, we identify and characterize the induction of cutaneous innate antiviral proteins in response to IL-27 and its functional role during cutaneous defense against Zika virus infection. Transcriptional and phenotypic profiling of epidermal keratinocytes treated with IL-27 demonstrated activation of antiviral proteins OAS1, OAS2, OASL, and MX1 in the skin of both mice and humans. IL-27–mediated antiviral protein induction was found to occur in a STAT1- and IRF3-dependent but STAT2-independent manner. Moreover, using IL27ra mice, we demonstrate a significant role for IL-27 in inhibiting Zika virus morbidity and mortality following cutaneous, but not intravenous, inoculation. Together, our results demonstrate a critical and previously unrecognized role for IL-27 in cutaneous innate antiviral immunity against Zika virus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science Advances: A chemically unmodified agonistic DNA with growth factor functionality for in vivo therapeutic application</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although growth factors have great therapeutic potential because of their regenerative functions, they often have intrinsic drawbacks, such as low thermal stability and high production cost. Oligonucleotides have recently emerged as promising chemical entities for designing synthetic alternatives to growth factors. However, their applications in vivo have been recognized as a challenge because of their susceptibility to nucleases and limited distribution to a target tissue. Here, we present the first example of oligonucleotide-based growth factor mimetics that exerts therapeutic effects at a target tissue after systemic injection. The aptamer was designed to dimerize a growth factor receptor for its activation and mitigated the progression of Fas-induced fulminant hepatitis in a mouse model. This unprecedented functionality of the aptamer can be reasonably explained by its high nuclease stability and migration to the liver parenchyma. These mechanistic analyses provided insights for the successful application of aptamer-based receptor agonists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science Advances: B cell Sirt1 deacetylates histone and non-histone proteins for epigenetic modulation of AID expression and the antibody response</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaay2793?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaay2793?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) mediates immunoglobulin class switch DNA recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM), critical processes for maturation of the antibody response. Epigenetic factors, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs), would underpin B cell differentiation stage–specific AID expression. Here, we showed that NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent class III HDAC sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) is highly expressed in resting B cells and down-regulated by stimuli inducing AID. B cell Sirt1 down-regulation, deprivation of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cofactor, or genetic Sirt1 deletion reduced deacetylation of &lt;i&gt;Aicda&lt;/i&gt; promoter histones, Dnmt1, and nuclear factor–B (NF-B) p65 and increased AID expression. This promoted class-switched and hypermutated T-dependent and T-independent antibody responses or led to generation of autoantibodies. Genetic Sirt1 overexpression, Sirt1 boost by NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or allosteric Sirt1 enhancement by SRT1720 repressed AID expression and CSR/SHM. By deacetylating histone and nonhistone proteins (Dnmt1 and NF-B p65), Sirt1 transduces metabolic cues into epigenetic changes to play an important B cell–intrinsic role in modulating antibody and autoantibody responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Virus-microbe interactions in the ocean are commonly described by &quot;boom and bust&quot; dynamics, whereby a numerically dominant microorganism is lysed and replaced by a virus-resistant one. Here, we isolated a microalga strain and its infective dsDNA virus whose dynamics are characterized instead by parallel growth of both the microalga and the virus. Experimental evolution of clonal lines revealed that this viral production originates from the lysis of a minority of virus-susceptible cells, which are regenerated from resistant cells. Whole-genome sequencing demonstrated that this resistant-susceptible switch involved a large deletion on one chromosome. Mathematical modeling explained how the switch maintains stable microalga-virus population dynamics consistent with their observed growth pattern. Comparative genomics confirmed an ancient origin of this &quot;accordion&quot; chromosome despite a lack of sequence conservation. Together, our results show how dynamic genomic rearrangements may account for a previously overlooked coexistence mechanism in microalgae-virus interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science Advances: Parallel PRC2/cPRC1 and vPRC1 pathways silence lineage-specific genes and maintain self-renewal in mouse embryonic stem cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaax5692?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The transcriptional repressors Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and PRC2 are required to maintain cell fate during embryonic development. PRC1 and PRC2 catalyze distinct histone modifications, establishing repressive chromatin at shared targets. How PRC1, which consists of canonical PRC1 (cPRC1) and variant PRC1 (vPRC1) complexes, and PRC2 cooperate to silence genes and support mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) self-renewal is unclear. Using combinatorial genetic perturbations, we show that independent pathways of cPRC1 and vPRC1 are responsible for maintenance of H2A monoubiquitylation and silencing of shared target genes. Individual loss of PRC2-dependent cPRC1 or PRC2-independent vPRC1 disrupts only one pathway and does not impair mESC self-renewal capacity. However, loss of both pathways leads to mESC differentiation and activation of a subset of lineage-specific genes co-occupied by relatively high levels of PRC1/PRC2. Thus, parallel pathways explain the differential requirements for PRC1 and PRC2 and provide robust silencing of lineage-specific genes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recurrent &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; infections are common, despite robust immune responses. &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; infection elicited protective antibody and T cell responses in mice that expressed the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) of the H-2&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; haplotype, but not H-2&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;, demonstrating that host genetics drives individual variability. Vaccination with a-toxin or leukotoxin E (LukE) elicited similar antibody and T cell responses in mice expressing H-2&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; or H-2&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;, but vaccine-elicited responses were inhibited by concomitant infection in H-2&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;–expressing mice. These findings suggested that competitive binding of microbial peptides to host MHC proteins determines the specificity of the immunodominant response, which was confirmed using LukE-derived peptide-MHC tetramers. A vaccine that elicited T cell and antibody responses protected mice that expressed H-2&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; or H-2&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;, demonstrating that vaccination can overcome MHC-restricted immunodominance. Together, these results define how host genetics determine whether immunity elicted by &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; is protective and provide a mechanistic roadmap for future vaccine design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Paired Associative Stimulation Fails to Induce Plasticity in Freely Behaving Intact Rats</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Paired associative stimulation (PAS) has been explored in humans as a noninvasive tool to drive plasticity and promote recovery after neurologic insult. A more thorough understanding of PAS-induced plasticity is needed to fully harness it as a clinical tool. Here, we tested the efficacy of PAS with multiple interstimulus intervals in an awake rat model to study the principles of associative plasticity. Using chronically implanted electrodes in motor cortex and forelimb, we explored PAS parameters to effectively drive plasticity. We assessed changes in corticomotor excitability using a closed-loop, EMG-controlled cortical stimulation paradigm. We tested 11 PAS intervals, chosen to force the coincidence of neuronal activity in the motor cortex and spinal cord of rats with timings relevant to the principles of Hebbian spike timing-dependent plasticity. However, despite a relatively large number of stimulus pairings (300), none of the tested intervals reliably changed corticospinal excitability relative to control conditions. Our results question PAS effectiveness under these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Microglial Depletion with CSF1R Inhibitor During Chronic Phase of Experimental Traumatic Brain Injury Reduces Neurodegeneration and Neurological Deficits</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2960?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic neuroinflammation with sustained microglial activation occurs following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is believed to contribute to subsequent neurodegeneration and neurological deficits. Microglia, the primary innate immune cells in brain, are dependent on colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling for their survival. In this preclinical study, we examined the effects of delayed depletion of chronically activated microglia on functional recovery and neurodegeneration up to 3 months postinjury. A CSF1R inhibitor, Plexxikon (PLX) 5622, was administered to adult male C57BL/6J mice at 1 month after controlled cortical impact to remove chronically activated microglia, and the inhibitor was withdrawn 1-week later to allow for microglial repopulation. Following TBI, the repopulated microglia displayed a ramified morphology similar to that of Sham uninjured mice, whereas microglia in vehicle-treated TBI mice showed the typical chronic posttraumatic hypertrophic morphology. PLX5622 treatment limited TBI-associated neuropathological changes at 3 months postinjury; these included a smaller cortical lesion, reduced hippocampal neuron cell death, and decreased NOX2- and NLRP3 inflammasome-associated neuroinflammation. Furthermore, delayed depletion of chronically activated microglia after TBI led to widespread changes in the cortical transcriptome and altered gene pathways involved in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuroplasticity. Using a variety of complementary neurobehavioral tests, PLX5622-treated TBI mice also had improved long-term motor and cognitive function recovery through 3 months postinjury. Together, these studies demonstrate that chronic phase removal of neurotoxic microglia after TBI using CSF1R inhibitors markedly reduce chronic neuroinflammation and associated neurodegeneration, as well as related motor and cognitive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a debilitating neurological disorder that can seriously impact the patient's quality of life. Microglial-mediated neuroinflammation is induced after severe TBI and contributes to neurological deficits and on-going neurodegenerative processes. Here, we investigated the effect of breaking the neurotoxic neuroinflammatory loop at 1-month after controlled cortical impact in mice by pharmacological removal of chronically activated microglia using a colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor, Plexxikon 5622. Overall, we show that short-term elimination of microglia during the chronic phase of TBI followed by repopulation results in long-term improvements in neurological function, suppression of neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress pathways, and a reduction in persistent neurodegenerative processes. These studies are clinically relevant and support new concepts that the therapeutic window for TBI may be far longer than traditionally believed if chronic and evolving microglial-mediated neuroinflammation can be inhibited or regulated in a precise manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Loss of Piccolo Function in Rats Induces Cerebellar Network Dysfunction and Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 3-like Phenotypes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2943?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2943?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Piccolo, a presynaptic active zone protein, is best known for its role in the regulated assembly and function of vertebrate synapses. Genetic studies suggest a further link to several psychiatric disorders as well as Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia type 3 (PCH3). We have characterized recently generated Piccolo KO (&lt;i&gt;Pclo&lt;sup&gt;gt/gt&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) rats. Analysis of rats of both sexes revealed a dramatic reduction in brain size compared with WT (&lt;i&gt;Pclo&lt;sup&gt;wt/wt&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) animals, attributed to a decrease in the size of the cerebral cortical, cerebellar, and pontine regions. Analysis of the cerebellum and brainstem revealed a reduced granule cell layer and a reduction in size of pontine nuclei. Moreover, the maturation of mossy fiber afferents from pontine neurons and the expression of the α6 GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunit at the mossy fiber-granule cell synapse are perturbed, as well as the innervation of Purkinje cells by cerebellar climbing fibers. Ultrastructural and functional studies revealed a reduced size of mossy fiber boutons, with fewer synaptic vesicles and altered synaptic transmission. These data imply that Piccolo is required for the normal development, maturation, and function of neuronal networks formed between the brainstem and cerebellum. Consistently, behavioral studies demonstrated that adult &lt;i&gt;Pclo&lt;sup&gt;gt/gt&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; rats display impaired motor coordination, despite adequate performance in tasks that reflect muscle strength and locomotion. Together, these data suggest that loss of Piccolo function in patients with PCH3 could be involved in many of the observed anatomical and behavioral symptoms, and that the further analysis of these animals could provide fundamental mechanistic insights into this devastating disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 3 is a devastating developmental disorder associated with severe developmental delay, progressive microcephaly with brachycephaly, optic atrophy, seizures, and hypertonia with hyperreflexia. Recent genetic studies have identified non-sense mutations in the coding region of the PCLO gene, suggesting a functional link between this disorder and the presynaptic active zone. Our analysis of Piccolo KO rats supports this hypothesis, formally demonstrating that anatomical and behavioral phenotypes seen in patients with Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 3 are also exhibited by these Piccolo deficient animals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Dopamine Receptor Dop1R2 Stabilizes Appetitive Olfactory Memory through the Raf/MAPK Pathway in Drosophila</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, dopamine signaling to the mushroom body intrinsic neurons, Kenyon cells (KCs), is critical to stabilize olfactory memory. Little is known about the downstream intracellular molecular signaling underlying memory stabilization. Here we address this question in the context of sugar-rewarded olfactory long-term memory (LTM). We show that associative training increases the phosphorylation of MAPK in KCs, via Dop1R2 signaling. Consistently, the attenuation of &lt;i&gt;Dop1R2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Raf&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;MAPK&lt;/i&gt; expression in KCs selectively impairs LTM, but not short-term memory. Moreover, we show that the LTM deficit caused by the knockdown of &lt;i&gt;Dop1R2&lt;/i&gt; can be rescued by expressing active Raf in KCs. Thus, the Dop1R2/Raf/MAPK pathway is a pivotal downstream effector of dopamine signaling for stabilizing appetitive olfactory memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dopaminergic input to the Kenyon cells (KCs) is pivotal to stabilize memory in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. This process is mediated by dopamine receptors like Dop1R2. Nevertheless, little is known for its underlying molecular mechanism. Here we show that the Raf/MAPK pathway is specifically engaged in appetitive long-term memory in KCs. With combined biochemical and behavioral experiments, we reveal that activation of the Raf/MAPK pathway is regulated through Dop1R2, shedding light on how dopamine modulates intracellular signaling for memory stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Regulation of emotional behavior is essential for human social interactions. Recent work has exposed its cognitive complexity, as well as its unexpected reliance on portions of the anterior PFC (aPFC) also involved in exploration, relational reasoning, and counterfactual choice, rather than on dorsolateral and medial prefrontal areas involved in several forms of cognitive control. This study anatomically qualifies the contribution of aPFC territories to the regulation of prepotent approach–avoidance action tendencies elicited by emotional faces, and explores a possible structural pathway through which this emotional action regulation might be implemented. We provide converging evidence from task-based fMRI, diffusion-weighted imaging, and functional connectivity fingerprints for a novel neural element in emotional regulation. Task-based fMRI in human male participants (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 40) performing an emotional approach–avoidance task identified aPFC territories involved in the regulation of action tendencies elicited by emotional faces. Connectivity fingerprints, based on diffusion-weighted imaging and resting-state connectivity, localized those task-defined frontal regions to the lateral frontal pole (FPl), an anatomically defined portion of the aPFC that lacks a homologous counterpart in macaque brains. Probabilistic tractography indicated that 10%–20% of interindividual variation in emotional regulation abilities is accounted for by the strength of structural connectivity between FPl and amygdala. Evidence from an independent replication sample (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 50; 10 females) further substantiated this result. These findings provide novel neuroanatomical evidence for incorporating FPl in models of control over human action tendencies elicited by emotional faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Successful regulation of emotional behaviors is a prerequisite for successful participation in human society, as is evidenced by the social isolation and loss of occupational opportunities often encountered by people suffering from emotion regulation disorders, such as social-anxiety disorder and psychopathy. Knowledge about the precise cortical regions and connections supporting this control is crucial for understanding both the nature of computations needed to successfully traverse the space of possible actions in social situations, and the potential interventions that might result in efficient treatment of social-emotional disorders. This study provides evidence for a precise cortical region (lateral frontal pole) and a structural pathway (the ventral amygdalofugal bundle) through which a cognitively complex form of emotional action regulation might be implemented in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Sensory Modality-Independent Activation of the Brain Network for Language</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The meaning of a sentence can be understood, whether presented in written or spoken form. Therefore, it is highly probable that brain processes supporting language comprehension are at least partly independent of sensory modality. To identify where and when in the brain language processing is independent of sensory modality, we directly compared neuromagnetic brain signals of 200 human subjects (102 males) either reading or listening to sentences. We used multiset canonical correlation analysis to align individual subject data in a way that boosts those aspects of the signal that are common to all, allowing us to capture word-by-word signal variations, consistent across subjects and at a fine temporal scale. Quantifying this consistency in activation across both reading and listening tasks revealed a mostly left-hemispheric cortical network. Areas showing consistent activity patterns included not only areas previously implicated in higher-level language processing, such as left prefrontal, superior and middle temporal areas, and anterior temporal lobe, but also parts of the control network as well as subcentral and more posterior temporal-parietal areas. Activity in this supramodal sentence-processing network starts in temporal areas and rapidly spreads to the other regions involved. The findings indicate not only the involvement of a large network of brain areas in supramodal language processing but also that the linguistic information contained in the unfolding sentences modulates brain activity in a word-specific manner across subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The brain can extract meaning from written and spoken messages alike. This requires activity of both brain circuits capable of processing sensory modality-specific aspects of the input signals as well as coordinated brain activity to extract modality-independent meaning from the input. Using traditional methods, it is difficult to disentangle modality-specific activation from modality-independent activation. In this work, we developed and applied a multivariate methodology that allows for a direct quantification of sensory modality-independent brain activity, revealing fast activation of a wide network of brain areas, both including and extending beyond the core network for language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Differential Effects of Awareness and Task Relevance on Early and Late ERPs in a No-Report Visual Oddball Paradigm</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2906?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To date it is poorly understood how and when deviance processing interacts with awareness and task relevance. Furthermore, an important issue in the study of consciousness is the prevalent confound of conscious perception with the requirement of reporting it. This study addresses these topics using a no-report inattentional blindness paradigm with a visual oddball sequence of geometrical shapes presented to male and female human participants. Electrophysiological responses were obtained in three physically identical Phases A–C that differed only with respect to the instructions: (A) participants were uninformed about the shapes and attended an unrelated foreground task (inattentional blind), (B) were informed about the shapes but still attended the foreground task, and (C) attended the shapes. Conscious processing of shapes was indexed by the visual awareness negativity but not a P3. Deviance processing was associated with the visual mismatch negativity independently of consciousness and task relevance. The oddball P3, however, only emerged when the stimuli were task relevant, and was absent for consciously perceived but task irrelevant stimuli. The P3 thus does not represent a reliable marker of stimulus awareness. This result pattern supports the view of hierarchical predictive processing, where lower levels display automatic deviance processing, whereas higher levels require attention and task relevance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To react to potentially important changes in our environment it is fundamental to detect deviations from regularities of sensory input. It has yet to be understood how awareness and task relevance of this input interact with deviance processing. We investigated the role of awareness in deviance detection while at the same time circumventing the confound of awareness and report by means of a no-report paradigm. Our results suggest that early processes are elicited automatically, whereas, contrary to prominent theories, late processes do not depend on awareness but on task-based attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Sleep Differentially Affects Early and Late Neuronal Responses to Sounds in Auditory and Perirhinal Cortices</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental feature of sleep is reduced behavioral responsiveness to external events, but the extent of processing along sensory pathways remains poorly understood. While responses are comparable across wakefulness and sleep in auditory cortex (AC), neuronal activity in downstream regions remains unknown. Here we recorded spiking activity in 435 neuronal clusters evoked by acoustic stimuli in the perirhinal cortex (PRC) and in AC of freely behaving male rats across wakefulness and sleep. Neuronal responses in AC showed modest (~10%) differences in response gain across vigilance states, replicating previous studies. By contrast, PRC neuronal responses were robustly attenuated by 47% and 36% during NREM sleep and REM sleep, respectively. Beyond the separation according to cortical region, response latency in each neuronal cluster was correlated with the degree of NREM sleep attenuation, such that late (&amp;gt;40 ms) responses in all monitored regions diminished during NREM sleep. The robust attenuation of late responses prevalent in PRC represents a novel neural correlate of sensory disconnection during sleep, opening new avenues for investigating the mediating mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Reduced behavioral responsiveness to sensory stimulation is at the core of sleep's definition, but it is still unclear how the sleeping brain responds differently to sensory stimuli. In the current study, we recorded neuronal spiking responses to sounds along the cortical processing hierarchy of rats during wakefulness and natural sleep. Responses in auditory cortex only showed modest changes during sleep, whereas sleep robustly attenuated the responses of neurons in high-level perirhinal cortex. We also found that, during NREM sleep, the response latency predicts the degree of sleep attenuation in individual neurons above and beyond their anatomical location. These results provide anatomical and temporal signatures of sensory disconnection during sleep and pave the way to understanding the underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Acetylcholine Modulates Cerebellar Granule Cell Spiking by Regulating the Balance of Synaptic Excitation and Inhibition</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensorimotor integration in the cerebellum is essential for refining motor output, and the first stage of this processing occurs in the granule cell layer. Recent evidence suggests that granule cell layer synaptic integration can be contextually modified, although the circuit mechanisms that could mediate such modulation remain largely unknown. Here we investigate the role of ACh in regulating granule cell layer synaptic integration in male rats and mice of both sexes. We find that Golgi cells, interneurons that provide the sole source of inhibition to the granule cell layer, express both nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors. While acute ACh application can modestly depolarize some Golgi cells, the net effect of longer, optogenetically induced ACh release is to strongly hyperpolarize Golgi cells. Golgi cell hyperpolarization by ACh leads to a significant reduction in both tonic and evoked granule cell synaptic inhibition. ACh also reduces glutamate release from mossy fibers by acting on presynaptic muscarinic receptors. Surprisingly, despite these consistent effects on Golgi cells and mossy fibers, ACh can either increase or decrease the spike probability of granule cells as measured by noninvasive cell-attached recordings. By constructing an integrate-and-fire model of granule cell layer population activity, we find that the direction of spike rate modulation can be accounted for predominately by the initial balance of excitation and inhibition onto individual granule cells. Together, these experiments demonstrate that ACh can modulate population-level granule cell responses by altering the ratios of excitation and inhibition at the first stage of cerebellar processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The cerebellum plays a key role in motor control and motor learning. While it is known that behavioral context can modify motor learning, the circuit basis of such modulation has remained unclear. Here we find that a key neuromodulator, ACh, can alter the balance of excitation and inhibition at the first stage of cerebellar processing. These results suggest that ACh could play a key role in altering cerebellar learning by modifying how sensorimotor input is represented at the input layer of the cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Abundance Compensates Kinetics: Similar Effect of Dopamine Signals on D1 and D2 Receptor Populations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2868?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neuromodulator dopamine plays a key role in motivation, reward-related learning, and normal motor function. The different affinity of striatal D1 and D2 dopamine receptor types has been argued to constrain the D1 and D2 signaling pathways to phasic and tonic dopamine signals, respectively. However, this view assumes that dopamine receptor kinetics are instantaneous so that the time courses of changes in dopamine concentration and changes in receptor occupation are basically identical. Here we developed a neurochemical model of dopamine receptor binding taking into account the different kinetics and abundance of D1 and D2 receptors in the striatum. Testing a large range of behaviorally-relevant dopamine signals, we found that the D1 and D2 dopamine receptor populations responded very similarly to tonic and phasic dopamine signals. Furthermore, because of slow unbinding rates, both receptor populations integrated dopamine signals over a timescale of minutes. Our model provides a description of how physiological dopamine signals translate into changes in dopamine receptor occupation in the striatum, and explains why dopamine ramps are an effective signal to occupy dopamine receptors. Overall, our model points to the importance of taking into account receptor kinetics for functional considerations of dopamine signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Current models of basal ganglia function are often based on a distinction of two types of dopamine receptors, D1 and D2, with low and high affinity, respectively. Thereby, phasic dopamine signals are believed to mostly affect striatal neurons with D1 receptors, and tonic dopamine signals are believed to mostly affect striatal neurons with D2 receptors. This view does not take into account the rates for the binding and unbinding of dopamine to D1 and D2 receptors. By incorporating these kinetics into a computational model we show that D1 and D2 receptors both respond to phasic and tonic dopamine signals. This has implications for the processing of reward-related and motivational signals in the basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Parkinsonian Beta Dynamics during Rest and Movement in the Dorsal Pallidum and Subthalamic Nucleus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2859?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In Parkinson's disease (PD), pathologically high levels of beta activity (12–30 Hz) reflect specific symptomatology and normalize with pharmacological or surgical intervention. Although beta characterization in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of PD patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) has now been translated into adaptive DBS paradigms, a limited number of studies have characterized beta power in the globus pallidus internus (GPi), an equally effective DBS target. Our objective was to compare beta power in the STN and GPi during rest and movement in people with PD undergoing DBS. Thirty-seven human female and male participants completed a simple behavioral experiment consisting of periods of rest and button presses, leading to local field potential recordings from 19 (15 participants) STN and 26 (22 participants) GPi nuclei. We examined overall beta power as well as beta time-domain dynamics (i.e., beta bursts). We found higher beta power during rest and movement in the GPi, which also had more beta desynchronization during movement. Beta power was positively associated with bradykinesia and rigidity severity; however, these clinical associations were present only in the GPi cohort. With regards to beta dynamics, bursts were similar in duration and frequency in the GPi and STN, but GPi bursts were stronger and correlated to bradykinesia-rigidity severity. Beta dynamics therefore differ across basal ganglia nuclei. Relative to the STN, beta power in the GPi may be readily detected, modulates more with movement, and relates more to clinical impairment. Together, this could point to the GPi as a potentially effective target for beta-based adaptive DBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It is known that subthalamic nucleus (STN) beta activity is linked to symptom severity in Parkinson's disease (PD), but few studies have characterized beta activity in the globus pallidus internus (GPi), another effective target for deep brain stimulation (DBS). We compared beta power in the STN and GPi during rest and movement in 37 people with PD undergoing DBS. We found that beta dynamics differed across basal ganglia nuclei. Our results show that, relative to the STN, beta power in the GPi may be readily detected, modulates more with movement, and relates more to clinical impairment. Together, this could point to the GPi as a potentially effective target for beta-based adaptive DBS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Cortico-Thalamo-Cortical Circuits of Mouse Forelimb S1 Are Organized Primarily as Recurrent Loops</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2849?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical projections to the thalamus arise from corticothalamic (CT) neurons in layer 6 and pyramidal tract-type (PT) neurons in layer 5B. We dissected the excitatory synaptic connections in the somatosensory thalamus formed by CT and PT neurons of the primary somatosensory (S1) cortex, focusing on mouse forelimb S1. Mice of both sexes were studied. The CT neurons in S1 synaptically excited S1-projecting thalamocortical (TC) neurons in subregions of both the ventral posterior lateral and posterior (PO) nuclei, forming a pair of recurrent cortico-thalamo-cortical (C-T-C) loops. The PT neurons in S1 also formed a recurrent loop with S1-projecting TC neurons in the same subregion of the PO. The PT neurons in the adjacent primary motor (M1) cortex formed a separate recurrent loop with M1-projecting TC neurons in a nearby subregion of the PO. Collectively, our results reveal that C-T-C circuits of mouse forelimb S1 are primarily organized as multiple cortical cell-type-specific and thalamic subnucleus-specific recurrent loops, with both CT and PT neurons providing the strongest excitatory input to TC neurons that project back to S1. The findings, together with those of related studies of C-T-C circuits, thus suggest that recurrently projecting thalamocortical neurons are the principal targets of cortical excitatory input to the mouse somatosensory and motor thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Bidirectional cortical communication with the thalamus is considered an important aspect of sensorimotor integration for active touch in the somatosensory system, but the cellular organization of the circuits mediating this process is not well understood. We used an approach combining cell-type-specific anterograde optogenetic excitation with single-cell recordings targeted to retrogradely labeled thalamocortical neurons to dissect these circuits. The findings reveal a consistent pattern: cortical projections to the somatosensory thalamus target thalamocortical neurons that project back to the same cortical area. Commonalities of these findings to previous descriptions of related circuits in other areas suggest that cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits may generally be organized primarily as recurrent loops.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Activity Dependent and Independent Determinants of Synaptic Size Diversity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2828?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2828?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The extraordinary diversity of excitatory synapse sizes is commonly attributed to activity-dependent processes that drive synaptic growth and diminution. Recent studies also point to activity-independent size fluctuations, possibly driven by innate synaptic molecule dynamics, as important generators of size diversity. To examine the contributions of activity-dependent and independent processes to excitatory synapse size diversity, we studied glutamatergic synapse size dynamics and diversification in cultured rat cortical neurons (both sexes), silenced from plating. We found that in networks with no history of activity whatsoever, synaptic size diversity was no less extensive than that observed in spontaneously active networks. Synapses in silenced networks were larger, size distributions were broader, yet these were rightward-skewed and similar in shape when scaled by mean synaptic size. Silencing reduced the magnitude of size fluctuations and weakened constraints on size distributions, yet these were sufficient to explain synaptic size diversity in silenced networks. Model-based exploration followed by experimental testing indicated that silencing-associated changes in innate molecular dynamics and fluctuation characteristics might negatively impact synaptic persistence, resulting in reduced synaptic numbers. This, in turn, would increase synaptic molecule availability, promote synaptic enlargement, and ultimately alter fluctuation characteristics. These findings suggest that activity-independent size fluctuations are sufficient to fully diversify glutamatergic synaptic sizes, with activity-dependent processes primarily setting the scale rather than the shape of size distributions. Moreover, they point to reciprocal relationships between synaptic size fluctuations, size distributions, and synaptic numbers mediated by the innate dynamics of synaptic molecules as they move in, out, and between synapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sizes of glutamatergic synapses vary tremendously, even when formed on the same neuron. This diversity is commonly thought to reflect the outcome of activity-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity, yet activity-independent processes might also play some part. Here we show that in neurons with no history of activity whatsoever, synaptic sizes are no less diverse. We show that this diversity is the product of activity-independent size fluctuations, which are sufficient to generate a full repertoire of synaptic sizes at correct proportions. By combining modeling and experimentation we expose reciprocal relationships between size fluctuations, synaptic sizes and synaptic counts, and show how these phenomena might be connected through the dynamics of synaptic molecules as they move in, out, and between synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Structural Remodeling of Active Zones Is Associated with Synaptic Homeostasis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2817?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Perturbations to postsynaptic glutamate receptors (GluRs) trigger retrograde signaling to precisely increase presynaptic neurotransmitter release, maintaining stable levels of synaptic strength, a process referred to as homeostatic regulation. However, the structural change of homeostatic regulation remains poorly defined. At wild-type &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junction synapse, there is one Bruchpilot (Brp) ring detected by superresolution microscopy at active zones (AZs). In the present study, we report multiple Brp rings (i.e., multiple T-bars seen by electron microscopy) at AZs of both male and female larvae when GluRs are reduced. At &lt;i&gt;GluRIIC&lt;/i&gt;-deficient neuromuscular junctions, quantal size was reduced but quantal content was increased, indicative of homeostatic presynaptic potentiation. Consistently, multiple Brp rings at AZs were observed in the two classic synaptic homeostasis models (i.e., &lt;i&gt;GluRIIA&lt;/i&gt; mutant and pharmacological blockade of GluRIIA activity). Furthermore, postsynaptic overexpression of the cell adhesion protein Neuroligin 1 partially rescued multiple Brp rings phenotype. Our study thus supports that the formation of multiple Brp rings at AZs might be a structural basis for synaptic homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Synaptic homeostasis is a conserved fundamental mechanism to maintain efficient neurotransmission of neural networks. Active zones (AZs) are characterized by an electron-dense cytomatrix, which is largely composed of Bruchpilot (Brp) at the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junction synapses. It is not clear how the structure of AZs changes during homeostatic regulation. To address this question, we examined the structure of AZs by superresolution microscopy and electron microscopy during homeostatic regulation. Our results reveal multiple Brp rings at AZs of glutamate receptor-deficient neuromuscular junction synapses compared with single Brp ring at AZs in wild type (WT). We further show that Neuroligin 1-mediated retrograde signaling regulates multiple Brp ring formation at glutamate receptor-deficient synapses. This study thus reveals a regulatory mechanism for synaptic homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience: Direct Interaction of PP2A Phosphatase with GABAB Receptors Alters Functional Signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2808?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Addictive drugs usurp the brain's intrinsic mechanism for reward, leading to compulsive and destructive behaviors. In the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the center of the brain's reward circuit, GABAergic neurons control the excitability of dopamine (DA) projection neurons and are the site of initial psychostimulant-dependent changes in signaling. Previous work established that cocaine/methamphetamine exposure increases protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, which dephosphorylates the GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R2 subunit, promotes internalization of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R) and leads to smaller GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R-activated G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) currents in VTA GABA neurons. How the actions of PP2A become selective for a particular signaling pathway is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that PP2A can associate directly with a short peptide sequence in the C terminal domain of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R1 subunit, and that GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs and PP2A are in close proximity in rodent neurons (mouse/rat; mixed sexes). We show that this PP2A-GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R interaction can be regulated by intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Finally, a peptide that potentially reduces recruitment of PP2A to GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs and thereby limits receptor dephosphorylation increases the magnitude of baclofen-induced GIRK currents. Thus, limiting PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs may be a useful strategy to increase receptor signaling for treating diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dysregulation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs) underlies altered neurotransmission in many neurological disorders. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is involved in dephosphorylating and subsequent internalization of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs in models of addiction and depression. Here, we provide new evidence that PP2A B55 regulatory subunit interacts directly with a small region of the C-terminal domain of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R1 subunit, and that this interaction is sensitive to intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. We demonstrate that a short peptide corresponding to the PP2A interaction site on GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R1 competes for PP2A binding, enhances phosphorylation GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R2 S783, and affects functional signaling through GIRK channels. Our study highlights how targeting PP2A dependent dephosphorylation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs may provide a specific strategy to modulate GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R signaling in disease conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The spatiotemporal dynamics of excitatory neurotransmission must be tightly regulated to achieve efficient synaptic communication. By limiting spillover, glutamate transporters are believed to prevent excessive activation of extrasynaptically located receptors that can impair synaptic plasticity. While glutamate transporter expression is reduced in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, the contributions of transporter dysfunction to disease pathophysiology remain ambiguous as the fundamental relationship between glutamate dynamics and plasticity, and the mechanisms linking these two phenomena, remain poorly understood. Here, we combined electrophysiology and real-time high-speed imaging of extracellular glutamate transients during LTP induction and characterized the sensitivity of the relationship between glutamate dynamics during theta burst stimulation (TBS) and the resulting magnitude of LTP consolidation, both in control conditions and following selective and nonselective glutamate transporter blockade. Glutamate clearance times were negatively correlated with LTP magnitude following nonselective glutamate transporter inhibition but not following selective blockade of a majority of GLT-1, the brain's most abundant glutamate transporter. Although glutamate transporter inhibition reduced the postsynaptic population response to TBS, calcium responses to TBS were greatly exaggerated. The source of excess calcium was dependent on NMDARs, L-type VGCCs, GluA2-lacking AMPARs, and internal calcium stores. Surprisingly, inhibition of L-type VGCCs, but not GluA2-lacking AMPARs or ryanodine receptors, was required to restore robust LTP. In all, these data provide a detailed understanding of the relationship between glutamate dynamics and plasticity and uncover important mechanisms by which poor glutamate uptake can negatively impact LTP consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Specific patterns of neural activity can promote long-term changes in the strength of synaptic connections through a phenomenon known as synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity is well accepted to represent the cellular mechanisms underlying learning and memory, and many forms of plasticity are initiated by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. While essential for rapid cellular communication in the brain, excessive levels of extracellular glutamate can negatively impact brain function. In this study, we demonstrate that pharmacological manipulations that increase the availability of extracellular glutamate during neural activity can have profoundly negative consequences on synaptic plasticity. We identify mechanisms through which excess glutamate can negatively influence synaptic plasticity, and we discuss the relevance of these findings to neurodegenerative diseases and in the aging brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: A functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based frontoparietal connectivity neurofeedback training method for cognitive functions promotion. (arXiv:2003.14091v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An innovative approach which can promote cognitive functions effectively and
efficiently is an urgent need for healthy elderly and patients with cognitive
impairment. In this study, we proposed a novel functional near-infrared
spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based frontoparietal functional connectivity (FC)
neurofeedback training paradigm related to working memory. Compared with
conventional cognitive training studies, we chose the frontoparietal network, a
key brain region for cognitive function modulation as neurofeedback, resulting
in strong targeting effect. In the experiment, ten participants received three
20 min cognitive training sessions with fNIRS-based frontoparietal FC as
neurofeedback, and the other ten participants served as the normal control (NC)
group. Frontoparietal FC was significantly increased in the tested group (p =
0.005) and the cognitive functions (memory and attention) were significantly
promoted compared to the NC group. Follow-up evaluations indicated that the
training effect can last for over half a month. The proposed method shows great
potential to be developed as a fast, effective and widespread training approach
for cognitive functions enhancement and rehabilitation applications.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Genetic Algorithmic Parameter Optimisation of a Recurrent Spiking Neural Network Model. (arXiv:2003.13850v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural networks are complex algorithms that loosely model the behaviour of
the human brain. They play a significant role in computational neuroscience and
artificial intelligence. The next generation of neural network models is based
on the spike timing activity of neurons: spiking neural networks (SNNs).
However, model parameters in SNNs are difficult to search and optimise.
Previous studies using genetic algorithm (GA) optimisation of SNNs were focused
mainly on simple, feedforward, or oscillatory networks, but not much work has
been done on optimising cortex-like recurrent SNNs. In this work, we
investigated the use of GAs to search for optimal parameters in recurrent SNNs
to reach targeted neuronal population firing rates, e.g. as in experimental
observations. We considered a cortical column based SNN comprising 1000
Izhikevich spiking neurons for computational efficiency and biologically
realism. The model parameters explored were the neuronal biased input currents.
First, we found for this particular SNN, the optimal parameter values for
targeted population averaged firing activities, and the convergence of
algorithm by ~100 generations. We then showed that the GA optimal population
size was within ~16-20 while the crossover rate that returned the best fitness
value was ~0.95. Overall, we have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of
implementing GA to optimise model parameters in a recurrent cortical based SNN.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: On the role of theory and modeling in neuroscience. (arXiv:2003.13825v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13825</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13825</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the field of neuroscience has gone through rapid
experimental advances and extensive use of quantitative and computational
methods. This accelerating growth has created a need for methodological
analysis of the role of theory and the modeling approaches currently used in
this field. Toward that end, we start from the general view that the primary
role of science is to solve empirical problems, and that it does so by
developing theories that can account for phenomena within their domain of
application. We propose a commonly-used set of terms - descriptive,
mechanistic, and normative - as methodological designations that refer to the
kind of problem a theory is intended to solve. Further, we find that models of
each kind play distinct roles in defining and bridging the multiple levels of
abstraction necessary to account for any neuroscientific phenomenon. We then
discuss how models play an important role to connect theory and experiment, and
note the importance of well-defined translation functions between them.
Furthermore, we describe how models themselves can be used as a form of
experiment to test and develop theories. This report is the summary of a
discussion initiated at the conference Present and Future Theoretical
Frameworks in Neuroscience, which we hope will contribute to a much-needed
discussion in the neuroscientific community.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: VOR Adaptation on a Humanoid iCub Robot Using a Spiking Cerebellar Model. (arXiv:2003.01409v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01409</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01409</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We embed a spiking cerebellar model within an adaptive real-time (RT) control
loop that is able to operate a real robotic body (iCub) when performing
different vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) tasks. The spiking neural network
computation, including event- and time-driven neural dynamics, neural activity,
and spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanisms, leads to a
nondeterministic computation time caused by the neural activity volleys
encountered during cerebellar simulation. This nondeterministic computation
time motivates the integration of an RT supervisor module that is able to
ensure a well-orchestrated neural computation time and robot operation.
Actually, our neurorobotic experimental setup (VOR) benefits from the
biological sensory motor delay between the cerebellum and the body to buffer
the computational overloads as well as providing flexibility in adjusting the
neural computation time and RT operation. The RT supervisor module provides for
incremental countermeasures that dynamically slow down or speed up the
cerebellar simulation by either halting the simulation or disabling certain
neural computation features (i.e., STDP mechanisms, spike propagation, and
neural updates) to cope with the RT constraints imposed by the real robot
operation. This neurorobotic experimental setup is applied to different
horizontal and vertical VOR adaptive tasks that are widely used by the
neuroscientific community to address cerebellar functioning. We aim to
elucidate the manner in which the combination of the cerebellar neural
substrate and the distributed plasticity shapes the cerebellar neural activity
to mediate motor adaptation. This paper underlies the need for a two-stage
learning process to facilitate VOR acquisition.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Optimal interplay between synaptic strengths and network structure enhances activity fluctuations and information propagation in hierarchical modular networks. (arXiv:1905.01181v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01181</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01181</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In network models of spiking neurons, the joint impact of network structure
and synaptic parameters on activity propagation is still an open problem. Here
we use an information-theoretical approach to investigate activity propagation
in spiking networks with hierarchical modular topology. We observe that
optimized pairwise information propagation emerges due to the increase of
either (i) the global synaptic strength parameter or (ii) the number of modules
in the network, while the network size remains constant. At the population
level, information propagation of activity among adjacent modules is enhanced
as the number of modules increases until a maximum value is reached and then
decreases, showing that there is an optimal interplay between synaptic strength
and modularity for population information flow. This is in contrast to
information propagation evaluated among pairs of neurons, which attains maximum
value at the maximum values of these two parameter ranges. By examining the
network behavior under increase of synaptic strength and number of modules we
find that these increases are associated with two different effects: (i)
increase of autocorrelations among individual neurons, and (ii) increase of
cross-correlations among pairs of neurons. The second effect is associated with
better information propagation in the network. Our results suggest roles that
link topological features and synaptic strength levels to the transmission of
information in cortical networks.v

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A Deep Learning Approach for Mild Depression Recognition Based on Functional Connectivity Using Electroencephalography</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Early detection remains a significant challenge for the treatment of depression. In our work, we proposed a novel approach to mild depression recognition using electroencephalography (EEG). First, we explored abnormal organization in the functional connectivity network of mild depression using graph theory. Second, we proposed a novel classification model for recognizing mild depression. Considering the powerful ability of CNN to process two-dimensional data, we applied CNN separately to the two-dimensional data form of the functional connectivity matrices from five EEG bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). In addition, inspired by recent breakthroughs in the ability of deep recurrent CNNs to classify mental load, we merged the functional connectivity matrices from the three EEG bands that performed the best into a three-channel image to classify mild depression-related and normal EEG signals using the CNN. The results of the graph theory analysis showed that the brain functional network of the mild depression group had a larger characteristic path length and a lower clustering coefficient than the healthy control group, showing deviation from the small-world network. The proposed classification model obtained a classification accuracy of 80.74% for recognizing mild depression. The current study suggests that the combination of a CNN and functional connectivity matrix may provide a promising objective approach for diagnosing mild depression. Deep learning approaches such as this might have the potential to inform clinical practice and aid in research on psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Predicting Alzheimer’s Disease Conversion From Mild Cognitive Impairment Using an Extreme Learning Machine-Based Grading Method With Multimodal Data</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Identifying patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are at high risk of progressing to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is crucial for early treatment of AD. However, it is difficult to predict the cognitive states of patients. This study developed an extreme learning machine (ELM)-based grading method to efficiently fuse multimodal data and predict MCI-to-AD conversion. First, features were extracted from magnetic resonance (MR) images, and useful features were selected using a feature selection method. Second, multiple modalities of MCI subjects, including MRI, positron emission tomography, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and gene data, were individually graded using the ELM method. Finally, these grading scores calculated from different modalities were fed into a classifier to discriminate subjects with progressive MCI from those with stable MCI. The proposed approach has been validated on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, and an accuracy of 84.7% was achieved for an AD prediction within 3 years. Experiments on predicting AD conversion from MCI within different periods showed similar results with the 3-year prediction. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach benefits from the efficient fusion of four modalities, resulting in an accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Delta glutamate receptor conductance drives excitation of mouse dorsal raphe neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56054</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56054</link>
	<description>The dorsal raphe nucleus is the predominant source of central serotonin, where neuronal activity regulates complex emotional behaviors. Action potential firing of serotonin dorsal raphe neurons is driven via a1-adrenergic receptors (a1-A&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;) activation. Despite this crucial role, the ion channels responsible for a1-A&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated depolarization are unknown. Here, we show in mouse brain slices that a1-A&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission is mediated by the ionotropic glutamate receptor homolog cation channel, delta glutamate receptor 1 (GluD1). GluD1&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;-channels are constitutively active under basal conditions carrying tonic inward current and synaptic activation of a1-A&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;s augments tonic GluD1&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;-channel current. Further, loss of dorsal raphe GluD1&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;-channels produces an anxiogenic phenotype. Thus, GluD1&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;-channels are responsible for a1-A&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent induction of persistent pacemaker-type firing of dorsal raphe neurons and regulate dorsal raphe-related behavior. Given the widespread distribution of these channels, ion channel function of GluD1&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; as a regulator of neuronal excitability is proposed to be widespread in the nervous system.</description>

	<title>eLife: CSF1R blockade induces macrophage ablation and results in mouse choroidal vascular atrophy and RPE disorganization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.55564</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55564</link>
	<description>The choroid, which provides vascular supply to the outer retina, demonstrates progressive degeneration in aging and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However mechanisms that maintain or compromise choroidal homeostasis are obscure. We discovered that the ablation of choroidal macrophages via CSF1R blockade was associated with choroidal vascular atrophy and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) changes including structural disruption, downregulation of visual cycle genes, and altered angiogenic factor expression. Suspending CSF1R blockade following ablation enabled spontaneous macrophage regeneration, which fully restored original macrophage distributions and morphologies. Macrophage regeneration was accompanied by arrested vascular degeneration and ameliorated pathological RPE alterations. These findings suggest that choroidal macrophages play a previously unappreciated trophic role in maintaining choroidal vasculature and RPE cells, implicating insufficiency in choroidal macrophage function as a factor in aging- and AMD-associated pathology. Modulating macrophage function may constitute a strategy for the therapeutic preservation of the choroid and RPE in age-related retinal disorders.</description>

	<title>eLife: Deep evolutionary analysis reveals the design principles of fold A glycosyltransferases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.54532</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54532</link>
	<description>Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are prevalent across the tree of life and regulate nearly all aspects of cellular functions. The evolutionary basis for their complex and diverse modes of catalytic functions remain enigmatic. Here, based on deep mining of over half million GT-A fold sequences, we define a minimal core component shared among functionally diverse enzymes. We find that variations in the common core and emergence of hypervariable loops extending from the core contributed to GT-A diversity. We provide a phylogenetic framework relating diverse GT-A fold families for the first time and show that inverting and retaining mechanisms emerged multiple times independently during evolution. Using evolutionary information encoded in primary sequences, we trained a machine learning classifier to predict donor specificity with nearly 90% accuracy and deployed it for the annotation of understudied GTs. Our studies provide an evolutionary framework for investigating complex relationships connecting GT-A fold sequence, structure, function and regulation.</description>

	<title>eLife: Calcium-stimulated disassembly of focal adhesions mediated by an ORP3/IQSec1 complex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.54113</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54113</link>
	<description>Coordinated assembly and disassembly of integrin-mediated focal adhesions (FAs) is essential for cell migration. Many studies have shown that FA disassembly requires Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, however our understanding of this process remains incomplete. Here we show that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx via STIM1/Orai1 calcium channels, which cluster near FAs, leads to activation of the GTPase Arf5 via the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated GEF IQSec1, and that both IQSec1 and Arf5 activation are essential for adhesion disassembly. We further show that IQSec1 forms a complex with the lipid transfer protein ORP3, and that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx triggers PKC-dependent translocation of this complex to ER/plasma membrane contact sites adjacent to FAs. In addition to allosterically activating IQSec1, ORP3 also extracts PI4P from the PM, in exchange for phosphatidylcholine. ORP3-mediated lipid exchange is also important for FA turnover. Together, these findings identify a new pathway that links calcium influx to FA turnover during cell migration.</description>

	<title>eLife: Mutations associated with human neural tube defects display disrupted planar cell polarity in Drosophila</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.53532</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53532</link>
	<description>Planar cell polarity (PCP) and neural tube defects (NTDs) are linked, with a subset of NTD patients found to harbour mutations in PCP genes, but there is limited data on whether these mutations disrupt PCP signaling &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The core PCP gene &lt;i&gt;Van Gogh&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Vang&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;Vangl1&lt;/i&gt;/2 in mammals, is the most specific for PCP. We thus addressed potential causality of NTD-associated &lt;i&gt;Vangl1&lt;/i&gt;/2 mutations, from either mouse or human patients, in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; allowing intricate analysis of the PCP pathway. Introducing the respective mammalian mutations into &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Vang&lt;/i&gt; revealed defective phenotypic and functional behaviors, with changes to Vang localization, post-translational modification, and mechanistic function, such as its ability to interact with PCP effectors. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into how different mammalian mutations contribute to developmental disorders and strengthen the link between PCP and NTD. Importantly, analyses of the human mutations revealed that each is a causative factor for the associated NTD.</description>

	<title>eLife: Functionally heterogeneous human satellite cells identified by single cell RNA sequencing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.51576</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51576</link>
	<description>Although heterogeneity is recognized within the murine satellite cell pool, a comprehensive understanding of distinct subpopulations and their functional relevance in human satellite cells is lacking. We used a combination of single cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry to identify, distinguish, and physically separate novel subpopulations of human PAX7+ satellite cells (Hu-MuSCs) from normal muscles. We found that, although relatively homogeneous compared to activated satellite cells and committed progenitors, the Hu-MuSC pool contains clusters of transcriptionally distinct cells with consistency across human individuals. New surface marker combinations were enriched in transcriptional subclusters, including a subpopulation of Hu-MuSCs marked by CXCR4/CD29/CD56/CAV1 (CAV1+). &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, CAV1+ Hu-MuSCs are morphologically distinct, and characterized by resistance to activation compared to CAV1- Hu-MuSCs. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, CAV1+ Hu-MuSCs demonstrated increased engraftment after transplantation. Our findings provide a comprehensive transcriptional view of normal Hu-MuSCs and describe new heterogeneity, enabling separation of functionally distinct human satellite cell subpopulations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Prion infection, transmission and cytopathology modelled in a low-biohazard human cell line</title>

	<description>Transmission of prion infectivity to susceptible murine cell lines has simplified prion titration assays and has greatly reduced the need for animal experimentation. However, murine cell models suffer from technical and biological constraints. Human cell lines might be more useful, but they are much more biohazardous and are often poorly infectible. Here we describe the human clonal cell line hovS, which lacks the human PRNP gene and expresses instead the ovine PRNP VRQ allele. HovS cells were highly susceptible to the PG127 strain of sheep-derived murine prions, reaching up to 90% infected cells in any given culture, and were maintained in a continuous infected state for at least 14 passages. Infected hovS cells produced proteinase K-resistant prion protein (PrPSc), pelletable PrP aggregates and bona fide infectious prions capable of infecting further generations of naive hovS cells and mice expressing the VRQ allelic variant of ovine PrPC. Infection in hovS led to prominent cytopathic vacuolation akin to the spongiform changes observed in individuals suffering from prion diseases. In addition to expanding the toolbox for prion research to human experimental genetics, the hovS cell line provides a human-derived system that does not require human prions. Hence, the manipulation of scrapie-infected hovS cells may present fewer biosafety hazards than that of genuine human prions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Alterations in retrotransposition, synaptic connectivity, and myelination implicated by transcriptomic changes following maternal immune activation in non-human primates</title>

	<description>Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a proposed risk factor for multiple neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. However, the molecular and neurobiological mechanisms through which MIA imparts risk for these disorders remain poorly understood. A recently developed nonhuman primate model of exposure to the viral mimic poly:ICLC during pregnancy shows abnormal social and repetitive behaviors and elevated striatal dopamine, a molecular hallmark of human psychosis, providing an unprecedented opportunity for mechanistic dissection. We performed RNA-sequencing across four psychiatrically-relevant brain regions (prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, hippocampus, and primary visual cortex) from 3.5-4-year old male MIA-exposed and control offspring, an age comparable to mid adolescence in humans. We identify 266 unique genes differentially expressed (DE) in at least one brain region with the greatest number observed in hippocampus. Co-expression networks identified region-specific alterations in synaptic signaling and oligodendrocytes. Across regions, we observed temporal and regional differences, but transcriptomic changes were largely similar across 1st or 2nd trimester MIA exposures, including for the top DE genes, PIWIL2 and MGARP. In addition to PIWIL2, several other known regulators of retrotransposition, as well as endogenous transposable elements were dysregulated in MIA offspring. Together, these results begin to elucidate the brain-level molecular mechanisms through which MIA may impart risk for psychiatric disease.</description>

	<description>The activity and connectivity of inhibitory cells has a profound impact on the operation of neuronal networks. While the average connectivity of many inhibitory cell types has been characterized, we still lack an understanding of how individual interneurons distribute their synapses onto their targets and how heterogeneous the inhibition is onto different individual excitatory neurons. Here, we use large-scale volumetric electron microscopy (EM) and functional imaging to address this question for chandelier cells in layer 2/3 of mouse visual cortex. Using dense morphological reconstructions from EM, we mapped the complete chandelier input onto 153 pyramidal neurons. We find that the number of input synapses is highly variable across the population, but the variability is correlated with structural features of the target neuron: soma depth, soma size, and the number of perisomatic synapses received. Functionally, we found that chandelier cell activity in vivo was highly correlated and tracks pupil diameter, a proxy for arousal state. We propose that chandelier cells provide a global signal whose strength is individually adjusted for each target neuron. This approach, combining comprehensive structural analysis with functional recordings of identified cell types, will be a powerful tool to uncover the wiring rules across the diversity of cortical cell types.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Brain Network Organization During Mindful Acceptance of Emotions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.31.018697v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.31.018697v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Individuals use various strategies to cope with challenging emotions such as anxiety. Mindful acceptance involves broadening attentional scope and fully experiencing present moment sensory feelings (whether pleasant or unpleasant) without judgment or elaboration. In contrast, narrative-evaluation involves focusing on a narrow band of sensory experience and generating an elaborate narrative about the meaning and desirability of one's emotional feelings. The current study examined brain network organization during these strategies using graph theoretic analyses. We used a naturalistic task paradigm in which participants reflected on an anxiety-provoking issue from their personal lives and adopted each strategy in different blocks. Compared to narrative-evaluation, mindful acceptance was associated with: (i) increased global network connectivity; (ii) greater integration of interoceptive regions (mid and posterior insula) into large-scale networks; (iii) reorganization of motivational circuits including a shift in the striatum's network assignment from the default network to the salience network; and (iv) a shift from default network to frontoparietal control network (FPCN) regions as central hubs that coordinate information flow. Functional connectivity patterns within the left FPCN were associated with acceptance reports. Thus, broadening attentional scope during mindful acceptance is supported by a more globally interconnected neural landscape, as well as greater information flow through FPCN regions that underlie metacognitive awareness and cognitive control.</description>

	<description>Death awareness influences multiple aspects of human lives, but its psychological constructs and underlying brain mechanisms remain unclear. We address these by measuring behavioral and brain responses to images of human skulls. We show that skulls relative to control stimuli delay responses to life-related words but speed responses to death-related words. Skulls compared to the control stimuli induce early deactivations in the posterior ventral temporal cortex followed by activations in the posterior and anterior ventral temporal cortices. The early and late neural modulations by perceived skulls respectively predict skull-induced changes of behavioral responses to life- and death-related words and the early neural modulation further predicts death anxiety. Our findings decompose skull-induced death awareness into two-stage neural processes of a lifeless state of a former life.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Neuroanatomy and Behaviour in Mice with a Haploinsufficiency of AT-Rich Interactive Domain 1B (ARID1B) Throughout Development</title>

	<description>One of the causal mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) is chromatin modification, and genes that regulate chromatin modify and control events regulating the formation of neural connections. AT-Rich Interactive Domain 1B (ARID1B), a chromatin modifier, has been shown to be reduced in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and to affect rare and inherited genetic variation in a broad set of NDDs. For this work, a novel preclinical mouse model of Arid1b deficiency was created and molecularly validated to characterize and define neuroanatomical, behavioural and transcriptional phenotypes. Brains of adult Arid1b+/- mice had a smaller cerebellum along with a larger hippocampus and corpus callosum. In addition, a notable sex dependence was observed throughout development; males had an early emergence of the neuroanatomical phenotype around postnatal day 7, whereas females had a delayed emergence of the phenotype around postnatal day 40. Behavioural assays relevant to NDD were conducted during neonatal development and adulthood to evaluate general health, anxiety-like, motor, cognitive, and social behaviours in Arid1b+/- mice. During neonatal development, Arid1b+/- mice exhibited robust impairments in ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and metrics of developmental growth. As adults, Arid1b+/- mice showed low motor skills in open field exploration and normal three chambered approach. Arid1b+/- mice had learning and memory deficits in novel object recognition but surprisingly not in visual discrimination and reversal touchscreen tasks. Social interactions in the male-female social dyad with USVs revealed social deficits on some but not all parameters. No repetitive behaviours were observed. This study represents a full investigation of Arid1b+/- haploinsufficiency throughout development and highlights the importance of examining both sexes throughout development in NDDs.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Can genetic polymorphisms predict response variability to anodal transcranial direct current stimulation of the primary motor cortex?</title>

	<description>Genetic mediation of cortical plasticity and the role genetic variants play in previously observed response variability to transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have become important issues in the tDCS literature in recent years. This study investigated whether inter-individual variability to tDCS was in-part genetically mediated. In sixty-one healthy males, anodal-tDCS (a-tDCS) and sham-tDCS were administered to the primary motor cortex at 1mA for 10-minutes via 6x4cm active and 7x5cm return electrodes. Twenty-five single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded to represent corticospinal excitability (CSE). Twenty-five paired-pulse MEPs were recorded with 3ms inter-stimulus interval (ISI) to assess intracortical inhibition (ICI) via short interval intracranial inhibition (SICI) and 10ms ISI for intracortical facilitation (ICF). Saliva samples tested for specific genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding for excitatory and inhibitory neuroreceptors. Individuals were sub-grouped based on a pre-determined threshold and via statistical cluster analysis. Two distinct subgroups were identified, increases in CSE following a-tDCS (i.e. Responders) and no increase or even reductions in CSE (i.e. Non-responders). No changes in ICI or ICF were reported. No relationships were reported between genetic polymorphisms in excitatory receptor genes and a-tDCS responders. An association was reported between a-tDCS responders and GABRA3 gene polymorphisms encoding for GABA-A receptors suggesting potential relationships between GABA-A receptor variations and capacity to undergo tDCS induced cortical plasticity. In the largest tDCS study of its kind, this study presents an important step forward in determining the contribution genetic factors play in previously observed inter-individual variability to tDCS.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Measuring robust functional connectivity from resting-state MEG using amplitude and entropy correlation across frequency-bands and temporal scales</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.31.017749v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.31.017749v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Recent studies have shown how MEG can reveal spatial patterns of functional connectivity using frequency-specific oscillatory coupling measures and that these may be modified in disease. However, there is a need to understand both how repeatable these patterns are across participants and how these measures relate to the moment-to-moment variability (or 'irregularity') of neural activity seen in healthy brain function. In this study, we used Multi-scale Rank-Vector Entropy (MRVE) to calculate the dynamic timecourses of signal variability over a range of temporal scales. The correlation of MRVE timecourses was then used to detect functional connections in resting state MEG recordings that were robust over 183 participants and varied with temporal scale. We then compared these MRVE connectivity patterns to those derived using more standard amplitude-amplitude coupling measures, using methods designed to quantify the consistency of these patterns across participants. Using oscillatory amplitude envelope correlation (AEC), the most consistent connectivity patterns, across the cohort, were seen in the alpha and beta frequency bands. At fine temporal scales (corresponding to 'scale frequencies', fs = 30-150Hz), MRVE correlation detected mostly occipital and parietal connections and these showed high similarity with the networks identified by AEC in the alpha and beta frequency bands. The most consistent connectivity profiles between participants were given by MRVE correlation at fs = 75Hz and AEC in the beta band. It was also found that average mid- to fine scale variability within each region (fs ~ 10-150Hz) negatively correlated with the region's overall connectivity strength with other brain areas, as measured by fine scale MRVE correlation (fs ~ 30-150Hz) and by alpha and beta band AEC. These findings suggest that local activity at frequencies fs [≥] 10Hz becomes more regular when a region exhibits high levels of resting state connectivity.</description>

	<description>Learning to associate sensory stimuli with a chosen action has been classically attributed to the cortex. Whether the thalamus, considered mainly as an upstream area relative to cortex, encodes learning-related information is still largely unknown. We studied learning-related activity in the dorsal and medial regions of the medial geniculate body (MGB), part of the non-lemniscal auditory pathway. Using fiber photometry, we continuously imaged population calcium dynamics as mice learned a go/no-go auditory discrimination task. The MGB was tuned to frequency shortly after stimulus onset and responded to cognitive features like the choice of the mouse several hundred milliseconds later. Encoding of choice in the MGB increased with learning, and was highly correlated with the learning curves of the mice. MGB also encoded motor parameters of the mouse during the task. These results provide evidence that the MGB encodes task- motor- and learning-related information.</description>

	<description>Ischemic stroke is one of the most common neurological disease. However, the impact of ischemic stroke on human cerebral tissue remains largely unknown; due to a lack of ischemic human brain samples. In this study, we used cerebral organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells to evaluate the effect of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). We identified 15 differentially expressed genes (DEGs); and found that all the DEGs were downregulated. Pathway analysis showed the relationship of vitamin digestion and absorption, fat digestion and absorption, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway, and complement and coagulation cascades. These findings indicate the mechanisms underlying ischemic injury in human cerebral tissue.</description>

	<description>The primary motor cortex (M1) is essential for voluntary fine motor control and is functionally conserved across mammals. Using high-throughput transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of over 450,000 single nuclei in human, marmoset monkey, and mouse, we demonstrate a broadly conserved cellular makeup of this region, whose similarity mirrors evolutionary distance and is consistent between the transcriptome and epigenome. The core conserved molecular identity of neuronal and non-neuronal types allowed the generation of a cross-species consensus cell type classification and inference of conserved cell type properties across species. Despite overall conservation, many species specializations were apparent, including differences in cell type proportions, gene expression, DNA methylation, and chromatin state. Few cell type marker genes were conserved across species, providing a short list of candidate genes and regulatory mechanisms responsible for conserved features of homologous cell types, such as the GABAergic chandelier cells. This consensus transcriptomic classification allowed the Patch-seq identification of layer 5 (L5) corticospinal Betz cells in non-human primate and human and characterization of their highly specialized physiology and anatomy. These findings highlight the robust molecular underpinnings of cell type diversity in M1 across mammals and point to the genes and regulatory pathways responsible for the functional identity of cell types and their species-specific adaptations.</description>

	<description>Theta oscillations in the hippocampus have many behavioural correlates, with the magnitude and vigour of ongoing movement being the most salient. Many consider correlates of locomotion with hippocampal theta to be a confound in delineating theta contributions to cognitive processes. But, theory and empirical experiments suggest theta-movement relationships are important if spatial navigation is to support higher cognitive processes. In the current study, we tested if variations in speed modulation of hippocampal theta can predict spatial learning rates in the water maze. Using multi-step regression, we find the magnitude and robustness of hippocampal theta frequency versus speed scaling can predict water maze learning rates. Using generalised linear models, we also demonstrate that speed and water maze learning are the best predictors of hippocampal theta frequency and power. Theta oscillations recorded from the supramammillary area showed much weaker, or non-existent, relationships supporting the idea that hippocampal theta has specific roles in speed representation and spatial learning. Our findings suggest movement-speed correlations with hippocampal theta frequency may be actively used in spatial learning.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Brain-wide structural and functional disruption in mice with oligodendrocyte specific Nf1 deletion is rescued by inhibition of NOS</title>

	<description>Neurofibromin gene (NF1) mutation causes Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a disorder in which brain white matter deficits identified by neuroimaging are common, yet of unknown cellular etiology. In mice, Nf1 loss in adult oligodendrocyte causes myelin decompaction, and increases oligodendrocyte nitric oxide (NO) levels. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors rescue this pathology. Whether oligodendrocyte pathology is sufficient to affect brain-wide structure and account for NF1 imaging findings is unknown. Here, we show that Nf1 gene inactivation in adult oligodendrocytes (Plp-Nf1fl/+ mice) results in a motor coordination deficit. Magnetic resonance imaging in awake mice shows that fractional anisotropy is reduced in Plp-Nf1fl/+ corpus callosum and that interhemispheric functional connectivity in motor cortex is also reduced, consistent with disrupted myelin integrity. Further, NOS-specific inhibition rescued both measures. These results demonstrate that oligodendrocyte defects account for aspects of brain dysfunction in NF1, which can be identified by neuroimaging and ameliorated by NOS inhibition.</description>

	<description>Objective: We explore the long-term performance and stability of seven percutanous Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (USEAs) and intramuscular recording leads (iEMGs) implanted chronically in the residual arm nerves and muscles of three human amputees as a means to permanently restore sensorimotor function after upper-limb. Approach. We quantify the number of functional recording and functional stimulating electrodes over time. We also calculate the signal-to-noise ratio of USEA and iEMG recordings and quantify the stimulation amplitude necessary to evoke detectable sensory percepts. Furthermore, we quantify the consistency of the sensory modality, receptive field location, and receptive field size of USEA-evoked percepts. Main Results: In the most recent subject, involving USEAs with technical improvements, neural recordings persisted for 502 days (entire implant duration) and the number of functional recording electrodes for one USEA increased over time. However, for six out of seven USEAs the number of functional recording electrodes decreased within the first two months after implantation. The signal-to-noise ratio of neural recordings and electromyographic recordings stayed relatively consistent over time. Sensory percepts were consistently evoked over the span of 14 months, were not significantly different in size, and highlighted the nerves' fascicular organization. The percentage of percepts with consistent modality or consistent receptive field location between sessions (~1 month apart) varied between 0-86.2% and 9.1-100%, respectively. Stimulation thresholds and electrode impedances increased initially but then remained relatively stable over time. Significance: This work demonstrates improved performance of USEAs, and provides a basis for comparing the longevity and stability of USEAs to that of other neural interfaces. Although USEAs provide a rich repertoire of neural recordings and sensory percepts, performance still generally declines over time. Future work should leverage the results presented here to further improve USEA design or to develop adaptive algorithms that can maintain a high level of performance.</description>

	<description>Coordinating among the demands of the external environment and internal plans requires cognitive control supported by a fronto-parietal control network (FPCN). Evidence suggests that multiple control systems span the FPCN whose operations are poorly understood. Previously (Nee and D'Esposito, 2016; 2017), we detailed frontal dynamics that support control processing, but left open their role in broader cortical function. Here, I show that the FPCN consists of an external/present-oriented to internal/future-oriented cortical gradient extending outwardly from sensory-motor cortices. Areas at the ends of this gradient act in a segregative manner, exciting areas at the same level, but suppressing areas at different levels. By contrast, areas in the middle of the gradient excite areas at all levels, promoting integration of control processing. Individual differences in integrative dynamics predict higher-level cognitive ability and amenability to neuromodulation. These data suggest that an intermediary zone within the FPCN underlies integrative processing that supports cognitive control.</description>

	<description>In sensory circuits with poor feature topography, stimulus-specific feedback inhibition necessitates carefully tuned synaptic circuitry. Recent experimental data from mouse primary visual cortex (V1) show that synapses between pyramidal neurons and parvalbumin-expressing (PV) inhibitory interneurons tend to be stronger for neurons that respond to similar stimulus features. The mechanism that underlies the formation of such excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) assemblies is unresolved. Here, we show that activity-dependent synaptic plasticity on input and output synapses of PV interneurons generates a circuit structure that is consistent with mouse V1. Using a computational model, we show that both forms of plasticity must act synergistically to form the observed E/I assemblies. Once established, these assemblies produce a stimulus-specific competition between pyramidal neurons. Our model suggests that activity-dependent plasticity can enable inhibitory circuits to actively shape cortical computations.</description>

	<description>Neocortical circuit computations underlying active vision are performed by a distributed network of reciprocally connected, functionally specialized areas. Mouse visual cortex is a dense, hierarchically organized network, comprising subnetworks that form preferentially interconnected processing streams. To determine the detailed layout of the mouse visual hierarchy, laminar patterns formed by interareal axonal projections, originating in each of ten visual areas were analyzed. Reciprocally connected pairs of areas, and shared targets of pairs of source areas, exhibited structural features consistent with a hierarchical organization. Beta regression analyses, which estimated a continuous measure of hierarchical distance, indicated that the network comprises multiple hierarchies embedded within overlapping processing levels. Single unit recordings showed that within each processing stream, receptive field sizes typically increased with increasing hierarchical level; however, ventral stream areas showed overall larger receptive field diameters. Together, the results reveal canonical and noncanonical hierarchical network motifs in mouse visual cortex.</description>

	<description>Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques delivered to cortical motor areas have been shown previously to: modulate cortical motor excitability; entrain brain oscillations; and influence motor behavior; and have therefore attracted considerable interest as potential therapeutic approaches targeted for the treatment of movement disorders. However, these techniques are most often not suitable for treatment outside of the clinic, or for use with young children. We therefore investigated directly whether rhythmic pulses of median nerve stimulation (MNS) could be used to entrain brain oscillations linked to the suppression of movement. Using electroencephalography techniques together with concurrent MNS we demonstrate that 10 pulses of rhythmic MNS, delivered at 19Hz, is sufficient to entrain Beta-band brain oscillations within the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, whereas 10-pulse trains of arrhythmic MNS does not. This approach has potential in our view to be developed into a non-drug therapeutic device suitable for use outside of the research laboratory or the clinic with brain health conditions associated by excessive movements.</description>

Protein structure determines biological function. Accurately conceptualizing 3D protein/ligand structures is thus vital to scientific research and education. Virtual reality (VR) enables protein visualization in stereoscopic 3D, but many VR molecular-visualization programs are expensive and challenging to use; work only on specific VR headsets; rely on complicated model-preparation software; and/or require the user to install separate programs or plugins. Here we introduce ProteinVR, a web-based application that works on various VR setups and operating systems. ProteinVR displays molecular structures within 3D environments that give useful biological context and allow users to situate themselves in 3D space. Our web-based implementation is ideal for hypothesis generation and education in research and large-classroom settings. We release ProteinVR under the open-source BSD-3-Clause license. A copy of the program is available free of charge from http://durrantlab.com/protein-vr/, and a working version can be accessed at http://durrantlab.com/pvr/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v_Hjpdfwolo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Spatial analyses of pathogen occurrence in their natural surroundings entail unique opportunities for assessing in vivo drivers of disease epidemiology. Such studies are however confronted by the complexity of the landscape driving epidemic spread and disease persistence. Since relevant information on how the landscape influences epidemiological dynamics is rarely available, simple spatial models of spread are often used. In the current study we demonstrate both how more complex transmission pathways could be incorpoted to epidemiological analyses and how this can offer novel insights into understanding disease spread across the landscape. Our study is focused on &lt;i&gt;Podosphaera plantaginis&lt;/i&gt;, a powdery mildew pathogen that transmits from one host plant to another by wind-dispersed spores. Its host populations often reside next to roads and thus we hypothesize that the road network influences the epidemiology of &lt;i&gt;P. plantaginis&lt;/i&gt;. To analyse the impact of roads on the transmission dynamics, we consider a spatial dataset on the presence-absence records on the pathogen collected from a fragmented landscape of host populations. Using both mechanistic transmission modeling and statistical modeling with road-network summary statistics as predictors, we conclude the evident role of the road network in the progression of the epidemics: a phenomena which is manifested both in the enhanced transmission along the roads and in infections typically occurring at the central hub locations of the road network. We also demonstrate how the road network affects the spread of the pathogen using simulations. Jointly our results highlight how human alteration of natural landscapes may increase disease spread.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4FS5-GTdITw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Icosahedral viral capsids must undergo conformational rearrangements to coordinate essential processes during the viral life cycle. Capturing such conformational flexibility has been technically challenging yet could be key for developing rational therapeutic agents to combat infections. Noroviruses are nonenveloped, icosahedral viruses of global importance to human health. They are a common cause of acute gastroenteritis, yet no vaccines or specific antiviral agents are available. Here, we use genetics and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to study the high-resolution solution structures of murine norovirus as a model for human viruses. By comparing our 3 structures (at 2.9- to 3.1-Å resolution), we show that whilst there is little change to the shell domain of the capsid, the radiating protruding domains are flexible, adopting distinct states both independently and synchronously. In doing so, the capsids sample a range of conformational space, with implications for maintaining virion stability and infectivity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/xAeZ9_qOVGY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral data shows that humans and animals have the capacity to learn rules of associations applied to specific examples, and generalize these rules to a broad variety of contexts. This article focuses on neural circuit mechanisms to perform a context‐dependent association task that requires linking sensory stimuli to behavioral responses and generalizing to multiple other symmetrical contexts. The model uses neural gating units that regulate the pattern of physiological connectivity within the circuit. These neural gating units can be used in a learning framework that performs low‐rank matrix factorization analogous to recommender systems, allowing generalization with high accuracy to a wide range of additional symmetrical contexts. The neural gating units are trained with a biologically inspired framework involving traces of Hebbian modification that are updated based on the correct behavioral output of the network. This modeling demonstrates potential neural mechanisms for learning context‐dependent association rules and for the change in selectivity of neurophysiological responses in the hippocampus. The proposed computational model is evaluated using simulations of the learning process and the application of the model to new stimuli. Further, human subject behavioral experiments were performed and the results validate the key observation of a low‐rank synaptic matrix structure linking stimuli to responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Grid coding, spatial representation, and navigation: Should we assume an isomorphism?</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grid cells provide a compelling example of a link between cellular activity and an abstract and difficult to define concept like space. Accordingly, a &lt;i&gt;representational&lt;/i&gt; perspective on grid coding argues that neural grid coding underlies a fundamentally spatial metric. Recently, some theoretical proposals have suggested extending such a framework to nonspatial cognition as well, such as category learning. Here, we provide a critique of the frequently employed assumption of an isomorphism between patterns of neural activity (e.g., grid cells), mental representation, and behavior (e.g., navigation). Specifically, we question the strict isomorphism between these three levels and suggest that human spatial navigation is perhaps best characterized by a wide variety of both metric and nonmetric strategies. We offer an alternative perspective on how grid coding might relate to human spatial navigation, arguing that grid coding is part of a much larger conglomeration of neural activity patterns that dynamically tune to accomplish specific behavioral outputs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Hippocampal spike‐time correlations and place field overlaps during open field foraging</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase precessing place cells encode spatial information on fine timescales via the timing of their spikes. This phase code has been extensively studied on linear tracks and for short runs in the open field. However, less is known about the phase code on unconstrained trajectories lasting tens of minutes, typical of open field foraging. In previous work (Monsalve‐Mercado and Leibold, Physical Review Letters, 119, 38101 (2017)), an analytic expression was derived for the spike‐time cross‐correlation between phase precessing place cells during natural foraging in the open field. This expression makes two predictions on how this phase code differs from the linear track case: cross‐correlations are symmetric with respect to time, and they represent the distance between pairs of place fields in that the theta‐filtered cross‐correlations around zero time lag are positive for cells with nearby fields while they are negative for those with fields further apart. Here we analyze several available open field recordings and show that these predictions hold for pairs of CA1 place cells. We also show that the relationship remains during remapping in CA1, and it is also present in place cells in area CA3. For CA1 place cells of Fmr1‐null mice, which exhibit normal place fields but somewhat weaker temporal coordination with respect to theta compared to wild type, the cross‐correlations still remain symmetric but the relationship to place field overlap is largely lost. The relationship discussed here describes how spatial information is communicated by place cells to downstream areas in a finer theta‐timescale, relevant for learning and memory formation in behavioral tasks lasting tens of minutes in the open field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearby grid cells have been observed to express a remarkable degree of long‐range order, which is often idealized as extending potentially to infinity. Yet their strict periodic firing and ensemble coherence are theoretically possible only in flat environments, much unlike the burrows which rodents usually live in. Are the symmetrical, coherent grid maps inferred in the lab relevant to chart their way in their natural habitat? We consider spheres as simple models of curved environments and waiting for the appropriate experiments to be performed, we use our adaptation model to predict what grid maps would emerge in a network with the same type of recurrent connections, which on the plane produce coherence among the units. We find that on the sphere such connections distort the maps that single grid units would express on their own, and aggregate them into clusters. When remapping to a different spherical environment, units in each cluster maintain only partial coherence, similar to what is observed in disordered materials, such as spin glasses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Spike conduction velocity characteristically differs between myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Here we test whether spikes of myelinated and unmyelinated paths differ in other respects by measuring rat retinal ganglion cell (RGC) spike duration in the intraretinal, unmyelinated nerve fiber layer and the extraretinal, myelinated optic nerve and optic chiasm. We find that rapid spike firing and illumination broaden spikes in intraretinal axons but not in extraretinal axons. RGC axons thus initiate spikes intraretinally and normalize spike duration extraretinally. Additionally, we analyze spikes that were recorded in a previous study of rhesus macaque retinogeniculate transmission and find that rapid spike firing does not broaden spikes in optic tract. The spike normalization we find reduces the number of spike properties that can change during RGC light responses. However, this is not because identical spikes fire in all axons. Instead, our recordings show that different subtypes of RGC generate axonal spikes of different durations and that the differences resemble spike duration increases that alter neurotransmitter release from other neurons. Moreover, previous studies have shown that RGC spikes of shorter duration can fire at higher maximum frequencies. These properties should facilitate signal transfer by different mechanisms at RGC synapses onto subcortical target neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: An uncertainty principle for neural coding: Conjugate representations of position and velocity are mapped onto firing rates and co‐firing rates of neural spike trains</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampal system contains neural populations that encode an animal's position and velocity as it navigates through space. Here, we show that such populations can embed two codes within their spike trains: a &lt;i&gt;firing rate code&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;) conveyed by within‐cell spike intervals, and a &lt;i&gt;co‐firing rate code&lt;/i&gt; () conveyed by between‐cell spike intervals. These two codes behave as &lt;i&gt;conjugates&lt;/i&gt; of one another, obeying an analog of the uncertainty principle from physics: information conveyed in &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; comes at the expense of information in , and vice versa. An exception to this trade‐off occurs when spike trains encode a pair of conjugate variables, such as position and velocity, which do not compete for capacity across &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; and . To illustrate this, we describe two biologically inspired methods for decoding &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; and , referred to as &lt;i&gt;sigma&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;sigma‐chi&lt;/i&gt; decoding, respectively. Simulations of head direction and grid cells show that if firing rates are tuned for position (but not velocity), then position is recovered by sigma decoding, whereas velocity is recovered by sigma‐chi decoding. Conversely, simulations of oscillatory interference among theta‐modulated “speed cells” show that if co‐firing rates are tuned for position (but not velocity), then position is recovered by sigma‐chi decoding, whereas velocity is recovered by sigma decoding. Between these two extremes, information about both variables can be distributed across both channels, and partially recovered by both decoders. These results suggest that populations with different spatial and temporal tuning properties—such as speed versus grid cells—might not encode different information, but rather, distribute similar information about position and velocity in different ways across &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; and . Such conjugate coding of position and velocity may influence how hippocampal populations are interconnected to form functional circuits, and how biological neurons integrate their inputs to decode information from firing rates and spike correlations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex are notoriously variable in their responses, despite the striking hexagonal arrangement of their spatial firing fields. Indeed, when the animal moves through a firing field, grid cells often fire much more vigorously than predicted or do not fire at all. The source of this trial‐to‐trial variability is not completely understood. By analyzing grid‐cell spike trains from mice running in open arenas and on linear tracks, we characterize the phenomenon of “missed” firing fields using the statistical theory of zero inflation. We find that one major cause of grid‐cell variability lies in the spatial representation itself: firing fields are not as strongly anchored to spatial location as the averaged grid suggests. In addition, grid fields from different cells drift together from trial to trial, regardless of whether the environment is real or virtual, or whether the animal moves in light or darkness. Spatial realignment across trials sharpens the grid representation, yielding firing fields that are more pronounced and significantly narrower. These findings indicate that ensembles of grid cells encode relative position more reliably than absolute position.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Spatial coordinate transforms linking the allocentric hippocampal and egocentric parietal primate brain systems for memory, action in space, and navigation</title>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23171?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A theory and model of spatial coordinate transforms in the dorsal visual system through the parietal cortex that enable an interface via posterior cingulate and related retrosplenial cortex to allocentric spatial representations in the primate hippocampus is described. First, a new approach to coordinate transform learning in the brain is proposed, in which the traditional gain modulation is complemented by temporal trace rule competitive network learning. It is shown in a computational model that the new approach works much more precisely than gain modulation alone, by enabling neurons to represent the different combinations of signal and gain modulator more accurately. This understanding may have application to many brain areas where coordinate transforms are learned. Second, a set of coordinate transforms is proposed for the dorsal visual system/parietal areas that enables a representation to be formed in allocentric spatial view coordinates. The input stimulus is merely a stimulus at a given position in retinal space, and the gain modulation signals needed are eye position, head direction, and place, all of which are present in the primate brain. Neurons that encode the bearing to a landmark are involved in the coordinate transforms. Part of the importance here is that the coordinates of the allocentric view produced in this model are the same as those of spatial view cells that respond to allocentric view recorded in the primate hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex. The result is that information from the dorsal visual system can be used to update the spatial input to the hippocampus in the appropriate allocentric coordinate frame, including providing for idiothetic update to allow for self‐motion. It is further shown how hippocampal spatial view cells could be useful for the transform from hippocampal allocentric coordinates to egocentric coordinates useful for actions in space and for navigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: A comprehensive knowledge base of synaptic electrophysiology in the rodent hippocampal formation</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cellular and synaptic architecture of the rodent hippocampus has been described in thousands of peer‐reviewed publications. However, no human‐ or machine‐readable public catalog of synaptic electrophysiology data exists for this or any other neural system. Harnessing state‐of‐the‐art information technology, we have developed a cloud‐based toolset for identifying empirical evidence from the scientific literature pertaining to synaptic electrophysiology, for extracting the experimental data of interest, and for linking each entry to relevant text or figure excerpts. Mining more than 1,200 published journal articles, we have identified eight different signal modalities quantified by 90 different methods to measure synaptic amplitude, kinetics, and plasticity in hippocampal neurons. We have designed a data structure that both reflects the differences and maintains the existing relations among experimental modalities. Moreover, we mapped every annotated experiment to identified potential connections, that is, specific pairs of presynaptic and postsynaptic neuron types. To this aim, we leveraged &lt;a href=&quot;http://hippocampome.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;Hippocampome.org&lt;/a&gt;, an open‐access knowledge base of morphologically, electrophysiologically, and molecularly characterized neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation. Specifically, we have implemented a computational pipeline to systematically translate neuron type properties into formal queries in order to find all compatible potential connections. With this system, we have collected nearly 40,000 synaptic data entities covering 88% of the 3,120 potential connections in &lt;a href=&quot;http://hippocampome.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;Hippocampome.org&lt;/a&gt;. Correcting membrane potentials with respect to liquid junction potentials significantly reduced the difference between theoretical and experimental reversal potentials, thereby enabling the accurate conversion of all synaptic amplitudes to conductance. This data set allows for large‐scale hypothesis testing of the general rules governing synaptic signals. To illustrate these applications, we confirmed several expected correlations between synaptic measurements and their covariates while suggesting previously unreported ones. We release all data open‐source at &lt;a href=&quot;http://hippocampome.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;Hippocampome.org&lt;/a&gt; in order to further research across disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A bump attractor network is a model that implements a competitive neuronal
process emerging from a spike pattern related to an input source. Since the
bump network could behave in many ways, this paper explores some critical
limits of the parameter space using various positive and negative weights and
an increasing size of the input spike sources The neuromorphic simulation of
the bumpattractor network shows that it exhibits a stationary, a splitting and
a divergent spike pattern, in relation to different sets of weights and input
windows. The balance between the values of positive and negative weights is
important in determining the splitting or diverging behaviour of the spike
train pattern and in defining the minimal firing conditions.

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Excessive β-Catenin in Excitatory Neurons Results in Reduced Social and Increased Repetitive Behaviors and Altered Expression of Multiple Genes Linked to Human Autism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00014</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00014</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple human autism risk genes are predicted to converge on the β-catenin (β-cat)/Wnt pathway. However, direct tests to link β-cat up- or down-regulation with autism are largely lacking, and the associated pathophysiological changes are poorly defined. Here we identify excessive β-cat as a risk factor that causes expression changes in several genes relevant to human autism. Our studies utilize mouse lines with β-cat dysregulation in forebrain excitatory neurons, identified as cell types with a convergent expression of autism-linked genes in both human and mouse brains. We show that mice expressing excessive β-cat display behavioral and molecular changes, including decreased social interest, increased repetitive behaviors, reduced parvalbumin and altered expression levels of additional genes identified as potential risk factors for human autism. These behavioral and molecular phenotypes are averted by reducing β-cat in neurons predisposed by gene mutations to express elevated β-cat. Using next-generation sequencing of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), we identify 87 dysregulated genes that are shared between mouse lines with excessive β-cat and autism-like behaviors, but not mouse lines with reduced β-cat and normal social behavior. Our findings provide critical new insights into β-cat, Wnt pathway dysregulation in the brain causing behavioral phenotypes relevant to the disease and the molecular etiology which includes several human autism risk genes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Anterior Commissure Regulates Neuronal Activity of Amygdalae and Influences Locomotor Activity, Social Interaction and Fear Memory in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00047</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The two hemispheres of the vertebrate brain are connected through several commissures. Although the anterior commissure (AC) is the most conserved white matter structure in the brains of different vertebrates, its complete physiological functionality remains elusive. Since the AC is involved in the connection between two amygdalae and because amygdalae are critical for emotional behaviors and social interaction, we assessed amygdalar activity and function to investigate the physiological role of the AC. We first performed ex vivo electrophysiological recording on mouse brains to demonstrate that the AC delivers a positive signal to facilitate synaptic responses and to recruit basolateral amygdalar neurons via glutamatergic synapses. Transection was then undertaken to investigate the role of the AC in vivo. Results from in vivo optogenetic stimulation suggest that AC transection impairs mutual activation between two basolateral amygdalae. Behavioral analyses were then used to assess if AC surgical lesioning results in hyperactivity, anxiety, social reduction or learning/memory impairment, which are behavioral features associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders. We found that AC transection results in higher locomotor activity, aberrant social interaction and reduced associative memory, but not anxiety. Moreover, systemic administration of D-cycloserine, a coagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, ameliorated auditory fear memory in AC-transected mice, reinforcing our evidence that the AC potentiates the activity of basolateral amygdalae. Our study suggests that the AC regulates basolateral amygdalar activity and influences neuropsychiatry-related behaviors in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Roles of VMP1 in Autophagy and ER–Membrane Contact: Potential Implications in Neurodegenerative Disorders</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cellular communication processes are highly dynamic and mediated, at least in part, by contacts between various membrane structures. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the major biosynthetic organelle of the cell, establishes an extensive network with other membrane structures to regulate the transport of intracellular molecules. Vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1), an ER-localized metazoan-specific protein, plays important roles in the formation of autophagosomes and communication between the ER and other organelles, including mitochondria, autophagosome precursor membranes, Golgi, lipid droplets, and endosomes. Increasing evidence has indicated that autophagy and ER–membrane communication at membrane contact sites are closely related to neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this review, we summarize the roles of VMP1 in autophagy and ER–membrane contacts and discuss their potential implications in neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Force Control and Motor Unit Firing Behavior Following Mental Fatigue in Young Female and Male Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00015</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00015</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: The neuromuscular mechanisms leading to impaired motor performance in the presence of mental fatigue remain unclear. It is also unknown if mental fatigue differentially impacts motor performance in males and females. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of mental fatigue on force production and motor unit (MU) firing behavior in males and females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Nineteen participants performed 10-s isometric dorsiflexion (DF) contractions at 20 and 50% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) before, during, and after completing 22 min of the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), to induce mental fatigue. The DF force and indwelling MU firing behavior of the tibialis anterior (TA) was measured before and immediately following the PVT and within the first and final minutes of the PVT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Force steadiness and motor unit firing rate (MUFR) variability did not change during or following the PVT at either contraction intensity (p ≥ 0.16). Overall, females had more variability than males in MUFR during the 20% MVCs (15.98 ± 2.19 vs. 13.64 ± 2.19%, p = 0.03), though no sex differences were identified during the 50% MVCs (p = 0.20). Mean MUFR decreased following mental fatigue in both sexes in the 20% MVC condition (14.79 ± 3.20 vs. 12.92 ± 2.53 Hz, p = 0.02), but only in males during the 50% MVC condition (18.65 ± 5.21 vs. 15.03 ± 2.60 Hz, p = 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These results suggest possible sex and contraction intensity-specific neuromuscular changes in the presence of mental fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Role of Alterations in Protein Kinase p38γ in the Pathogenesis of the Synaptic Pathology in Dementia With Lewy Bodies and α-Synuclein Transgenic Models</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00286</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Progressive accumulation of the pre-synaptic protein α-synuclein (α-syn) has been strongly associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders of the aging population such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy. While the precise mechanisms are not fully understood, alterations in kinase pathways including that of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 have been proposed to play a role. In AD, p38α activation has been linked to neuro-inflammation while alterations in p38γ have been associated with tau phosphorylation. Although p38 has been studied in AD, less is known about its role in DLB/PD and other α-synucleinopathies. For this purpose, we investigated the expression of the p38 family in brains from α-syn overexpressing transgenic mice (α-syn Tg: Line 61) and patients with DLB/PD. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that in healthy human controls and non-Tg mice, p38α associated with neurons and astroglial cells and p38γ localized to pre-synaptic terminals. In DLB and α-syn Tg brains, however, p38α levels were increased in astroglial cells while p38γ immunostaining was redistributed from the synaptic terminals to the neuronal cell bodies. Double immunolabeling further showed that p38γ colocalized with α-syn aggregates in DLB patients, and immunoblot and qPCR analysis confirmed the increased levels of p38α and p38γ. α1-syntrophin, a synaptic target of p38γ, was present in the neuropil and some neuronal cell bodies in human controls and non-Tg mice. In DLB and and Tg mice, however, α1-syntrophin was decreased in the neuropil and instead colocalized with α-syn in intra-neuronal inclusions. In agreement with these findings, in vitro studies showed that α-syn co-immunoprecipitates with p38γ, but not p38α. These results suggest that α-syn might interfere with the p38γ pathway and play a role in the mechanisms of synaptic dysfunction in DLB/PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: fMRI-Targeted High-Angular Resolution Diffusion MR Tractography to Identify Functional Language Tracts in Healthy Controls and Glioma Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00225</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;MR Tractography enables non-invasive preoperative depiction of language subcortical tracts, which is crucial for the presurgical work-up of brain tumors; however, it cannot evaluate the exact function of the fibers.&lt;/p&gt;Purpose&lt;p&gt;A systematic pipeline was developed to combine tractography reconstruction of language fiber bundles, based on anatomical landmarks (Anatomical-T), with language fMRI cortical activations. A fMRI-targeted Tractography (fMRI-T) was thus obtained, depicting the subsets of the anatomical tracts whose endpoints are located inside a fMRI activation. We hypothesized that fMRI-T could provide additional functional information regarding the subcortical structures, better reflecting the eloquent white matter structures identified intraoperatively.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Both Anatomical-T and fMRI-T of language fiber tracts were performed on 16 controls and preoperatively on 16 patients with left-hemisphere brain tumors, using a q-ball residual bootstrap algorithm based on High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) datasets (b = 3000 s/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; 60 directions); fMRI ROIs were obtained using picture naming, verbal fluency, and auditory verb generation tasks. In healthy controls, normalized MNI atlases of fMRI-T and Anatomical-T were obtained. In patients, the surgical resection of the tumor was pursued by identifying eloquent structures with intraoperative direct electrical stimulation mapping and extending surgery to the functional boundaries. Post-surgical MRI allowed to identify Anatomical-T and fMRI-T non-eloquent portions removed during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;MNI Atlases showed that fMRI-T is a subset of Anatomical-T, and that different task-specific fMRI-T involve both shared subsets and task-specific subsets – e.g., verbal fluency fMRI-T strongly involves dorsal frontal tracts, consistently with the phonogical-articulatory features of this task. A quantitative analysis in patients revealed that Anatomical-T removed portions of AF-SLF and IFOF were significantly greater than verbal fluency fMRI-T ones, suggesting that fMRI-T is a more specific approach. In addition, qualitative analyses showed that fMRI-T AF-SLF and IFOF predict the exact functional limits of resection with increased specificity when compared to Anatomical-T counterparts, especially the superior frontal portion of IFOF, in a subcohort of patients.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that performing fMRI-T in addition to the ‘classic’ Anatomical-T may be useful in a preoperative setting to identify the ‘high-risk subsets’ that should be spared during the surgical procedure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Higher Sensitivity and Reproducibility of Wavelet-Based Amplitude of Resting-State fMRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00224</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is a widely used algorithm used to depict the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). Wavelet transform (WT) is more effective in representing the complex waveform due to its adaptivity to non-stationary or local features of data and many varieties of wavelet functions with different shapes being available. However, there is a paucity of RS-fMRI studies that systematically compare between the results of FFT versus WT. The present study employed five cohorts of datasets and compared the sensitivity and reproducibility of FFT-ALFF with those of Wavelet-ALFF based on five mother wavelets (namely, db2, bior4.4, morl, meyr, and sym3). In addition to the conventional frequency band of 0.0117–0.0781 Hz, a comparison was performed in sub-bands, namely, Slow-6 (0–0.0117 Hz), Slow-5 (0.0117–0.0273 Hz), Slow-4 (0.0273–0.0742 Hz), Slow-3 (0.0742–0.1992 Hz), and Slow-2 (0.1992–0.25 Hz). The results indicated that the Wavelet-ALFF of all five mother wavelets was generally more sensitive and reproducible than FFT-ALFF in all frequency bands. Specifically, in the higher frequency band Slow-2 (0.1992–0.25 Hz), the mean sensitivity of db2-ALFF results was 1.54 times that of FFT-ALFF, and the reproducibility of db2-ALFF results was 2.95 times that of FFT-ALFF. The findings suggest that wavelet-ALFF can replace FFT-ALFF, especially in the higher frequency band. Future studies should test more mother wavelets on other RS-fMRI metrics and multiple datasets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Neurodegenerative Diseases – Is Metabolic Deficiency the Root Cause?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00213</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00213</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are a prominent class of neurological diseases currently without a cure. They are characterized by an inexorable loss of a specific type of neurons. The selective vulnerability of specific neuronal clusters (typically a subcortical cluster) in the early stages, followed by the spread of the disease to higher cortical areas, is a typical pattern of disease progression. Neurodegenerative diseases share a range of molecular and cellular pathologies, including protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate toxicity, calcium load, proteolytic stress, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and aging, which contribute to neuronal death. Efforts to treat these diseases are often limited by the fact that they tend to address any one of the above pathological changes while ignoring others. Lack of clarity regarding a possible root cause that underlies all the above pathologies poses a significant challenge. In search of an integrative theory for neurodegenerative pathology, we hypothesize that metabolic deficiency in certain vulnerable neuronal clusters is the common underlying thread that links many dimensions of the disease. The current review aims to present an outline of such an integrative theory. We present a new perspective of neurodegenerative diseases as metabolic disorders at molecular, cellular, and systems levels. This helps to understand a common underlying mechanism of the many facets of the disease and may lead to more promising disease-modifying therapeutic interventions. Here, we briefly discuss the selective metabolic vulnerability of specific neuronal clusters and also the involvement of glia and vascular dysfunctions. Any failure in satisfaction of the metabolic demand by the neurons triggers a chain of events that precipitate various manifestations of neurodegenerative pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Alcohol Craving in Heavy and Occasional Alcohol Drinkers After Cue Exposure in a Virtual Environment: The Role of the Sense of Presence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00124</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00124</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The development of new technologies, and more specifically the opportunity to immerse participants in virtual controlled environments, provides a new ecological framework for researchers to study complex behaviors. This experiment aimed to compare post-immersion craving in occasional and heavy alcohol drinkers. Twenty-two occasional drinkers and eighteen heavy drinkers were recruited and immersed in a virtual bar, including alcoholic beverages. After the exposure, heavy drinkers reported a significantly higher craving than occasional drinkers. Post-immersion alcohol craving was significantly related to the levels of perceived ecological validity of the virtual environment. Finally, a moderation analysis suggested that the levels of craving more strongly increased with perceived ecological validity in heavy drinkers than in occasional drinkers. Therefore, the perceived ecological validity was an important experimental parameter to study craving in a virtual environment. These results further suggested that virtual reality might be a useful tool for both the scientific study of alcohol addiction and the treatment of alcohol dependence and relapse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Egocentric and Allocentric Spatial Memory in Korsakoff’s Amnesia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00121</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00121</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of the present study was to investigate spatial memory in a group of patients with amnesia due to Korsakoff’s syndrome (KS). We used a virtual spatial memory task that allowed us to separate the use of egocentric and allocentric spatial reference frames to determine object locations. Research investigating the ability of patients with Korsakoff’s amnesia to use different reference frames is scarce and it remains unclear whether these patients are impaired in using ego- and allocentric reference frames to the same extent. Twenty Korsakoff patients and 24 matched controls watched an animation of a bird flying in one of three trees standing in a virtual environment. After the bird disappeared, the camera turned around, by which the trees were briefly out of sight and then turned back to the center of the environment. Participants were asked in which tree the bird was hiding. In half of the trials, a landmark was shown. Half of the trials required an immediate response whereas in the other half a delay of 10 s was present. Patients performed significantly worse than controls. For all participants trials with a landmark were easier than without a landmark and trials without a delay were easier than with a delay. While controls were above chance on all trials patients were at chance in allocentric trials without a landmark present and with a memory delay. Patients showed no difference in the ego- and the allocentric condition. Together the findings suggest that despite the amnesia, spatial memory and especially the use of ego- and allocentric reference frames in Korsakoff patients are spared.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Rating the Intensity of a Laser Stimulus, but Not Attending to Changes in Its Location or Intensity Modulates the Laser-Evoked Cortical Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00120</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00120</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Top-down attention towards nociceptive stimuli can be modulated by asking participants to pay attention to specific features of a stimulus, or to provide a rating about its intensity/unpleasantness. Whether and how these different top-down processes may lead to different modulations of the cortical response to nociceptive stimuli remains an open question. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to brief nociceptive laser stimuli in 24 healthy participants while they performed a task in which they had to compare two subsequent stimuli on their Spatial location (Location task) or Intensity (Intensity Task). In two additional blocks (Location + Ratings, and Intensity + Ratings) participants had to further provide a rating of the perceived intensity of the stimulus. Such a design allowed us to investigate whether focusing on spatial or intensity features of a nociceptive stimulus and rating its intensity would exert different effects on the EEG responses. We did not find statistical evidence for an effect on the signal while participants were focusing on different features of the signal. We only observed a significant cluster difference in frontoparietal leads at approximately 300–500 ms post-stimulus between the magnitude of the signal in the Intensity and Intensity + Rating conditions, with a less negative response in the Intensity + Rating condition in frontal electrodes, and a less positive amplitude in parietal leads. We speculatively propose that activity in those electrodes and time window reflects magnitude estimation processes. Moreover, the smaller frontal amplitude in the Intensity + Rating condition can be explained by greater working memory engagement known to reduce the magnitude of the EEG signal. We conclude that different top-down attentional processes modulate responses to nociceptive laser stimuli at different electrodes and time windows depending on the underlying processes that are engaged.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Travel Planning Ability in Right Brain-Damaged Patients: Two Case Reports</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00117</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00117</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Planning ability is fundamental for goal-directed spatial navigation. Preliminary findings from patients and healthy individuals suggest that travel planning (TP)—namely, navigational planning—can be considered a distinct process from visuospatial planning (VP) ability. To shed light on this distinction, two right brain-damaged patients without hemineglect were compared with a control group on two tasks aimed at testing VP (i.e., Tower of London-16, ToL-16) and TP (i.e., Minefield Task, MFT). The former requires planning the moves to reach the right configuration of three colored beads on three pegs, whereas the latter was opportunely developed to assess TP in the navigational environment when obstacles are present. Specifically, the MFT requires participants to plan a route on a large carpet avoiding some hidden obstacles previously observed. Patient 1 showed lesions encompassing the temporoparietal region and the insula; she performed poorer than the control group on the ToL-16 but showed no deficit on the MFT. Conversely, Patient 2 showed lesions mainly located in the occipitoparietal network of spatial navigation; she performed worse than the control group on the MFT but not on the ToL-16. In both cases performances satisfied the criteria for a classical dissociation, meeting criteria for a double dissociation. These results support the idea that TP is a distinct ability and that it is dissociated from VP skills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Preliminary Study of the Effects of Attentive Music Listening on Cochlear Implant Users’ Speech Perception, Quality of Life, and Behavioral and Objective Measures of Frequency Change Detection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00110</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00110</link>
	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Most cochlear implant (CI) users have difficulty in listening tasks that rely strongly on perception of frequency changes (e.g., speech perception in noise, musical melody perception, etc.). Some previous studies using behavioral or subjective assessments have shown that short-term music training can benefit CI users’ perception of music and speech. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings may reveal the neural basis for music training benefits in CI users.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To examine the effects of short-term music training on CI hearing outcomes using a comprehensive test battery of subjective evaluation, behavioral tests, and EEG measures.&lt;/p&gt;Design&lt;p&gt;Twelve adult CI users were recruited for a home-based music training program that focused on attentive listening to music genres and materials that have an emphasis on melody. The participants used a music streaming program (i.e., Pandora) downloaded onto personal electronic devices for training. The participants attentively listened to music through a direct audio cable or through Bluetooth streaming. The training schedule was 40 min/session/day, 5 days/week, for either 4 or 8 weeks. The pre-training and post-training tests included: hearing thresholds, Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ12) questionnaire, psychoacoustic tests of frequency change detection threshold (FCDT), speech recognition tests (CNC words, AzBio sentences, and QuickSIN), and EEG responses to tones that contained different magnitudes of frequency changes.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;All participants except one finished the 4- or 8-week training, resulting in a dropout rate of 8.33%. Eleven participants performed all tests except for two who did not participate in EEG tests. Results showed a significant improvement in the FCDTs as well as performance on CNC and QuickSIN after training (p &amp;lt; 0.05), but no significant improvement in SSQ scores (p &amp;gt; 0.05). Results of the EEG tests showed larger post-training cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) in seven of the nine participants, suggesting a better cortical processing of both stimulus onset and within-stimulus frequency changes.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These preliminary data suggest that extensive, focused music listening can improve frequency perception and speech perception in CI users. Further studies that include a larger sample size and control groups are warranted to determine the efficacy of short-term music training in CI users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Path Learning in Individuals With Down Syndrome: The Floor Matrix Task and the Role of Individual Visuo-Spatial Measures</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00107</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00107</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Environment learning is essential in everyday life. In individuals with Down syndrome (DS), this skill has begun to be examined using virtual exploration. Previous studies showed that individuals with DS can learn and remember paths in terms of sequences of turns and straight stretches, albeit with some difficulty, and this learning is supported by their cognitive abilities. This study further investigates environment learning in the DS population, newly examining their ability to learn a path from actual movements, and to learn increasingly long paths, and how their performance relates to their visuo-spatial abilities and everyday spatial activities. A group of 30 individuals with DS and 30 typically-developing (TD) children matched for receptive vocabulary performed a 4 × 4 Floor Matrix task in a grid comprising 16 squares (total area 2.3 × 2.3 meters). The task involved repeating increasingly long sequences of steps by actually moving in the grid. The sequences were presented in two learning conditions, called Observation (when participants watched the experimenter’s moves), or Map (when they were shown a map reproducing the path). Several visuo-spatial measures were also administered. The results showed a clear difference between the two groups’ performance in the individual visuo-spatial measures. In the Floor Matrix task, after controlling for visuo-spatial reasoning ability, both groups benefited to the same degree from the Observation condition vis-à-vis the Map condition, and no group differences emerged. In the group with DS, visuo-spatial abilities were more predictive of performance in the Floor Matrix task in the Observation condition than in the Map condition. The same was true of the TD group, but this difference was much less clear-cut. The visuo-spatial working memory and visualization tasks were the strongest predictors of Floor Matrix task performance. Finally, the group with DS showed a significant relation between Floor Matrix task performance in the Observation condition and everyday spatial activity. These results enlarge on what we know about path learning in individuals with DS and its relation to their visuo-spatial abilities. These findings are discussed within the frame of spatial cognition and the atypical development domain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Factors Associated With Virtual Reality Sickness in Head-Mounted Displays: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00096</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00096</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The use of head-mounted displays (HMD) for virtual reality (VR) application-based purposes including therapy, rehabilitation, and training is increasing. Despite advancements in VR technologies, many users still experience sickness symptoms. VR sickness may be influenced by technological differences within HMDs such as resolution and refresh rate, however, VR content also plays a significant role. The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the literature on HMDs that report Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) scores to determine the impact of content. User factors associated with VR sickness were also examined. A systematic search was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Fifty-five articles met inclusion criteria, representing 3,016 participants (mean age range 19.5–80; 41% female). Findings show gaming content recorded the highest total SSQ mean 34.26 (95%CI 29.57–38.95). VR sickness profiles were also influenced by visual stimulation, locomotion and exposure times. Older samples (mean age ≥35 years) scored significantly lower total SSQ means than younger samples, however, these findings are based on a small evidence base as a limited number of studies included older users. No sex differences were found. Across all types of content, the pooled total SSQ mean was relatively high 28.00 (95%CI 24.66–31.35) compared with recommended SSQ cut-off scores. These findings are of relevance for informing future research and the application of VR in different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Electrophysiological Correlates of Basic and Higher Order Cognitive and Affective Theory of Mind Processing in Emerging and Early Adulthood—An Explorative Event-Related Potentials Study to Investigate First-, Second-, and Third-Order Theory of Mind Processing Based on Visual Cues</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Attributing mental states to others in social interactions [Theory of Mind (ToM)] often depends on visual social cues like eye gaze or mimic. This study presents an event-related potentials task (Brainy-ERP) that was developed in order to investigate the electrophysiological correlates of first-, second-, and third-order cognitive and affective ToM processing. The task was based on social visual cues and involved electroencephalographic event-related potential (ERP) analyses and exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography analyses (eLORETA) source localization analyses. Results showed that in cognitive and affective conditions, first-order trials elicited greater Anterior P2 (180–370 ms) amplitudes. In the cognitive condition, third-order trials elicited greatest amplitudes in the broadly distributed early negative slow wave (eNSW, 260–470 ms) and the late NSW (LNSW, 460–1,000 ms). In the affective condition, third-order and second-order trials elicited greatest amplitudes in a broadly distributed NSW (250–1,000 ms). Regarding affective trials in the NSW time span, statistical significant differences and trends were shown regarding activation of underlying brain regions. Third-order trials elicited greatest activation in a number of regions typically associated with the ToM network, especially the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), cuneus, and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Furthermore, ToM low performers (participants with high accuracy but longer reaction times) showed by trend smaller Posterior N1 and significantly smaller eNSW amplitudes compared to average and high performers. This study offers new insights into electrophysiological correlates of basic and higher order cognitive and affective ToM processing and its precise time course.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Inhibition of Long-Term Variability in Decoding Forelimb Trajectory Using Evolutionary Neural Networks With Error-Correction Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00022</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00022</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: In brain machine interfaces (BMIs), the functional mapping between neural activities and kinematic parameters varied over time owing to changes in neural recording conditions. The variability in neural recording conditions might result in unstable long-term decoding performance. Relevant studies trained decoders with several days of training data to make them inherently robust to changes in neural recording conditions. However, these decoders might not be robust to changes in neural recording conditions when only a few days of training data are available. In time-series prediction and feedback control system, an error feedback was commonly adopted to reduce the effects of model uncertainty. This motivated us to introduce an error feedback to a neural decoder for dealing with the variability in neural recording conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approach: We proposed an evolutionary constructive and pruning neural network with error feedback (ECPNN-EF) as a neural decoder. The ECPNN-EF with partially connected topology decoded the instantaneous firing rates of each sorted unit into forelimb movement of a rat. Furthermore, an error feedback was adopted as an additional input to provide kinematic information and thus compensate for changes in functional mapping. The proposed neural decoder was trained on data collected from a water reward-related lever-pressing task for a rat. The first 2 days of data were used to train the decoder, and the subsequent 10 days of data were used to test the decoder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main Results: The ECPNN-EF under different settings was evaluated to better understand the impact of the error feedback and partially connected topology. The experimental results demonstrated that the ECPNN-EF achieved significantly higher daily decoding performance with smaller daily variability when using the error feedback and partially connected topology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significance: These results suggested that the ECPNN-EF with partially connected topology could cope with both within- and across-day changes in neural recording conditions. The error feedback in the ECPNN-EF compensated for decreases in decoding performance when neural recording conditions changed. This mechanism made the ECPNN-EF robust against changes in functional mappings and thus improved the long-term decoding stability when only a few days of training data were available.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Cortical Microcircuit Mechanisms of Mismatch Negativity and Its Underlying Subcomponents</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00013</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the neocortex, neuronal processing of sensory events is significantly influenced by context. For instance, responses in sensory cortices are suppressed to repetitive or redundant stimuli, a phenomenon termed “stimulus-specific adaptation” (SSA). However, in a context in which that same stimulus is novel, or deviates from expectations, neuronal responses are augmented. This augmentation is termed “deviance detection” (DD). This contextual modulation of neural responses is fundamental for how the brain efficiently processes the sensory world to guide immediate and future behaviors. Notably, context modulation is deficient in some neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ), as quantified by reduced “mismatch negativity” (MMN), an electroencephalography waveform reflecting a combination of SSA and DD in sensory cortex. Although the role of NMDA-receptor function and other neuromodulatory systems on MMN is established, the precise microcircuit mechanisms of MMN and its underlying components, SSA and DD, remain unknown. When coupled with animal models, the development of powerful precision neurotechnologies over the past decade carries significant promise for making new progress into understanding the neurobiology of MMN with previously unreachable spatial resolution. Currently, rodent models represent the best tool for mechanistic study due to the vast genetic tools available. While quantifying human-like MMN waveforms in rodents is not straightforward, the “oddball” paradigms used to study it in humans and its underlying subcomponents (SSA/DD) are highly translatable across species. Here we summarize efforts published so far, with a focus on cortically measured SSA and DD in animals to maintain relevance to the classically measured MMN, which has cortical origins. While mechanistic studies that measure and contrast both components are sparse, we synthesize a potential set of microcircuit mechanisms from the existing rodent, primate, and human literature. While MMN and its subcomponents likely reflect several mechanisms across multiple brain regions, understanding fundamental microcircuit mechanisms is an important step to understand MMN as a whole. We hypothesize that SSA reflects adaptations occurring at synapses along the sensory-thalamocortical pathways, while DD depends on both SSA inherited from afferent inputs and resulting disinhibition of non-adapted neurons arising from the distinct physiology and wiring properties of local interneuronal subpopulations and NMDA-receptor function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether the CSF-contacting nucleus receives brainstem and spinal cord projections and to understand the functional significance of these connections.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The retrograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit (CB) was injected into the CSF-contacting nucleus in Sprague-Dawley rats according the previously reported stereotaxic coordinates. After 7–10 days, these rats were perfused and their brainstem and spinal cord were sliced (thickness, 40 μm) using a freezing microtome. All the sections were subjected to CB immunofluorescence staining. The distribution of CB-positive neuron in different brainstem and spinal cord areas was observed under fluorescence microscope.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The retrograde labeled CB-positive neurons were found in the midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. Four functional areas including one hundred and twelve sub-regions have projections to the CSF-contacting nucleus. However, the density of CB-positive neuron distribution ranged from sparse to dense.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Based on the connectivity patterns of the CSF-contacting nucleus receives anatomical inputs from the brainstem and spinal cord, we preliminarily conclude and summarize that the CSF-contacting nucleus participates in pain, visceral activity, sleep and arousal, emotion, and drug addiction. The present study firstly illustrates the broad projections of the CSF-contacting nucleus from the brainstem and spinal cord, which implies the complicated functions of the nucleus especially for the unique roles of coordination in neural and body fluids regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gut peptide hormones are one group of secretory factors produced from gastrointestinal endocrine cells with potent functions in modulating digestive functions. In recent decades, they have been found across different brain regions, many of which are involved in autism-related social, emotional and cognitive deficits. Clinical studies have revealed possible correlation between those hormones and autism spectrum disorder pathogenesis. In animal models, gut peptide hormones modulate neurodevelopment, synaptic transmission and neural plasticity, explaining their behavioral relevance. This review article will summarize major findings from both clinical and basic research showing the role of gut peptide hormones in mediating autism-related neurological functions, and their potential implications in autism pathogenesis. The pharmaceutical value of gut hormones in alleviating autism-associated behavioral syndromes will be discussed to provide new insights for future drug development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: mTOR Suppresses Macroautophagy During Striatal Postnatal Development and Is Hyperactive in Mouse Models of Autism Spectrum Disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00070</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) plays a critical role in neuronal function related to development and degeneration. Here, we investigated whether autophagy is developmentally regulated in the striatum, a brain region implicated in neurodevelopmental disease. We demonstrate that autophagic flux is suppressed during striatal postnatal development, reaching adult levels around postnatal day 28 (P28). We also find that mTOR signaling, a key regulator of autophagy, increases during the same developmental period. We further show that mTOR signaling is responsible for suppressing autophagy, via regulation of Beclin-1 and VPS34 activity. Finally, we discover that autophagy is downregulated during late striatal postnatal development (P28) in mice with in utero exposure to valproic acid (VPA), an established mouse model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). VPA-exposed mice also display deficits in striatal neurotransmission and social behavior. Correction of hyperactive mTOR signaling in VPA-exposed mice restores social behavior. These results demonstrate that neurons coopt metabolic signaling cascades to developmentally regulate autophagy and provide additional evidence that mTOR-dependent signaling pathways represent pathogenic signaling cascades in ASD mouse models that are active during specific postnatal windows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Inhibition of Microglial TGFβ Signaling Increases Expression of Mrc1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00066</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are constantly surveying their microenvironment and rapidly react to impairments by changing their morphology, migrating toward stimuli and adopting gene expression profiles characterizing their activated state. The increased expression of the M2-like marker Mannose receptor 1 (Mrc1), which is also referred to as CD206, in microglia has been reported after M2-like activation in vitro and in vivo. Mrc1 is a 175-kDa transmembrane pattern recognition receptor which binds a variety of carbohydrates and is involved in the pinocytosis and the phagocytosis of immune cells, including microglia, and thought to contribute to a neuroprotective microglial phenotype. Here we analyzed the effects of TGFβ signaling on Mrc1 expression in microglia in vivo and in vitro. Using C57BL/6 wild type and Cx3cr1&lt;sup&gt;CreERT2&lt;/sup&gt;:R26-YFP:Tgfbr2&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt; mice-derived microglia, we show that the silencing of TGFβ signaling results in the upregulation of Mrc1, whereas recombinant TGFβ1 induced the delayed downregulation of Mrc1. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments provided evidence that Mrc1 is not a direct Smad2/Smad4 target gene in microglia. Altogether our data indicate that the changes in Mrc1 expression after the activation or the silencing of microglial TGFβ signaling are likely to be mediated by modifications of the secondary intracellular signaling events influenced by TGFβ signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Pharmacological Inhibition of HDAC6 Attenuates NLRP3 Inflammatory Response and Protects Dopaminergic Neurons in Experimental Models of Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>Aim&lt;p&gt;To investigate the role of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) deacetylation activity in nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain and leucine-rich repeat pyrin 3 domain (NLRP3) inflammatory response and explore the effects of pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 with tubastatin A (TBA) on dopaminergic injury.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Using 6-OHDA-induced Parkinson’s disease (PD) models, we examined the effects of TBA on NLRP3 activation and cell injury in SH-SY5Y cells. We also investigated the effects of TBA on NLRP3 inflammatory responses and dopaminergic injury in the nigrostriatal system in mice and analyzed the acetylation levels of peroxiredoxin2 (Prx2) and oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;TBA inhibited 6-OHDA-induced NLRP3 activation, as demonstrated by decreased expressions of NLRP3 and matured caspase-1 and IL-1β, and also alleviated glial proliferation and dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. Notably, TBA recovered acetylation levels of Prx2 and reduced oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 with TBA attenuates NLRP3 inflammation and protects dopaminergic neurons, probably through Prx2 acetylation. This study suggests that the deacetylase catalytic domain of HDAC6 is a potential target for PD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Low Cholesterol Level Linked to Reduced Semantic Fluency Performance and Reduced Gray Matter Volume in the Medial Temporal Lobe</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00057</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00057</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hyperlipidemia has been proposed as a risk factor of dementia and cognitive decline. However, the findings of the relationship between cholesterol level and cognitive/brain function have been inconsistent. Here, using a well-controlled sample from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), we investigated the probable non-linear relationship between plasma total cholesterol (TC) level, gray matter volume (GMv), and cognitive performance in 117 non-demented subjects (mean age, 61.5 ± 8.9 years), including 67 Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients and 50 demographically matched controls. A quadratic relationship between semantic fluency (SF) performance and TC levels was identified. Within the subjects with a desirable TC level (TC &amp;lt; 200 mg/dl), low TC (lTC) levels were associated with reduced SF performance, as well as reduced GMv in three medial temporal regions [including bilateral anterior hippocampus (HIP)]. In contrast, no significant relationship between TC and cognition performance/GMv was found in individuals with a high cholesterol level (i.e., TC ≥ 200 mg/dl). Further region of interest (ROI)-based analysis showed that individuals with TC levels ranging from 100 to 160 mg/dl had the lowest GMv in the medial temporal regions. These findings suggest that low-normal TC level may be associated with reduced cognitive function and brain atrophy in regions implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, adding to a growing body of literature supporting a probable non-linear relationship between cholesterol level and brain health. However, this finding needs to be verified with other large public cohort data that do not include PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a harsh reminder of the fact that, whether in a single human host or a wave of infection across continents, viral dynamics is often a story about the numbers. In this snapshot, our aim is to provide a one-stop, curated graphical source for the key numbers that help us understand the virus driving our current global crisis. The discussion is framed around two broad themes: 1) the biology of the virus itself and 2) the characteristics of the infection of a single human host. Our one-page summary provides the key numbers pertaining to SARS-CoV-2, based mostly on peer-reviewed literature. The numbers reported in summary format are substantiated by the annotated references below. Readers are urged to remember that much uncertainty remains and knowledge of this pandemic and the virus driving it is rapidly evolving. In the paragraphs below we provide 'back of the envelope' calculations that exemplify the insights that can be gained from knowing some key numbers and using quantitative logic. These calculations serve to improve our intuition through sanity checks, but do not replace detailed epidemiological analysis.</description>

	<title>eLife: Approaching boiling point stability of an alcohol dehydrogenase through computationally-guided enzyme engineering</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54639</link>
	<description>Enzyme instability is an important limitation for the investigation and application of enzymes. Therefore, methods to rapidly and effectively improve enzyme stability are highly appealing. In this study we applied a computational method (FRESCO) to guide the engineering of an alcohol dehydrogenase. Of the 177 selected mutations, 25 mutations brought about a significant increase in apparent melting temperature (Δ&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ +3 °C). By combining mutations, a 10-fold mutant was generated with a &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of 94 °C (+51 °C relative to wildtype), almost reaching water's boiling point, and the highest increase with FRESCO to date. The 10-fold mutant's structure was elucidated, which enabled the identification of an activity-impairing mutation. After reverting this mutation, the enzyme showed no loss in activity compared to wildtype, while displaying a &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of 88 °C (+45 °C relative to wildtype). This work demonstrates the value of enzyme stabilization through computational library design.</description>

	<title>eLife: The primary structural photoresponse of phytochrome proteins captured by a femtosecond X-ray laser</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.53514</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53514</link>
	<description>Phytochrome proteins control the growth, reproduction, and photosynthesis of plants, fungi, and bacteria. Light is detected by a bilin cofactor, but it remains elusive how this leads to activation of the protein through structural changes. We present serial femtosecond X-ray crystallographic data of the chromophore-binding domains of a bacterial phytochrome at delay times of 1 ps and 10 ps after photoexcitation. The data reveal a twist of the D-ring, which leads to partial detachment of the chromophore from the protein. Unexpectedly, the conserved so-called pyrrole water is photodissociated from the chromophore, concomitant with movement of the A-ring and a key signalling aspartate. The changes are wired together by ultrafast backbone and water movements around the chromophore, channeling them into signal transduction towards the output domains. We suggest that the observed collective changes are important for the phytochrome photoresponse, explaining the earliest steps of how plants, fungi and bacteria sense red light.</description>

	<title>eLife: Gating and selectivity mechanisms for the lysosomal K+channel TMEM175</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53430</link>
	<description>Transmembrane protein 175 (TMEM175) is a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-selective ion channel expressed in lysosomal membranes, where it establishes a membrane potential essential for lysosomal function and its dysregulation is associated with the development of Parkinson's Disease. TMEM175 is evolutionarily distinct from all known channels, predicting novel ion-selectivity and gating mechanisms. Here we present cryo-EM structures of human TMEM175 in open and closed conformations, enabled by resolutions up to 2.6Å. Human TMEM175 adopts a homodimeric architecture with a central ion-conduction pore lined by the side chains of the pore-lining helices. Conserved isoleucine residues in the center of the pore serve as the gate in the closed conformation. In the widened channel in the open conformation, these same residues establish a constriction essential for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity. These studies reveal the mechanisms of permeation, selectivity and gating and lay the groundwork for understanding the role of TMEM175 in lysosomal function.</description>

	<title>eLife: TMEM87a/Elkin1, a component of a novel mechanoelectrical transduction pathway, modulates melanoma adhesion and migration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.53308</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53308</link>
	<description>Mechanoelectrical transduction is a cellular signalling pathway where physical stimuli are converted into electro-chemical signals by mechanically activated ion channels. We describe here the presence of mechanically activated currents in melanoma cells that are dependent on TMEM87a, which we have renamed Elkin1. Heterologous expression of this protein in PIEZO1-deficient cells, that exhibit no baseline mechanosensitivity, is sufficient to reconstitute mechanically activated currents. Melanoma cells lacking functional Elkin1 exhibit defective mechanoelectrical transduction, decreased motility and increased dissociation from organotypic spheroids. By analysing cell adhesion properties, we demonstrate that Elkin1 deletion is associated with increased cell-substrate adhesion and decreased homotypic cell-cell adhesion strength. We therefore conclude that Elkin1 supports a PIEZO1-independent mechanoelectrical transduction pathway and modulates cellular adhesions and regulates melanoma cell migration and cell-cell interactions.</description>

	<title>eLife: Application of optogenetic Amyloid-β distinguishes between metabolic and physical damage in neurodegeneration</title>

	<description>The brains of Alzheimer's Disease patients show a decrease in brain mass and a preponderance of extracellular Amyloid-β plaques. These plaques are formed by aggregation of polypeptides that are derived from the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). Amyloid-β plaques are thought to play either a direct or an indirect role in disease progression, however the exact role of aggregation and plaque formation in the aetiology of Alzheimer's Disease is subject to debate as the biological effects of soluble and aggregated Amyloid-β peptides are difficult to separate &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. To investigate the consequences of formation of Amyloid-β oligomers in living tissues, we developed a fluorescently tagged, optogenetic Amyloid-β peptide that oligomerizes rapidly in the presence of blue light. We applied this system to the crucial question of how intracellular Amyloid-β oligomers underlie the pathologies of Alzheimer's Disease. We use &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;D. rerio&lt;/i&gt; to show that, although both expression and induced oligomerization of Amyloid-β were detrimental to lifespan and healthspan, we were able to separate the metabolic and physical damage caused by light-induced Amyloid-β oligomerization from Amyloid-β expression alone. The physical damage caused by Amyloid-β oligomers also recapitulated the catastrophic tissue loss that is a hallmark of late AD. We show that the lifespan deficit induced by Amyloid-β oligomers was reduced with Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; treatment. Our results present the first model to separate different aspects of disease progression.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/52380</link>
	<description>Fast signaling from vision and proprioception to muscle activation plays essential roles in quickly correcting movement. Though many studies have demonstrated modulation of the quick sensorimotor responses as depending on context in each modality, the contribution of multimodal information has not been established. Here, we examined whether state estimates contributing to stretch reflexes are represented solely by proprioceptive information or by multimodal information. Unlike previous studies, we newly found a significant stretch-reflex attenuation by the distortion and elimination of visual-feedback without any change in motor tasks. Furthermore, the stretch-reflex amplitude reduced with increasing elimination durations which would degrade state estimates. By contrast, even though a distortion was introduced in the target-motor-mapping, the stretch reflex was not simultaneously attenuated with visuomotor reflex. Our results therefore indicate that the observed stretch-reflex attenuation is specifically ascribed to uncertainty increase in estimating hand states, suggesting multimodal contributions to the generation of stretch reflexes.</description>

	<description>Cardiomyocyte b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenoceptors (b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-ARs) coupled to soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC)-dependent production of the second messenger 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) have been shown to protect from heart failure. However, the exact localization of these receptors to fine membrane structures and subcellular compartmentation of b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-AR/cGMP signals underpinning this protection in health and disease remain elusive. Here, we used a Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based cGMP biosensor combined with scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) to show that functional β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-ARs are mostly confined to the T-tubules of healthy rat cardiomyocytes. Heart failure, induced via myocardial infarction, causes a decrease of the cGMP levels generated by these receptors and a change of subcellular cGMP compartmentation. Furthermore, attenuated cGMP signals led to impaired phosphodiesterase 2 dependent negative cGMP-to-cAMP cross-talk. In conclusion, topographic and functional reorganization of the b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-AR/cGMP signalosome happens in heart failure and should be considered when designing new therapies acting via this receptor.</description>

	<description>Central mammalian synapses release synaptic vesicles in dedicated structures called docking/release sites. It has been assumed that when voltage-dependent calcium entry is sufficiently large, synaptic output attains a maximum value of one synaptic vesicle per action potential and per site. Here we use deconvolution to count synaptic vesicle output at single sites (mean site number per synapse: 3.6). When increasing calcium entry with tetraethylammonium in 1.5 mM external calcium concentration, we find that synaptic output saturates at 0.22 vesicle per site, not at 1 vesicle per site. Fitting the results with current models of calcium-dependent exocytosis indicates that the 0.22 vesicle limit reflects the probability of docking sites to be occupied by synaptic vesicles at rest, as only docked vesicles can be released. With 3 mM external calcium, the maximum output per site increases to 0.47, indicating an increase in docking site occupancy as a function of external calcium concentration.</description>

	<description>Mammalian mitochondrial inner membrane fusion is mediated by optic atrophy 1 (OPA1). Under physiological conditions, OPA1 undergoes proteolytic processing to form a membrane-anchored long isoform (L-OPA1) and a soluble short isoform (S-OPA1). A combination of L-OPA1 and S-OPA1 is essential for efficient membrane fusion; however, the relevant mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we investigate the cryo-electron microscopic structures of S-OPA1–coated liposomes in nucleotide-free and GTPγS-bound states. S-OPA1 exhibits a general dynamin-like structure and can assemble onto membranes in a helical array with a dimer building block. We reveal that hydrophobic residues in its extended membrane-binding domain are critical for its tubulation activity. The binding of GTPγS triggers a conformational change and results in a rearrangement of the helical lattice and tube expansion similar to that of S-Mgm1. These observations indicate that S-OPA1 adopts a dynamin-like power stroke membrane remodeling mechanism during mitochondrial inner membrane fusion.</description>

	<description>Current xenogeneic mouse models cannot evaluate on-target off-tumor adverse effect, hindering the development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies for solid tumors, due to limited human/mouse cross-reactivity of antibodies used in CAR and sever graft-versus-host disease induced by administered human T cells. We have evaluated safety and antitumor efficacy of CAR-T cells targeting glypican-1 (GPC1) overexpressed in various solid tumors. GPC1-specific human and murine CAR-T cells generated from our original anti-human/mouse GPC1 antibody showed strong antitumor effects in xenogeneic and syngeneic mouse models, respectively. Importantly, the murine CAR-T cells enhanced endogenous T cell responses against a non-GPC1 tumor antigen through the mechanism of antigen-spreading and showed synergistic antitumor effects with anti-PD-1 antibody without any adverse effects in syngeneic models. Our study shows the potential of GPC1 as a CAR-T cell target for solid tumors and the importance of syngeneic and xenogeneic models for evaluating their safety and efficacy.</description>

	<title>eLife: Fibronectin is a smart adhesive that both influences and responds to the mechanics of early spinal column development</title>

	<description>An extracellular matrix of Fibronectin adheres the neural tube to the two flanking columns of paraxial mesoderm and is required for normal vertebrate development. Here, we find that the bilaterally symmetric interfaces between the zebrafish neural tube and paraxial mesoderm function as optimally engineered adhesive lap joints with rounded edges, graded Fibronectin ‘adhesive’ and an arced adhesive spew filet. Fibronectin is a ‘smart adhesive’ that remodels to the lateral edges of the neural tube-paraxial mesoderm interfaces where shear stress is highest. Fibronectin remodeling is mechanically responsive to contralateral variation morphogenesis, and Fibronectin-mediated inter-tissue adhesion is required for bilaterally symmetric morphogenesis of the paraxial mesoderm. Strikingly, however, perturbation of the Fibronectin matrix rescues the neural tube convergence defect of &lt;i&gt;cadherin 2&lt;/i&gt; mutants. Therefore, Fibronectin-mediated inter-tissue adhesion dynamically coordinates bilaterally symmetric morphogenesis of the vertebrate trunk but predisposes the neural tube to convergence defects that lead to spina bifida.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Uncoupling the roles of firing rates and spike bursts in shaping the STN-GPe beta band oscillations</title>

The excess of 15-30 Hz (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-band) oscillations in the basal ganglia is one of the key signatures of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The STN-GPe network is integral to generation and modulation of &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; band oscillations in basal ganglia. However, the role of changes in the firing rates and spike bursting of STN and GPe neurons in shaping these oscillations has remained unclear. In order to uncouple their effects, we studied the dynamics of STN-GPe network using numerical simulations. In particular, we used a neuron model, in which firing rates and spike bursting can be independently controlled. Using this model, we found that while STN firing rate is predictive of oscillations but GPe firing rate is not. The effect of spike bursting in STN and GPe neurons was state-dependent. That is, only when the network was operating in a state close to the border of oscillatory and non-oscillatory regimes, spike bursting had a qualitative effect on the &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; band oscillations. In these network states, an increase in GPe bursting enhanced the oscillations whereas an equivalent proportion of spike bursting in STN suppressed the oscillations. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the transient &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; bursts and how duration and power of &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; band oscillations may be controlled by an interplay of GPe and STN firing rates and spike bursts.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HtyKKb1Lty8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Mechanisms underlying attraction to odors in walking &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Liangyu Tao, Siddhi Ozarkar, Vikas Bhandawat&lt;/p&gt;

Mechanisms that control movements range from navigational mechanisms, in which the animal employs directional cues to reach a specific destination, to search movements during which there are little or no environmental cues. Even though most real-world movements result from an interplay between these mechanisms, an experimental system and theoretical framework for the study of interplay of these mechanisms is not available. Here, we rectify this deficit. We create a new method to stimulate the olfactory system in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; or fruit flies. As flies explore a circular arena, their olfactory receptor neuron (ORNs) are optogenetically activated within a central region making this region attractive to the flies without emitting any clear directional signals outside this central region. In the absence of ORN activation, the fly’s locomotion can be described by a random walk model where a fly’s movement is described by its speed and turn-rate (or kinematics). Upon optogenetic stimulation, the fly’s behavior changes dramatically in two respects. First, there are large kinematic changes. Second, there are more turns at the border between light-zone and no-light-zone and these turns have an inward bias. Surprisingly, there is no increase in turn-rate, rather a large decrease in speed that makes it appear that the flies are turning at the border. Similarly, the inward bias of the turns is a result of the increase in turn angle. These two mechanisms entirely account for the change in a fly’s locomotion. No complex mechanisms such as path-integration or a careful evaluation of gradients are necessary.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/91c5cfhMBKw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

This work reports a dynamical Markov state model of CLC-2 “fast” (pore) gating, based on 600 microseconds of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. In the starting conformation of our CLC-2 model, both outer and inner channel gates are closed. The first conformational change in our dataset involves rotation of the inner-gate backbone along residues S168-G169-I170. This change is strikingly similar to that observed in the cryo-EM structure of the bovine CLC-K channel, though the volume of the intracellular (inner) region of the ion conduction pathway is further expanded in our model. From this state (inner gate open and outer gate closed), two additional states are observed, each involving a unique rotameric flip of the outer-gate residue GLU&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt;. Both additional states involve conformational changes that orient GLU&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt; away from the extracellular (outer) region of the ion conduction pathway. In the first additional state, the rotameric flip of GLU&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt; results in an open, or near-open, channel pore. The equilibrium population of this state is low (∼1%), consistent with the low open probability of CLC-2 observed experimentally in the absence of a membrane potential stimulus (0 mV). In the second additional state, GLU&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt; rotates to occlude the channel pore. This state, which has a low equilibrium population (∼1%), is only accessible when GLU&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt; is protonated. Together, these pathways model the opening of both an inner and outer gate within the CLC-2 selectivity filter, as a function of GLU&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt; protonation. Collectively, our findings are consistent with published experimental analyses of CLC-2 gating and provide a high-resolution structural model to guide future investigations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jTCDQXkF0cw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Compact CRISPR/Cas9 systems that can be packaged into an adeno-associated virus (AAV) hold great promise for gene therapy. Unfortunately, currently available small Cas9 nucleases either display low activity or require a long protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, limiting their extensive applications. Here, we screened a panel of Cas9 nucleases and identified a small Cas9 ortholog from &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus auricularis&lt;/i&gt; (SauriCas9), which recognizes a simple NNGG PAM, displays high activity for genome editing, and is compact enough to be packaged into an AAV for genome editing. Moreover, the conversion of adenine and cytosine bases can be achieved by fusing SauriCas9 to the cytidine and adenine deaminase. Therefore, SauriCas9 holds great potential for both basic research and clinical applications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/nuaTGLVxbGA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Vocal learning is the ability to modify vocal output on the basis of experience. Traditionally, species have been classified as either displaying or lacking this ability. A recent proposal, the vocal learning continuum, recognizes the need to have a more nuanced view of this phenotype and abandon the yes–no dichotomy. However, it also limits vocal learning to production of novel calls through imitation, moreover subserved by a forebrain-to-phonatory-muscles circuit. We discuss its limitations regarding the characterization of vocal learning across species and argue for a more permissive view.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/pN_KTsdURbA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Science communication and outreach are essential for training the next generation of scientists and raising public awareness for science. Providing effective science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) educational outreach to students in classrooms is challenging because of the need to form partnerships with teachers, the time commitment required for the presenting scientist, and the limited class time allotted for presentations. In our Present Your Ph.D. Thesis to a 12-Year Old outreach project, our novel solution to this problem is hosting a youth science workshop (YSW) on our university campus. The YSW is an interpersonal science communication and outreach experience in which graduate students from diverse scientific disciplines introduce middle and high school students to their cutting-edge research and mentor them to develop a white-board presentation to communicate the research to the workshop audience. Our assessment of the YSW indicated that participating young students expressed significantly more positive attitudes toward science and increased motivation to work in a STEM career after attending the workshop. Qualitative follow-up interviews with participating graduate students’ show that even with minimal time commitment, an impactful science communication training experience can be achieved. The YSW is a low-cost, high-reward educational outreach event amenable to all disciplines of science. It enhances interest and support of basic science research while providing opportunities for graduate students to engage with the public, improve their science communication skills, and enhance public understanding of science. This YSW model can be easily implemented at other higher education institutions to globally enhance science outreach initiatives.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/HlMbjtbeoUM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Different mismatch concepts for MRI‐guided thrombolysis in unknown onset stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25730?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25730?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the prevalence of the perfusion‐weighted imaging (PWI) ‐ diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) mismatch and response to intravenous thrombolysis in the WAKE‐UP trial.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a prespecified post‐hoc analysis of ischemic stroke patients screened for DWI ‐ fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) mismatch in WAKE‐UP who underwent PWI. We defined PWI‐DWI mismatch as ischemic core volume &amp;lt; 70 ml, mismatch volume &amp;gt; 10 ml and mismatch ratio &amp;gt; 1.2. Primary efficacy endpoint was a modified Rankin Scale score of 0–1 at 90 days, adjusted for age and symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 1,362 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screened patients, 431 underwent PWI. Of these, 57 (13%) had a double mismatch, 151 (35%) only a DWI‐FLAIR mismatch and 54 (13%) only a PWI‐DWI mismatch. DWI‐FLAIR mismatch was more prevalent than PWI‐DWI mismatch (48%; 95% CI 43%–53% vs 26%; 95% CI 22%–30%, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Screening for either one of the mismatch profiles resulted in a yield of 61% (95% CI 56%–65%). Prevalence of PWI‐DWI mismatch was similar in patients with (27%) or without (24%) DWI‐FLAIR mismatch (p = 0.52). In an exploratory analysis in the small subgroup of 208 randomized patients with PWI, PWI‐DWI mismatch status did not modify the treatment response (p for interaction = 0.73).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluating both the DWI‐FLAIR and PWI‐DWI mismatch pattern in patients with unknown time of stroke onset will result in the highest yield of thrombolysis treatment. The treatment benefit of alteplase in patients with a DWI‐FLAIR mismatch seems not merely driven by the presence of a PWI‐DWI mismatch, although this analysis was underpowered.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Post‐traumatic stress disorder is associated with further increased Parkinson's disease risk in veterans with traumatic brain injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25726?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25726?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determining if traumatic brain injury (TBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). This constitutes a research priority for the Veterans Administration (VA) with implications for screening policy and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Population‐based, matched case‐control study among veterans using VA healthcare facilities from 10/1/1999 to 09/30/2013. We identified 176,871 PD cases and 707,484 randomly selected PD‐free matched controls. Parkinson's Disease, TBI and PTSD were ascertained by validated ICD‐9 code‐based algorithms. We examined the association between both risk factors and PD employing race‐adjusted conditional logistic regression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall study cohort prevalence for TBI &lt;sub&gt;mild&lt;/sub&gt;, TBI &lt;sub&gt;non‐mild&lt;/sub&gt;, and PTSD was 0.65%, 0.69% and 5.5% respectively. Both TBI and PTSD were significantly associated with PD in single‐risk factor race‐adjusted analyses (conditional odds ratio (cOR) =2.99 (95% CI: 2.69‐3.32), 3.82 (95% CI: 3.67‐3.97), and 2.71 (95% CI: 2.66‐2.77) for TBI &lt;sub&gt;mild&lt;/sub&gt;, TBI &lt;sub&gt;non‐mild&lt;/sub&gt; and PTSD, respectively). There was suggestive positive interaction observed with comorbid PTSD/TBI in dual‐risk factor analyses, with significant 2.69‐fold and 3.70‐fold excess relative PD risk in veterans with TBI &lt;sub&gt;mild&lt;/sub&gt; and TBI &lt;sub&gt;non‐mild&lt;/sub&gt; vs. those without TBI when PTSD was present vs. 2.17‐fold and 2.80‐fold excess risk when PTSD was absent.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study was the first to demonstrate that both TBI and PTSD are independently associated with increased relative PD risk in a diverse nationwide cohort of military service veterans, and the first to suggest a potential modest synergistic excess risk in those with comorbid TBI/PTSD. Longitudinal research is needed to confirm these suggestive findings.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eNeuro: Arousal State-Dependent Alterations in VTA-GABAergic Neuronal Activity</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Decades of research have implicated the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in motivation, learning and reward processing. We and others recently demonstrated that it also serves as an important node in sleep/wake regulation. Specifically, VTA-dopaminergic neuron activation is sufficient to drive wakefulness and necessary for the maintenance of wakefulness. However, the role of VTA-GABAergic neurons in arousal regulation is not fully understood. It is still unclear whether VTA-GABAergic neurons predictably alter their activity across arousal states, what is the nature of interactions between VTA-GABAergic activity and cortical oscillations, and how activity in VTA-GABAergic neurons relates to VTA-dopaminergic neurons in the context of sleep/wake regulation. To address these, we simultaneously recorded population activity from VTA subpopulations and electroencephalography/electromyography (EEG/EMG) signals during spontaneous sleep/wake states and in the presence of salient stimuli in freely-behaving mice. We found that VTA-GABAergic neurons exhibit robust arousal-state-dependent alterations in population activity, with high activity and transients during wakefulness and REM sleep. During wakefulness, population activity of VTA-GABAergic neurons, but not VTA-dopaminergic neurons, was positively correlated with EEG  power and negatively correlated with  power. During NREM sleep, population activity in both VTA-GABAergic and VTA-dopaminergic neurons negatively correlated with , , and  power bands. Salient stimuli, with both positive and negative valence, activated VTA-GABAergic neurons. Together, our data indicate that VTA-GABAergic neurons, like their dopaminergic counterparts, drastically alter their activity across sleep-wake states. Changes in their activity predicts cortical oscillatory patterns reflected in the EEG, which are distinct from EEG spectra associated with dopaminergic neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Human‐Specific Transcriptome of Ventral and Dorsal Midbrain Dopamine Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25719?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25719?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) in Parkinson disease (PD) is not uniform, as dopamine neurons from the ventral tier are lost more rapidly than those of the dorsal tier. Identifying the intrinsic differences that account for this differential vulnerability may provide a key for developing new treatments for PD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we compared the RNA‐sequenced transcriptomes of ~100 laser captured microdissected SNpc neurons from each tier from 7 healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expression levels of dopaminergic markers were similar across the tiers, whereas markers specific to the neighboring ventral tegmental area were virtually undetected. After accounting for unwanted sources of variation, we identified 106 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the SNpc tiers. The genes higher in the dorsal/resistant SNpc tier neurons displayed coordinated patterns of expression across the human brain, their protein products had more interactions than expected by chance, and they demonstrated evidence of functional convergence. No significant shared functionality was found for genes higher in the ventral/vulnerable SNpc tier. Surprisingly but importantly, none of the identified DEGs was among the familial PD genes or genome‐wide associated loci. Finally, we found some DEGs in opposite tier orientation between human and analogous mouse populations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results highlight functional enrichments of vesicular trafficking, ion transport/homeostasis and oxidative stress genes showing higher expression in the resistant neurons of the SNpc dorsal tier. Furthermore, the comparison of gene expression variation in human and mouse SNpc populations strongly argues for the need of human‐focused omics studies. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Retinal topography and spectral sensitivity of the Port Jackson shark (Heterodontus portusjacksoni)</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Retinal topography and spectral sensitivity of the Port Jackson shark (Heterodontus portusjacksoni)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e3ebe4bf-4097-4d3a-8d5a-9fb2bd3235ce/cne24911-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Histological sections and electroretinography suggest the presence of a heavily rod dominated (and possibly rod‐only) retina in Port Jackson sharks. Mapping of the distribution of retinal neurons reveals a specialisation for higher visual acuity in a narrow horizontal band that corresponds to the part of the visual field covering the water‐substrate interface. Such a specialised retina would be well‐adapted to low‐light (scotopic) vision and a benthic lifestyle, and may assist the shark in finding food and avoiding predators.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we investigated the visual system of the Port Jackson shark &lt;i&gt;Heterodontus portusjacksoni&lt;/i&gt;, a shallow‐dwelling benthic species and generalist predator endemic to the temperate coastal waters around southern Australia. Measurements of retinal spectral sensitivity in juvenile sharks, made using single flash and heterochromatic flicker photometry under conditions of dark‐ or light‐adaptation, indicated a peak sensitivity at around 500 nm, with no evidence of a spectral shift with increasing levels of light adaptation. Histological sections of the retina revealed a heavily rod dominated retina containing only a few small cell profiles in the photoreceptor layer that might represent a sparse cone population or may be immature rods. Assessment of retinal topography in juvenile sharks indicated the presence of a distinct specialisation for increased visual spatial acuity in the form of a horizontal streak of higher rod photoreceptor (~80,000 rods mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) and ganglion cell (~1,800 cells mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) densities across the horizontal meridian of the eye. This specialisation would be adaptive for panoramic sampling of the part of the visual field corresponding to the substrate‐water interface and remove the need for &lt;i&gt;H. portusjacksoni&lt;/i&gt; to move its eyes extensively when resting on the sea floor. The estimated upper limit of spatial resolving power in juvenile &lt;i&gt;H. portusjacksoni&lt;/i&gt; was 3.14 cycles deg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is at the lower end of values measured in elasmobranchs. Taken together, these results suggest that the retina of &lt;i&gt;H. portusjacksoni&lt;/i&gt; is well adapted for nocturnal vision.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Senescent cells secrete several molecules, collectively named &lt;i&gt;senescence-associated secretory phenotype&lt;/i&gt; (SASP). In the SASP of cells that became senescent following several &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; chemical and physical stress, we identified the IGFBP-4 protein that can be considered a general stress mediator. This factor appeared to play a key role in senescence-paracrine signaling. We provided evidences showing that genotoxic injury, such as low dose irradiation, may promote an IGFBP-4 release in bloodstream both in mice irradiated with 100 mGy X-ray and in human subjects that received Computer Tomography. Increased level of circulating IGFBP-4 may be responsible of pro-aging effect. We found a significant increase of senescent cells in the lungs, heart, and kidneys of mice that were intraperitoneally injected with IGFBP-4 twice a week for two months. We then analyzed how genotoxic stressors may promote the release of IGFBP-4 and the molecular pathways associated with the induction of senescence by this protein.</description>

	<title>eLife: Targeting mir128-3p alleviates myocardial insulin resistance and prevents ischemia-induced heart failure</title>

	<description>Myocardial insulin resistance contributes to heart failure in response to pathological stresses, therefore, a therapeutic strategy to maintain cardiac insulin pathways requires further investigation. We demonstrated that insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) was reduced in failing mouse hearts post-myocardial infarction (MI) and failing human hearts. The mice manifesting severe cardiac dysfunction post-MI displayed elevated &lt;i&gt;mir128-3p&lt;/i&gt; in the myocardium. Ischemia-upregulated &lt;i&gt;mir128-3p&lt;/i&gt; promoted &lt;i&gt;Irs1&lt;/i&gt; degradation. Using rat cardiomyocytes and human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, we elucidated that mitogen-activated protein kinase 7 (MAPK7, also known as ERK5)-mediated CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBPβ) transcriptionally represses &lt;i&gt;mir128-3p&lt;/i&gt; under hypoxia. Therapeutically, functional studies demonstrated gene therapy-delivered cardiac-specific MAPK7 restoration or overexpression of CEBPβ impeded cardiac injury after MI, at least partly due to normalization of &lt;i&gt;mir128-3p&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, inhibition of &lt;i&gt;mir128-3p&lt;/i&gt; preserved &lt;i&gt;Irs1&lt;/i&gt; and ameliorated cardiac dysfunction post-MI. In conclusion, we reveal that targeting &lt;i&gt;mir128-3p&lt;/i&gt; mitigates myocardial insulin resistance, thereafter slowing down the progression of heart failure post-ischemia.</description>

	<title>eLife: Prediction signals in the cerebellum: beyond supervised motor learning</title>

	<description>While classical views of cerebellar learning have suggested that this structure predominantly operates according to an error-based supervised learning rule to refine movements, emerging evidence suggests that the cerebellum may also harness a wider range of learning rules to contribute to a variety of behaviors, including cognitive processes. Together, such evidence points to a broad role for cerebellar circuits in generating and testing predictions about movement, reward, and other non-motor operations. However, this expanded view of cerebellar processing also raises many new questions about how such apparent diversity of function arises from a structure with striking homogeneity. Hence, this review will highlight both current evidence for predictive cerebellar circuit function that extends beyond the classical view of error-driven supervised learning, as well as open questions that must be addressed to unify our understanding cerebellar circuit function.</description>

	<title>eLife: Theoretical relation between axon initial segment geometry and excitability</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53432</link>
	<description>In most vertebrate neurons, action potentials are triggered at the distal end of the axon initial segment (AIS). Both position and length of the AIS vary across and within neuron types, with activity, development and pathology. What is the impact of AIS geometry on excitability? Direct empirical assessment has proven difficult because of the many potential confounding factors. Here we carried a principled theoretical analysis to answer this question. We provide a simple formula relating AIS geometry and sodium conductance density to the somatic voltage threshold. A distal shift of the AIS normally produces a (modest) increase in excitability, but we explain how this pattern can reverse if a hyperpolarizing current is present at the AIS, due to resistive coupling with the soma. This work provides a theoretical tool to assess the significance of structural AIS plasticity for electrical function.</description>

	<title>eLife: A branched heterochronic pathway directs juvenile-to-adult transition through two LIN-29 isoforms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.53387</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53387</link>
	<description>Robust organismal development relies on temporal coordination of disparate physiological processes. In &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, the heterochronic pathway controls a timely juvenile-to-adult (J/A) transition. This regulatory cascade of conserved proteins and small RNAs culminates in accumulation of the transcription factor LIN-29, which triggers coordinated execution of transition events. We report that two LIN-29 isoforms fulfill distinct functions. Functional specialization is a consequence of distinct isoform expression patterns, not protein sequence, and we propose that distinct LIN-29 dose sensitivities of the individual J/A transition events help to ensure their temporal ordering. We demonstrate that unique isoform expression patterns are generated by the activities of LIN-41 for &lt;i&gt;lin-29a&lt;/i&gt;, and of HBL-1 for &lt;i&gt;lin-&lt;/i&gt;29&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;, whereas the RNA-binding protein LIN-28 coordinates LIN-29 isoform activity, in part by regulating both &lt;i&gt;hbl-1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;lin-41&lt;/i&gt;. Our findings reveal that coordinated transition from juvenile to adult involves branching of a linear pathway to achieve timely control of multiple events.</description>

	<title>eLife: Co-evolution within structured bacterial communities results in multiple expansion of CRISPR loci and enhanced immunity</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53078</link>
	<description>Type II CRISPR-Cas systems provide immunity against phages and plasmids that infect bacteria through the insertion of a short sequence from the invader’s genome, known as the ‘spacer’, into the CRISPR locus. Spacers are transcribed into guide RNAs that direct the Cas9 nuclease to its target on the invader. In liquid cultures, most bacteria acquire a single spacer. Multiple spacer integration is a rare event which significance for immunity is poorly understood. Here, we found that when phage infections occur on solid media, a high proportion of the surviving colonies display complex morphologies that contain cells with multiple spacers. This is the result of the viral-host co-evolution, in which the immunity provided by the initial acquired spacer is easily overcome by escaper phages. Our results reveal the versatility of CRISPR-Cas immunity, which can respond with both single or multiple spacer acquisition schemes to solve challenges presented by different environments.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: A novel mouse model of glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor expression: A look at the brain</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;A novel mouse model of glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor expression: A look at the brain&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3545434f-0429-43b0-9a38-ca2f7e330ffb/cne24905-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a BAC transgenic mouse model of the glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor (GLP‐1R) whereby expression of a red fluorescent protein (mApple) was driven by the GLP‐1R promoter. We further characterized the expression patterns and cellular specificity of these neurons in order to better understand the functional roles of GLP‐1R.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) is an incretin hormone with a number of functions to maintain energy homeostasis and contribute to motivated behavior, both peripherally and within the central nervous system (CNS). These functions, which include insulin secretion, gastric emptying, satiety, and the hedonic aspects of food and drug intake, are primarily mediated through stimulation of the GLP‐1 receptor. While this receptor plays an important role in a variety of physiological outcomes, data regarding its CNS expression has been primarily limited to regional receptor binding and single‐label transcript expression studies. We thus developed a bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mouse, in which expression of a red fluorescent protein (mApple) is driven by the GLP‐1R promoter. Using this reporter mouse, we characterized the regional and cellular expression patterns of GLP‐1R expressing cells in the CNS, using double‐label immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. GLP‐1R‐expressing cells were enriched in several key brain regions and circuits, including the lateral septum, hypothalamus, amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, hippocampus, ventral midbrain, periaqueductal gray, and cerebral cortex. In most regions, GLP‐1R primarily colocalized with GABAergic neurons, except within some regions such as the hippocampus, where it was co‐expressed in glutamatergic neurons. GLP‐1R‐mApple cells were highly co‐expressed with 5‐HT3 receptor‐containing neurons within the cortex and striatum, as well as with dopamine receptor‐ and calbindin‐expressing cells within the lateral septum, the brain region in which GLP‐1R is most highly expressed. In this manuscript, we provide detailed images of GLP‐1R‐mApple expression and distribution within the brain and characterization of these neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The day‐night differences in ERK1/2, GSK3β activity and c‐Fos levels in the brain, and the responsiveness of various brain structures to morphine</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The day‐night differences in ERK1/2, GSK3β activity and c‐Fos levels in the brain, and the responsiveness of various brain structures to morphine&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d19a97bc-c759-445d-9ca9-ddd28ceb0687/cne24906-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of brain structures in which acute morphine induced or suppressed the level of c‐Fos, pERK1/2 and pGSK3β. While the c‐Fos level in the brain is either upregulated or unchanged, the levels of phosphorylated forms of both kinases can be upregulated as well as downregulated below the baseline level. The day/night variation in the spontaneous levels of all markers may affect the direction, rate, and magnitude of the response to morphine.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with other drugs or pharmaceuticals, opioids differ in their rewarding or analgesic effects depending on when they are applied. In the previous study, we have demonstrated the day/night difference in the sensitivity of the major circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus to a low dose of morphine, and showed the bidirectional effect of morphine on pERK1/2 and pGSK3β levels in the suprachiasmatic nucleus depending on the time of administration. The main aim of this study was to identify other brain structures that respond differently to morphine depending on the time of its administration. Using immunohistochemistry, we identified 44 structures that show time‐of‐day specific changes in c‐Fos level and activity of ERK1/2 and GSK3β kinases in response to a single dose of 1 mg/kg morphine. Furthermore, comparison among control groups revealed the differences in the spontaneous levels of all markers with a generally higher level during the night, that is, in the active phase of the day. We thus provide further evidence for diurnal variations in the activity of brain regions outside the suprachiasmatic nucleus indicated by the temporal changes in the molecular substrate. We suggest that these changes are responsible for generating diurnal variation in the reward behavior or analgesic effect of opioid administration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: The polarity and properties of radial glia‐like neural stem cells are altered by seizures with status epilepticus: Study using an improved mouse pilocarpine model of epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23153?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the adult mouse hippocampus, new neurons are produced by radial glia‐like (RGL) neural stem cells in the subgranular zone, which extend their apical processes toward the molecular layer, and express the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein, but not the astrocyte marker S100β. In rodent models of epilepsy, adult hippocampal neurogenesis was reported to be increased after acute and mild seizures, but to be decreased by chronic and severe epilepsy. In the present study, we investigated how the severity of seizures affects neurogenesis and RGL neural stem cells in acute stages of epilepsy, using an improved mouse pilocarpine model in which pilocarpine‐induced hypothermia was prevented by maintaining body temperature, resulting in a high incidence rate of epileptic seizures and low rate of mortality. In mice that experienced seizures without status epilepticus (SE), the number of proliferating progenitors and immature neurons were significantly increased, whereas no changes were observed in RGL cells. In mice that experienced seizures with SE, the number of proliferating progenitors and immature neurons were unchanged, but the number of RGL cells with an apical process was significantly reduced. Furthermore, the processes of the majority of RGL cells extended inversely toward the hilus, and about half of the aberrant RGL cells expressed S100β. These results suggest that seizures with SE lead to changes in the polarity and properties of RGL neural stem cells, which may direct them toward astrocyte differentiation, resulting in the reduction of neural stem cells producing new granule cells. This also suggests the possibility that cell polarity of RGL stem cells is important for maintaining the stemness of adult neural stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Interplay of the long axis of the hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in schema‐related memory retrieval</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When new information is relevant to prior knowledge or schema, it can be learned and remembered better. Rodent studies have suggested that the hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) are important for processing schema‐related information. However, there are inconsistent findings from human studies on the involvement of the hippocampus and its interaction with the vmPFC in schema‐related memory retrieval. To address these issues, we used a human analog of the rodent spatial schema task to compare brain activity during immediate retrieval of paired associations (PAs) in schema‐consistent and schema‐inconsistent conditions. The results showed that the anterior hippocampus was more involved in retrieving PAs in the schema‐consistent condition than in the schema‐inconsistent condition. Connectivity analyses showed that the anterior hippocampus had stronger coupling with the vmPFC when the participants retrieved newly learned PAs successfully in the schema‐consistent (vs. schema‐inconsistent) condition, whereas the coupling of the posterior hippocampus with the vmPFC showed the opposite. Taken together, the results shed light on how the long axis of the hippocampus and vmPFC interact to serve memory retrieval via different networks that differ by schema condition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Place cell firing cannot support navigation without intact septal circuits</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it has been known for over half a century that interference with the normal activity of septohippocampal neurons can abolish hippocampal theta rhythmicity, a definitive answer to the question of its function has remained elusive. To clarify the role of septal circuits and theta in location‐specific activity of place cells and spatial behavior, three drugs were delivered to the medial septum of rats: Tetracaine, a local anesthetic; muscimol, a GABA‐A agonist; and gabazine, a GABA‐A antagonist. All three drugs disrupted normal oscillatory activity in the hippocampus. However, tetracaine and muscimol both reduced spatial firing and interfered with the rat's ability to navigate to a hidden goal. After gabazine, location‐specific firing was preserved in the absence of theta, but rats were unable to accurately locate the hidden goal. These results indicate that theta is unnecessary for location‐specific firing of hippocampal cells, and that place cell activity cannot support accurate navigation when septal circuits are disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: The rodent hippocampus as a bilateral structure: A review of hemispheric lateralization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23188?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23188?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left and right rodent hippocampi exhibit striking lateralization in some of the very neural substrates considered to be critical for hippocampal cognitive function. Despite this, there is an overwhelming lack of consideration for hemispheric differences in studies of the rodent hippocampus. Asymmetries identified so far suggest that a bilateral model of the hippocampus will be essential for an understanding of this brain region, and perhaps of the brain more widely. Although hypotheses have been proposed to explain how the left and right hippocampi contribute to behavior and cognition, these hypotheses have either been refuted by more recent studies or have been limited in the scope of data they explain. Here, I will first review data on human and rodent hippocampal lateralization. The implications of these data suggest that considering the hippocampus as a bilateral structure with functional lateralization will be critical moving forward in understanding the function and mechanisms of this brain region. In exploring these implications, I will then propose a hypothesis of the hippocampus as a bilateral structure. This discrete‐continuous hypothesis proposes that the left and right hippocampi contribute to spatial memory and navigation in a complementary manner. Specifically, the left hemisphere stores spatial information as discrete, salient locations, and the right hemisphere represents space continuously, contributing to route computation and flexible spatial navigation. Consideration of hippocampal lateralization in designing future studies may provide insight into the function of the hippocampus and resolve debates concerning its function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Modulation of local field potentials and neuronal activity in primate hippocampus during saccades</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primates use saccades to gather information about objects and their relative spatial arrangement, a process essential for visual perception and memory. It has been proposed that signals linked to saccades reset the phase of local field potential (LFP) oscillations in the hippocampus, providing a temporal window for visual signals to activate neurons in this region and influence memory formation. We investigated this issue by measuring hippocampal LFPs and spikes in two macaques performing different tasks with unconstrained eye movements. We found that LFP phase clustering (PC) in the alpha/beta (8–16 Hz) frequencies followed foveation onsets, while PC in frequencies lower than 8 Hz followed spontaneous saccades, even on a homogeneous background. Saccades to a solid grey background were not followed by increases in local neuronal firing, whereas saccades toward appearing visual stimuli were. Finally, saccade parameters correlated with LFPs phase and amplitude: saccade direction correlated with delta (≤4 Hz) phase, and saccade amplitude with theta (4–8 Hz) power. Our results suggest that signals linked to saccades reach the hippocampus, producing synchronization of delta/theta LFPs without a general activation of local neurons. Moreover, some visual inputs co‐occurring with saccades produce LFP synchronization in the alpha/beta bands and elevated neuronal firing. Our findings support the hypothesis that saccade‐related signals enact sensory input‐dependent plasticity and therefore memory formation in the primate hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have taken a number of different approaches in their exploration of hippocampal function. One approach seeks to describe hippocampal function by probing the memory representations that the hippocampus supports. Another approach focuses on the role of the hippocampus in pattern separation and completion. Each of these approaches to understanding hippocampal function utilizes a distinct set of specialized tasks, and both of these task sets are known to be sensitive to changes in hippocampal function with age and disease status. But the question remains whether the tasks utilized in these two approaches tap into the same aspects of hippocampal function. We explored this question in the context of hippocampal development. Preadolescent children (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 73) and young adults (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 41) completed an identical battery of cognitive tasks consisting of a spatial reconstruction relational memory task, the mnemonic similarity task (MST)—an object‐based pattern separation task, and a novel hybrid task—the Object Discrimination and Distribution (ODD) Task—designed to integrate and simultaneously tax pattern separation and spatial relational memory. Children did not demonstrate impairments in lure discrimination relative to young adults on either the object‐based pattern separation task or for aspects of the ODD task that required pattern separation in the absence of relational memory demands but performed more poorly across aspects of tasks that required relational binding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Navigating with grid and place cells in cluttered environments</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23147?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal formation contains several classes of neurons thought to be involved in navigational processes, in particular place cells and grid cells. Place cells have been associated with a topological strategy for navigation, while grid cells have been suggested to support metric vector navigation. Grid cell‐based vector navigation can support novel shortcuts across unexplored territory by providing the direction toward the goal. However, this strategy is insufficient in natural environments cluttered with obstacles. Here, we show how navigation in complex environments can be supported by integrating a grid cell‐based vector navigation mechanism with local obstacle avoidance mediated by border cells and place cells whose interconnections form an experience‐dependent topological graph of the environment. When vector navigation and object avoidance fail (i.e., the agent gets stuck), place cell replay events set closer subgoals for vector navigation. We demonstrate that this combined navigation model can successfully traverse environments cluttered by obstacles and is particularly useful where the environment is underexplored. Finally, we show that the model enables the simulated agent to successfully navigate experimental maze environments from the animal literature on cognitive mapping. The proposed model is sufficiently flexible to support navigation in different environments, and may inform the design of experiments to relate different navigational abilities to place, grid, and border cell firing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Differential developmental refinement of the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons from the rat dorsal and ventral hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23152?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dorsal and ventral regions of the rat longitudinal hippocampal axis are functionally distinct. That is, each region is associated with different behavioral tasks and disease susceptibilities due to underlying anatomical, and physiological differences. These differences are especially pronounced in area CA1, where significant differences in morphology, synaptic physiology, intrinsic excitability, and gene expression have been reported between CA1 pyramidal neurons from the dorsal (DHC) and ventral hippocampus (VHC). However, despite a significant amount of recent attention, a cogent picture of the intrinsic electrophysiological profile of DHC and VHC neurons has remained elusive, due, in part, to experiments performed on rats at different developmental time points. Moreover, the resulting intrinsic electrophysiological profiles are sufficiently different as to warrant a thorough investigation of the spatial and temporal changes in the intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons across developmental time. Accordingly, in this study, I have characterized the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons from acute hippocampal slices prepared from the DHC and VHC throughout an approximately 3‐week developmental period (P14–P37). DHC and VHC neurons exhibited distinct intra‐region changes (DHC or VHC) and inter‐region differences (DHC versus VHC) in their intrinsic electrophysiological properties, which yielded two developmental timelines: (a) a common developmental timeline describing changes observed in both DHC and VHC neurons, and (b) a differential developmental timeline highlighting unique features observed in DHC neurons. Specifically, DHC neurons exhibited significant inter‐region differences in RMP, input resistance, threshold, and spike frequency adaptation relative to VHC neurons, as well as an intra‐region change in the rebound slope (a proxy for &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;). These observations both integrate and reconcile previous work performed with rats at different developmental stages and suggest a distinct developmental trajectory for DHC neurons that might shed light on the normal physiological functions and disease susceptibility of the DHC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Retinal morphology in Astyanax mexicanus during eye degeneration&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bf732163-249b-4437-924e-d846bbe237d7/cne24835-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we use immunohistochemistry to show that the degenerating retina of the cavefish &lt;i&gt;Astyanax mexicanus&lt;/i&gt; is marked by two important features. First, the neuroretina contains all cell types commonly see in the circuit. Presumably these components will later degenerate as the lens dies. Second, the outer segments of the photoreceptors are already malformed from early stages of development. It is interesting to note how evolution has severed a cell in half.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teleost &lt;i&gt;Astyanax mexicanus&lt;/i&gt; is one species extant in two readily available forms. One that lives in Mexican rivers and various convergent forms that live in nearby caves. These fish are born with eyes but in the cavefish, they degenerate during development. It is known that the lens of cavefish undergoes apoptosis and that some cells in the neuroretina also die. It has not been described, however, if glia and various components of the neuroretina form before complete eye degeneration. Here we examined the development of the retina of the closest living ancestor that lives in the rivers and two independently adapted of cavefish. We report that although the neuroretina is smaller and more compact, it has all cell types and layers including amacrine cells and Müller glia. While various makers for photoreceptors are present in the cavefish inner segments, the outer segments of the photoreceptors in cavefish are missing from the earliest stages examined. This shows that the machinery for visual transducing discs might still be present but not organized in one part of the cell. It is interesting to note that the deficiencies in Astyanax cavefish resemble retinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Inner retinal preservation in the photoinducible I307N rhodopsin mutant mouse, a model of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b4d8995f-7c4c-47b5-a529-861c939fdb1a/cne24838-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tvrm4 rhodopsin mutant mice undergo rapid photoreceptor loss upon bright light exposure. Early consequences on the inner retina involve mainly second‐order neurons and include quick dendritic retraction and axonal shrinkage in rod bipolar cells (RBCs) and, later, in cone BCs and the presence of anomalous globular synaptic ribbons (GR). Yet, BC survival is nearly 100% and retinal architecture is overall well preserved. Hence, early remodeling in this adult mutant is moderate and similar to what observed in developmental paradigms of retinitis pigmentosa.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rod‐cone degenerations, for example, retinitis pigmentosa are leading causes of blindness worldwide. Despite slow disease progression in humans, vision loss is inevitable; therefore, development of vision restoration strategies is crucial. Among others, promising approaches include optogenetics and prosthetic implants, which aim to bypass lost photoreceptors (PRs). Naturally, the efficacy of these therapeutic strategies will depend on inner retinal structural and functional preservation. The present study shows that in photoinducible I307N rhodopsin mice (Translational Vision Research Model 4 [Tvrm4]), a 12k lux light exposure eliminates PRs in the central retina in 1 week, but interneurons and their synapses are maintained for as long as 9 weeks postinduction. Despite bipolar cell dendritic retraction and moderate loss of horizontal cells, the survival rate of various cell types is very high. Significant preservation of conventional synapses and gap junctions in the inner plexiform layer is also observed. We found the number of synaptic ribbons to gradually decline and their ultrastructure to become transiently abnormal, although based on our findings intrinsic retinal architecture is maintained despite complete loss of PRs. Unlike common rodent models of PR degeneration, where the disease phenotype often interferes with retinal development, in Tvrm4 mice, the degenerative process can be induced after retinal development is complete. This time course more closely mimics the timing of disease onset in affected patients. Stability of the inner retina found in these mutants 2 months after PR degeneration suggests moderate, stereotyped remodeling in the early stages of the human disease and represents a promising finding for prompt approaches of vision restoration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a public health threat in low TB incidence countries, through a combination of reactivated disease and onward transmission. Using surveillance data from the United Kingdom (UK) and the Netherlands (NL), we demonstrate a simple and predictable relationship between the probability of observing a cluster and its size (the number of cases with a single genotype). We demonstrate that the full range of observed cluster sizes can be described using a modified branching process model with the individual reproduction number following a Poisson lognormal distribution. We estimate that, on average, between 2010 and 2015, a TB case generated 0.41 (95% CrI 0.30,0.60) secondary cases in the UK, and 0.24 (0.14,0.48) secondary cases in the NL. A majority of cases did not generate any secondary cases. Recent transmission accounted for 39% (26%,60%) of UK cases and 23%(13%,37%) of NL cases. We predict that reducing UK transmission rates to those observed in the NL would result in 538(266,818) fewer cases annually in the UK. In conclusion, while TB in low incidence countries is strongly associated with reactivated infections, we demonstrate that recent transmission remains sufficient to warrant policies aimed at limiting local TB spread.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zOdHl606mLw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Social insect colonies exhibit colony-level phenotypes such as social immunity and task coordination, which are produced by the individual phenotypes. Mapping the genetic basis of such phenotypes requires associating the colony-level phenotype with the genotypes in the colony. In this paper, we examine alternative approaches to DNA extraction, library construction, and sequencing for genome wide association studies (GWAS) of colony-level traits using a population sample of &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis niger&lt;/i&gt; ants. We evaluate the accuracy of allele frequency estimation from sequencing a pool of individuals (pool-seq) from each colony using either whole-genome sequencing or reduced representation genomic sequencing. Based on empirical measurement of the experimental noise in sequenced DNA pools, we show that reduced representation pool-seq is drastically less accurate than whole-genome pool-seq. Surprisingly, normalized pooling of samples did not result in greater accuracy than un-normalized pooling. Subsequently, we evaluate the power of the alternative approaches for detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL) of colony-level traits by using simulations that account for an environmental effect on the phenotype. Our results can inform experimental designs and enable optimizing the power of GWAS depending on budget, availability of samples and research goals. We conclude that for a given budget, sequencing un-normalized pools of individuals from each colony provides optimal QTL detection power.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Q_GOl3uKNVE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Credibility of scientific claims is established with evidence for their replicability using new data. According to common understanding, replication is repeating a study’s procedure and observing whether the prior finding recurs. This definition is intuitive, easy to apply, and incorrect. We propose that replication is a study for which any outcome would be considered diagnostic evidence about a claim from prior research. This definition reduces emphasis on operational characteristics of the study and increases emphasis on the interpretation of possible outcomes. The purpose of replication is to advance theory by confronting existing understanding with new evidence. Ironically, the value of replication may be strongest when existing understanding is weakest. Successful replication provides evidence of generalizability across the conditions that inevitably differ from the original study; Unsuccessful replication indicates that the reliability of the finding may be more constrained than recognized previously. Defining replication as a confrontation of current theoretical expectations clarifies its important, exciting, and generative role in scientific progress.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/uaQ3infk5f8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Urolithin A exerts antiobesity effects through enhancing adipose tissue thermogenesis in mice</title>

Obesity leads to multiple health problems, including diabetes, fatty liver, and even cancer. Here, we report that urolithin A (UA), a gut-microflora–derived metabolite of pomegranate ellagitannins (ETs), prevents diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunctions in mice without causing adverse effects. UA treatment increases energy expenditure (EE) by enhancing thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and inducing browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). Mechanistically, UA-mediated increased thermogenesis is caused by an elevation of triiodothyronine (T3) levels in BAT and inguinal fat depots. This is also confirmed in UA-treated white and brown adipocytes. Consistent with this mechanism, UA loses its beneficial effects on activation of BAT, browning of white fat, body weight control, and glucose homeostasis when thyroid hormone (TH) production is blocked by its inhibitor, propylthiouracil (PTU). Conversely, administration of exogenous tetraiodothyronine (T4) to PTU-treated mice restores UA-induced activation of BAT and browning of white fat and its preventive role on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced weight gain. Together, these results suggest that UA is a potent antiobesity agent with potential for human clinical applications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bLupb1iHL9c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter J. Hotez&lt;/p&gt;

In the last half of the 2010s, we saw an upswing in antiscience movements and unprecedented attacks on scientists in the United States and elsewhere. All indications suggest that this trend will not slow or reverse anytime soon, and it is now increasingly apparent that it will fall to the scientists themselves to respond, engage a skeptical public, and lead the defense of science. Accordingly, we must recognize opportunities to both reorganize science doctoral and postdoctoral training and incentivize senior scientists as a means to establish a new ecosystem for science public engagement. Such activities may become essential if the assaults on our profession continue or expand. Today, the commitment of young scientists to public service is at an all-time high. However, we must work quickly to capture that enthusiasm and channel it into a social good, lest we lose this opportunity. Potentially, open-access publishers could play a central role.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/XU7VvEvo0OU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a powerful tool for gene silencing that has been used for a wide range of biomedical applications, but there are many challenges facing its therapeutic use in vivo. Here, we report on a platelet cell membrane–coated metal-organic framework (MOF) nanodelivery platform for the targeted delivery of siRNA in vivo. The MOF core is capable of high loading yields, and its pH sensitivity enables endosomal disruption upon cellular uptake. The cell membrane coating provides a natural means of biointerfacing with disease substrates. It is shown that high silencing efficiency can be achieved in vitro against multiple target genes. Using a murine xenograft model, significant antitumor targeting and therapeutic efficacy are observed. Overall, the biomimetic nanodelivery system presented here provides an effective means of achieving gene silencing in vivo and could be used to expand the applicability of siRNA across a range of disease-relevant applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We study topologically protected four-wave mixing (FWM) interactions in a plasmonic metasurface consisting of a periodic array of nanoholes in a graphene sheet, which exhibits a wide topological bandgap at terahertz frequencies upon the breaking of time reversal symmetry by a static magnetic field. We demonstrate that due to the significant nonlinearity enhancement and large life time of graphene plasmons in specific configurations, a net gain of FWM interaction of plasmonic edge states located in the topological bandgap can be achieved with a pump power of less than 10 nW. In particular, we find that the effective nonlinear edge-waveguide coefficient is about  ~= 1.1 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; W&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e., more than 10 orders of magnitude larger than that of commonly used, highly nonlinear silicon photonic nanowires. These findings could pave a new way for developing ultralow-power-consumption, highly integrated, and robust active photonic systems at deep-subwavelength scale for applications in quantum communications and information processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic covalent polymer networks exhibit unusual adaptability while maintaining the robustness of conventional covalent networks. Typically, their network topology is statistically nonchangeable, and their material properties are therefore nonprogrammable. By introducing topological heterogeneity, we demonstrate a concept of topology isomerizable network (TIN) that can be programmed into many topological states. Using a photo-latent catalyst that controls the isomerization reaction, spatiotemporal manipulation of the topology is realized. The overall result is that the network polymer can be programmed into numerous polymers with distinctive and spatially definable (thermo-) mechanical properties. Among many opportunities for practical applications, the unique attributes of TIN can be explored for use as shape-shifting structures, adaptive robotic arms, and fracture-resistant stretchable devices, showing a high degree of design versatility. The TIN concept enriches the design of polymers, with potential expansion into other materials with variations in dynamic covalent chemistries, isomerizable topologies, and programmable macroscopic properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science Advances current issue: A novel physical mechanism of liquid flow slippage on a solid surface</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/13/eaaz0504?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Viscous liquids often exhibit flow slippage on solid walls. The occurrence of flow slippage has a large impact on the liquid transport and the resulting energy dissipation, which are crucial for many applications. It is natural to expect that slippage takes place to reduce the dissipation. However, (i) how the density fluctuation is affected by the presence of the wall and (ii) how slippage takes place through forming a gas layer remained elusive. Here, we report possible answers to these fundamental questions: (i) Density fluctuation is intrinsically enhanced near the wall even in a quiescent state irrespective of the property of wall, and (ii) it is the density dependence of the viscosity that destabilizes the system toward gas-layer formation under shear flow. Our scenario of shear-induced gas-phase formation provides a natural physical explanation for wall slippage of liquid flow, covering the slip length ranging from a microscopic (nanometers) to macroscopic (micrometers) scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cavitation is a common damage mechanism in soft solids. Here, we study this using a phase separation technique in stretched, elastic solids to controllably nucleate and grow small cavities by several orders of magnitude. The ability to make stable cavities of different sizes, as well as the huge range of accessible strains, allows us to systematically study the early stages of cavity expansion. Cavities grow in a scale-free manner, accompanied by irreversible bond breakage that is distributed around the growing cavity rather than being localized to a crack tip. Furthermore, cavities appear to grow at constant driving pressure. This has strong analogies with the plasticity that occurs surrounding a growing void in ductile metals. In particular, we find that, although elastomers are normally considered as brittle materials, small-scale cavity expansion is more like a ductile process. Our results have broad implications for understanding and controlling failure in soft solids.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science Advances current issue: Nonreciprocal transport in gate-induced polar superconductor SrTiO3</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Polar conductors/superconductors with Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction are potential material platforms for quantum transport and spintronic functionalities. One of their inherent properties is the nonreciprocal transport, where the rightward and leftward currents become inequivalent, reflecting spatial inversion/time-reversal symmetry breaking. Such a rectification effect originating from the polar symmetry has been recently observed at interfaces or bulk Rashba semiconductors, while its mechanism in a polar superconductor remains elusive. Here, we report the nonreciprocal transport in gate-induced two-dimensional superconductor SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is a Rashba superconductor candidate. In addition to the gigantic enhancement of nonreciprocal signals in the superconducting fluctuation region, we found kink and sharp peak structures around critical temperatures, which reflect the crossover behavior from the paraconductivity origin to the vortex origin, based on a microscopic theory. The present result proves that the nonreciprocal transport is a powerful tool for investigating the interfacial/polar superconductors without inversion symmetry, where rich exotic features are theoretically prognosticated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science Advances current issue: Soft crystal martensites: An in situ resonant soft x-ray scattering study of a liquid crystal martensitic transformation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Liquid crystal blue phases (BPs) are three-dimensional soft crystals with unit cell sizes orders of magnitude larger than those of classic, atomic crystals. The directed self-assembly of BPs on chemically patterned surfaces uniquely enables detailed in situ resonant soft x-ray scattering measurements of martensitic phase transformations in these systems. The formation of twin lamellae is explicitly identified during the BPII-to-BPI transformation, further corroborating the martensitic nature of this transformation and broadening the analogy between soft and atomic crystal diffusionless phase transformations to include their strain-release mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electromechanical coupling in piezoelectric materials allows direct conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy and vice versa. Here, we demonstrate lead-free (K&lt;i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Na&lt;sub&gt;1–&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)NbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals with an ultrahigh large-signal piezoelectric coefficient &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;* of 9000 pm V&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is superior to the highest value reported in state-of-the-art lead-based single crystals (~2500 pm V&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;). The enhanced electromechanical properties in our crystals are realized by an engineered compositional gradient in the as-grown crystal, allowing notable reversible non-180° domain wall motion. Moreover, our crystals exhibit temperature-insensitive strain performance within the temperature range of 25°C to 125°C. The enhanced temperature stability of the response also allows the materials to be used in a wider range of applications that exceed the temperature limits of current lead-based piezoelectric crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Science Advances current issue: Twist again: Dynamically and reversibly controllable chirality in liquid crystalline elastomer microposts</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Photoresponsive liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) constitute ideal actuators for soft robots because their light-induced macroscopic shape changes can be harnessed to perform specific articulated motions. Conventional LCEs, however, do not typically exhibit complex modes of bending and twisting necessary to perform sophisticated maneuvers. Here, we model LCE microposts encompassing side-chain mesogens oriented along a magnetically programmed nematic director, and azobenzene cross-linkers, which determine the deformations of illuminated posts. On altering the nematic director orientation from vertical to horizontal, the post’s bending respectively changes from light-seeking to light-avoiding. Moreover, both modeling and subsequent experiments show that with the director tilted at 45°, the initially achiral post reversibly twists into a right- or left-handed chiral structure, controlled by the angle of incident light. We exploit this photoinduced chirality to design &quot;chimera&quot; posts (encompassing two regions with distinct director orientations) that exhibit simultaneous bending and twisting, mimicking motions exhibited by the human musculoskeletal system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Quantum-enhanced optical systems operating within the 2- to 2.5-μm spectral region have the potential to revolutionize emerging applications in communications, sensing, and metrology. However, to date, sources of entangled photons have been realized mainly in the near-infrared 700- to 1550-nm spectral window. Here, using custom-designed lithium niobate crystals for spontaneous parametric down-conversion and tailored superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, we demonstrate two-photon interference and polarization-entangled photon pairs at 2090 nm. These results open the 2- to 2.5-μm mid-infrared window for the development of optical quantum technologies such as quantum key distribution in next-generation mid-infrared fiber communication systems and future Earth-to-satellite communications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Chronic Activation of Gp1 mGluRs Leads to Distinct Refinement of Neural Network Activity through Non-Canonical p53 and Akt Signaling</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (Gp1 mGluRs), including mGluR1 and mGluR5, are critical regulators for neuronal and synaptic plasticity. Dysregulated Gp1 mGluR signaling is observed with various neurologic disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). It is well established that acute activation of Gp1 mGluRs leads to elevation of neuronal intrinsic excitability and long-term synaptic depression. However, it remains unknown how chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs can affect neural activity and what molecular mechanisms might be involved. In the current study, we employed a multielectrode array (MEA) recording system to evaluate neural network activity of primary mouse cortical neuron cultures. We demonstrated that chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs leads to elevation of spontaneous spike frequency while burst activity and cross-electrode synchronization are maintained at the baseline. We further showed that these neural network properties are achieved through proteasomal degradation of Akt that is dependent on the tumor suppressor p53. Genetically knocking down p53 disrupts the elevation of spontaneous spike frequency and alters the burst activity and cross-electrode synchronization following chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs. Importantly, these deficits can be restored by pharmacologically inhibiting Akt to mimic inactivation of Akt mediated by p53. Together, our findings reveal the effects of chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs on neural network activity and identify a unique signaling pathway involving p53 and Akt for these effects. Our data can provide insights into constitutively active Gp1 mGluR signaling observed in many neurologic and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Feeding, a critical behavior for survival, consists of a complex series of behavioral steps. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larvae, the initial steps of feeding are food choice, during which the quality of a potential food source is judged, and ingestion, during which the selected food source is ingested into the digestive tract. It remains unclear whether these steps employ different mechanisms of neural perception. Here, we provide insight into the two initial steps of feeding in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larva. We find that substrate choice and ingestion are determined by independent circuits at the cellular level. First, we took 22 candidate bitter compounds and examined their influence on choice preference and ingestion behavior. Interestingly, certain bitter tastants caused different responses in choice and ingestion, suggesting distinct mechanisms of perception. We further provide evidence that certain gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) in the external terminal organ are involved in determining choice preference, and a pair of larval pharyngeal GRNs is involved in mediating both avoidance and suppression of ingestion. Our results show that feeding behavior is coordinated by a multi-step regulatory process employing relatively independent neural elements. These findings are consistent with a model in which distinct sensory pathways act as modulatory circuits controlling distinct subprograms during feeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Here we provide molecular and cellular evidence that feeding can indeed be dissected into two distinct steps, namely the determination of preference and initiation of ingestion. We find that bitter tastants have individual characteristics when negatively affecting feeding, with most chemicals negatively affecting both preference and ingestion, and certain chemicals negatively affecting only preference. These characteristics are due to different sensory neurons being responsible for detecting different bitter compounds. The different sensory neurons appear to act in relatively independent neural circuits to differentially affect the multiple steps that comprise feeding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Differential effects of nasal inflammation and odor deprivation on layer-specific degeneration of the mouse olfactory bulb</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Harmful environmental agents cause nasal inflammation, and chronic nasal inflammation induces a loss of olfactory sensory neurons and reversible atrophy of the olfactory bulb (OB). Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying this inflammation-induced OB atrophy by histologically and biochemically comparing the OB changes in mouse models of nasal inflammation and odor deprivation. In addition, we examined whether odor stimulation is necessary for OB recovery from atrophy. One group of adult male C57BL/6 mice was administered lipopolysaccharide unilaterally for 10 weeks to induce nasal inflammation (control animals received saline), and a second group received unilateral naris closures for 10 weeks of odor deprivation. The OBs atrophied in both models, but odor deprivation shrank the glomerular, external plexiform, mitral, and granule cell layers, whereas the olfactory nerve, glomerular, and external plexiform layers atrophied as a result of nasal inflammation. Additionally, nasal inflammation, but not odor deprivation, caused neuroinflammation in the OB, inducing glial activation and elevated expression of IL–1β and TNFα. After 10 weeks of nasal inflammation, mice were housed for another 10 weeks with no additional treatment or with unilateral naris closure. Nasal inflammation and glial activation subsided in both groups, but glomerular and external plexiform layers recovered only in those with no additional treatment. Our findings demonstrate that nasal inflammation and odor deprivation differentially induce layer-specific degeneration in the OB, that loss of olfactory sensory neuron activity rather than neuroinflammation is a major cause of inflammation-induced OB atrophy, and that odor stimulation is required for OB recovery from atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance&lt;/b&gt; Chronic nasal inflammation causes a loss of olfactory sensory neurons and atrophy of the olfactory bulb, which recovers when inflammation subsides. To reveal the mechanisms underlying inflammation-induced olfactory bulb atrophy, we compared the histological and biochemical changes in olfactory bulbs in mouse models of nasal inflammation and odor deprivation. In addition, we examined whether odor stimulation was required for the recovery of the olfactory bulb from atrophy. Our findings revealed that nasal inflammation and odor deprivation differentially induce layer-specific degeneration in the olfactory bulb, that loss of olfactory sensory neuron activity rather than neuroinflammation is a major cause of inflammation-induced olfactory bulb atrophy, and that odor stimulation is required for the olfactory bulb to recover from atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Polygenic Multiple Sclerosis Risk and Population‐Based Childhood Brain Imaging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25717?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25717?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease with a substantial genetic component and immune‐mediated neurodegeneration. Patients with MS show structural brain differences relative to individuals without MS, including smaller regional volumes and alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure. Whether genetic risk for MS is associated with brain structure during early neurodevelopment remains unclear. In this study, we explore the association between MS polygenic risk scores (PRS) and brain imaging outcomes from a large, population‐based pediatric sample to gain insight into the underlying neurobiology of MS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 8‐ to 12‐year‐old genotyped participants from the Generation R Study in whom T1‐weighted volumetric (n = 1,136) and/or diffusion tensor imaging (n = 1,088) had been collected. PRS for MS were calculated based on a large genome‐wide association study of MS (n = 41,505) and were regressed on regional volumes, global and tract‐specific fractional anisotropy (FA), and global mean diffusivity using linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No associations were observed for the regional volumes. We observed a positive association between the MS PRS and global FA (β = 0.098, standard error [SE] = 0.030, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 1.08 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;). Tract‐specific analyses showed higher FA and lower radial diffusivity in several tracts. We replicated our findings in an independent sample of children (n = 186) who were scanned in an earlier phase (global FA; β = 0.189, SE = 0.072, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 9.40 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to show that greater genetic predisposition for MS is associated with higher global brain WM FA at an early age in the general population. Our results suggest a preadolescent time window within neurodevelopment in which MS risk variants act upon the brain. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mean oxygen saturation during sleep is related to specific brain atrophy pattern</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25728?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much controversy about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effects of sleep‐disordered breathing on the brain. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between markers of sleep‐related hypoxemia and brain anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used data from a large‐scale cohort from the general population (n = 775, 50.6% males, age range = 45–86 years, mean age = 60.3 ± 9.9) that underwent full polysomnography and brain MRI to correlate respiratory variables with regional brain volume estimates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, gender, and cardiovascular risk factors, only mean oxygen saturation during sleep was associated with bilateral volume of hippocampus (right: p = 0.001; left: p &amp;lt; 0.001), thalamus (right: p &amp;lt; 0.001; left: p &amp;lt; 0.001), putamen (right: p = 0.001; left: p = 0.001) and angular gyrus (right: p = 0.011; left: p = 0.001). We observed the same relationship in left hemispheric amygdala (p = 0.010), caudate (p = 0.008), inferior frontal gyrus (p = 0.004) and supramarginal gyrus (p = 0.003). The other respiratory variables ‐ lowest oxygen saturation, % of sleep time with oxygen saturation &amp;lt; 90%, apnea‐hypopnea index and oxygen desaturation index ‐ did not show any significant association with brain volumes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower mean oxygen saturation during sleep was associated with atrophy of cortical and subcortical brain areas known for high sensitivity to oxygen supply. Their vulnerability to hypoxemia may contribute to behavioral phenotype and cognitive decline in patients with sleep‐disordered breathing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors are composed of five subunits arranged around a central chloride channel. The different subunits originate from different genes or gene families. In the mammalian brain they generally consist of two α‐, two β‐ and one γ‐ or δ‐subunit. This subunit organization crucially determines the physiological and pharmacological properties of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. Here we investigated the distribution of 10 different GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunits in the forebrain of rhesus monkeys. We observed highly heterogeneous distribution patterns of the individual subunits indicating a high number of heterogeneously assembled GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. Their distribution was, however, less distinct in the monkey than in rodents.


&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors are composed of five subunits arranged around a central chloride channel. Their subunits originate from different genes or gene families. The majority of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the mammalian brain consist of two α‐, two β‐ and one γ‐ or δ‐subunit. This subunit organization crucially determines the physiological and pharmacological properties of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using immunhistochemistry we investigated the distribution of 10 GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunits (α1, α2, α3, α4, α5, β1, β2, β3, γ2 and δ) in the fore brain of three female rhesus monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;). Within the cerebral cortex, subunits α1, α5, β2, β3, and γ2 were found in all layers, α2, α3, and β1 were more concentrated in the inner and outer layers. The caudate/putamen was rich in α1, α2, α5, all three β‐subunits, γ2, and δ. Subunits α3 and α5 were more concentrated in the caudate than in the putamen. In contrast, α1, α2, β1, β2, γ2, and δ were highest in the pallidum. Most dorsal thalamic nuclei contained subunits α1, α2, α4, β2, β3, and γ2, whereas α1, α3, β1, and γ2 were most abundant in the reticular nucleus. Within the amygdala, subunits α1, α2, α5, β1, β3, γ2, and δ were concentrated in the cortical nucleus, whereas in the lateral and basolateral amygdala α1, α2, α5, β1, β3, and δ, and in the central amygdala α1, α2, β3, and γ2 were most abundant. Interestingly, subunit α3‐IR outlined the intercalated nuclei of the amygdala. In the hippocampus, subunits α1, α2, α5, β2, β3, γ2, and δ were highly expressed in the dentate molecular layer, whereas α1, α2, α3, α5, β1, β2, β3, and γ2 were concentrated in sector CA1 and the subiculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distribution of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunits in the rhesus monkey was highly heterogeneous indicating a high number of differently assembled receptors. In most areas investigated, notably in the striatum/pallidum, amygdaloid nuclei and in the hippocampus it was more diverse than in the rat and mouse indicating a more heterogeneous and less defined receptor assembly in the monkey than in rodent brain.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: A Practical Guide to Using CV Analysis for Determining the Locus of Synaptic Plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00011</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00011</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Long-term synaptic plasticity is widely believed to underlie learning and memory in the brain. Whether plasticity is primarily expressed pre- or postsynaptically has been the subject of considerable debate for many decades. More recently, it is generally agreed that the locus of plasticity depends on a number of factors, such as developmental stage, induction protocol, and synapse type. Since presynaptic expression alters not just the gain but also the short-term dynamics of a synapse, whereas postsynaptic expression only modifies the gain, the locus has fundamental implications for circuits dynamics and computations in the brain. It therefore remains crucial for our understanding of neuronal circuits to know the locus of expression of long-term plasticity. One classical method for elucidating whether plasticity is pre- or postsynaptically expressed is based on analysis of the coefficient of variation (CV), which serves as a measure of noise levels of synaptic neurotransmission. Here, we provide a practical guide to using CV analysis for the purposes of exploring the locus of expression of long-term plasticity, primarily aimed at beginners in the field. We provide relatively simple intuitive background to an otherwise theoretically complex approach as well as simple mathematical derivations for key parametric relationships. We list important pitfalls of the method, accompanied by accessible computer simulations to better illustrate the problems (downloadable from GitHub), and we provide straightforward solutions for these issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Phosphorylation-Dependent Regulation of Ca2+-Permeable AMPA Receptors During Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00008</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Experience-dependent learning and memory require multiple forms of plasticity at hippocampal and cortical synapses that are regulated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (NMDAR, AMPAR). These plasticity mechanisms include long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), which are Hebbian input-specific mechanisms that rapidly increase or decrease AMPAR synaptic strength at specific inputs, and homeostatic plasticity that globally scales-up or -down AMPAR synaptic strength across many or even all inputs. Frequently, these changes in synaptic strength are also accompanied by a change in the subunit composition of AMPARs at the synapse due to the trafficking to and from the synapse of receptors lacking GluA2 subunits. These GluA2-lacking receptors are most often GluA1 homomeric receptors that exhibit higher single-channel conductance and are Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable (CP-AMPAR). This review article will focus on the role of protein phosphorylation in regulation of GluA1 CP-AMPAR recruitment and removal from hippocampal synapses during synaptic plasticity with an emphasis on the crucial role of local signaling by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin (CaN) that is coordinated by the postsynaptic scaffold protein A-kinase anchoring protein 79/150 (AKAP79/150).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Requirement of Sox2 for the Spinal Cord Motor Neuron Development of Zebrafish</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sex-determining region Y box 2 (Sox2), expressed in neural tissues, plays an important role as a transcription factor not only in the pluripotency and proliferation of neuronal cells but also in the opposite function of cell differentiation. Nevertheless, how Sox2 is linked to motor neuron development remains unknown. Here, we showed that Sox2 was localized in the motor neurons of spinal cord by in situ hybridization and cell separation, which acted as a positive regulator of motor neuron development. The deficiency of Sox2 in zebrafish larvae resulted in abnormal PMN development, including truncated but excessively branched CaP axons, loss of MiP, and increase of undifferentiated neuron cells. Importantly, transcriptome analysis showed that Sox2-depleted embryos caused many neurogenesis, axonogenesis, axon guidance, and differentiation-related gene expression changes, which further support the vital function of Sox2 in motor neuron development. Taken together, these data indicate that Sox2 plays a crucial role in the motor neuron development by regulating neuron differentiation and morphology of neuron axons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Predicting Long-Term After-Effects of Theta-Burst Stimulation on Supplementary Motor Network Through One-Session Response</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To understand the neural mechanism of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), the after-effects following one session or multiple days of stimulation have been widely investigated. However, the relation between the short-term effect (STE) and long-term effect (LTE) of rTMS is largely unknown. This study aims to explore whether the after-effects of 5-day rTMS on supplementary motor area (SMA) network could be predicted by one-session response. A primary cohort of 38 healthy participants underwent five daily sessions of real or sham continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) on the left SMA. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired at the first (before and after the first stimulation) and sixth experimental day. The SMA connectivity changes after the first cTBS and after 5 days of stimulation were defined as STE and LTE, respectively. Compared to the baseline, significant STE and LTE were found in the bilateral paracentral gyrus (ParaCG) after real stimulation, suggesting shared neural correlates of short- and long-term stimulations. Region-of-interest analysis indicated that the resting-state functional connectivity between SMA and ParaCG increased after real stimulation, while no significant change was found after sham stimulation. Leave-one-out cross-validation indicated that the LTE in ParaCG could be predicted by the STE after real but not sham stimulations. In an independent cohort, the after-effects of rTMS on ParaCG and short- to long-term prediction were reproduced at the region-of-interest level. These imaging evidences indicate that one-session rTMS can aid to predict the regions responsive to long-term stimulation and the individualized response degree.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Deep Temporal Organization of fMRI Phase Synchrony Modes Promotes Large-Scale Disconnection in Schizophrenia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00214</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Itinerant dynamics of the brain generates transient and recurrent spatiotemporal patterns in neuroimaging data. Characterizing metastable functional connectivity (FC) – particularly at rest and using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) – has shaped the field of dynamic functional connectivity (DFC). Mainstream DFC research relies on (sliding window) correlations to identify recurrent FC patterns. Recently, functional relevance of the instantaneous phase synchrony (IPS) of fMRI signals has been revealed using imaging studies and computational models. In the present paper, we identify the repertoire of whole-brain inter-network IPS states at rest. Moreover, we uncover a hierarchy in the temporal organization of IPS modes. We hypothesize that connectivity disorder in schizophrenia (SZ) is related to the (deep) temporal arrangement of large-scale IPS modes. Hence, we analyze resting-state fMRI data from 68 healthy controls (HC) and 51 SZ patients. Seven resting-state networks (and their sub-components) are identified using spatial independent component analysis. IPS is computed between subject-specific network time courses, using analytic signals. The resultant phase coupling patterns, across time and subjects, are clustered into eight IPS states. Statistical tests show that the relative expression and mean lifetime of certain IPS states have been altered in SZ. Namely, patients spend (45%) less time in a globally coherent state and a subcortical-centered state, and (40%) more time in states reflecting anticoupling within the cognitive control network, compared to the HC. Moreover, the transition profile (between states) reveals a deep temporal structure, shaping two metastates with distinct phase synchrony profiles. A metastate is a collection of states such that within-metastate transitions are more probable than across. Remarkably, metastate occupation balance is altered in SZ, in favor of the less synchronous metastate that promotes disconnection across networks. Furthermore, the trajectory of IPS patterns is less efficient, less smooth, and more restricted in SZ subjects, compared to the HC. Finally, a regression analysis confirms the diagnostic value of the defined IPS measures for SZ identification, highlighting the distinctive role of metastate proportion. Our results suggest that the proposed IPS features may be used for classification studies and for characterizing phase synchrony modes in other (clinical) populations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Quantitative Identification of Major Depression Based on Resting-State Dynamic Functional Connectivity: A Machine Learning Approach</title>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Developing a machine learning-based approach which could provide quantitative identification of major depressive disorder (MDD) is essential for the diagnosis and intervention of this disorder. However, the performances of traditional algorithms using static functional connectivity (SFC) measures were unsatisfactory. In the present work, we exploit the hidden information embedded in dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) and developed an accurate and objective image-based diagnosis system for MDD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;MRI images were collected from 99 participants including 56 healthy controls and 43 MDD patients. DFC was calculated using a sliding-window algorithm. A non-linear support vector machine (SVM) approach was then used with the DFC matrices as features to distinguish MDD patients from healthy controls. The spatiotemporal characteristics of the most discriminative features were then investigated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The area under the curve (AUC) of the SVM classifier with DFC measures reached 0.9913, while this value is only 0.8685 for the algorithm using SFC measures. Spatially, the most discriminative 28 connections distributed in the visual network (VN), somatomotor network (SMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), ventral attention network (VAN), limbic network (LN), frontoparietal network (FPN), and default mode network (DMN), etc. Notably, a large portion of these connections were associated with the FPN, DMN, and VN. Temporally, the most discriminative connections transited from the cortex to deeper regions.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The results clearly suggested that DFC is superior to SFC and provide a reliable quantitative identification method for MDD. Our findings may furnish a better understanding of the neural mechanisms of MDD as well as improve accurate diagnosis and early intervention of this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Associations Between Individual Differences in Mathematical Competencies and Surface Anatomy of the Adult Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00116</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previously conducted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on the neuroanatomical correlates of mathematical abilities and competencies have several methodological limitations. Besides small sample sizes, the majority of these studies have employed voxel-based morphometry (VBM)—a method that, although it is easy to implement, has some major drawbacks. Taking this into account, the current study is the first to investigate in a large sample of typically developed adults the associations between mathematical abilities and variations in brain surface structure by using surface-based morphometry (SBM). SBM is a method that also allows the investigation of brain morphometry by avoiding the pitfalls of VBM. Eighty-nine young adults were tested with a large battery of psychometric tests to measure mathematical competencies in four different areas: (1) simple arithmetic; (2) complex arithmetic; (3) higher-order mathematics; and (4) numerical intelligence. Also, we asked participants for their mathematics grades for their final school exams. Inside the MRI scanner, we collected high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images from each subject. SBM analyses were performed with the computational anatomy toolbox (CAT12) and indices for cortical thickness, for cortical surface complexity, for gyrification, and sulcal depth were calculated. Further analyses revealed associations between: (1) the cortical surface complexity of the right superior temporal gyrus and numerical intelligence; (2) the depth of the right central sulcus and adults’ ability to solve complex arithmetic problems; and (3) the depth of the left parieto-occipital sulcus and adults’ higher-order mathematics competence. Interestingly, no relationships with previously reported brain regions were observed, thus, suggesting the importance of similar research to confirm the role of the brain regions found in this study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Event-Related Potentials to Changes in Sound Intensity Demonstrate Alterations in Brain Function Related to Depression and Aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00098</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Measures of the brain’s automatic electrophysiological responses to sounds represent a potential tool for identifying age- and depression-related neural markers. However, these markers have rarely been studied related to aging and depression within one study. Here, we investigated auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) in the brain that may show different alterations related to aging and depression. We used an oddball condition employing changes in sound intensity to investigate: (i) sound intensity dependence; (ii) sensory gating; and (iii) change detection, all within a single paradigm. The ERPs of younger (18–40 years) and older (62–80 years) depressed female participants and age-matched non-depressed participants were measured. Intensity dependence was examined as the difference between N1 responses to repeated high- and low-intensity sounds, sensory gating as N1 responses to rare and repeated sounds, and change detection as indexed by the mismatch negativity (MMN). We found that intensity dependence was greater in older participants than younger ones, indicating effects related to aging but not to depression. For sensory gating, we found depression- and age-related alterations as increased N1 responses. No group differences were found for MMN. Although a sensory gating deficit was expected in older adults, this study is the first to demonstrate age-related overexcitability in sound intensity dependency. The results indicate that automatic brain responses to sound intensity changes are suitable for studying age- and depression-related neural markers but may not be sensitive enough to differentiate the effects of aging and depression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Man’s Pursuit of Meaning: Unexpected Termination Bolsters One’s Autonomous Motivation in an Irrelevant Ensuing Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00081</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00081</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Meaningfulness has been suggested as one of the fundamental psychological needs, as one would actively pursue meaning in both his/her work life and personal life. Previous studies consistently showed that a lack of meaning in work would reduce one’s autonomous motivation in the current job, which is the motivation to engage in self-determined activities driven by one’s own interests or personal beliefs. However, researchers overlooked the fact that in work settings, it is not uncommon that people work on multiple tasks in a row. As a result, the cross-task effect of work meaningfulness remains understudied. Based on the meaning maintenance model (MMM) and the suggested fluid compensation strategy, we predicted that the disappearance of the meaning of work may induce a compensatory response and thus enhance one’s autonomous motivation in an irrelevant ensuing activity. To test this hypothesis, we invited participants to work on an encyclopedic knowledge quiz in Session 1 and a StopWatch (SW) task in Session 2. A between-subject design was adopted. While participants in the control group successfully completed their tasks in Session 1, those in the experimental group encountered unexpected program quits by the end of the quiz, and their previous efforts suddenly became futile and meaningless. Electroencephalography was recorded during the experiment to measure reward positivity (RewP). In Session 2, a more pronounced RewP in the win–lose difference wave was observed in the experimental group in contrast to the control group, suggesting that the disappearance of the meaning of work enhanced one’s autonomous motivation in an irrelevant activity that follows. Therefore, results of this study provided preliminary electrophysiological evidence for one’s pursuit of meaning and the compensation effect induced by the disappearance of the meaning of work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Seventh Annual Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) Think Tank held on September 8th of 2019 addressed the most current: (1) use and utility of complex neurophysiological signals for development of adaptive neurostimulation to improve clinical outcomes; (2) Advancements in recent neuromodulation techniques to treat neuropsychiatric disorders; (3) New developments in optogenetics and DBS; (4) The use of augmented Virtual reality (VR) and neuromodulation; (5) commercially available technologies; and (6) ethical issues arising in and from research and use of DBS. These advances serve as both “markers of progress” and challenges and opportunities for ongoing address, engagement, and deliberation as we move to improve the functional capabilities and translational value of DBS. It is in this light that these proceedings are presented to inform the field and initiate ongoing discourse. As consistent with the intent, and spirit of this, and prior DBS Think Tanks, the overarching goal is to continue to develop multidisciplinary collaborations to rapidly advance the field and ultimately improve patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Resveratrol Preincubation Enhances the Therapeutic Efficacy of hUC-MSCs by Improving Cell Migration and Modulating Neuroinflammation Mediated by MAPK Signaling in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) are promising for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, their low rate of migration and survival in the brain limit their clinical applicability. This study is designed to improve the therapeutic potential of hUC-MSCs by preincubating them with resveratrol, a natural polyphenol capable of regulating cell destiny. Herein, we demonstrate that resveratrol preincubation enhances the migration of hUC-MSCs in vitro, as well as their survival and homing into the hippocampus of AD mice in vivo. Moreover, resveratrol-primed MSCs were better able to inhibit amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) deposition, Tau hyperphosphorylation, and oxidative stress, all while improving learning and memory. Notably, we found that hUC-MSCs inhibited neuroinflammation by reacting with astrocytes and microglial cells and suppressing mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), extracellular signal kinases (ERK), p38 kinases (p38), and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) signaling pathways in the hippocampus of AD mice. Furthermore, resveratrol pretreatment enhanced these effects. Conclusively, the current study revealed that resveratrol preconditioning protected hUC-MSCs against the hostile microenvironment characteristic of AD and enhanced their viability and homing into the brain of AD mice. The use of resveratrol-pretreated hUC-MSCs is thereby proposed to be a promising therapy for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) etiology is attributed to aging and the progressive neurodegeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). GPR37 is an orphan G-protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) that is linked to the juvenile form of PD. In addition, misfolded GPR37 has been found in Lewy bodies. However, properly folded GPR37 found at the cell membrane appears to exert neuroprotection. In the present study we investigated the role of GPR37 in motor deficits due to aging or toxin-induced experimental parkinsonism. Elderly GPR37 knock out (KO) mice displayed hypolocomotion and worse fine movement performance compared to their WT counterparts. Striatal slice electrophysiology reveiled that GPR37 KO mice show profound decrease in long term potentiation (LTP) formation which is accompanied by an alteration in glutamate receptor subunit content. GPR37 KO animals exposed to intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) show poorer score in the behavioral cylinder test and more loss of the DA transporter (DAT) in striatum. The GPR37 KO striata exhibit a significant increase in GABA which is aggravated after DA depletion. Our data indicate that GPR37 KO mice have DA neuron deficit, enhanced striatal GABA levels and deficient corticostriatal LTP. They also respond stronger to 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity. Taken together, the data indicate that properly functional GPR37 may counteract aging processes and parkinsonism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>After its initial development, the nervous system matures to connect and shape the neuronal circuitry and to keep it functional in humans for decades. Here we conceptualize neuronal maturation as a research field that will have, we would argue, a strong impact on understanding the healthy and diseased nervous system. Identifying the key mechanisms underlying neuronal maturation has the potential to reverse this process in adulthood, thereby facilitating regeneration.</description>

	<description>DNA sequence variants in the TBK1 gene associate with familial and sporadic ALS. Gerbino et al. show that partial or complete loss-of-function TBK1 mutations alone do not induce neurodegeneration in mice. However, they profoundly affect disease onset and progression in the SOD1 ALS mouse model.</description>

Life scientists are increasingly turning to high-throughput sequencing technologies in their research programs, owing to the enormous potential of these methods. In a parallel manner, the number of core facilities that provide bioinformatics support are also increasing. Notably, the generation of complex large datasets has necessitated the development of bioinformatics support core facilities that aid laboratory scientists with cost-effective and efficient data management, analysis, and interpretation. In this article, we address the challenges—related to communication, good laboratory practice, and data handling—that may be encountered in core support facilities when providing bioinformatics support, drawing on our own experiences working as support bioinformaticians on multidisciplinary research projects. Most importantly, the article proposes a list of guidelines that outline how these challenges can be preemptively avoided and effectively managed to increase the value of outputs to the end user, covering the entire research project lifecycle, including experimental design, data analysis, and management (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;., sharing and storage). In addition, we highlight the importance of clear and transparent communication, comprehensive preparation, appropriate handling of samples and data using monitoring systems, and the employment of appropriate tools and standard operating procedures to provide effective bioinformatics support.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N4DYN0D3GGs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Ulrich Dirnagl&lt;/p&gt;

Preregistration of study protocols and, in particular, Registered Reports are novel publishing formats that are currently gaining substantial traction. Besides rating the research question and soundness of methodology over outstanding significance of the results, they can help with antagonizing inadequate statistical power, selective reporting of results, undisclosed analytic flexibility, as well as publication bias. Preregistration works well when a clear hypothesis, primary outcome, and mode of analysis can be formulated. But is it also applicable and useful in discovery research, which develops theories and hypotheses, measurement techniques, and generates evidence that justifies further research? I will argue that only slight modifications are needed to harness the potential of preregistration and make exploratory research more trustworthy and useful.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vW2It49UnbY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: ATPase domain AFG3L2 mutations alter OPA1 processing and cause Optic Neuropathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25723?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25723?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is the most common inherited optic neuropathy with a prevalence of 1:12,000 to 1:25,000. &lt;i&gt;OPA1&lt;/i&gt; mutations are found in 70% of DOA patients, with a significant number remaining undiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We screened 286 index cases presenting optic atrophy, negative for &lt;i&gt;OPA1&lt;/i&gt; mutations, by targeted NGS or whole‐exome sequencing. Pathogenicity and molecular mechanisms of the identified variants were studied in yeast and patient‐derived fibroblasts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve cases (4%) were found to carry novel variants in &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2,&lt;/i&gt; a gene that has been associated with autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia 28 (SCA28). Half of cases were familial with a dominant inheritance while the others were sporadic, including &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; mutations. Biallelic mutations were found in three probands with severe syndromic optic neuropathy, acting as recessive or phenotype‐modifier variants. All the DOA‐associated &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2&lt;/i&gt; mutations were clustered in the ATPase domain, whereas SCA28‐associated mutations mostly affect the proteolytic domain. The pathogenic role of DOA‐associated &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2&lt;/i&gt; mutations was confirmed in yeast, unraveling a mechanism distinct from that of SCA28‐associated &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2&lt;/i&gt; mutations. Patients' fibroblasts showed an abnormal OPA1 processing, with accumulation of the fission‐inducing short forms leading to mitochondrial network fragmentation, not observed in SCA28 patients' cells.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates that mutations in &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2&lt;/i&gt; are a relevant cause of optic neuropathy, broadening the spectrum of clinical manifestations and genetic mechanisms associated with &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2&lt;/i&gt; mutations, and underscore the pivotal role of OPA1 and its processing in the pathogenesis of DOA.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eNeuro: Single-Pulse TMS over the Parietal Cortex Does Not Impair Sensorimotor Perturbation-Induced Changes in Motor Commands</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Intermittent exposure to a sensorimotor perturbation, such as a visuomotor rotation, is known to cause a directional bias on the subsequent movement that opposes the previously experienced perturbation. To date, it is unclear whether the parietal cortex is causally involved in this postperturbation movement bias. In a recent electroencephalogram study, Savoie et al. (2018) observed increased parietal activity in response to an intermittent visuomotor perturbation, raising the possibility that the parietal cortex could subserve this change in motor behavior. The goal of the present study was to causally test this hypothesis. Human participants (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 28) reached toward one of two visual targets located on either side of a fixation point, while being pseudorandomly submitted to a visuomotor rotation. On half of all rotation trials, single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied over the right (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 14) or left (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 14) parietal cortex 150 ms after visual feedback provision. To determine whether TMS influenced the postperturbation bias, reach direction was compared on trials that followed rotation with (RS + 1) and without (R + 1) TMS. It was hypothesized that interfering with parietal activity would reduce the movement bias following rotated trials. Results revealed a significant and robust postrotation directional bias compared with both rotation and null rotation trials. Contrary to our hypothesis, however, neither left nor right parietal stimulation significantly impacted the postrotation bias. These data suggest that the parietal areas targeted here may not be critical for perturbation-induced motor output changes to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Muscarinic-Dependent miR-182 and QR2 Expression Regulation in the Anterior Insula Enables Novel Taste Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0067-20.2020v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0067-20.2020v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In a similar manner to other learning paradigms, intact muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) neurotransmission or protein synthesis regulation in the anterior insular cortex (aIC) is necessary for appetitive taste learning. Here we describe a parallel, local molecular pathway, where -aminobutyric acid type a receptor (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R) control of mAChR activation causes upregulation of microRNA-182 (miR-182) and quinone reductase 2 (QR2) mRNA destabilization in the rodent aIC. Damage to long-term memory by prevention of this process, with the use of mAChR antagonist scopolamine prior to novel taste learning, can be rescued by local QR2 inhibition, demonstrating that QR2 acts downstream of local muscarinic activation. Furthermore, we prove for the first time the presence of endogenous QR2 co-factors in the brain, establishing QR2 as a functional reductase there. In turn, we show that QR2 activity causes the generation of reactive oxygen species, leading to modulation in Kv2.1 redox state. QR2 expression reduction therefore is a previously unaccounted mode of mAChR mediated inflammation reduction, and thus adds QR2 to the cadre of redox modulators in the brain. The concomitant reduction in QR2 activity during memory consolidation suggests a complementary mechanism to the well-established molecular processes of this phase, by which the cortex gleans important information from general sensory stimuli. This places QR2 as a promising new target to tackle neurodegenerative inflammation and the associated impediment of novel memory formation in diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Most studies on molecular mechanisms underlying memory consolidation have thus far focused on the transformation of electrical and synaptic activity to post-translation modifications, mRNA translation, and gene transcription regulation. Here, we explore a less studied mechanism, of the removal of an innate constraint to allow the formation of long-term memory. Our findings point to a pathway of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor control of mAChR activation, which causes upregulation of miR-182, which can in turn lead to destabilization of QR2 mRNA in the rodent anterior insular cortex. The results propose a novel molecular cascade, complementary to the mRNA translation/transcription regulation underlying memory consolidation, by which the cortex gleans important information from general sensory stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Structural plasticity of GABAergic and glutamatergic networks in the motor thalamus of parkinsonian monkeys&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/864d33a7-8236-4a83-9fb2-69781e04b33f/cne24834-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced prevalence and increased size of glutamatergic cortical terminals in contact with thalamocortical neurons in the basal ganglia‐receiving region of the ventral motor thalamus in MPTP‐treated parkinsonian monkeys. The electron micrographs show vGluT1‐immunoreactive corticothalamic terminals in normal and parkinsonian monkeys.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the primate thalamus, the parvocellular ventral anterior nucleus (VApc) and the centromedian nucleus (CM) receive GABAergic projections from the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and glutamatergic inputs from motor cortices. In this study, we used electron microscopy to assess potential structural changes in GABAergic and glutamatergic microcircuits in the VApc and CM of MPTP‐treated parkinsonian monkeys. The intensity of immunostaining for GABAergic markers in VApc and CM did not differ between control and parkinsonian monkeys. In the electron microscope, three major types of terminals were identified in both nuclei: (a) vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1)‐positive terminals forming asymmetric synapses (type As), which originate from the cerebral cortex, (b) GABAergic terminals forming single symmetric synapses (type S1), which likely arise from the reticular nucleus and GABAergic interneurons, and (c) GABAergic terminals forming multiple symmetric synapses (type S2), which originate from GPi. The density of As terminals outnumbered that of S1 and S2 terminals in VApc and CM of control and parkinsonian animals. No significant change was found in the abundance and synaptic connectivity of S1 and S2 terminals in VApc or CM of MPTP‐treated monkeys, while the prevalence of “As” terminals in VApc of parkinsonian monkeys was 51.4% lower than in controls. The cross‐sectional area of vGluT1‐positive boutons in both VApc and CM of parkinsonian monkeys was significantly larger than in controls, but their pattern of innervation of thalamic cells was not altered. Our findings suggest that the corticothalamic system undergoes significant synaptic remodeling in the parkinsonian state.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Dark exposure affects plasticity‐related molecules and interneurons throughout the visual system during adulthood</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24832?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24832?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Dark exposure affects plasticity‐related molecules and interneurons throughout the visual system during adulthood&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6d66ea81-d41a-465e-a45b-df650ba67461/cne24832-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten days of dark exposure during adulthood have an important impact on the microcircuitry of the primary visual cortex, especially on its interneurons. This paradigm induced changes in the expression of synaptic molecules and in the structure of Martinotti interneurons. It also altered the expression of the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule and induced changes in the perineuronal nets surrounding parvalbumin expressing interneurons, suggesting that these plasticity‐related molecules may be involved in the changes produced by dark exposure. Some of these changes are also observed throughout the visual pathway.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several experimental manipulations, including visual deprivation, are able to induce critical period‐like plasticity in the visual cortex of adult animals. In this regard, many studies have analyzed the effects of dark exposure in adult animals, but still little is known about the role of interneurons and plasticity‐related molecules on such mechanisms. In this study, we analyzed the effects of 10 days of dark exposure on the connectivity and structure of interneurons, both in the primary visual cortex and in the rest of cerebral regions implicated in the transmission of visual stimulus. We found that this environmental manipulation induces changes in the expression of synaptic molecules throughout the visual pathway and in the structure of interneurons in the primary visual cortex. Moreover, we found altered expression in the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule and in perineuronal nets surrounding parvalbumin expressing interneurons, suggesting that these plasticity‐related molecules may be involved in the changes produced by dark exposure. Together, our findings indicate that dark exposure produces an important alteration of inhibitory circuits and molecules related to their plasticity, not only in the visual cortex but throughout the visual pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Hippocampal oscillatory dynamics and sleep atonia are altered in an animal model of fibromyalgia: Implications in the search for biomarkers&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2aff88c9-0425-44ce-8abe-c5f6bf412beb/cne24829-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monoamine depletion by reserpine has evidenced to induce pain and depression in rats, two comorbid symptoms in fibromyalgia patients. In this study, we have tested if also sleep disorders appear following monoamine depletion, mimicking also this key symptom of the disease. We found a disruption of the normal sleep patterns, together with increased motor activity during sleep, as well as a loss of the hierarchical oscillatory coupling. These alterations can explain muscular pain and cognitive disturbances also present in fibromyalgia patients. Our results support that reserpine injection could provide a useful model also to mimic sleep alterations as well as to search for new oscillatory biomarkers in fibromyalgia.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pathogenesis of fibromyalgia is still unknown. Core symptoms include pain, depression, and sleep disturbances with high comorbidity, suggesting alterations in the monoaminergic system as a common origin of this disease. The reserpine‐induced myalgia (RIM) model lowers pain thresholds and produces depressive‐like symptoms. The present work aims to evaluate temporal dynamics in the oscillatory profiles and motor activity during sleep in this model and to evaluate if the model mimics the sleep disorders that occur in fibromyalgia patients. Hippocampal and electromyogram activity were recorded in chronically implanted rats. Following 3 days of basal recordings, reserpine was administered on three consecutive days to achieve the RIM. Postreserpine recordings were taken on alternate days for 21 days. Reserpine induced changes in the sleep architecture with more transitions between states, and a different pattern between the administration period and postreserpine weeks. Administration days were characterized by a larger amount of rapid eyes movement sleep with dominant theta waves without atonia. Following the reserpinization, theta oscillations were always more fragmented and with lower frequency. On the postreserpine days, sleep was dominated by slow‐wave sleep with fast intrusions and reduced hierarchical coupling with spindles and ripples. Simultaneous electromyography recordings also showed muscle twitches during sleep and the dissociation of theta activity and muscle atonia. Abnormally high slow waves, alpha/delta intrusions, frequent transitions, and muscle twitches are common traits in fibromyalgia. Therefore, our analyses support the validity of the RIM model to study sleep disorders in fibromyalgia, and provide new insights into the research of oscillographic biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Blockade of astrocytic activation delays the occurrence of severe hypoxia‐induced seizure and respiratory arrest in mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/831373ab-ead8-4bff-9990-df044a29e80e/cne24828-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative recordings in hypoxia loading experiments in two groups of mice, one pretreated with vehicle alone and the other with arundic acid, an inhibitor of astrocytic activation. From top to bottom: oxygen concentration in a chamber (Fo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), respiratory flow (whole body plethysmogram, inspiration upward), EEG spectrogram in the mouse with vehicle alone, respiratory flow, and EEG spectrogram in the mouse with arundic acid. The percentage of mice with respiratory arrest was significantly smaller in the arundic acid group as compared to the vehicle group. Time from the start of hypoxia to the occurrence of seizures was significantly longer in the mice with arundic acid than that in the vehicle group. Arundic acid delayed the occurrence of severe hypoxia‐induced seizures and prevented subsequent respiratory arrest.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seizures are induced when subjects are exposed to severe hypoxia. It is followed by ventilatory fall‐off and eventual respiratory arrest, which may underlie the pathophysiology of death in patients with epilepsy and severe respiratory disorders. However, the mechanisms of hypoxia‐induced seizures have not been fully understood. Because astrocytes are involved in various neurological disorders, we aimed to investigate whether astrocytes are operational in seizure generation and respiratory arrest in a severe hypoxic condition. We examined the effects of astrocytic activation blockade on responses of EEG and ventilation to severe hypoxia. Adult mice were divided into two groups; in one group (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 24) only vehicle was injected, and in the other group (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 24) arundic acid, an inhibitory modulator of astrocytic activation, was administered before initiation of recording. After recording EEG and ventilation by whole body plethysmography in room air, the gas in the recording chamber was switched to 5% oxygen (nitrogen balanced) until a seizure and ventilatory depression occurred, followed by prompt switch back to room air. Severe hypoxia initially increased ventilation, followed by a seizure and ventilatory suppression in all mice examined. Fourteen mice without arundic acid showed respiratory arrest during loading of hypoxia. However, 22 mice pretreated with arundic acid did not suffer from respiratory arrest. Time from the onset of hypoxia to the occurrence of seizures was significantly longer in the group with arundic acid than that in the group without arundic acid. We suggest that blockade of astrocytic activation delays the occurrence of seizures and prevents respiratory arrest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Somatosensory corticospinal tract axons sprout within the cervical cord following a dorsal root/dorsal column spinal injury in the rat</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Somatosensory corticospinal tract axons sprout within the cervical cord following a dorsal root/dorsal column spinal injury in the rat&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c92a5764-20fc-4f89-bb59-1266adac414e/cne24826-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corticospinal tract (CST) controls voluntary hand function in primates, and to a lesser degree, paw movements in rats. Recent monkey studies showed that following a combined cervical dorsal root/dorsal column lesion, both motor and somatosensory CSTs sprout well beyond normal range. The S1 CST sprouting response is particularly dramatic, indicating an important, if poorly understood, somatosensory role in the recovery process. Here, we used behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroanatomical approaches, to show that CST terminal sprouting also occurs in the rodent and that it is a robust and highly conserved response to a spinal injury that likely mediates but does not directly track with recovery extent.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corticospinal tract (CST) is the major descending pathway controlling voluntary hand function in primates, and though less dominant, it mediates voluntary paw movements in rats. As with primates, the CST in rats originates from multiple (albeit fewer) cortical sites, and functionally different motor and somatosensory subcomponents terminate in different regions of the spinal gray matter. We recently reported in monkeys that following a combined cervical dorsal root/dorsal column lesion (DRL/DCL), both motor and S1 CSTs sprout well beyond their normal terminal range. The S1 CST sprouting response is particularly dramatic, indicating an important, if poorly understood, somatosensory role in the recovery process. As rats are used extensively to model spinal cord injury, we asked if the S1 CST response is conserved in rodents. Rats were divided into sham controls, and two groups surviving post‐lesion for ~6 and 10 weeks. A DRL/DCL was made to partially deafferent one paw. Behavioral testing showed a post‐lesion deficit and recovery over several weeks. Three weeks prior to ending the experiment, S1 cortex was mapped electrophysiologically, for tracer injection placement to determine S1 CST termination patterns within the cord. Synaptogenesis was also assessed for labeled S1 CST terminals within the dorsal horn. Our findings show that the affected S1 CST sprouts well beyond its normal range in response to a DRL/DCL, much as it does in macaque monkeys. This, along with evidence for increased synaptogenesis post‐lesion, indicates that CST terminal sprouting following a central sensory lesion, is a robust and conserved response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Sonic hedgehog expression in zebrafish forebrain identifies the teleostean pallidal signaling center and shows preglomerular complex and posterior tubercular dopamine cells to arise from shh cells</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Sonic hedgehog expression in zebrafish forebrain identifies the teleostean pallidal signaling center and shows preglomerular complex and posterior tubercular dopamine cells to arise from shh cells&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d9e7b098-0dcf-40e4-a665-b1a8a4ab79d1/cne24825-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study of zebrafish &lt;i&gt;shh&lt;/i&gt;‐GFP line reveals the location of the pallidal signaling center which is important for telencephalic dorsoventral patterning. Furthermore, striatal‐projecting posterior tubercular dopamine cells as well as noncatecholaminergic preglomerular cells arise directly from ventral diencephalic &lt;i&gt;shh&lt;/i&gt; expressing cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ventralization, a major patterning process in the developing vertebrate neural tube (central nervous system, CNS), depends on Sonic hedgehog (SHH) as a main signaling morphogen. We studied the CNS of late larval and young adult zebrafish in a transgenic &lt;i&gt;shh&lt;/i&gt;‐GFP line revealing increased neuroanatomical detail due to the progressed differentiation state compared to earlier stages. Some major findings emerge from the present study. (a) &lt;i&gt;shh&lt;/i&gt; –GFP is still expressed along the adult zebrafish CNS neuraxis in most locations seen in larvae. (b) We newly identify a ventroposterior &lt;i&gt;shh&lt;/i&gt; pallidal domain representing the basal telencephalic signaling center important for basal ganglia development known in other vertebrates (i.e., the anterior entopeduncular area—basal medial ganglionic eminence of mammals). (c) We further show late‐emerging &lt;i&gt;shh&lt;/i&gt;‐GFP positive radial glia cells in the medial zone of the dorsal telencephalon (i.e., the teleostan pallial amygdala). (d) Immunostains for tyrosine hydroxylase demonstrate that there is selective colocalization in adult dopamine cells with &lt;i&gt;shh&lt;/i&gt;‐GFP in the posterior tuberculum, including in projection cells to striatum, which represents a striking parallel to amniote mesodiencephalic dopamine cell origin from &lt;i&gt;shh&lt;/i&gt; expressing floor plate cells. (e) There is no colocalization of &lt;i&gt;shh&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;islet1&lt;/i&gt; as shown by respective &lt;i&gt;shh&lt;/i&gt;‐GFP and &lt;i&gt;islet1&lt;/i&gt;‐GFP lines. (f) The only radially far migrated &lt;i&gt;shh&lt;/i&gt;‐GFP cells are located in the preglomerular area. (g) There are no adult cerebellar and tectal &lt;i&gt;shh&lt;/i&gt;‐GFP cells confirming their exclusive role during early development as previously reported by our laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: On the organization of receptive fields of retinal spot detectors projecting to the fish tectum: Analogies with the local edge detectors in frogs and mammals</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;On the organization of receptive fields of retinal spot detectors projecting to the fish tectum: Analogies with the local edge detectors in frogs and mammals&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e9b95f96-21ce-4120-8895-ec74286e7c16/cne24824-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responses of ON‐ and OFF‐ganglion cells (GCs) referred to as spot detectors (SDs) were recorded extracellularly from their axon terminals in the medial sublaminae of tectal retino‐recipient layer of immobilized cyprinid fish. Computer‐generated visual stimuli (contrast edges or spots) were presented on the computer‐controlled CRT monitor to the fish right eye. Stimuli were presented in the limited area of the monitor screen—a square of approximately 11°. Visual responses are recorded from a contralateral lobe of the tectum opticum. Characteristic feature of SDs is prolonged response to small stationary spot, lasting for seconds. We investigated spatial properties of SD receptive fields (RFs). RFs of the recorded units were mapped by the canonical method with a flickering contrast spot (“random checkerboard”). Small spots were flashed on and off sequentially in nodes of square grid in a quasi‐random order and evoked responses were counted. Cell responses over the entire stimulation area are represented in the form of topographic map. Lateral interactions in the RFs were analyzed by another test which consisted of stimulation by concentric spots of different sizes. The number of spikes in the unit response initially increases with an increase of the stimulus width up to some “optimal size.” And then it starts to decrease, which points at the start of lateral inhibitory influences. Estimation of the RF excitatory area by the second method was significantly lower than that evaluated by random checkerboard, what indicates that inhibitory influences are generated already inside the RF center (blue concentric area marks central inhibitory zone). This fact suggests that RFs of SDs cannot be defined as homogeneous sensory zone driven by a linear mechanism of response generation. Physiological properties of fish SDs are compared with the properties of frog SDs and analogous mammalian retinal GCs—local edge detectors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responses of ON‐ and OFF‐ganglion cells (GCs) were recorded extracellularly from their axon terminals in the medial sublamina of tectal retino‐recipient layer of immobilized cyprinid fish (goldfish and carp). These units were recorded deeper than direction selective (DS) ones and at the same depth where responses of orientation selective (OS) GCs were recorded. Prominent responses of these units are evoked by small contrast spots flickering within or moving across their visual field. They are not selective either to the direction of motion or to the orientation of stimuli and are not characterized by any spontaneous spike activity. We refer to these fish GCs as spot detectors (SDs) by analogy with the frog SD. Receptive fields (RFs) of SDs are organized concentrically: the excitatory center (about 4.5°) is surrounded by opponent periphery. Study of interactions in the RF has shown that inhibitory influences are generated already inside the central RF area. This fact suggests that RFs of SDs cannot be defined as homogeneous sensory zone driven by a linear mechanism of response generation. Physiological properties of fish SDs are compared with the properties of frog SDs and analogous mammalian retinal GCs—local edge detectors (LEDs). The potential role of the SDs in visually guided fish behavior is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The current study examined the morphology of neurons in prefrontal, primary motor, and primary visual cortices of three species: African lion (&lt;i&gt;Panthera leo leo&lt;/i&gt;), African leopard (&lt;i&gt;Panthera pardus pardus&lt;/i&gt;), and cheetah (&lt;i&gt;Acinonyx jubatus jubatus&lt;/i&gt;). Quantitatively, somatodendritic measures of typical pyramidal neurons in the cheetah were generally larger than in the African leopard. Both morphological and stereological analyses indicated that primary motor gigantopyramidal neurons were exceptionally large across all three felids compared to other carnivores, possibly due to specializations related to the felid musculoskeletal systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study examines cortical neuronal morphology in the African lion (&lt;i&gt;Panthera leo leo&lt;/i&gt;), African leopard (&lt;i&gt;Panthera pardus pardus&lt;/i&gt;), and cheetah (&lt;i&gt;Acinonyx jubatus jubatus&lt;/i&gt;). Tissue samples were removed from prefrontal, primary motor, and primary visual cortices and investigated with a Golgi stain and computer‐assisted morphometry to provide somatodendritic measures of 652 neurons. Although neurons in the African lion were insufficiently impregnated for accurate quantitative dendritic measurements, descriptions of neuronal morphologies were still possible. Qualitatively, the range of spiny and aspiny neurons across the three species was similar to those observed in other felids, with typical pyramidal neurons being the most prominent neuronal type. Quantitatively, somatodendritic measures of typical pyramidal neurons in the cheetah were generally larger than in the African leopard, despite similar brain sizes. A MARsplines analysis of dendritic measures correctly differentiated 87.4% of complete typical pyramidal neurons between the African leopard and cheetah. In addition, unbiased stereology was used to compare the soma size of typical pyramidal neurons (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 2,238) across all three cortical regions and gigantopyramidal neurons (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 1,189) in primary motor and primary visual cortices. Both morphological and stereological analyses indicated that primary motor gigantopyramidal neurons were exceptionally large across all three felids compared to other carnivores, possibly due to specializations related to the felid musculoskeletal systems. The large size of these neurons in the cheetah which, unlike lions and leopards, does not belong to the &lt;i&gt;Panthera&lt;/i&gt; genus, suggests that exceptionally enlarged primary motor gigantopyramidal neurons evolved independently in these felid species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Cytoarchitecture and myeloarchitecture of the entorhinal cortex of the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d602e894-fd8b-4c57-9ad5-8a2b7646d82e/cne24814-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide a detailed analysis of the cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture and neurochemical considerations about the organization of the entorhinal cortex in the common marmoset (&lt;i&gt;Callithrix jacchus)&lt;/i&gt;. Variations of the basic lamination patterns permit the delineation of six different areas in the Entorhinal cortex.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entorhinal cortex (EC) is associated with impaired cognitive function such as in the case of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. The present study provides a detailed analysis of the cytoarchitectural and myeloarchitectural organization of the EC in the common marmoset &lt;i&gt;Callithrix jacchus&lt;/i&gt;. Data were collected using Nissl and fiber stained preparations, supplemented with acetylcholinesterase and parvalbumin immunohistochemistry. The EC layers and subfields in the marmoset seem to be architectonically similar to those that have been proposed in nonhuman primates and humans to date; however, slight differences could be revealed using the present techniques. Throughout its rostrocaudal length, the entorhinal cortex presents a clear six‐layered pattern. The entorhinal cortex is divided into six fields, named mainly in accordance to their rostrocaudal and mediolateral positions. At rostral levels, the neurons tend to be organized in patches that are surrounded by large, thick, radially oriented bundles of fibers, and the deep layers are poorly developed. At caudal levels, the divisions are more laminated in appearance. AChE staining at the borders of adjacent fields are consistent with the changes in layering revealed in Nissl‐stained sections, of which the lateral regions of the EC display denser AChE staining than that of the medial banks. PV immunoreactivity was found in the labeled somata, dendrites, and axons in all layers and subdivisions. Additionally, we distinguished three subtypes of PV‐immunoreactive neurons: multipolar, bipolar and spherical‐shaped neurons, based on the shape of the somata and the disposition of the dendrites.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The functional anatomy of cognitive control: A domain‐general brain network for uncertainty processing&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b9f5a415-aba6-4513-b376-7d2e8a8716d7/cne24804-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this large‐scale meta‐analysis, we examined the common involvement of the cognitive control network (CCN) in uncertainty processing for three cognitive domains: executive control, working memory, and decision‐making. Results showed a general association between increase in uncertainty and an activation increase in regions of the CCN across these domains, suggesting that the CCN is a domain‐general brain network for the coordination of thoughts and actions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive control is the coordination of mental operations under conditions of uncertainty in accordance with goal‐directed behaviors, and plays a key role in the domains of executive control, working memory, and decision‐making. Although there is emerging evidence of common involvement of the cognitive control network (CCN) of the brain in these domains, this network has mostly been linked to the processing of conflict, which is just one case of an increase in uncertainty. Here, we conducted an activation‐likelihood‐estimation‐based large‐scale meta‐analysis of 289 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in the three domains to examine the common involvement of the CCN in uncertainty processing by contrasting the high‐uncertainty versus low‐uncertainty conditions. We found a general association between increase in uncertainty and an activation increase in regions of the CCN, including the frontoparietal network (comprising the frontal eye fields, the areas near and along the intraparietal sulcus, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), the cingulo‐opercular network (including the anterior cingulate cortex extending to the supplementary motor area, and the anterior insular cortex), and a subcortical structure (the striatum). These results demonstrate that the CCN is a domain‐general construct underlying uncertainty processing to support goal‐directed behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor is essential for enteric neuronal development, maintenance, and regulation of gastrointestinal transit</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24901?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor is essential for enteric neuronal development, maintenance, and regulation of gastrointestinal transit&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/65732015-9b67-4208-b940-b054bc87aa76/cne24901-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) is a member of a novel family of growth factors that is not only secreted but is highly retained in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and protective against ER stress. CDNF is expressed in the brain and bowel and is neuroprotective. We sought to determine the location of CDNF in the gut as well as its functions during development and maintenance of the enteric nervous system (ENS). The ENS is formed by precursor cells that migrate to the primordial bowel from the neural crest (1). These cells colonize the gut and some of the crest‐derived émigrés express (CDNF) within the gut (2). CDNF selectively promotes the development of subsets of enteric neurons that are late born (3). These include, but are not limited to enteric dopaminergic neurons. Most mature dopaminergic neurons coexpress CDNF. Exposure to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP4) causes neurons isolated from the fetal gut to become CDNF‐dependent. When the bowel contains CDNF, submucosal dopaminergic and other late‐born neurons develop normally and are maintained; however, when CDNF is genetically deleted, these same neurons become deficient as a function of age. Although CDNF is expressed in subsets of neurons in both plexuses, the submucosal plexus selectively becomes hypoplastic in animals lacking CDNF, and parameters of gastrointestinal motility become abnormally slow. We conclude that enteric expression of CDNF is restricted to neurons and their precursors and that CDNF is essential for the development and maintenance of dopaminergic and other late‐born submucosal neurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) is expressed in the brain and is neuroprotective. We have previously shown that CDNF is also expressed in the bowel and that its absence leads to degeneration and autophagy in the enteric nervous system (ENS), particularly in the submucosal plexus. We now demonstrate that enteric CDNF immunoreactivity is restricted to neurons (submucosal &amp;gt; myenteric) and is not seen in glia, interstitial cells of Cajal, or smooth muscle. Expression of CDNF, moreover, is essential for the normal development and survival of enteric dopaminergic neurons; thus, expression of the dopaminergic neuronal markers, dopamine, tyrosine hydroxylase, and dopamine transporter are deficient in the ileum of &lt;i&gt;Cdnf&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;−/−&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mice. The normal age‐related decline in proportions of submucosal dopaminergic neurons is exacerbated in &lt;i&gt;Cdnf&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;−/−&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; animals. The defect in &lt;i&gt;Cdnf&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;−/−&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; animals is not dopamine‐restricted; proportions of other submucosal neurons (NOS‐, GABA‐, and CGRP‐expressing), are also deficient. The deficits in submucosal neurons are reflected functionally in delayed gastric emptying, slowed colonic motility, and prolonged total gastrointestinal transit. CDNF is expressed selectively in isolated enteric neural crest‐derived cells (ENCDC), which also express the dopamine‐related transcription factor Foxa2. Addition of CDNF to ENCDC promotes development of dopaminergic neurons; moreover, survival of these neurons becomes CDNF‐dependent after exposure to bone morphogenetic protein 4. The effects of neither glial cell‐derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) nor serotonin are additive with CDNF. We suggest that CDNF plays a critical role in development and long‐term maintenance of dopaminergic and other sets of submucosal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Late-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD) is dominated clinically and experimentally by a focus on dopamine neuron degeneration and ensuing motor system abnormalities. There are, additionally, a number of non-motor symptoms – including cognitive and psychiatric – that can appear much earlier in the course of the disease and also significantly impair quality of life. The neurobiology of such cognitive and psychiatric non-motor symptoms is poorly understood. The recognition of genetic forms of late-onset PD, which are clinically similar to idiopathic forms in both motor and non-motor symptoms, raises the perspective that brain cells and circuits – and the behaviors they support – differ in significant ways from normal by virtue of the fact that these mutations are carried throughout life, including especially early developmental critical periods where circuit structure and function is particularly susceptible to the influence of experience-dependent activity. In this focused review, we support this central thesis by highlighting studies of LRRK2-G2019S mouse models. We describe work that shows that in G2019S mutants, corticostriatal activity and plasticity are abnormal by P21, the end of a period of excitatory synaptogenesis in striatum. Moreover, by young adulthood, impaired striatal synaptic and non-synaptic forms of plasticity likely underlie altered and variable performance by mutant mice in validated tasks that test for depression-like and anhedonia-like behaviors. Mechanistically, deficits in cellular, synaptic and behavioral plasticity may be unified by mutation-linked defects in trafficking of AMPAR subunits and other membrane channels, which in turn may reflect impairment in the function of the Rab family of GTPases, a major target of LRRK2 phosphorylation. These findings underscore the need to better understand how PD-related mutant proteins influence brain structure and function during an extended period of brain development, and offer new clues for future therapeutic strategies to target non-motor cognitive or psychiatric symptoms of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Mechanotactile Sensory Feedback Improves Embodiment of a Prosthetic Hand During Active Use</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There have been several advancements in the field of myoelectric prostheses to improve dexterity and restore hand grasp patterns for persons with upper limb loss, including robust control strategies, novel sensory feedback, and multifunction prosthetic terminal devices. Although these advancements have shown to improve prosthesis performance, a key element that may further improve acceptance is often overlooked. Embodiment, which encompasses the feeling of owning, controlling and locating the device without the need to constantly look at it, has been shown to be affected by sensory feedback. However, the specific aspects of embodiment that are influenced are not clearly understood, particularly when a prosthesis is actively controlled. In this work, we used a sensorized simulated prosthesis in able-bodied participants to investigate the contribution of sensory feedback, active motor control, and the combination of both to the components of embodiment; using a common methodology in the literature, namely the rubber hand illusion (RHI). Our results indicate that (1) the sensorized simulated prosthesis may be embodied by able-bodied users in a similar fashion as prosthetic devices embodied by persons with upper limb amputation, and (2) mechanotactile sensory feedback might not only be useful for improving certain aspects of embodiment, i.e., ownership and location, but also may have a modulating effect on other aspects, namely sense of agency, when provided asynchronously during active motor control tasks. This work may allow us to further investigate and manipulate factors contributing to the complex phenomenon of embodiment in relation to active motor control of a device, enabling future study of more precise quantitative measures of embodiment that do not rely as much on subjective perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Stimulation Strategies for Improving the Resolution of Retinal Prostheses</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electrical stimulation using implantable devices with arrays of stimulating electrodes is an emerging therapy for neurological diseases. The performance of these devices depends greatly on their ability to activate populations of neurons with high spatiotemporal resolution. To study electrical stimulation of populations of neurons, retina serves as a useful model because the neural network is arranged in a planar array that is easy to access. Moreover, retinal prostheses are under development to restore vision by replacing the function of damaged light sensitive photoreceptors, which makes retinal research directly relevant for curing blindness. Here we provide a progress review on stimulation strategies developed in recent years to improve the resolution of electrical stimulation in retinal prostheses. We focus on studies performed with explanted retinas, in which electrophysiological techniques are the most advanced. We summarize achievements in improving the spatial and temporal resolution of electrical stimulation of the retina and methods to selectively stimulate neurons with different visual functions. Future directions for retinal prostheses development are also discussed, which could provide insights for other types of neuromodulatory devices in which high-resolution electrical stimulation is required.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Neonatal Brain Image Segmentation</title>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Deep learning neural networks are especially potent at dealing with structured data, such as images and volumes. Both modified LiviaNET and HyperDense-Net performed well at a prior competition segmenting 6-month-old infant magnetic resonance images, but neonatal cerebral tissue type identification is challenging given its uniquely inverted tissue contrasts. The current study aims to evaluate the two architectures to segment neonatal brain tissue types at term equivalent age.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Both networks were retrained over 24 pairs of neonatal T1 and T2 data from the Developing Human Connectome Project public data set and validated on another eight pairs against ground truth. We then reported the best-performing model from training and its performance by computing the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for each tissue type against eight test subjects.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;During the testing phase, among the segmentation approaches tested, the dual-modality HyperDense-Net achieved the best statistically significantly test mean DSC values, obtaining 0.94/0.95/0.92 for the tissue types and took 80 h to train and 10 min to segment, including preprocessing. The single-modality LiviaNET was better at processing T2-weighted images than processing T1-weighted images across all tissue types, achieving mean DSC values of 0.90/0.90/0.88 for gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid, respectively, while requiring 30 h to train and 8 min to segment each brain, including preprocessing.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;Our evaluation demonstrates that both neural networks can segment neonatal brains, achieving previously reported performance. Both networks will be continuously retrained over an increasingly larger repertoire of neonatal brain data and be made available through the Canadian Neonatal Brain Platform to better serve the neonatal brain imaging research community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Relationship Between Exercise and Alzheimer’s Disease: A Narrative Literature Review</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This narrative review aimed to summarize evidence regarding the responses to exercise among patients with preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and the effectiveness of long-term exercise interventions in improving cognitive function and neuropsychiatric symptoms. We performed a narrative review of existing literature on the effectiveness of long-term exercise interventions in improving cognitive function and neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with AD. Patients with AD who presented with long-term exercise interventions appeared to have improved blood flow, increased hippocampal volume, and improved neurogenesis. Most prospective studies have proven that physical inactivity is one of the most common preventable risk factors for developing AD and that higher physical activity levels are associated with a reduced risk of AD development. Physical exercise seems to be effective in improving several neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD, notably cognitive function. Compared with medications, exercise has been shown to have fewer side effects and better adherence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Brain and Behavioral Asymmetry: A Lesson From Fish</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00011</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is widely acknowledged that the left and right hemispheres of human brains display both anatomical and functional asymmetries. For more than a century, brain and behavioral lateralization have been considered a uniquely human feature linked to language and handedness. However, over the past decades this idea has been challenged by an increasing number of studies describing structural asymmetries and lateralized behaviors in non-human species extending from primates to fish. Evidence suggesting that a similar pattern of brain lateralization occurs in all vertebrates, humans included, has allowed the emergence of different model systems to investigate the development of brain asymmetries and their impact on behavior. Among animal models, fish have contributed much to the research on lateralization as several fish species exhibit lateralized behaviors. For instance, behavioral studies have shown that the advantages of having an asymmetric brain, such as the ability of simultaneously processing different information and perform parallel tasks compensate the potential costs associated with poor integration of information between the two hemispheres thus helping to better understand the possible evolutionary significance of lateralization. However, these studies inferred how the two sides of the brains are differentially specialized by measuring the differences in the behavioral responses but did not allow to directly investigate the relation between anatomical and functional asymmetries. With respect to this issue, in recent years zebrafish has become a powerful model to address lateralization at different level of complexity, from genes to neural circuitry and behavior. The possibility of combining genetic manipulation of brain asymmetries with cutting-edge in vivo imaging technique and behavioral tests makes the zebrafish a valuable model to investigate the phylogeny and ontogeny of brain lateralization and its relevance for normal brain function and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: An &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;silico&lt;/i&gt; human cell model reveals the influence of spatial organization on RNA splicing</title>

Spatial organization is a characteristic of all cells, achieved in eukaryotic cells by utilizing both membrane-bound and membrane-less organelles. One of the key processes in eukaryotes is RNA splicing, which readies mRNA for translation. This complex and highly dynamical chemical process involves assembly and disassembly of many molecules in multiple cellular compartments and their transport among compartments. Our goal is to model the effect of spatial organization of membrane-less organelles (specifically nuclear speckles) and of organelle heterogeneity on splicing particle biogenesis in mammalian cells. Based on multiple sources of complementary experimental data, we constructed a spatial model of a HeLa cell to capture intracellular crowding effects. We then developed chemical reaction networks to describe the formation of RNA splicing machinery complexes and splicing processes within nuclear speckles (specific type of non-membrane-bound organelles). We incorporated these networks into our spatially-resolved human cell model and performed stochastic simulations for up to 15 minutes of biological time, the longest thus far for a eukaryotic cell. We find that an increase (decrease) in the number of nuclear pore complexes increases (decreases) the number of assembled splicing particles; and that compartmentalization is critical for the yield of correctly-assembled particles. We also show that a slight increase of splicing particle localization into nuclear speckles leads to a disproportionate enhancement of mRNA splicing and a reduction in the noise of generated mRNA. Our model also predicts that the distance between genes and speckles has a considerable effect on the mRNA production rate, with genes located closer to speckles producing mRNA at higher levels, emphasizing the importance of genome organization around speckles. The HeLa cell model, including organelles and sub-compartments, provides a flexible foundation to study other cellular processes that are strongly modulated by spatiotemporal heterogeneity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/svCIRJkhwKU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>
