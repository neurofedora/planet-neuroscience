	<title>Annals of Neurology: The immune response of the human brain to abdominal surgery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24909</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24909</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24909-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgery launches a systemic inflammatory reaction that reaches the brain and associates with immune activation and cognitive decline. Although preclinical studies have in part described this systemic-to-brain signaling pathway, we lack information on how these changes appear in humans. This study examines the short- and long-term impact of abdominal surgery on the human brain immune system by positron emission tomography (PET) in relation to blood immune reactivity, plasma inflammatory biomarkers, and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24909-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight males undergoing prostatectomy under general anesthesia were included. Prior to surgery (baseline), at postoperative days 3 to 4, and after 3 months, patients were examined using [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 brain PET imaging to assess brain immune cell activation. Concurrently, systemic inflammatory biomarkers, ex vivo blood tests on immunoreactivity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and cognitive function were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24909-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients showed a global downregulation of gray matter [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 binding of 26 ± 26% (mean ± standard deviation) at 3 to 4 days postoperatively compared to baseline (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.023), recovering or even increasing after 3 months. LPS-induced release of the proinflammatory marker tumor necrosis factor-α in blood displayed a reduction (41 ± 39%) on the 3rd to 4th postoperative day, corresponding to changes in [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 distribution volume. Change in Stroop Color-Word Test performance between postoperative days 3 to 4 and 3 months correlated to change in [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 binding (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.027).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24909-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study translates preclinical data on changes in the brain immune system after surgery to humans, and suggests an interplay between the human brain and the inflammatory response of the peripheral innate immune system. These findings may be related to postsurgical impairments of cognitive function. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02780</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Message passing between components of a distributed physical system is
non-instantaneous and contributes to determine the time scales of the emerging
collective dynamics like an effective inertia. In biological neuron networks
this inertia is due in part to local synaptic filtering of exchanged spikes,
and in part to the distribution of the axonal transmission delays. How
differently these two kinds of inertia affect the network dynamics is an open
issue not yet addressed due to the difficulties in dealing with the
non-Markovian nature of synaptic transmission. Here, we develop a mean-field
dimensional reduction yielding to an effective Markovian dynamics of the
population density of the neuronal membrane potential, valid under the
hypothesis of small fluctuations of the synaptic current. The resulting theory
allows us to prove the formal equivalence between local and distributed
inertia, holding for any synaptic time scale, integrate-and-fire neuron model,
spike emission regimes and for different network states even when the neuron
number is finite.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Avalanches and Generalized Memory Associativity in a Network Model for Conscious and Unconscious Mental Functioning. (arXiv:1704.02741v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02741</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02741</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We explore statistical characteristics of avalanches associated with the
dynamics of a complex-network model, where two modules corresponding to
sensorial and symbolic memories interact, representing unconscious and
conscious mental processes. The model illustrates Freud's ideas regarding the
neuroses and that consciousness is related with symbolic and linguistic memory
activity in the brain. It incorporates the Stariolo-Tsallis generalization of
the Boltzmann Machine in order to model memory retrieval and associativity. In
the present work, we define and measure avalanche size distributions during
memory retrieval, in order to gain insight regarding basic aspects of the
functioning of these complex networks. The avalanche sizes defined for our
model should be related to the time consumed and also to the size of the
neuronal region which is activated, during memory retrieval. This allows the
qualitative comparison of the behaviour of the distribution of cluster sizes,
obtained during fMRI measurements of the propagation of signals in the brain,
with the distribution of avalanche sizes obtained in our simulation
experiments. This comparison corroborates the indication that the Nonextensive
Statistical Mechanics formalism may indeed be more well suited to model the
complex networks which constitute brain and mental structure.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pain is among the most salient of experiences while also, curiously, being
among the most malleable. A large body of research has revealed that a
multitude of explicit strategies can be used to effectively alter the
attention-demanding quality of acute and chronic pains and their associated
neural correlates. However, thoughts that are spontaneous, rather than actively
generated, are common in daily life, and so attention to pain can often
temporally fluctuate because of ongoing self-generated experiences. Classic
pain theories have largely neglected to account for unconstrained fluctuations
in cognition, but new studies have demonstrated the behavioral-relevance,
putative neural basis, and individual variability of interactions between pain
and spontaneous thoughts. In this chapter, I review behavioral studies of
ongoing fluctuations in attention to pain, studies of the neural basis of
spontaneous mind-wandering away from pain, and the clinical implications of
this research.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study proposes an approach to estimate the functional localization and
connectivity from CBF and BOLD signals simultaneously measured by ASL (arterial
spin labeling) MRI, especially using exploratory Structural Equation Modeling
analysis. In a visual task experiment, the primary visual cortices were located
by analyzing the perfusion data. In the resting state experiment, two
structural equation models were estimated at each voxel regarding to the
sensory-motor network and default-mode network. The resulting connectivity maps
indicate that supplementary motor area has significant connections to
left/right primary motor areas, and inferior parietal lobules link
significantly with posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex. The
model fitting results imply that BOLD signal is more directly linked to the
underlying cause of functional connectivity than CBF signal.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An often-overlooked characteristic of the human mind is its propensity to
wander. Despite growing interest in the science of mind-wandering, most studies
operationalize mind-wandering by its task-unrelated contents, which may be
orthogonal to the processes constraining how thoughts are evoked and unfold
over time. In this chapter, we emphasize the importance of incorporating such
processes into current definitions of mind-wandering, and proposing that
mind-wandering and other forms of spontaneous thought (such as dreaming and
creativity) are mental states that arise and transition relatively freely due
to an absence of constraints on cognition. We review existing psychological,
philosophical, and neuroscientific research on spontaneous thought through the
lens of this framework, and call for additional research into the dynamic
properties of the mind and brain.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synchronization in neural networks is strongly tied to the implementation of
cognitive processes, but abnormal neuronal synchronization has been linked to a
number of brain disorders such as epilepsy and schizophrenia. Here we examine
the effects of channel noise on the synchronization of small Hodgkin-Huxley
neuronal networks. The principal feature of a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron is the
existence of protein channels that transition between open and closed states
with voltage dependent rate constants. The Hodgkin-Huxley model assumes
infinitely many channels, so fluctuations in the number of open channels do not
affect the voltage. However, real neurons have finitely many channels which
lead to fluctuations in the membrane voltage and modify the timing of the
spikes, which may in turn lead to large changes in the degree of
synchronization. We demonstrate that under mild conditions, neurons in the
network reach a steady state synchronization level that depends only on the
number of neurons in the network. The channel noise only affects the time it
takes to reach the steady state synchronization level.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sleep paralysis is an experience of being temporarily unable to move or talk
during the transitional periods between sleep and wakefulness: at sleep onset
or upon awakening. Feeling of paralysis may be accompanied by a variety of
vivid and intense sensory experiences, including mentation in visual, auditory,
and tactile modalities, as well as a distinct feeling of presence. This chapter
discusses a variety of sleep paralysis experiences from the perspective of
enactive cognition and cultural neurophenomenology. Current knowledge of
neurophysiology and associated conditions is presented, and some techniques for
coping with sleep paralysis are proposed. As an experience characterized by a
hybrid state of dreaming and waking, sleep paralysis offers a unique window
into phenomenology of spontaneous thought in sleep.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has led to significant advances in artificial intelligence, in
part, by adopting strategies motivated by neurophysiology. However, it is
unclear whether deep learning could occur in the real brain. Here, we show that
a deep learning algorithm that utilizes multi-compartment neurons might help us
to understand how the brain optimizes cost functions. Like neocortical
pyramidal neurons, neurons in our model receive sensory information and
higher-order feedback in electrotonically segregated compartments. Thanks to
this segregation, the neurons in different layers of the network can coordinate
synaptic weight updates. As a result, the network can learn to categorize
images better than a single layer network. Furthermore, we show that our
algorithm takes advantage of multilayer architectures to identify useful
representations---the hallmark of deep learning. This work demonstrates that
deep learning can be achieved using segregated dendritic compartments, which
may help to explain the dendritic morphology of neocortical pyramidal neurons.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling disordered protein interactions from biophysical principles</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005485</guid>

Disordered protein-protein interactions (PPIs), those involving a folded protein and an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), are prevalent in the cell, including important signaling and regulatory pathways. IDPs do not adopt a single dominant structure in isolation but often become ordered upon binding. To aid understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disordered PPIs, it is crucial to obtain the tertiary structure of the PPIs. However, experimental methods have difficulty in solving disordered PPIs and existing protein-protein and protein-peptide docking methods are not able to model them. Here we present a novel computational method, IDP-LZerD, which models the conformation of a disordered PPI by considering the biophysical binding mechanism of an IDP to a structured protein, whereby a local segment of the IDP initiates the interaction and subsequently the remaining IDP regions explore and coalesce around the initial binding site. On a dataset of 22 disordered PPIs with IDPs up to 69 amino acids, successful predictions were made for 21 bound and 18 unbound receptors. The successful modeling provides additional support for biophysical principles. Moreover, the new technique significantly expands the capability of protein structure modeling and provides crucial insights into the molecular mechanisms of disordered PPIs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MUyvfhHHVgo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Amino acid composition predicts prion activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005465</guid>

Many prion-forming proteins contain glutamine/asparagine (Q/N) rich domains, and there are conflicting opinions as to the role of primary sequence in their conversion to the prion form: is this phenomenon driven primarily by amino acid composition, or, as a recent computational analysis suggested, dependent on the presence of short sequence elements with high amyloid-forming potential. The argument for the importance of short sequence elements hinged on the relatively-high accuracy obtained using a method that utilizes a collection of length-six sequence elements with known amyloid-forming potential. We weigh in on this question and demonstrate that when those sequence elements are permuted, even higher accuracy is obtained; we also propose a novel multiple-instance machine learning method that uses sequence composition alone, and achieves better accuracy than all existing prion prediction approaches. While we expect there to be elements of primary sequence that affect the process, our experiments suggest that sequence composition alone is sufficient for predicting protein sequences that are likely to form prions. A web-server for the proposed method is available at http://faculty.pieas.edu.pk/fayyaz/prank.html, and the code for reproducing our experiments is available at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.167136.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rL8SH_vmJu0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Focused ultrasound as a novel strategy for Alzheimer's disease therapeutics</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of advances in the pathology, genetics and imaging of Alzheimer's disease (AD), there remain no effective treatments that significantly alter its natural history. Several late phase clinical trials, focused largely on amyloid beta metabolism and clearance, have unfortunately demonstrated no significant benefit in early AD patients. Recent work investigating blood-brain barrier opening using focused ultrasound in transgenic animal models has shown that repeated ultrasound administration coupled with microbubble-containing contrast can reduce plaque burden and reverse memory deficits. While the mechanisms underlying plaque clearance are under investigation, this image-guided, noninvasive technique appears promising. This article describes the rationale and underlying principles of focused ultrasound as applied to Alzheimer's disease and suggests that based on promising pre-clinical results, this technology, whether alone or in conjunction with targeted therapies, can be of potential benefit.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;T2-weighted scans provided data on the extent and dynamics of neuronal tissue damage and midsagittal tissue bridges at the epicenter of traumatic cervical spinal cord lesions in 24 subacute tetraplegic patients. At one month post-injury, smaller lesion area and midsagittal tissue bridges identified those patients with lower extremity evoked potentials and better clinical recovery. Wider midsagittal tissue bridges and smaller lesions at one month post-injury were associated with neurological and functional recovery at 1 year follow-up. Neuroimaging biomarkers of lesion area and midsagittal tissue bridges are potential outcome predictors and patient stratifiers in both subacute and chronic clinical trials.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A mutation in the Tubb4a gene leads to microtubule accumulation with hypomyelination and demyelination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24930</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24930</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Our goal was to define the genetic cause of the profound hypomyelination in the &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; rat model and determine its relevance to human white matter disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Based on previous localization of the &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; mutation to rat chromosome 9, we tested if the mutation resided within the &lt;em&gt;Tubb4a&lt;/em&gt; (β-tubulin 4A) gene, since mutations in the &lt;em&gt;TUBB4A&lt;/em&gt; gene have been described in patients with CNS hypomyelination. To determine whether accumulation of microtubules led to progressive demyelination we analyzed the spinal cord and optic nerves of 2 year old rats by light and electron microscopy. Cerebral white matter from a patient with &lt;em&gt;TUBB4A&lt;/em&gt; Asn414Lys mutation and MRI evidence of severe hypomyelination was studied similarly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: As the &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; rat ages there is progressive loss of myelin in the brain and dorsal column of the spinal cord associated with increased oligodendrocyte numbers with accumulation of microtubules. This accumulation involved the entire cell body and distal processes of oligodendrocytes but there was no accumulation of microtubules in axons. A single point mutation in &lt;em&gt;Tubb4a&lt;/em&gt; (p.Ala302Thr) was found in homozygous &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; samples. A similar hypomyelination associated with increased oligodendrocyte numbers and arrays of microtubules in oligodendrocytes was demonstrated in the human patient sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: The &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; rat is the first animal model of &lt;em&gt;TUBB4&lt;/em&gt; mutations in humans and a novel system in which to test the mechanism of microtubule accumulation. The finding of microtubule accumulation in a patient with a &lt;em&gt;TUBB4A&lt;/em&gt; mutation and leukodystrophy confirms the usefulness of &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; as a model of the human disease.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Associative content-addressable networks with exponentially many robust stable states. (arXiv:1704.02019v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain must robustly store a large number of memories, corresponding to
the many events and scenes a person encounters over a lifetime. However, the
number of memory states in existing neural network models either grows weakly
with network size or recall performance fails catastrophically with vanishingly
little noise. Here we show that it is possible to construct an associative
content-addressable memory (ACAM) with exponentially many stable states and
robust error-correction. The network possesses expander graph connectivity on a
restricted Boltzmann machine architecture. The expansion property allows simple
neural network dynamics to perform at par with modern error-correcting codes.
Appropriate networks can be constructed with sparse random connections combined
with glomerular nodes and a local associative learning rule, using low
dynamic-range weights. Thus, sparse quasi-random constraint structures --
characteristic of an important class of modern error-correcting codes -- may
provide for high-performance computation in artificial neural networks and the
brain.

	<description>Head movements are primarily sensed in a reference frame tied to the head, yet they are used to calculate self-orientation relative to the world. This requires to re-encode head kinematic signals into a reference frame anchored to earth-centered landmarks such as gravity, through computations whose neuronal substrate remains to be determined. Here, we studied the encoding of self-generated head movements in the caudal cerebellar vermis, an area essential for graviceptive functions. We found that, contrarily to peripheral vestibular inputs, most Purkinje cells exhibited a mixed sensitivity to head rotational and gravitational information and were differentially modulated by active and passive movements. In a subpopulation of cells, this mixed sensitivity underlay a tuning to rotations about an axis defined relative to gravity. Therefore, we show that the caudal vermis hosts a re-encoded, gravitationally-polarized representation of self-generated head kinematics.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neural Overlap In Item Representations Across Episodes Impairs Context Memory</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/125971v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We frequently encounter the same item in different contexts, and when that happens, memories of earlier encounters can get reactivated in the brain. Here we examined how these existing memories are changed as a result of such reactivation. We hypothesized that when an item's initial and subsequent neural representations overlap, this allows the initial item to become associated with novel contextual information, interfering with later retrieval of the initial context. That is, we predicted a negative relationship between representational similarity across repeated experiences of an item and subsequent source memory for the initial context. We tested this hypothesis in an fMRI study, in which objects were presented multiple times during different tasks. We measured the similarity of the neural patterns in lateral occipital cortex that were elicited by the first and second presentations of objects, and related this neural overlap score to source memory in a subsequent test. Consistent with our hypothesis, greater item-specific pattern similarity was linked to worse source memory for the initial task. Our findings suggest that the influence of novel experiences on an existing context memory depends on how reliably a shared component (i.e., same item) is represented across these episodes.</description>

	<description>The stability analysis of dynamical neural network systems generally follows the route of finding a suitable Liapunov function after the fashion Hopfield's famous paper on content addressable memory network or by finding conditions that make divergent solutions impossible. For the current work we focused on biological recurrent neural networks (bRNNs) that require transient external inputs (Cohen-Grossberg networks). In the current work we have proposed a general method to construct Liapunov functions for recurrent neural network with the help of a physically meaningful Hamiltonian function. This construct allows us to explore the emergent properties of the recurrent network (e.g., parameter configuration needed for winner-take-all competition in a leaky accumulator design) beyond that available in standard stability analysis, while also comparing well with standard stability analysis (ordinary differential equation approach) as a special case of the general stability constraint derived from the Hamiltonian formulation. We also show that the Cohen-Grossberg Liapunov function can be derived naturally from the Hamiltonian formalism. A strength of the construct comes from its usability as a predictor for behavior in psychophysical experiments involving numerosity and temporal duration judgements.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Efficient Information Contents Flow Down from Memory to Predict the Identity of Faces</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/125591v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/125591v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In the sciences of cognition, an influential idea is that the brain makes predictions about incoming sensory information to reduce inherent ambiguity. In the visual hierarchy, this implies that information content originating in memory, e.g. the identity of a face, propagates down to disambiguate incoming stimulus information. However, understanding this powerful &quot;prediction for recognition&quot; mechanism will remain elusive until we uncover the content of the information propagating down from memory. Here, we address this foundational limitation with a task ubiquitous to humans: familiar face identification. We developed a unique computer graphics platform that combines a generative model of random face identity information with the subjectivity of perception. In 14 individual participants, we reverse engineered the predicted information contents propagating down from memory to identify 4 familiar faces. In a follow-up validation, we used the predicted face information to synthesize the identity of new faces and confirmed the causal role of the predictions in face identification. We show these predictions comprise both local 3D surface patches, such as a particularly thin and pointy nose combined with a square chin and a prominent brow, or more global surface characteristics, such as a longer or broader face. Further analyses reveal that the predicted contents are efficient because they represent objective features that maximally distinguish each identity from a model norm. Our results reveal the contents that propagate down the visual hierarchy from memory, showing this coding scheme is efficient and compatible with norm-based coding, with implications for mechanistic accounts of brain and machine intelligence.</description>

	<description>The Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) seeks to create the first 4-dimensional connectome of early life. Understanding this connectome in detail may provide insights into normal as well as abnormal patterns of brain development. Following established best practices adopted by the WU-MINN Human Connectome Project and pioneered by FreeSurfer, the project utilises cortical surface-based processing pipelines. In this paper, we propose a fully automated processing pipeline for the structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the developing neonatal brain. This proposed pipeline consists of a refined framework for cortical and sub-cortical volume segmentation, cortical surface extraction and cortical surface inflation of neonatal subjects, which has been specifically designed to address considerable differences between adult and neonatal brains, as imaged using MRI. Using the proposed pipeline our results demonstrate that images collected from 465 subjects ranging from 28 to 45 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA) can be fully automatically processed; generating cortical surface models that are topologically and anatomically correct. Downstream, these surfaces will enhance comparisons of functional and diffusion MRI datasets, and support the modelling of emerging patterns of brain connectivity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Multichannel Sleep Spindle Detection Using Sparse Low-Rank Optimization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/104414v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/104414v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We consider the detection of sleep spindles simultaneously across the frontal, central and occipital channels of sleep EEG in a single run. We propose a multichannel sleep spindle detection method utilizing a multichannel transient separation algorithm based on a sparse optimization framework. The proposed transient separation algorithm decomposes the multichannel EEG into the sum of an oscillatory and a transient component. Consecutive overlapping blocks of the multichannel oscillatory component are assumed to be of low-rank whereas the transient component is assumed to be piecewise constant with a zero baseline. We estimate both the components by minimizing a convex objective function using an iterative algorithm. The multichannel oscillatory component is used in conjunction with the Teager operator for detecting sleep spindles. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using an online single channel EEG database and compared with 7 state-of-the-art automated detectors. The by-event F1 scores for the proposed spindle detection method averaged 0.67 (0.03). The average false discovery rate for the proposed method was 31.3 (0.04). For an overnight 6 to 8 channel EEG signal, the proposed algorithm takes on an average 2 minutes to detect sleep spindles. Comparable F1 scores and fast run times make the proposed spindle detector a valuable tool in answering the open question of studying the dynamics of sleep spindles and tracking their propagation overnight across the scalp in sleep EEG.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Abnormal Social Behaviors And Dysfunction Of Autism-Related Genes Associated With Daily Agonistic Interactions In Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/125674v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/125674v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: The ability of people to communicate with each other is a necessary component of social behavior and the normal development of individuals who live in a community. An apparent decline in sociability may be the result of a negative social environment or the development of affective and neurological disorders, including autistic spectrum disorders. The behavior of these humans may be characterized by the deterioration of socialization, low communication, and repetitive and restricted behaviors. This study aimed to analyze changes in the social behaviors of male mice induced by daily agonistic interactions and investigate the involvement of genes, related with autistic spectrum disorders in the process of the impairment of social behaviors. Methods: Abnormal social behavior is induced by repeated experiences of aggression accompanied by wins (winners) or chronic social defeats (losers) in daily agonistic interactions in male mice. The collected brain regions (the midbrain raphe nuclei, ventral tegmental area, striatum, hippocampus, and hypothalamus) were sequenced at JSC Genoanalytica (http://genoanalytica.ru/, Moscow, Russia). The Cufflinks program was used to estimate the gene expression levels. Bioinformatic methods were used for the analysis of differentially expressed genes in male mice. Results: The losers exhibited an avoidance of social contacts toward unfamiliar conspecific, immobility and low communication on neutral territory. The winners demonstrated aggression and hyperactivity in this condition. The exploratory activity (rearing) and approaching behavior time towards the partner were decreased, and the number of episodes of repetitive self-grooming behavior was increased in both social groups. These symptoms were similar to the symptoms observed in animal models of autistic spectrum disorders. In an analysis of the RNA-Seq database of the whole transcriptome in the brain regions of the winners and losers, we identified changes in the expression of the following genes, which are associated with autism in humans: Tph2, Maoa, Slc6a4, Htr7, Gabrb3, Nrxn1, Nrxn2, Nlgn1, Nlgn2, Nlgn3, Shank2, Shank3, Fmr1, Ube3a, Pten, Cntn3, Foxp2, Oxtr, Reln, Cadps2, Pcdh10, Ctnnd2, En2, Arx, Auts2, Mecp2, and Ptchd1. Common and specific changes in the expression of these genes in different brain regions were identified in the winners and losers. Conclusions: This research demonstrates for the first time that abnormalities in social behaviors that develop under a negative social environment in adults may be associated with alterations in expression of genes, related with autism in the brain.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Electrochemical Measurement Of Acetylcholine In The Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex: A Technical Report</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/120691v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Ever since the discovery of acetylcholine in 1913, its role as neuromodulator has been extensively studied in a variety of model systems. These previous studies revealed that acetylcholine is of critical importance for several cognitive functions including attention, learning and memory. In spite of these previous findings, it has proven difficult to determine the amount of acetylcholine that is released during cognitive tasks with sub-second temporal resolution. One method that might be used to measure acetylcholine release is the use of an enzyme-coupled amperometric sensor, which has been suggested to measure acetylcholine with high sensitivity, selectivity and relatively high temporal resolution (&amp;lt; 1 second). In the present study, we have tried to adapt the technique developed in the rodent model system by Parikh and colleagues(1,2) for use in non-human primates. We aimed to measure in-vivo levels of acetylcholine in the macaque dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while the monkey performed an attention demanding curve-tracing task(3,4). We report that our attempts to measure acetylcholine using amperometry in an awake behaving macaque monkey proved difficult and tedious and that our results are inconsistent and prone to noise. In the discussion, we will outline the challenges that will need to be addressed to use this technique in non-human primates and hope that our observations inspire solutions to help future research on the role of this important neurotransmitter.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Dose-response relationships for environmentally mediated infectious disease transmission models</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005481</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew F. Brouwer, Mark H. Weir, Marisa C. Eisenberg, Rafael Meza, Joseph N. S. Eisenberg&lt;/p&gt;

Environmentally mediated infectious disease transmission models provide a mechanistic approach to examining environmental interventions for outbreaks, such as water treatment or surface decontamination. The shift from the classical SIR framework to one incorporating the environment requires codifying the relationship between exposure to environmental pathogens and infection, i.e. the dose–response relationship. Much of the work characterizing the functional forms of dose–response relationships has used statistical fit to experimental data. However, there has been little research examining the consequences of the choice of functional form in the context of transmission dynamics. To this end, we identify four properties of dose–response functions that should be considered when selecting a functional form: low-dose linearity, scalability, concavity, and whether it is a single-hit model. We find that i) middle- and high-dose data do not constrain the low-dose response, and different dose–response forms that are equally plausible given the data can lead to significant differences in simulated outbreak dynamics; ii) the choice of how to aggregate continuous exposure into discrete doses can impact the modeled force of infection; iii) low-dose linear, concave functions allow the basic reproduction number to control global dynamics; and iv) identifiability analysis offers a way to manage multiple sources of uncertainty and leverage environmental monitoring to make inference about infectivity. By applying an environmentally mediated infectious disease model to the 1993 Milwaukee &lt;i&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/i&gt; outbreak, we demonstrate that environmental monitoring allows for inference regarding the infectivity of the pathogen and thus improves our ability to identify outbreak characteristics such as pathogen strain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Jzgkl6SGBws&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Rigorous spatial statistics for gaze patterns in scene viewing: Effects of repeated viewing. (arXiv:1704.01761v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Scene viewing is used to study attentional selection in complex but still
controlled environments. One of the main observations on eye movements during
scene viewing is the inhomogeneous distribution of fixation locations: While
some parts of an image are fixated by almost all observers and are inspected
repeatedly by the same observer, other image parts remain unfixated among
observers even after long exploration intervals. Here, we apply spatial point
processes to investigate the correlations between pairs of points. More
technically, the pair correlation function (PCF) is a powerful statistical tool
to evaluate how individual scanpaths deviate from the inhomogeneity observed
across participants. We demonstrate that aggregation of fixation locations
within four degrees is stronger during individual trials than expected by the
inhomogeneity of the distribution. Furthermore, the PCF reveals stronger
aggregation of fixations when the same image is presented a second time. We use
simulations of a dynamical model to show that a reduced attentional span may
explain differences in spatial correlations between first and second inspection
of the same image.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dynamical models implemented on the large scale architecture of the human
brain may shed light on how function arises from the underlying structure. This
is the case notably for simple abstract models, such as the Ising model. We
compare the spin correlations of the Ising model and the empirical functional
brain correlations, both at the single link level and at the modular level, and
show that their match increases at the modular level in anesthesia, in line
with recent results and theories. Moreover, we show that at the peak of the
specific heat (the \it{critical state}) the spin correlations are minimally
shaped by the underlying structural network, explaining how the best match
between structure and function is obtained at the onset of criticality, as
previously observed. These findings confirm that brain dynamics under
anesthesia shows a departure from criticality and could open the way to novel
perspectives when the conserved magnetization is interpreted in terms of an
homeostatic principle imposed to neural activity.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Running Promotes Spatial Bias Independently Of Adult Neurogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/125260v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Different memory systems offer distinct advantages to navigational behavior. The hippocampus forms complex associations between environmental stimuli, enabling flexible navigation through space. In contrast, the dorsal striatum associates discrete cues and favorable behavioral responses, enabling habit-like, automated navigation. While these two systems often complement one another, there are instances where striatal-dependent responses (e.g. approach a cue) conflict with hippocampal representations of spatial goals. In conflict situations, preference for spatial vs. response strategies varies across individuals and depends on previous experience, plasticity and the integrity of these two memory systems. Here, we investigated the role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and exercise on mouse search strategies in a water maze task that can be solved with either a hippocampal-dependent place strategy or a striatal-dependent cue-response strategy. We predicted that inhibiting adult neurogenesis would impair hippocampal function and shift behavior towards striatal-dependent cue responses. However, blocking neurogenesis in a transgenic nestin-TK mouse did not affect strategy choice. We then investigated whether a pro-neurogenic stimulus, running, would bias mice towards hippocampal-dependent spatial strategies. While running indeed promoted spatial strategies, it did so even when neurogenesis was inhibited in nestin-TK mice. These findings indicate that exercise-induced increases in neurogenesis are not always required for enhanced cognitive function. Furthermore, our data identify exercise as a potentially useful strategy for promoting flexible, cognitive forms of memory in habit-related disorders that are characterized by excessive responding to discrete cues.</description>

	<description>We study the confidence response distributions for several two alternative forced choice tasks with different structure, and assess whether their behavioral responses are accurately accounted for as a mapping from bayesian inferred probability of having made a correct choice. We propose an extension to an existing bayesian decision making model that allows us to quantitatively compare the relative quality of different function mappings from bayesian belief onto responded confidence. We find that a simple linear rescaling from bayesian belief best fits the observed response distributions. Furthermore, the parameter values allow us to study how task structure affects differently the decision policy and confidence mapping, highlighting a dissociable effect between confidence and perceptual performance.</description>

	<description>Depression is a pervasive and debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder. A single, low dose of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine elicits a long-lasting antidepressant response in patients with treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder. Developing mechanistic understanding of how NMDAR antagonism alters synapse and circuit function is pivotal to developing translatable, circuit-based therapies for depression. Here using viral vectors, anatomical tracing, fMRI, and optogenetic-assisted circuit analysis, we assessed the role of the NMDAR subunit GluN2B in regulating cellular, synaptic, and circuit-level function and depression-related behavior. We demonstrate that post-developmental deletion of GluN2B from pyramidal neurons in medial prefrontal cortex enhances action potential output in a synaptic activity-dependent manner. GluN2B deletion dictates functional connectivity between mPFC and limbic thalamus but not ventral hippocampus and elicits antidepressant-like behavior. Our findings demonstrate that postsynaptic GluN2B exerts input-specific control of pyramidal neuron innervation, and identify a novel circuit for regulating depression-like behaviors in mice.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Functional asymmetry and plasticity of electrical synapses interconnecting neurons through a 36-state model of gap junction channel gating</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Mindaugas Snipas, Lina Rimkute, Tadas Kraujalis, Kestutis Maciunas, Feliksas F. Bukauskas&lt;/p&gt;

We combined the Hodgkin–Huxley equations and a 36-state model of gap junction channel gating to simulate electrical signal transfer through electrical synapses. Differently from most previous studies, our model can account for dynamic modulation of junctional conductance during the spread of electrical signal between coupled neurons. The model of electrical synapse is based on electrical properties of the gap junction channel encompassing two &lt;i&gt;fast&lt;/i&gt; and two &lt;i&gt;slow&lt;/i&gt; gates triggered by the transjunctional voltage. We quantified the influence of a difference in input resistances of electrically coupled neurons and instantaneous conductance–voltage rectification of gap junctions on an asymmetry of cell-to-cell signaling. We demonstrated that such asymmetry strongly depends on junctional conductance and can lead to the unidirectional transfer of action potentials. The simulation results also revealed that voltage spikes, which develop between neighboring cells during the spread of action potentials, can induce a rapid decay of junctional conductance, thus demonstrating spiking activity-dependent short-term plasticity of electrical synapses. This conclusion was supported by experimental data obtained in HeLa cells transfected with connexin45, which is among connexin isoforms expressed in neurons. Moreover, the model allowed us to replicate the kinetics of junctional conductance under different levels of intracellular concentration of free magnesium ([Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;), which was experimentally recorded in cells expressing connexin36, a major neuronal connexin. We demonstrated that such [Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent long-term plasticity of the electrical synapse can be adequately reproduced through the changes of &lt;i&gt;slow&lt;/i&gt; gate parameters of the 36-state model. This suggests that some types of chemical modulation of gap junctions can be executed through the underlying mechanisms of voltage gating. Overall, the developed model accounts for direction-dependent asymmetry, as well as for short- and long-term plasticity of electrical synapses. Our modeling results demonstrate that such complex behavior of the electrical synapse is important in shaping the response of coupled neurons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/G_ezrXWVN44&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Dynamic compensation, parameter identifiability, and equivariances</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Eduardo D. Sontag&lt;/p&gt;

A recent paper by Karin et al. introduced a mathematical notion called dynamical compensation (DC) of biological circuits. DC was shown to play an important role in glucose homeostasis as well as other key physiological regulatory mechanisms. Karin et al. went on to provide a sufficient condition to test whether a given system has the DC property. Here, we show how DC is a reformulation of a well-known concept in systems biology, statistics, and control theory—that of parameter structural non-identifiability. Viewing DC as a parameter identification problem enables one to take advantage of powerful theoretical and computational tools to test a system for DC. We obtain as a special case the sufficient criterion discussed by Karin et al. We also draw connections to system equivalence and to the fold-change detection property.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/grkMJTAOlrI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: How evolution learns to generalise: Using the principles of learning theory to understand the evolution of developmental organisation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005358</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/CpK5z1wAC_M/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Kostas Kouvaris, Jeff Clune, Loizos Kounios, Markus Brede, Richard A. Watson&lt;/p&gt;

One of the most intriguing questions in evolution is how organisms exhibit suitable phenotypic variation to rapidly adapt in novel selective environments. Such variability is crucial for evolvability, but poorly understood. In particular, how can natural selection favour developmental organisations that facilitate adaptive evolution in previously unseen environments? Such a capacity suggests foresight that is incompatible with the short-sighted concept of natural selection. A potential resolution is provided by the idea that evolution may discover and exploit information not only about the particular phenotypes selected in the past, but their underlying structural regularities: new phenotypes, with the same underlying regularities, but novel particulars, may then be useful in new environments. If true, we still need to understand the conditions in which natural selection will discover such deep regularities rather than exploiting ‘quick fixes’ (i.e., fixes that provide adaptive phenotypes in the short term, but limit future evolvability). Here we argue that the ability of evolution to discover such regularities is formally analogous to learning principles, familiar in humans and machines, that enable generalisation from past experience. Conversely, natural selection that fails to enhance evolvability is directly analogous to the learning problem of over-fitting and the subsequent failure to generalise. We support the conclusion that evolving systems and learning systems are different instantiations of the same algorithmic principles by showing that existing results from the learning domain can be transferred to the evolution domain. Specifically, we show that conditions that alleviate over-fitting in learning systems successfully predict which biological conditions (e.g., environmental variation, regularity, noise or a pressure for developmental simplicity) enhance evolvability. This equivalence provides access to a well-developed theoretical framework from learning theory that enables a characterisation of the general conditions for the evolution of evolvability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CpK5z1wAC_M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In contrast, frontal hypometabolism related to the common age-related entorhinal tauopathy, but this dysfunction was independent of amyloid, and did not predict significant memory decline. Neocortical tauopathy was positively associated with metabolism in individuals with subthreshold amyloid, suggesting that glucose metabolism increases before decreasing in the course of preclinical AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A recent paper suggests that Deep Neural Networks can be protected from
gradient-based adversarial perturbations by driving the network activations
into a highly saturated regime. Here we analyse such saturated networks and
show that the attacks fail due to numerical limitations in the gradient
computations. A simple stabilisation of the gradient estimates enables
successful and efficient attacks. Thus, it has yet to be shown that the
robustness observed in highly saturated networks is not simply due to numerical
limitations.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Resting-state functional connectivity-based biomarkers and functional MRI-based neurofeedback for psychiatric disorders: a challenge for developing theranostic biomarkers. (arXiv:1704.01350v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01350</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01350</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Psychiatric research has been hampered by an explanatory gap between
psychiatric symptoms and their neural underpinnings, which has resulted in poor
treatment outcomes. This situation has prompted us to shift from symptom-based
diagnosis to data-driven diagnosis, aiming to redefine psychiatric disorders as
disorders of neural circuitry. Promising candidates for data-driven diagnosis
include resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI)-based biomarkers.
Although biomarkers have been developed with the aim of diagnosing patients and
predicting the efficacy of therapy, the focus has shifted to the identification
of biomarkers that represent therapeutic targets, which would allow for more
personalized treatment approaches. This type of biomarker (i.e., theranostic
biomarker) is expected to elucidate the disease mechanism of psychiatric
conditions and to offer an individualized neural circuit-based therapeutic
target based on the neural cause of a condition. To this end, researchers have
developed rs-fcMRI-based biomarkers and investigated a causal relationship
between potential biomarkers and disease-specific behavior using functional MRI
(fMRI)-based neurofeedback on functional connectivity. In this review, we
introduce recent approach for creating a theranostic biomarker, which consists
mainly of two parts: (i) developing an rs-fcMRI-based biomarker that can
predict diagnosis and/or symptoms with high accuracy, and (ii) the introduction
of a proof-of-concept study investigating the relationship between normalizing
the biomarker and symptom changes using fMRI-based neurofeedback. In parallel
with the introduction of recent studies, we review rs-fcMRI-based biomarker and
fMRI-based neurofeedback, focusing on the technological improvements and
limitations associated with clinical use.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Hard Problem of Consciousness: An Advance via a Novel Mathematical Approach. (arXiv:1704.01148v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01148</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01148</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental explanandum of the hard problem of consciousness concerns the
link between the physical and the phenomenal. That is to say, given that there
are such things as physical processes and conscious experience, what is it
about the particular physical processes (e.g. certain neural processes) that
entail instances of conscious experience that accounts for such entailment?
Building on the fundamental premises of property dualism, this paper speculates
that certain properties of the particular physical processes that entail
instances of conscious experience may obey mathematical laws pursuant to which
such properties have magnitudes that are numerically defined at most times (and
are thus physical properties at such times), but have magnitudes that are
numerically undefined, or &quot;irreducibly abstract,&quot; at other times (and can thus,
it is argued, be inferred to be phenomenal properties at such times). On this
view, a property can be instantiated as a physical property or a phenomenal
property depending on whether its mathematical representation is numerically
defined or irreducibly abstract, respectively, at a given time. This dynamic
forms the basis for a proposed bridge law that may account for the link between
the physical and the phenomenal and thus afford an advance concerning the hard
problem.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In previously identified forms of remote synchronization between two nodes,
the intermediate portion of the network connecting the two nodes is not
synchronized with them but generally exhibits some coherent dynamics. Here we
report on a network phenomenon we call incoherence-mediated remote
synchronization (IMRS), in which two non-contiguous parts of the network are
identically synchronized while the dynamics of the intermediate part is
statistically and information-theoretically incoherent. We identify mirror
symmetry in the network structure as a mechanism allowing for such behavior,
and show that IMRS is robust against dynamical noise as well as against
parameter changes. IMRS may underlie neuronal information processing and
potentially lead to network solutions for encryption key distribution and
secure communication.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Gr\&quot;obner Bases of Neural Ideals. (arXiv:1612.05660v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain processes information about the environment via neural codes. The
neural ideal was introduced recently as an algebraic object that can be used to
better understand the combinatorial structure of neural codes. Every neural
ideal has a particular generating set, called the canonical form, that directly
encodes a minimal description of the receptive field structure intrinsic to the
neural code. On the other hand, for a given monomial order, any polynomial
ideal is also generated by its unique (reduced) Gr\&quot;obner basis with respect to
that monomial order. How are these two types of generating sets -- canonical
forms and Gr\&quot;obner bases -- related? Our main result states that if the
canonical form of a neural ideal is a Gr\&quot;obner basis, then it is the universal
Gr\&quot;obner basis (that is, the union of all reduced Gr\&quot;obner bases).
Furthermore, we prove that this situation -- when the canonical form is a
Gr\&quot;obner basis -- occurs precisely when the universal Gr\&quot;obner basis contains
only pseudo-monomials (certain generalizations of monomials). Our results
motivate two questions: (1)~When is the canonical form a Gr\&quot;obner basis?
(2)~When the universal Gr\&quot;obner basis of a neural ideal is {\em not} a
canonical form, what can the non-pseudo-monomial elements in the basis tell us
about the receptive fields of the code? We give partial answers to both
questions. Along the way, we develop a representation of pseudo-monomials as
hypercubes in a Boolean lattice.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Post-transcriptional regulation of adult CNS axonal regeneration by Cpeb1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/125096v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/125096v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Adult mammalian CNS neurons are unable to regenerate following axonal injury, leading to permanent functional impairments. Yet, the reasons underlying this regeneration failure are not fully understood. Here, we study the transcriptome and proteome shortly after spinal cord injury. Profiling of the total and ribosome-bound RNA in injured and naive spinal cords identify a substantial post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. In particular, transcripts associated with nervous system development were downregulated in the total RNA-fraction while remaining stably loaded onto ribosomes. Interestingly, motif association analysis of posttranscriptionally regulated transcripts identified the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE) as enriched in a subset of these transcripts that was more resistant to injury-induced reduction at transcriptome level. Modulation of these transcripts by overexpression of the CPE binding protein, Cpeb1, in mouse and Drosophila CNS neurons promoted axonal regeneration following injury. Our study uncovers a global conserved post-transcriptional mechanism enhancing regeneration of injured CNS axons.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Burst Activation Of Dopamine Neurons Produces Prolonged Post-Burst Availability Of Actively Released Dopamine</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/125062v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/125062v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Both phasic and tonic modes of neurotransmission are implicated in critical functions assigned to dopamine. In learning, for example, sub-second phasic responses of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons to salient events serve as teaching signals, but learning is also interrupted by dopamine antagonists administered minutes after training. Our findings bridge the multiple timescales of dopamine neurotransmission by demonstrating that burst stimulation of VTA dopamine neurons produces a prolonged post-burst increase (&amp;gt; 20 min) of extracellular dopamine in nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex. This elevation is not due to spillover from the stimulation surge but depends on impulse flow-mediated dopamine release. We identified Rho-mediated internalization of dopamine transporter as a mechanism responsible for prolonged availability of actively released dopamine. These results demonstrate that phasic and tonic dopamine neurotransmission can be a continuum and may explain why both modes of signaling are critical for motivational and cognitive functions associated with dopamine.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/125039v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Humans can identify visual objects independently of view angle and lighting, words independently of volume and pitch, and smells independently of concentration. The computational principles underlying invariant object recognition remain mostly unknown. Here we propose that, in olfaction, a small and relatively stable set made of the earliest activated receptors forms a code for concentration invariant odor identity. One prediction of this &quot;primacy coding&quot; scheme is that decisions based on odor identity can be made solely using early odor-evoked neural activity. Using an optogenetic masking paradigm, we define the sensory integration time necessary for odor identification and demonstrate that animals can use information occurring &amp;lt;100 ms after inhalation onset to identify odors. Using multi-electrode array recordings of odor responses in the olfactory bulb, we find that concentration invariant units respond earliest and at latencies that are within this behaviorally-defined time window. We propose a computational model demonstrating how such a code can be read by neural circuits of the olfactory system.</description>

	<description>Estimates of functional connectivity using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) are acutely sensitive to artifacts and large scale nuisance variation. As a result much effort is dedicated to preprocessing rs-fMRI data and using diagnostic measure to identify bad scans. One such diagnostic measure is DVARS, the spatial standard deviation of the data after temporal differencing. A limitation of DVARS however is the lack of concrete interpretation of the absolute values of DVARS, and finding a threshold to distinguish bad scans from good. In this work we describe a variance decomposition of the entire 4D dataset that shows DVARS to be just one of three sources of variation we refer to as D-var, S-var and E-var. D-var and S-var partition the average variance between adjacent time points, while E-var accounts for edge effects, and each can be used to make spatial and temporal summary diagnostic measures. Extending the partitioning to global (and non-global) signal leads to a rs-fMRI DSE ANOVA table, which decomposes the total and global variance into fast (D-var), slow (S-var) and edge (E-var) components. We find expected values for each variance component under nominal models, showing how D-var (and thus DVARS) scales with overall variance and is diminished by temporal autocorrelation. Finally we propose a sampling distribution for squared DVARS (a multiple of D-var) and robust methods to estimate this null model, allowing computations of DVARS p-values. We propose that these diagnostic time series, images, p-values and ANOVA table will provide a succinct summary of the quality of a rs-fMRI dataset that will support comparisons of datasets over preprocessing steps and between subjects.</description>

	<description>Electric potential recorded at the scalp (EEG) is dominated by contributions from current dipoles set by active neurons in the cortex. Estimation of these currents, called  inverse modeling, requires a  forward model, which gives the potential when the positions, sizes, and directions of the current dipoles are known. Different models of varying complexity and realism are used in the field. An important analytical example is the four-sphere model which assumes a four-layered spherical head where the layers represent brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), skull, and scalp, respectively. This model has been used extensively in the analysis of EEG recordings. Since it is analytical, it can also serve as a benchmark against which numerical schemes, such as the Finite Element Method (FEM), can be tested. While conceptually clear, the mathematical expression for the scalp potentials in the four-sphere model is quite cumbersome, and we observed the formulas presented in the literature to contain errors. We here derive and present the correct analytical formulas for future reference. They are compared with the results of FEM simulations of four-sphere model. We also provide scripts for computing EEG potentials in this model with the correct analytical formula and using FEM.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/124750v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The ability to parse a complex auditory scene into perceptual objects is facilitated by a hierarchical auditory system. Successive stages in the hierarchy transform an auditory scene of multiple overlapping sources, from peripheral tonotopically-based representations in the auditory nerve, into perceptually distinct auditory-objects based representation in auditory cortex. Here, using magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from human subjects, we investigate how a complex acoustic scene consisting of multiple speech sources is represented in distinct hierarchical stages of auditory cortex. Using systems-theoretic methods of stimulus reconstruction, we show that the primary-like areas in auditory cortex contain dominantly spectro-temporal based representations of the entire auditory scene. Here, both attended and ignored speech streams are represented with almost equal fidelity, and a global representation of the full auditory scene with all its streams is a better candidate neural representation than that of individual streams being represented separately. In contrast, we also show that higher order auditory cortical areas represent the attended stream separately, and with significantly higher fidelity, than unattended streams. Furthermore, the unattended background streams are more faithfully represented as a single unsegregated background object rather than as separated objects. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the progression of the representations and processing of a complex acoustic scene up through the hierarchy of human auditory cortex.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/124677v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SWRs) represent irregularly occurring synchronous neuronal population events that are observed during phases of rest and slow wave sleep. SWR activity that follows learning involves sequential replay of training-associated neuronal assemblies and is critical for systems level memory consolidation. SWRs are initiated by CA2 or CA3 pyramidal cells and require initial excitation of CA1 pyramidal cells as well as subsequent participation of parvalbumin (PV) expressing fast spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons. These interneurons are relatively unique in that they represent the major neuronal cell type known to be surrounded by perineuronal nets (PNNs), lattice like structures composed of a hyaluronin backbone that surround the cell soma and proximal dendrites. Though the function of the PNN is not completely understood, previous studies suggest it may serve to localize glutamatergic input to synaptic contacts and thus influence the activity of ensheathed cells. Noting that FS PV interneurons impact the activity of pyramidal cells thought to initiate SWRs, and that their activity is critical to ripple expression, we examine the effects of PNN integrity on SWR activity in the hippocampus. Extracellular recordings from the stratum radiatum of 490 micron horizontal murine hippocampal hemisections demonstrate SWRs that occur spontaneously in CA1. As compared to vehicle, pretreatment (120 min) of paired hemislices with hyaluronidase, which cleaves the hyaluronin backbone of the PNN, decreases PNN integrity and increases SWR frequency. Pretreatment with chondroitinase, which cleaves PNN side chains, also increases SWR frequency. Together, these data contribute to an emerging appreciation of extracellular matrix as a regulator of neuronal plasticity and suggest that one function of mature perineuronal nets could be to modulate the frequency of SWR events.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Response Reversal During Top-Down Modulation In Cortical Circuits With Multiple Interneuron Types</title>

	<description>Pyramidal cells and interneurons expressing parvalbumin, somatostatin, or vasoactive intestinal peptide show cell type-specific connectivity patterns leading to a canonical microcircuit across cortex. Dissecting the dynamics of this microcircuit is essential to our understanding of the mammalian cortex. However, experiments recording from this circuit often report counterintuitive and seemingly contradictory findings. For example, the response of a V1 neural population to top-down behavioral modulation can reverse from positive to negative when the bottom-up thalamic input changes. We developed a theoretical framework to explain such response reversal, and we showed how this complex dynamics can emerge in circuits that possess two key features: the presence of multiple interneuron populations and a non-linear dependence between the input and output of the populations. Furthermore, we built a cortical circuit model and the comparison of our simulations with real data shows that our model reproduces the complex dynamics observed experimentally in mouse V1. Our explicit calculations allowed us to pinpoint the connections critical to response reversal, and to predict the existence of more types of complex dynamics that could be experimentally tested and the conditions to observe them.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Myoclonus epilepsy and ataxia due to KCNC1 mutation: Analysis of 20 cases and K+ channel properties</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24929</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24929</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To comprehensively describe the new syndrome of myoclonus epilepsy and ataxia due to potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) channel mutation (MEAK), including cellular electrophysiological characterization of observed clinical improvement with fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analysed clinical, electroclinical and neuroimaging data for twenty patients with MEAK due to recurrent KCNC1 p.R320H mutation. In vitro electrophysiological studies were conducted using whole cell patch clamp to explore biophysical properties of wild-type and mutant K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.1 channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms began between 3-15 years (median 9.5) with progressively severe myoclonus and rare tonic-clonic seizures. Ataxia was present early but quickly became overshadowed by myoclonus; ten patients were wheelchair-bound by late teenage. Mild cognitive decline occurred in half. Early death was not observed. EEG showed generalized spike and polyspike wave discharges with documented photosensitivity in most. Polygraphic EEG-EMG studies demonstrated a cortical origin for myoclonus and striking co-activation of agonist and antagonist muscles. MRI revealed symmetrical cerebellar atrophy, that appeared progressive, and a prominent corpus callosum. Unexpectedly, transient clinical improvement with fever was noted in six patients. To explore this, we performed high temperature in vitro recordings. At elevated temperatures there was a robust left-shift in activation of wild-type K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.1 increasing channel availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEAK has a relatively homogeneous presentation resembling Unverricht-Lundborg disease, despite the genetic and biological basis being quite different. A remarkable improvement with fever may be explained by the temperature-dependent left-shift in activation of wild-type K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.1 subunit containing channels that would counter the loss-of-function observed for mutant channels, highlighting KCNC1 as a potential target for precision therapeutics.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Randomized clinical trial of deep brain stimulation for post-stroke pain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24927</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24927</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: The experience with deep brain stimulation (DBS) for pain is largely based on uncontrolled studies targeting the somatosensory pathways, with mixed results. We hypothesized that targeting limbic neural pathways would modulate the affective sphere of pain and alleviate suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We conducted a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study of DBS targeting the ventral striatum/anterior limb of the internal capsule (VS/ALIC) in 10 patients with post-stroke pain syndrome. One month after bilateral DBS, patients were randomized to active DBS or sham for 3 months, followed by cross-over for another 3-month period. The primary endpoint was a ≥ 50% improvement in the Pain Disability Index in 50% of patients with active DBS compared to sham. This 6-month blinded phase was followed by an 18-month open-stimulation phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Nine participants completed randomization. Although this trial was negative for its primary and secondary endpoints, we did observe significant differences in multiple outcome measures related to the affective sphere of pain (e.g. Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Affective Pain Rating Index of the Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire). 14 serious adverse events were recorded and resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: VS/ALIC DBS to modulate the affective sphere of pain represents a paradigm shift in chronic pain management. While this exploratory study was negative for its primary endpoint, VS/ALIC DBS demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and statistically-significant improvements in multiple outcome measures related to the affective sphere of pain. Therefore, we believe these results justify further work in neuromodulation therapies targeting the affective sphere of pain. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Tailoring epilepsy surgery with fast ripples in the intra-operative electrocorticogram</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24928</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24928</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Intra-operative electrocorticography (ECoG) can be used to delineate the resection area in epilepsy surgery. High frequency oscillations (HFOs, 80-500Hz) seem better biomarkers for epileptogenic tissue than spikes. We studied how HFOs and spikes in combined pre- and post-resection ECoG predict surgical outcome in different tailoring approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We, retrospectively, marked HFOs, divided into fast ripples (FRs, 250-500Hz) and ripples (80-250Hz), and spikes in pre- and post-resection ECoG sampled at 2048 Hz in people with refractory focal epilepsy. We defined four groups of EEG-event occurrence: pre+post- (+/-), pre+post+ (+/+), pre-post+ (-/+) and pre-post- (-/-). We subcategorized three tailoring approaches: hippocampectomy with tailoring for neocortical involvement, lesionectomy of temporal lesions with tailoring for mesiotemporal involvement and lesionectomy with tailoring for surrounding neocortical involvement. We compared the percentage of resected pre-EEG-events, the time to recurrence and the different tailoring approaches to outcome (seizure-free versus recurrence).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We included 54 patients (median age 15.5y, 25 months follow-up, 30 seizure-free). The percentage of resected FRs, ripples or spikes in pre-ECoG did not predict outcome. The occurrence of FRs in post-ECoG, given FRs in pre-ECoG (+/-,+/+), predicted outcome (hazard ratio: 3.13 (CI=1.22-6.25); p=0.01). Seven out of eight patients without spikes in pre-ECoG were seizure-free. The highest predictive value for seizure recurrence was the presence of FRs in post-ECoG for all tailoring approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: FRs which persists before and after resection predict poor post-surgical outcome. These findings hold for different tailoring approaches. FRs can thus be used for tailoring epilepsy surgery with repeated intra-operative ECoG measurements. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Computation and measurement of cell decision making errors using single cell data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005436</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Iman Habibi, Raymond Cheong, Tomasz Lipniacki, Andre Levchenko, Effat S. Emamian, Ali Abdi&lt;/p&gt;

In this study a new computational method is developed to quantify decision making errors in cells, caused by noise and signaling failures. Analysis of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway which regulates the transcription factor Nuclear Factor κB (NF-κB) using this method identifies two types of incorrect cell decisions called &lt;i&gt;false alarm&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;miss&lt;/i&gt;. These two events represent, respectively, declaring a signal which is not present and missing a signal that does exist. Using single cell experimental data and the developed method, we compute false alarm and miss error probabilities in wild-type cells and provide a formulation which shows how they depend on the signal transduction noise level. We also show that in the presence of abnormalities in a cell, decision making processes can be significantly affected, compared to a wild-type cell, and the method is able to model and measure such effects. In the TNF—NF-κB pathway, the method computes and reveals changes in false alarm and miss probabilities in A20-deficient cells, caused by cell’s inability to inhibit TNF-induced NF-κB response. In biological terms, a higher false alarm metric in this abnormal TNF signaling system indicates perceiving more cytokine signals which in fact do not exist at the system input, whereas a higher miss metric indicates that it is highly likely to miss signals that actually exist. Overall, this study demonstrates the ability of the developed method for modeling cell decision making errors under normal and abnormal conditions, and in the presence of transduction noise uncertainty. Compared to the previously reported pathway capacity metric, our results suggest that the introduced decision error metrics characterize signaling failures more accurately. This is mainly because while capacity is a useful metric to study information transmission in signaling pathways, it does not capture the overlap between TNF-induced noisy response curves.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zL70rWy_1oQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mesoscale Architecture Shapes Initiation and Richness of Spontaneous Network Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/14/3972?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/14/3972?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous activity in the absence of external input, including propagating waves of activity, is a robust feature of neuronal networks &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. The neurophysiological and anatomical requirements for initiation and persistence of such activity, however, are poorly understood, as is their role in the function of neuronal networks. Computational network studies indicate that clustered connectivity may foster the generation, maintenance, and richness of spontaneous activity. Since this mesoscale architecture cannot be systematically modified in intact tissue, testing these predictions is impracticable &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we investigate how the mesoscale structure shapes spontaneous activity in generic networks of rat cortical neurons &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. In these networks, neurons spontaneously arrange into local clusters with high neurite density and form fasciculating long-range axons. We modified this structure by modulation of protein kinase C, an enzyme regulating neurite growth and cell migration. Inhibition of protein kinase C reduced neuronal aggregation and fasciculation of axons, i.e., promoted uniform architecture. Conversely, activation of protein kinase C promoted aggregation of neurons into clusters, local connectivity, and bundling of long-range axons. Supporting predictions from theory, clustered networks were more spontaneously active and generated diverse activity patterns. Neurons within clusters received stronger synaptic inputs and displayed increased membrane potential fluctuations. Intensified clustering promoted the initiation of synchronous bursting events but entailed incomplete network recruitment. Moderately clustered networks appear optimal for initiation and propagation of diverse patterns of activity. Our findings support a crucial role of the mesoscale architectures in the regulation of spontaneous activity dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Computational studies predict richer and persisting spatiotemporal patterns of spontaneous activity in neuronal networks with neuron clustering. To test this, we created networks of varying architecture &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Supporting these predictions, the generation and spatiotemporal patterns of propagation were most variable in networks with intermediate clustering and lowest in uniform networks. Grid-like clustering, on the other hand, facilitated spontaneous activity but led to degenerating patterns of propagation. Neurons outside clusters had weaker synaptic input than neurons within clusters, in which increased membrane potential fluctuations facilitated the initiation of synchronized spike activity. Our results thus show that the intermediate level organization of neuronal networks strongly influences the dynamics of their activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Truncated TrkB.T1-Mediated Astrocyte Dysfunction Contributes to Impaired Motor Function and Neuropathic Pain after Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/14/3956?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Following spinal cord injury (SCI), astrocytes demonstrate long-lasting reactive changes, which are associated with the persistence of neuropathic pain and motor dysfunction. We previously demonstrated that upregulation of trkB.T1, a truncated isoform of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor receptor (BDNF), contributes to gliosis after SCI, but little is known about the effects of trkB.T1 on the function of astrocytes. As trkB.T1 is the sole isoform of trkB receptors expressed on astrocytes, we examined the function of trkB.T1-driven astrocytes &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Immunohistochemistry showed that trkB.T1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were significantly upregulated 7 d after injury, with sustained elevation in white matter through 8 weeks. The latter increase was predominantly found in astrocytes. TrkB.T1 was also highly expressed by neurons and microglia/macrophages at 7 d after injury and declined by 8 weeks. RNA sequencing of cultured astrocytes derived from &lt;i&gt;trkB.T1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; (WT) and &lt;i&gt;trkB.T1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; (KO) mice revealed downregulation of migration and proliferation pathways in KO astrocytes. KO astrocytes also exhibited slower migration/proliferation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; in response to FBS or BDNF compared with WT astrocytes. Reduced proliferation of astrocytes was also confirmed after SCI in astrocyte-specific &lt;i&gt;trkB.T1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice; using mechanical allodynia and pain-related measurements on the CatWalk, these animals also showed reduced hyperpathic responses, along with improved motor coordination. Together, our data indicate that trkB.T1 in astrocytes contributes to neuropathic pain and neurological dysfunction following SCI, suggesting that trkB.T1 may provide a novel therapeutic target for SCI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury (SCI) may in part be caused by upregulation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor trkB.T1, a truncated isoform of BDNF. TrkB.T1 is the only isoform of tropomyosin-related receptor kinase type B (trkB) receptors expressed on astrocytes. Here, we showed that trkB.T1 is significantly increased in the injured mouse spinal cord, where it is predominantly found in astrocytes. RNA sequencing of cultured astrocytes demonstrated downregulation of migration and proliferation pathways in &lt;i&gt;trkB.T1&lt;/i&gt; KO astrocytes. This was validated &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, where deletion of &lt;i&gt;trkB.T1&lt;/i&gt; in astrocytes reduced cell proliferation and migration. After SCI, astrocyte-specific &lt;i&gt;trkB.T1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice showed reduced hyperpathic responses and improved motor coordination. Therefore, the trkB.T1 receptor plays a significant pathophysiological role after SCI, and may provide a novel therapeutic target for SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dendritic GIRK Channels Gate the Integration Window, Plateau Potentials, and Induction of Synaptic Plasticity in Dorsal But Not Ventral CA1 Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/14/3940?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/14/3940?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Studies comparing neuronal activity at the dorsal and ventral poles of the hippocampus have shown that the scale of spatial information increases and the precision with which space is represented declines from the dorsal to ventral end. These dorsoventral differences in neuronal output and spatial representation could arise due to differences in computations performed by dorsal and ventral CA1 neurons. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by quantifying the differences in dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity between dorsal and ventral CA1 pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampus. Using a combination of somatic and dendritic patch-clamp recordings, we show that the threshold for LTP induction is higher in dorsal CA1 neurons and that a G-protein-coupled inward-rectifying potassium channel mediated regulation of dendritic plateau potentials and dendritic excitability underlies this gating. By contrast, similar regulation of LTP is absent in ventral CA1 neurons. Additionally, we show that generation of plateau potentials and LTP induction in dorsal CA1 neurons depends on the coincident activation of Schaffer collateral and temporoammonic inputs at the distal apical dendrites. The ventral CA1 dendrites, however, can generate plateau potentials in response to temporally dispersed excitatory inputs. Overall, our results highlight the dorsoventral differences in dendritic computation that could account for the dorsoventral differences in spatial representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The dorsal and ventral parts of the hippocampus encode spatial information at very different scales. Whereas the place-specific firing fields are small and precise at the dorsal end of the hippocampus, neurons at the ventral end have comparatively larger place fields. Here, we show that the dorsal CA1 neurons have a higher threshold for LTP induction and require coincident timing of excitatory synaptic inputs for the generation of dendritic plateau potentials. By contrast, ventral CA1 neurons can integrate temporally dispersed inputs and have a lower threshold for LTP. Together, these dorsoventral differences in the threshold for LTP induction could account for the differences in scale of spatial representation at the dorsal and ventral ends of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Glycoside Oleandrin Reduces Glioma Growth with Direct and Indirect Effects on Tumor Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/14/3926?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/14/3926?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Oleandrin is a glycoside that inhibits the ubiquitous enzyme Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase. In addition to its known effects on cardiac muscle, recent &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; evidence highlighted its potential for anticancer properties. Here, we evaluated for the first time the effect of oleandrin on brain tumors. To this aim, mice were transplanted with human or murine glioma and analyzed for tumor progression upon oleandrin treatment. In both systems, oleandrin impaired glioma development, reduced tumor size, and inhibited cell proliferation. We demonstrated that oleandrin does the following: (1) enhances the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level in the brain; (2) reduces both microglia/macrophage infiltration and CD68 immunoreactivity in the tumor mass; (3) decreases astrogliosis in peritumoral area; and (4) reduces glioma cell infiltration in healthy parenchyma. In BDNF-deficient mice (bdnftm1Jae/J) and in glioma cells silenced for TrkB receptor expression, oleandrin was not effective, indicating a crucial role for BDNF in oleandrin's protective and antitumor functions. In addition, we found that oleandrin increases survival of temozolomide-treated mice. These results encourage the development of oleandrin as possible coadjuvant agent in clinical trials of glioma treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In this work, we paved the road for a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of brain tumors, demonstrating the potential of using the cardioactive glycoside oleandrin as a coadjuvant drug to standard chemotherapeutics such as temozolomide. In murine models of glioma, we demonstrated that oleandrin significantly increased mouse survival and reduced tumor growth both directly on tumor cells and indirectly by promoting an antitumor brain microenvironment with a key protective role played by the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Architecture for Feature Binding in Visual Working Memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/14/3913?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/14/3913?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Binding refers to the operation that groups different features together into objects. We propose a neural architecture for feature binding in visual working memory that employs populations of neurons with conjunction responses. We tested this model using cued recall tasks, in which subjects had to memorize object arrays composed of simple visual features (color, orientation, and location). After a brief delay, one feature of one item was given as a cue, and the observer had to report, on a continuous scale, one or two other features of the cued item. Binding failure in this task is associated with swap errors, in which observers report an item other than the one indicated by the cue. We observed that the probability of swapping two items strongly correlated with the items' similarity in the cue feature dimension, and found a strong correlation between swap errors occurring in spatial and nonspatial report. The neural model explains both swap errors and response variability as results of decoding noisy neural activity, and can account for the behavioral results in quantitative detail. We then used the model to compare alternative mechanisms for binding nonspatial features. We found the behavioral results fully consistent with a model in which nonspatial features are bound exclusively via their shared location, with no indication of direct binding between color and orientation. These results provide evidence for a special role of location in feature binding, and the model explains how this special role could be realized in the neural system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The problem of feature binding is of central importance in understanding the mechanisms of working memory. How do we remember not only that we saw a red and a round object, but that these features belong together to a single object rather than to different objects in our environment? Here we present evidence for a neural mechanism for feature binding in working memory, based on encoding of visual information by neurons that respond to the conjunction of features. We find clear evidence that nonspatial features are bound via space: we memorize directly where a color or an orientation appeared, but we memorize which color belonged with which orientation only indirectly by virtue of their shared location.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Nonlinear Modulation of Cutaneous Reflexes with Increasing Speed of Locomotion in Spinal Cats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/14/3896?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cutaneous reflexes are important for responding rapidly to perturbations, correcting limb trajectory, and strengthening support. During locomotion, they are modulated by phase to generate functionally appropriate responses. The goal of the present study was to determine whether cutaneous reflexes and their phase-dependent modulation are altered with increasing speed and if this is accomplished at the spinal level. Four adult cats that recovered stable hindlimb locomotion after spinal transection were implanted with electrodes to record hindlimb muscle activity chronically and to stimulate the superficial peroneal nerve electrically to evoke cutaneous reflexes. The speed-dependent modulation of cutaneous reflexes was assessed by evoking and characterizing ipsilateral and contralateral responses in semitendinosus, vastus lateralis, and lateral gastrocnemius muscles at four treadmill speeds: 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 m/s. The amplitudes of ipsilateral and contralateral responses were largest at intermediate speeds of 0.4 and 0.6 m/s, followed by the slowest and fastest speeds of 0.2 and 0.8 m/s, respectively. The phase-dependent modulation of reflexes was maintained across speeds, with ipsilateral and contralateral responses peaking during the stance-to-swing transition and swing phase of the ipsilateral limb or midstance of the contralateral limb. Reflex modulation across speeds also correlated with the spatial symmetry of the locomotor pattern, but not with temporal symmetry. That the cutaneous reflex amplitude in all muscles was similarly modulated with increasing speed independently of the background level of muscle activity is consistent with a generalized premotoneuronal spinal control mechanism that could help to stabilize the locomotor pattern when changing speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When walking, receptors located in the skin respond to mechanical pressure and send signals to the CNS to correct the trajectory of the limb and to reinforce weight support. These signals produce different responses, or reflexes, if they occur when the foot is contacting the ground or in the air. This is known as phase-dependent modulation of reflexes. However, when walking at faster speeds, we do not know if and how these reflexes are changed. In the present study, we show that reflexes from the skin are modulated with speed and that this is controlled at the level of the spinal cord. This modulation could be important in preventing sensory signals from destabilizing the walking pattern.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: SCRAPPER Selectively Contributes to Spontaneous Release and Presynaptic Long-Term Potentiation in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;SCRAPPER is an E3 ubiquitin ligase expressed in presynaptic terminals, neural cell body, and dendrites of the hippocampus and cortex, which is coded by the &lt;i&gt;FBXL20&lt;/i&gt; gene. SCRAPPER is known to regulate synaptic transmissions and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, but no report is available for the cortex. Here we show genetic evidence for critical roles of SCRAPPER in excitatory transmission and presynaptic LTP (pre-LTP) of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a critical cortical region for pain, anxiety, and fear. Miniature and spontaneous releases, but not evoked release, of glutamate were significantly increased in SCRAPPER knock-out (SCR-KO) mice. Interestingly, SCRAPPER selectively contributes to the increases of frequency and amplitude. The pre-LTP in the ACC was completely blocked in SCR-KO mice. Our results thus provide direct evidence for SCRAPPER in both spontaneous release and pre-LTP in the ACC and reveal a potential novel target for treating anxiety-related disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays critical roles in pain, anxiety, and fear. Peripheral injury induces long-term changes in synaptic transmission in the ACC. Our recent study found that a presynaptic form of LTP (pre-LTP) in the ACC contributes to chronic pain-induced anxiety. Here, we show that SCRAPPER plays a critical role in ACC pre-LTP as well as synaptic transmission.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Leptin Signaling in AgRP Neurons Modulates Puberty Onset and Adult Fertility in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/14/3875?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The hormone leptin indirectly communicates metabolic information to brain neurons that control reproduction, using GABAergic circuitry. Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus are GABAergic, express leptin receptors (LepR), and are known to influence reproduction. This study tested whether leptin actions on AgRP neurons are required and sufficient for puberty onset and subsequent fertility. First, &lt;i&gt;Agrp-&lt;/i&gt;Cre and &lt;i&gt;Lepr-&lt;/i&gt;flox mice were used to target deletion of LepR to AgRP neurons. AgRP-LepR knock-out female mice exhibited mild obesity and adiposity as described previously, as well as a significant delay in the pubertal onset of estrous cycles compared with control animals. No significant differences in male puberty onset or adult fecundity in either sex were observed. Next, mice with a floxed polyadenylation signal causing premature transcriptional termination of the &lt;i&gt;Lepr&lt;/i&gt; gene were crossed with AgRP-Cre mice to generate mice with AgRP neuron-specific rescue of LepR. Lepr-null control males and females were morbidly obese and exhibited delayed puberty onset, no evidence of estrous cycles, and minimal fecundity. Remarkably, AgRP-LepR rescue partially or fully restored all of these reproductive attributes to levels similar to those of LepR-intact controls despite minimal rescue of metabolic function. These results indicate that leptin signaling in AgRP neurons is sufficient for puberty onset and normal adult fecundity in both sexes when leptin signaling is absent in all other cells and that in females, the absence of AgRP neuron leptin signaling delays puberty. These actions appear to be independent of leptin's metabolic effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sexual maturation and fertility are dispensable at the individual level but critical for species survival. Conditions such as nutritional imbalance may therefore suppress puberty onset and fertility in an individual. In societies characterized by widespread obesity, the sensitivity of reproduction to metabolic imbalance has significant public health implications. Deficient leptin signaling attributable to diet-induced leptin resistance is associated with infertility in humans and rodents, and treatments for human infertility show a decreased success rate with increasing body mass index. Here we show that the transmission of metabolic information to the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis is mediated by leptin receptors on AgRP neurons. These results provide conclusive new insights into the mechanisms that cause infertility attributable to malnourishment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Rapid Subcortical Amygdala Route for Faces Irrespective of Spatial Frequency and Emotion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/14/3864?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/14/3864?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is significant controversy over the existence and function of a direct subcortical visual pathway to the amygdala. It is thought that this pathway rapidly transmits low spatial frequency information to the amygdala independently of the cortex, and yet the directionality of this function has never been determined. We used magnetoencephalography to measure neural activity while human participants discriminated the gender of neutral and fearful faces filtered for low or high spatial frequencies. We applied dynamic causal modeling to demonstrate that the most likely underlying neural network consisted of a pulvinar-amygdala connection that was uninfluenced by spatial frequency or emotion, and a cortical-amygdala connection that conveyed high spatial frequencies. Crucially, data-driven neural simulations revealed a clear temporal advantage of the subcortical connection over the cortical connection in influencing amygdala activity. Thus, our findings support the existence of a rapid subcortical pathway that is nonselective in terms of the spatial frequency or emotional content of faces. We propose that that the &quot;coarseness&quot; of the subcortical route may be better reframed as &quot;generalized.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The human amygdala coordinates how we respond to biologically relevant stimuli, such as threat or reward. It has been postulated that the amygdala first receives visual input via a rapid subcortical route that conveys &quot;coarse&quot; information, namely, low spatial frequencies. For the first time, the present paper provides direction-specific evidence from computational modeling that the subcortical route plays a generalized role in visual processing by rapidly transmitting raw, unfiltered information directly to the amygdala. This calls into question a widely held assumption across human and animal research that fear responses are produced faster by low spatial frequencies. Our proposed mechanism suggests organisms quickly generate fear responses to a wide range of visual properties, heavily implicating future research on anxiety-prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: HDAC7 Ubiquitination by the E3 Ligase CBX4 Is Involved in Contextual Fear Conditioning Memory Formation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Histone acetylation, an epigenetic modification, plays an important role in long-term memory formation. Recently, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors were demonstrated to promote memory formation, which raises the intriguing possibility that they may be used to rescue memory deficits. However, additional research is necessary to clarify the roles of individual HDACs in memory. In this study, we demonstrated that HDAC7, within the dorsal hippocampus of C57BL6J mice, had a late and persistent decrease after contextual fear conditioning (CFC) training (4–24 h), which was involved in long-term CFC memory formation. We also showed that HDAC7 decreased via ubiquitin-dependent degradation. CBX4 was one of the HDAC7 E3 ligases involved in this process. Nur77, as one of the target genes of HDAC7, increased 6–24 h after CFC training and, accordingly, modulated the formation of CFC memory. Finally, HDAC7 was involved in the formation of other hippocampal-dependent memories, including the Morris water maze and object location test. The current findings facilitate an understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of HDAC7 in the regulation of hippocampal-dependent memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The current findings demonstrated the effects of histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) on hippocampal-dependent memories. Moreover, we determined the mechanism of decreased HDAC7 in contextual fear conditioning (CFC) through ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. We also verified that CBX4 was one of the HDAC7 E3 ligases. Finally, we demonstrated that Nur77, as one of the important targets for HDAC7, was involved in CFC memory formation. All of these proteins, including HDAC7, CBX4, and Nur77, could be potential therapeutic targets for preventing memory deficits in aging and neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Static Magnetic Field Stimulation over Parietal Cortex Enhances Somatosensory Detection in Humans</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The role of neuronal oscillations in human somatosensory perception is currently unclear. To address this, here we use noninvasive brain stimulation to artificially modulate cortical network dynamics in the context of neurophysiological and behavioral recordings. We demonstrate that transcranial static magnetic field stimulation (tSMS) over the somatosensory parietal cortex increases oscillatory power specifically in the alpha range, without significantly affecting bottom-up thalamocortical inputs indexed by the early cortical component of somatosensory evoked potentials. Critically, we next show that parietal tSMS enhances the detection of near-threshold somatosensory stimuli. Interestingly, this behavioral improvement reflects a decrease of habituation to somatosensation. Our data therefore provide causal evidence that somatosensory perception depends on parietal alpha activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Artificially increasing alpha power by placing a powerful magnetic field over the somatosensory cortex overcomes the natural decline in detection probability of a repeated near-threshold sensory stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Axonal Degeneration in Retinal Ganglion Cells Is Associated with a Membrane Polarity-Sensitive Redox Process</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/14/3824?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Axonal degeneration is a pathophysiological mechanism common to several neurodegenerative diseases. The slow Wallerian degeneration (Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;) mutation, which results in reduced axonal degeneration in the central and peripheral nervous systems, has provided insight into a redox-dependent mechanism by which axons undergo self-destruction. We studied early molecular events in axonal degeneration with single-axon laser axotomy and time-lapse imaging, monitoring the initial changes in transected axons of purified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from wild-type and Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; rat retinas using a polarity-sensitive annexin-based biosensor (annexin B12-Cys101,Cys260-N,N'-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N'-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) ethylenediamine). Transected axons demonstrated a rapid and progressive change in membrane phospholipid polarity, manifested as phosphatidylserine externalization, which was significantly delayed and propagated more slowly in axotomized Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; RGCs compared with wild-type axons. Delivery of bis(3-propionic acid methyl ester)phenylphosphine borane complex, a cell-permeable intracellular disulfide-reducing drug, slowed the onset and velocity of phosphatidylserine externalization in wild-type axons significantly, replicating the Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype, whereas extracellular redox modulation reversed the Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype. These findings are consistent with an intra-axonal redox mechanism for axonal degeneration associated with the initiation and propagation of phosphatidylserine externalization after axotomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Axonal degeneration is a neuronal process independent of somal apoptosis, the propagation of which is unclear. We combined single-cell laser axotomy with time-lapse imaging to study the dynamics of phosphatidylserine externalization immediately after axonal injury in purified retinal ganglion cells. The extension of phosphatidylserine externalization was slowed and delayed in Wallerian degeneration slow (Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;) axons and this phenotype could be reproduced by intra-axonal disulfide reduction in wild-type axons and reversed by extra-axonal reduction in Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; axons. These results are consistent with a redox mechanism for propagation of membrane polarity asymmetry in axonal degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Electrophysiological Evidence for Hyperfocusing of Spatial Attention in Schizophrenia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/14/3813?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/14/3813?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A recently proposed hyperfocusing hypothesis of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia proposes that people with schizophrenia (PSZ) tend to concentrate processing resources more narrowly but more intensely than healthy control subjects (HCS). The present study tests a key prediction of this hypothesis, namely, that PSZ will hyperfocus on information presented at the center of gaze. This should lead to greater filtering of peripheral stimuli when the task requires focusing centrally but reduced filtering of central stimuli when the task requires attending broadly in the periphery. These predictions were tested in a double oddball paradigm, in which frequent standard stimuli and rare oddball stimuli were presented at central and peripheral locations while event-related potentials were recorded. Participants were instructed to discriminate between the standard and oddball stimuli at either the central location or at the peripheral locations. PSZ and HCS showed opposite patterns of spatial bias at the level of early sensory processing, as assessed with the P1 component: PSZ exhibited stronger sensory suppression of peripheral stimuli when the task required attending narrowly to the central location, whereas HCS exhibited stronger sensory suppression of central stimuli when the task required attending broadly to the peripheral locations. Moreover, PSZ exhibited a stronger stimulus categorization response than HCS, as assessed with the P3b component, for central stimuli when the task required attending to the peripheral region. These results provide strong evidence of hyperfocusing in PSZ, which may provide a unified mechanistic account of multiple aspects of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Schizophrenia clearly involves impaired attention, but attention is complex, and delineating the precise nature of attentional dysfunction in schizophrenia has been difficult. The present study tests a new hyperfocusing hypothesis, which proposes that people with schizophrenia (PSZ) tend to concentrate processing resources more intensely but more narrowly than healthy control subjects (HCS). Using electrophysiological measures of sensory and cognitive processing, we found that PSZ were actually superior to HCS in focusing attention at the point of gaze and filtering out peripheral distractors when the task required a narrow focusing of attention. This finding of superior filtering in PSZ supports the hyperfocusing hypothesis, which may provide the mechanism underlying a broad range of cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Enduring Memory Impairments Provoked by Developmental Febrile Seizures Are Mediated by Functional and Structural Effects of Neuronal Restrictive Silencing Factor</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In a subset of children experiencing prolonged febrile seizures (FSs), the most common type of childhood seizures, cognitive outcomes are compromised. However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we identified significant, enduring spatial memory problems in male rats following experimental prolonged FS (febrile status epilepticus; eFSE). Remarkably, these deficits were abolished by transient, &lt;i&gt;post hoc&lt;/i&gt; interference with the chromatin binding of the transcriptional repressor neuron restrictive silencing factor (NRSF or REST). This transcriptional regulator is known to contribute to neuronal differentiation during development and to programmed gene expression in mature neurons. The mechanisms of the eFSE-provoked memory problems involved complex disruption of memory-related hippocampal oscillations recorded from CA1, likely resulting in part from impairments of dendritic filtering of cortical inputs as well as abnormal synaptic function. Accordingly, eFSE provoked region-specific dendritic loss in the hippocampus, and aberrant generation of excitatory synapses in dentate gyrus granule cells. Blocking NRSF transiently after eFSE prevented granule cell dysmaturation, restored a functional balance of -band network oscillations, and allowed treated eFSE rats to encode and retrieve spatial memories. Together, these studies provide novel insights into developing networks that underlie memory, the mechanisms by which early-life seizures influence them, and the means to abrogate the ensuing cognitive problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Whereas seizures have been the central focus of epilepsy research, they are commonly accompanied by cognitive problems, including memory impairments that contribute to poor quality of life. These deficits often arise before the onset of spontaneous seizures, or independent from them, yet the mechanisms involved are unclear. Here, using a rodent model of common developmental seizures that provoke epilepsy in a subset of individuals, we identify serious consequent memory problems. We uncover molecular, cellular, and circuit-level mechanisms that underlie these deficits and successfully abolish them by targeted therapeutic interventions. These findings may be important for understanding and preventing cognitive problems in individuals suffering long febrile seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Predicting future reward is paramount to performing an optimal action. Although a number of brain areas are known to encode such predictions, a detailed account of how the associated representations evolve over time is lacking. Here, we address this question using human magnetoencephalography (MEG) and multivariate analyses of instantaneous activity in reconstructed sources. We overtrained participants on a simple instrumental reward learning task where geometric cues predicted a distribution of possible rewards, from which a sample was revealed 2000 ms later. We show that predicted mean reward (i.e., expected value), and predicted reward variability (i.e., economic risk), are encoded distinctly. Early on, representations of mean reward are seen in parietal and visual areas, and later in frontal regions with orbitofrontal cortex emerging last. Strikingly, an encoding of reward variability emerges simultaneously in parietal/sensory and frontal sources and later than mean reward encoding. An orbitofrontal variability encoding emerged around the same time as that seen for mean reward. Crucially, cross-prediction showed that mean reward and variability representations are distinct and also revealed that instantaneous representations become more stable over time. Across sources, the best fitting metric for variability signals was coefficient of variation (rather than SD or variance), but distinct best metrics were seen for individual brain regions. Our data demonstrate how a dynamic encoding of probabilistic reward prediction unfolds in the brain both in time and space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Predicting future reward is paramount to optimal behavior. To gain insight into the underlying neural computations, we investigate how reward representations in the brain arise over time. Using magnetoencephalography, we show that a representation of predicted mean reward emerges early in parietal/sensory regions and later in frontal cortex. In contrast, predicted reward variability representations appear in most regions at the same time, and slightly later than for mean reward. For both features, representations dynamically change &amp;gt;1000 ms before stabilizing. The best metric for encoding variability is coefficient of variation, with heterogeneity in this encoding seen between brain areas. The results provide novel insights into the emergence of predictive reward representations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Plasminogen Deficiency Delays the Onset and Protects from Demyelination and Paralysis in Autoimmune Neuroinflammatory Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory, demyelinating disease of the CNS. Fibrinogen deposition at sites of blood–brain barrier breakdown is a prominent feature of neuroinflammatory disease and contributes to disease severity. Plasminogen, the primary fibrinolytic enzyme, also modifies inflammatory processes. We used a murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), to evaluate the hypothesis that the loss of plasminogen would exacerbate neuroinflammatory disease. However, contrary to initial expectations, EAE-challenged plasminogen-deficient (Plg&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;) mice developed significantly delayed disease onset and reduced disease severity compared with wild-type (Plg&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) mice. Similarly, pharmacologic inhibition of plasmin activation with tranexamic acid also delayed disease onset. The T-cell response to immunization was similar between genotypes, suggesting that the contribution of plasminogen was downstream of the T-cell response. Spinal cords from EAE-challenged Plg&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; mice demonstrated significantly decreased demyelination and microglial/macrophage accumulation compared with Plg&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Although fibrinogen-deficient mice or mice with combined deficiencies of plasminogen and fibrinogen had decreased EAE severity, they did not exhibit the delay in EAE disease onset, as seen in mice with plasminogen deficiency alone. Together, these data suggest that plasminogen and plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis is a key modifier of the onset of neuroinflammatory demyelination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Multiple sclerosis is a severe, chronic, demyelinating disease. Understanding the pathobiology related to the autoreactive T-cell and microglial/macrophage demyelinating response is critical to effectively target therapeutics. We describe for the first time that deficiency of plasminogen, the key fibrinolytic enzyme, delays disease onset and protects from the development of the paralysis associated with a murine model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Administration of a widely used, pharmacologic inhibitor of plasminogen activation, tranexamic acid, also delays the onset of neuroinflammation associated with EAE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Locomotion Enhances Neural Encoding of Visual Stimuli in Mouse V1</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) are selective for particular properties of visual stimuli. Locomotion causes a change in cortical state that leaves their selectivity unchanged but strengthens their responses. Both locomotion and the change in cortical state are thought to be initiated by projections from the mesencephalic locomotor region, the latter through a disinhibitory circuit in V1. By recording simultaneously from a large number of single neurons in alert mice viewing moving gratings, we investigated the relationship between locomotion and the information contained within the neural population. We found that locomotion improved encoding of visual stimuli in V1 by two mechanisms. First, locomotion-induced increases in firing rates enhanced the mutual information between visual stimuli and single neuron responses over a fixed window of time. Second, stimulus discriminability was improved, even for fixed population firing rates, because of a decrease in noise correlations across the population. These two mechanisms contributed differently to improvements in discriminability across cortical layers, with changes in firing rates most important in the upper layers and changes in noise correlations most important in layer V. Together, these changes resulted in a threefold to fivefold reduction in the time needed to precisely encode grating direction and orientation. These results support the hypothesis that cortical state shifts during locomotion to accommodate an increased load on the visual system when mice are moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This paper contains three novel findings about the representation of information in neurons within the primary visual cortex of the mouse. First, we show that locomotion reduces by at least a factor of 3 the time needed for information to accumulate in the visual cortex that allows the distinction of different visual stimuli. Second, we show that the effect of locomotion is to increase information in cells of all layers of the visual cortex. Third, we show that the means by which information is enhanced by locomotion differs between the upper layers, where the major effect is the increasing of firing rates, and in layer V, where the major effect is the reduction in noise correlations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Compartmentalized cGMP Responses of Olfactory Sensory Neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) plays a crucial role as a second messenger in the regulation of sensory signal transduction in many organisms. In AWC olfactory sensory neurons of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, cGMP also has essential and distinctive functions in olfactory sensation and adaptation. According to molecular genetic studies, when nematodes are exposed to odorants, a decrease in cGMP regulates cGMP-gated channels for olfactory sensation. Conversely, for olfactory adaptation, an increase in cGMP activates protein kinase G to modulate cellular physiological functions. Although these opposing cGMP responses in single neurons may occur at the same time, it is unclear how cGMP actually behaves in AWC sensory neurons. A hypothetical explanation for opposing cGMP responses is region-specific behaviors in AWC: for odor sensation, cGMP levels in cilia could decrease, whereas odor adaptation is mediated by increased cGMP levels in soma. Therefore, we visualized intracellular cGMP in AWC with a genetically encoded cGMP indicator, cGi500, and examined spatiotemporal cGMP responses in AWC neurons. The cGMP imaging showed that, after odor exposure, cGMP levels in AWC cilia decreased transiently, whereas levels in dendrites and soma gradually increased. These region-specific responses indicated that the cGMP responses in AWC neurons are explicitly compartmentalized. In addition, we performed Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging to examine the relationship between cGMP and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. These results suggested that AWC sensory neurons are in fact analogous to vertebrate photoreceptor neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A PTEN-Regulated Checkpoint Controls Surface Delivery of {delta} Opioid Receptors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/14/3741?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The  opioid receptor (R) is a promising alternate target for pain management because R agonists show decreased abuse potential compared with current opioid analgesics that target the μ opioid receptor. A critical limitation in developing R as an analgesic target, however, is that R agonists show relatively low efficacy &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, requiring the use of high doses that often cause adverse effects, such as convulsions. Here we tested whether intracellular retention of R in sensory neurons contributes to this low R agonist efficacy &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by limiting surface R expression. Using direct visualization of R trafficking and localization, we define a phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-regulated checkpoint that retains R in the Golgi and decreases surface delivery in rat and mice sensory neurons. PTEN inhibition releases R from this checkpoint and stimulates delivery of exogenous and endogenous R to the neuronal surface both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. PTEN inhibition &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; increases the percentage of TG neurons expressing R on the surface and allows efficient R-mediated antihyperalgesia in mice. Together, we define a critical role for PTEN in regulating the surface delivery and bioavailability of the R, explain the low efficacy of R agonists &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, and provide evidence that active R relocation is a viable strategy to increase R antinociception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Opioid analgesics, such as morphine, which target the μ opioid receptor (μR), have been the mainstay of pain management, but their use is highly limited by adverse effects and their variable efficacy in chronic pain. Identifying alternate analgesic targets is therefore of great significance. Although the  opioid receptor (R) is an attractive option, a critical limiting factor in developing R as a target has been the low efficacy of R agonists. Why R agonists show low efficacy is still under debate. This study provides mechanistic and functional data that intracellular localization of R in neurons is a key factor that contributes to low agonist efficacy, and presents a proof of mechanism that relocating R improves efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Identifying melancholic depression biomarker using whole-brain functional connectivity. (arXiv:1704.01039v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01039</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01039</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;By focusing on melancholic features with biological homogeneity, this study
aimed to identify a small number of critical functional connections (FCs) that
were specific only to the melancholic type of MDD. On the resting-state fMRI
data, classifiers were developed to differentiate MDD patients from healthy
controls (HCs). The classification accuracy was improved from 50 % (93 MDD and
93 HCs) to 70% (66 melancholic MDD and 66 HCs), when we specifically focused on
the melancholic MDD with moderate or severer level of depressive symptoms. It
showed 65% accuracy for the independent validation cohort. The biomarker score
distribution showed improvements with escitalopram treatments, and also showed
significant correlations with depression symptom scores. This classifier was
specific to melancholic MDD, and it did not generalize in other mental
disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD, 54% accuracy) and
schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD, 45% accuracy). Among the identified 12
FCs from 9,316 FCs between whole brain anatomical node pairs, the left DLPFC /
IFG region, which has most commonly been targeted for depression treatments,
and its functional connections between Precuneus / PCC, and between right DLPFC
/ SMA areas had the highest contributions. Given the heterogeneity of the MDD,
focusing on the melancholic features is the key to achieve high classification
accuracy. The identified FCs specifically predicted the melancholic MDD and
associated with subjective depressive symptoms. These results suggested key FCs
of melancholic depression, and open doors to novel treatments targeting these
regions in the future.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Seeds Cleansing CNMF for Spatiotemporal Neural Signals Extraction of Miniscope Imaging Data. (arXiv:1704.00793v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00793</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00793</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Miniscope calcium imaging is increasingly being used to monitor large
populations of neuronal activities in freely behaving animals. However, due to
the high background and low signal-to-noise ratio of the single-photon based
imaging used in this technique, extraction of neural signals from the large
numbers of imaged cells automatically has remained challenging. Here we
describe a highly accurate framework for automatically identifying activated
neurons and extracting calcium signals from the miniscope imaging data, seeds
cleansing Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (sc-CNMF). This sc-CNMF
extends the conventional CNMF with two new modules: i) a neural enhancing
module to overcome miniscope-specific limitations, and ii) a seeds cleansing
module combining LSTM to rigorously select and cleanse the set of seeds for
detecting regions-of-interest. Our sc-CNMF yields highly stable and superior
performance in analyzing miniscope calcium imaging data compared to existing
methods.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While the channel capacity reflects a theoretical upper bound on the
achievable information transmission rate in the limit of infinitely many bits,
it does not characterise the information transfer of a given encoding routine
with finitely many bits. In this note, we characterise the quality of a code
(i. e. a given encoding routine) by an upper bound on the expected minimum
error probability that can be achieved when using this code. We show that for
equientropic channels this upper bound is minimal for codes with maximal
marginal entropy. As an instructive example we show for the additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel that random coding---also a capacity achieving
code---indeed maximises the marginal entropy in the limit of infinite messages.

	<description>Memories of experiences are stored in the cerebral cortex. Sleep is critical for the consolidation of hippocampal memory of wake experiences into the neocortex. Understanding representations of neural codes of hippocampal–neocortical networks during sleep would reveal important circuit mechanisms in memory consolidation and provide novel insights into memory and dreams. Although sleep-associated ensemble spike activity has been investigated, identifying the content of memory in sleep remains challenging.</description>

	<description>Jiang et al. demonstrate that odor elicits theta activity within human piriform cortex. Additionally, the time-frequency dynamics of piriform can decode odor content within the first few hundred milliseconds of sampling. Finally, presence of odor promotes piriform-hippocampal theta phase locking.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Beyond the labeled line: variation in visual reference frames from intraparietal cortex to frontal eye fields and the superior colliculus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/124628v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/124628v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We accurately perceive the locations of visual stimuli despite the fact that our eyes move roughly three times per second. The neural computations that underlie this ability require incorporation of eye position and retinal information. Here, we assessed how single neurons do this in three interconnected structures: the frontal eye fields (FEF), the parietal cortex (LIP/MIP), and the superior colliculus (SC). Head-restrained monkeys performed visually-guided saccades from different initial eye fixations. By comparing visual responses across eye positions, we quantified whether the receptive fields were in eye-centered, head-centered, or hybrid coordinates. As previously shown, most LIP/MIP neurons encoded visual signals in hybrid coordinates, i.e. their receptive fields shifted to novel positions on the retina for each eye position, and these locations were not clearly related to each other in either eye- or head-centered coordinates. In contrast, most SC neurons exhibited receptive fields that had a stable position in eye-centered coordinates. In the FEF, visual signals were intermediate between those patterns: around 60% of the recorded neurons encoded targets in eye-centered coordinates, whereas the remainder showed changes in receptive field location, boundaries, or responsiveness that rendered the response patterns hybrid or occasionally head-centered. These results suggest that FEF may act as a transitional step in an evolution of coordinate systems between LIP/MIP and the SC. The persistence across cortical areas of hybrid representations that do not provide unequivocal location labels in a consistent reference frame has implications for how these representations must be read out.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Geospatial characteristics of measles transmission in China during 2005−2014</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005474</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/B8oBZkOXAgI/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Wan Yang, Liang Wen, Shen-Long Li, Kai Chen, Wen-Yi Zhang, Jeffrey Shaman&lt;/p&gt;

Measles is a highly contagious and severe disease. Despite mass vaccination, it remains a leading cause of death in children in developing regions, killing 114,900 globally in 2014. In 2006, China committed to eliminating measles by 2012; to this end, the country enhanced its mandatory vaccination programs and achieved vaccination rates reported above 95% by 2008. However, in spite of these efforts, during the last 3 years (2013–2015) China documented 27,695, 52,656, and 42,874 confirmed measles cases. How measles manages to spread in China—the world’s largest population—in the mass vaccination era remains poorly understood. To address this conundrum and provide insights for future public health efforts, we analyze the geospatial pattern of measles transmission across China during 2005–2014. We map measles incidence and incidence rates for each of the 344 cities in mainland China, identify the key socioeconomic and demographic features associated with high disease burden, and identify transmission clusters based on the synchrony of outbreak cycles. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, we identify 21 epidemic clusters, of which 12 were cross-regional. The cross-regional clusters included more underdeveloped cities with large numbers of emigrants than would be expected by chance (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011; bootstrap sampling), indicating that cities in these clusters were likely linked by internal worker migration in response to uneven economic development. In contrast, cities in regional clusters were more likely to have high rates of minorities and high natural growth rates than would be expected by chance (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.074; bootstrap sampling). Our findings suggest that multiple highly connected foci of measles transmission coexist in China and that migrant workers likely facilitate the transmission of measles across regions. This complex connection renders eradication of measles challenging in China despite its high overall vaccination coverage. Future immunization programs should therefore target these transmission foci simultaneously.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/B8oBZkOXAgI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Activating mutations of NOTCH1 (a well-known oncogene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia) are present in ∼4–13% of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cases, where they are associated with disease progression and chemorefractoriness. However, the specific role of NOTCH1 in leukemogenesis remains to be established. Here, we report that the active intracellular...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/wHKSvGUDdX8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A correlation game for unsupervised learning yields computational interpretations of Hebbian excitation, anti-Hebbian inhibition, and synapse elimination. (arXiv:1704.00646v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00646</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00646</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Much has been learned about plasticity of biological synapses from empirical
studies. Hebbian plasticity is driven by correlated activity of presynaptic and
postsynaptic neurons. Synapses that converge onto the same neuron often behave
as if they compete for a fixed resource; some survive the competition while
others are eliminated. To provide computational interpretations of these
aspects of synaptic plasticity, we formulate unsupervised learning as a
zero-sum game between Hebbian excitation and anti-Hebbian inhibition in a
neural network model. The game formalizes the intuition that Hebbian excitation
tries to maximize correlations of neurons with their inputs, while anti-Hebbian
inhibition tries to decorrelate neurons from each other. We further include a
model of synaptic competition, which enables a neuron to eliminate all
connections except those from its most strongly correlated inputs. Through
empirical studies, we show that this facilitates the learning of sensory
features that resemble parts of objects.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Tom Sumner, Richard J. Orton, Darren M. Green, Rowland R. Kao, Simon Gubbins&lt;/p&gt;

The role of host movement in the spread of vector-borne diseases of livestock has been little studied. Here we develop a mathematical framework that allows us to disentangle and quantify the roles of vector dispersal and livestock movement in transmission between farms. We apply this framework to outbreaks of bluetongue virus (BTV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in Great Britain, both of which are spread by &lt;i&gt;Culicoides&lt;/i&gt; biting midges and have recently emerged in northern Europe. For BTV we estimate parameters by fitting the model to outbreak data using approximate Bayesian computation, while for SBV we use previously derived estimates. We find that around 90% of transmission of BTV between farms is a result of vector dispersal, while for SBV this proportion is 98%. This difference is a consequence of higher vector competence and shorter duration of viraemia for SBV compared with BTV. For both viruses we estimate that the mean number of secondary infections per infected farm is greater than one for vector dispersal, but below one for livestock movements. Although livestock movements account for a small proportion of transmission and cannot sustain an outbreak on their own, they play an important role in establishing new foci of infection. However, the impact of restricting livestock movements on the spread of both viruses depends critically on assumptions made about the distances over which vector dispersal occurs. If vector dispersal occurs primarily at a local scale (99% of transmission occurs &amp;lt;25 km), movement restrictions are predicted to be effective at reducing spread, but if dispersal occurs frequently over longer distances (99% of transmission occurs &amp;lt;50 km) they are not.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4WGE8yqxvg0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Chromatin organization can be probed by Chromosomal Capture (5C) data, from which the encounter probability (EP) between genomic sites is presented in a large matrix. This matrix is averaged over a large cell population, revealing diagonal blocks called Topological Associating Domains (TADs) that represent a sub-chromatin organization. To study the relation between chromatin organization and gene regulation, we introduce a computational procedure to construct a bead-spring polymer model based on the EP matrix. The model permits exploring transient properties constrained by the statistics of the 5C data. To construct the polymer model, we proceed in two steps: first, we introduce a minimal number of random connectors inside restricted regions to account for diagonal blocks. Second, we account for long-range frequent specific genomic interactions. Using the constructed polymer, we compute the first encounter time distribution and the conditional probability of three key genomic sites. By simulating single particle trajectories of loci located on the constructed polymers from 5C data, we found a large variability of the anomalous exponent, used to interpret live cell imaging trajectories. The present polymer construction provides a generic tool to study steady-state and transient properties of chromatin constrained by some physical properties embedded in 5C data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v-IqqU6Nek4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Role of non-native electrostatic interactions in the coupled folding and binding of PUMA with Mcl-1</title>

PUMA, which belongs to the BH3-only protein family, is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP). It binds to its cellular partner Mcl-1 through its BH3 motif, which folds upon binding into an &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; helix. We have applied a structure-based coarse-grained model, with an explicit &lt;i&gt;Debye&lt;/i&gt;—&lt;i&gt;Hückel&lt;/i&gt; charge model, to probe the importance of electrostatic interactions both in the early and the later stages of this model coupled folding and binding process. This model was carefully calibrated with the experimental data on helical content and affinity, and shown to be consistent with previously published experimental data on binding rate changes with respect to ion strength. We find that intramolecular electrostatic interactions influence the unbound states of PUMA only marginally. Our results further suggest that intermolecular electrostatic interactions, and in particular non-native electrostatic interactions, are involved in formation of the initial encounter complex. We are able to reveal the binding mechanism in more detail than is possible using experimental data alone however, and in particular we uncover the role of non-native electrostatic interactions. We highlight the potential importance of such electrostatic interactions for describing the binding reactions of IDPs. Such approaches could be used to provide predictions for the results of mutational studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mrIhXG100PA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Sequence dependency of canonical base pair opening in the DNA double helix</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Viveca Lindahl, Alessandra Villa, Berk Hess&lt;/p&gt;

The flipping-out of a DNA base from the double helical structure is a key step of many cellular processes, such as DNA replication, modification and repair. Base pair opening is the first step of base flipping and the exact mechanism is still not well understood. We investigate sequence effects on base pair opening using extensive classical molecular dynamics simulations targeting the opening of 11 different canonical base pairs in two DNA sequences. Two popular biomolecular force fields are applied. To enhance sampling and calculate free energies, we bias the simulation along a simple distance coordinate using a newly developed adaptive sampling algorithm. The simulation is guided back and forth along the coordinate, allowing for multiple opening pathways. We compare the calculated free energies with those from an NMR study and check assumptions of the model used for interpreting the NMR data. Our results further show that the neighboring sequence is an important factor for the opening free energy, but also indicates that other sequence effects may play a role. All base pairs are observed to have a propensity for opening toward the major groove. The preferred opening base is cytosine for GC base pairs, while for AT there is sequence dependent competition between the two bases. For AT opening, we identify two non-canonical base pair interactions contributing to a local minimum in the free energy profile. For both AT and CG we observe long-lived interactions with water and with sodium ions at specific sites on the open base pair.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nWKsoR_wUx0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The promiscuous enzyme medium-chain 3-keto-acyl-CoA thiolase triggers a vicious cycle in fatty-acid beta-oxidation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005461</guid>

Mitochondrial fatty-acid beta-oxidation (mFAO) plays a central role in mammalian energy metabolism. Multiple severe diseases are associated with defects in this pathway. Its kinetic structure is characterized by a complex wiring of which the functional implications have hardly been explored. Repetitive cycles of reversible reactions, each cycle shortening the fatty acid by two carbon atoms, evoke competition between intermediates of different chain lengths for a common set of ‘promiscuous’ enzymes (enzymes with activity towards multiple substrates). In our validated kinetic model of the pathway, substrate overload causes a steep and detrimental flux decline. Here, we unravel the underlying mechanism and the role of enzyme promiscuity in it. Comparison of alternative model versions elucidated the role of promiscuity of individual enzymes. Promiscuity of the last enzyme of the pathway, medium-chain ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (MCKAT), was both necessary and sufficient to elicit the flux decline. Subsequently, Metabolic Control Analysis revealed that MCKAT had insufficient capacity to cope with high substrate influx. Next, we quantified the internal metabolic regulation, revealing a vicious cycle around MCKAT. Upon substrate overload, MCKAT’s ketoacyl-CoA substrates started to accumulate. The unfavourable equilibrium constant of the preceding enzyme, medium/short-chain hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, worked as an amplifier, leading to accumulation of upstream CoA esters, including acyl-CoA esters. These acyl-CoA esters are at the same time products of MCKAT and inhibited its already low activity further. Finally, the accumulation of CoA esters led to a sequestration of free CoA. CoA being a cofactor for MCKAT, its sequestration limited the MCKAT activity even further, thus completing the vicious cycle. Since CoA is also a substrate for distant enzymes, it efficiently communicated the ‘traffic jam’ at MCKAT to the entire pathway. This novel mechanism provides a basis to explore the role of mFAO in disease and elucidate similar principles in other pathways of lipid metabolism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ttEPt-zv1rA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Chemical Reaction Network Theory elucidates sources of multistability in interferon signaling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Irene Otero-Muras, Pencho Yordanov, Joerg Stelling&lt;/p&gt;

Bistability has important implications in signaling pathways, since it indicates a potential cell decision between alternative outcomes. We present two approaches developed in the framework of the Chemical Reaction Network Theory for easy and efficient search of multiple steady state behavior in signaling networks (both with and without mass conservation), and apply them to search for sources of bistability at different levels of the interferon signaling pathway. Different type I interferon subtypes and/or doses are known to elicit differential bioactivities (ranging from antiviral, antiproliferative to immunomodulatory activities). How different signaling outcomes can be generated through the same receptor and activating the same JAK/STAT pathway is still an open question. Here, we detect bistability at the level of early STAT signaling, showing how two different cell outcomes are achieved under or above a threshold in ligand dose or ligand-receptor affinity. This finding could contribute to explain the differential signaling (antiviral vs apoptotic) depending on interferon dose and subtype (&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; vs &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;) observed in type I interferons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4T4nKSvd4-w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Collective cell migration plays an important role in development. Here, we study the posterior lateral line primordium (PLLP) a group of about 100 cells, destined to form sensory structures, that migrates from head to tail in the zebrafish embryo. We model mutually inhibitory FGF-Wnt signalling network in the PLLP and link tissue subdivision (Wnt receptor and FGF receptor activity domains) to receptor-ligand parameters. We then use a 3D cell-based simulation with realistic cell-cell adhesion, interaction forces, and chemotaxis. Our model is able to reproduce experimentally observed motility with leading cells migrating up a gradient of CXCL12a, and trailing (FGF receptor active) cells moving actively by chemotaxis towards FGF ligand secreted by the leading cells. The 3D simulation framework, combined with experiments, allows an investigation of the role of cell division, chemotaxis, adhesion, and other parameters on the shape and speed of the PLLP. The 3D model demonstrates reasonable behaviour of control as well as mutant phenotypes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-2xErWNi25c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

They are also frequently observed after acute ischemic stroke (AIS), indicating poor functional outcome and increased mortality. However, recent evidence showed that, in most AIS patients, myocardial injury is not caused by coronary ischemia. Instead, stroke lesion location has been suggested to precipitate myocardial injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24906-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) was used in 299 patients who had a magnetic resonance imaging–confirmed acute ischemic stroke within the anterior circulation and a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) acquired on the day of admission. Of these, 228 had a second troponin measurement during the acute phase. The absolute hs-cTnT levels above the 99th percentile of a healthy reference population (≥14ng/l) as well as their relative temporal changes were used as continuous variables of interest in the VLSM model, including a multiple regression analysis adjusted for confounding variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In contrast, the baseline hs-cTnT levels on admission were not related to lesion location anywhere within the anterior circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Autoantibodies recognizing cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase 1A (cN1A) were found in plasma and serum from sIBM patients. However, whether anti-cN1A autoantibodies play a pathogenic role in sIBM is controversial. This study investigated the pathogenic properties of anti-cN1A autoantibodies in sIBM pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24919-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We developed a cell-based assay to detect anti-cN1A autoantibodies, which we found in serum from patients with neuromuscular diseases including sIBM. We also investigated the clinicopathological differences between sIBM patients with and without the autoantibodies. We used passive in vitro and in vivo immunization models to evaluate the pathogenic role of the autoantibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In the anti-cN1A–positive group, the percentage of patients with hepatitis C virus antibodies was significantly lower and the mean area of type 2 myofibers was significantly smaller compared with the autoantibody-negative group. In the in vitro passive immunization model, p62/SQSTM1 significantly increased in anti-cN1A–positive sIBM immunoglobulin G (IgG)-supplemented cells. In the in vivo passive immunization model, anti-cN1A–positive sIBM IgG-injected mice demonstrated p62/SQSTM1-positive sarcoplasmic aggregates in myofibers, associated with macrophage infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Patients with anti-cN1A autoantibodies demonstrated unique clinicopathological features. In vitro and in vivo passive immunization model results suggest that anti-cN1A autoantibodies may affect protein degradation in myofibers.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The preferred nucleotide contexts of the AID/APOBEC cytidine deaminases have differential effects when mutating retrotransposon and virus sequences compared to host genes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005471</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jeffrey Chen, Thomas MacCarthy&lt;/p&gt;

The AID / APOBEC genes are a family of cytidine deaminases that have evolved in vertebrates, and particularly mammals, to mutate RNA and DNA at distinct preferred nucleotide contexts (or “hotspots”) on foreign genomes such as viruses and retrotransposons. These enzymes play a pivotal role in intrinsic immunity defense mechanisms, often deleteriously mutating invading retroviruses or retrotransposons and, in the case of AID, changing antibody sequences to drive affinity maturation. We investigate the strength of various hotspots on their known biological targets by evaluating the potential impact of mutations on the DNA coding sequences of these targets, and compare these results to hypothetical hotspots that did not evolve. We find that the existing AID / APOBEC hotspots have a large impact on retrotransposons and non-mammalian viruses while having a much smaller effect on vital mammalian genes, suggesting co-evolution with AID / APOBECs may have had an impact on the genomes of the viruses we analyzed. We determine that GC content appears to be a significant, but not sole, factor in resistance to deaminase activity. We discuss possible mechanisms AID and APOBEC viral targets have adopted to escape the impacts of deamination activity, including changing the GC content of the genome.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ycQwEhXP4SQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Creating and running realistic models of neural networks has hitherto been a task for computing professionals rather than experimental neuroscientists. This is mainly because such networks usually engage substantial computational resources, the handling of which requires specific programing skills. Here we put forward a newly developed simulation environment ARACHNE: it enables an investigator to build and explore cellular networks of arbitrary biophysical and architectural complexity using the logic of NEURON and a simple interface on a local computer or a mobile device. The interface can control, through the internet, an optimized computational kernel installed on a remote computer cluster. ARACHNE can combine neuronal (wired) and astroglial (extracellular volume-transmission driven) network types and adopt realistic cell models from the NEURON library. The program and documentation (current version) are available at GitHub repository https://github.com/LeonidSavtchenko/Arachne under the MIT License (MIT).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/P5jJ4rRYC8w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Interrogating the topological robustness of gene regulatory circuits by randomization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005456</guid>

One of the most important roles of cells is performing their cellular tasks properly for survival. Cells usually achieve robust functionality, for example, cell-fate decision-making and signal transduction, through multiple layers of regulation involving many genes. Despite the combinatorial complexity of gene regulation, its quantitative behavior has been typically studied on the basis of experimentally verified core gene regulatory circuitry, composed of a small set of important elements. It is still unclear how such a core circuit operates in the presence of many other regulatory molecules and in a crowded and noisy cellular environment. Here we report a new computational method, named random circuit perturbation (RACIPE), for interrogating the robust dynamical behavior of a gene regulatory circuit even without accurate measurements of circuit kinetic parameters. RACIPE generates an ensemble of random kinetic models corresponding to a fixed circuit topology, and utilizes statistical tools to identify generic properties of the circuit. By applying RACIPE to simple toggle-switch-like motifs, we observed that the stable states of all models converge to experimentally observed gene state clusters even when the parameters are strongly perturbed. RACIPE was further applied to a proposed 22-gene network of the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), from which we identified four experimentally observed gene states, including the states that are associated with two different types of hybrid Epithelial/Mesenchymal phenotypes. Our results suggest that dynamics of a gene circuit is mainly determined by its topology, not by detailed circuit parameters. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for circuit-based systems biology modeling. We anticipate RACIPE to be a powerful tool to predict and decode circuit design principles in an unbiased manner, and to quantitatively evaluate the robustness and heterogeneity of gene expression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/95I6HbX7yKs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Effects of contact structure on the transient evolution of HIV virulence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005453</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/1iEZGtJW3rA/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Sang Woo Park, Benjamin M. Bolker&lt;/p&gt;

Early in an epidemic, high densities of susceptible hosts select for relatively high parasite virulence; later in the epidemic, lower susceptible densities select for lower virulence. Thus over the course of a typical epidemic the average virulence of parasite strains increases initially, peaks partway through the epidemic, then declines again. However, precise quantitative outcomes, such as the peak virulence reached and its timing, may depend sensitively on epidemiological details. Fraser &lt;i&gt;et al.&lt;/i&gt; proposed a model for the eco-evolutionary dynamics of HIV that incorporates the tradeoffs between transmission and virulence (mediated by set-point viral load, SPVL) and their heritability between hosts. Their model used implicit equations to capture the effects of partnership dynamics that are at the core of epidemics of sexually transmitted diseases. Our models combine HIV virulence tradeoffs with a range of contact models, explicitly modeling partnership formation and dissolution and allowing for individuals to transmit disease outside of partnerships. We assess summary statistics such as the peak virulence (corresponding to the maximum value of population mean log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; SPVL achieved throughout the epidemic) across models for a range of parameters applicable to the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Although virulence trajectories are broadly similar across models, the timing and magnitude of the virulence peak vary considerably. Previously developed implicit models predicted lower virulence and slower progression at the peak (a maximum of 3.5 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; SPVL) compared both to more realistic models and to simple random-mixing models with no partnership structure at all (both with a maximum of ≈ 4.7 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; SPVL). In this range of models, the simplest random-mixing structure best approximates the most realistic model; this surprising outcome occurs because the dominance of extra-pair contact in the realistic model swamps the effects of partnership structure.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1iEZGtJW3rA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Homozygous mutations in VAMP1 cause a presynaptic congenital myasthenic syndrome</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We report 2 families with undiagnosed recessive presynaptic congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). Whole exome or genome sequencing identified segregating homozygous variants in &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt;: c.51_64delAGGTGGGGGTCCCC in a Kuwaiti family and c.146G&amp;gt;C in an Israeli family. &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt; is crucial for vesicle fusion at presynaptic neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Electrodiagnostic examination showed severely low compound muscle action potentials and presynaptic impairment. We assessed the effect of the nonsense mutation on mRNA levels and evaluated the NMJ transmission in &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;lew/lew&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice, observing neurophysiological features of presynaptic impairment, similar to the patients. Taken together, our findings highlight &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt; homozygous mutations as a cause of presynaptic CMS. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Authors: Kristina Valentinova &amp;amp; Manuel Mameli&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addictive substances hijack the reward system partly via synaptic plasticity onto dopamine neurons. Cadherins may contribute to cocaine-evoked adaptations, supporting the notion that drug addiction is a synaptic disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal place cells are traditionally thought to represent locations where animals currently are or predict where they are headed. However, new results reveal that place cells also represent distant places that are actively avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>A growing body of work is investigating the use of mental maps during decision-making. Here we discuss how decision-making organizes experiences according to an internal model of the current task, thereby structuring memory. Likewise, we consider how the structure of mental maps contributes to decision-making.</description>

	<description>Early sensory cortex is typically investigated in response to sensory stimulation, masking the contribution of internal signals. Recently, van Kerkoerle and colleagues reported that attention and memory signals segregate from sensory signals within specific layers of primary visual cortex, providing insight into the role of internal signals in sensory processing.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules of the Immunoglobulin Superfamily Regulate Synapse Formation, Maintenance, and Function</title>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30032-2?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecules are among the most abundant proteins in vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems. Prominent family members are the neural cell adhesion molecules NCAM and L1, which were the first to be shown to be essential not only in development but also in synaptic function and as key regulators of synapse formation, synaptic activity, plasticity, and synaptic vesicle recycling at distinct developmental and activity stages. In addition to interacting with each other, adhesion molecules interact with ion channels and cytokine and neurotransmitter receptors.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Genetic variation at 16q24.2 is associated with small vessel stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24840</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24840-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful at identifying associations with stroke and stroke subtypes, but have not yet identified any associations solely with small vessel stroke (SVS). SVS comprises one quarter of all ischemic stroke and is a major manifestation of cerebral small vessel disease, the primary cause of vascular cognitive impairment. Studies across neurological traits have shown that younger-onset cases have an increased genetic burden. We leveraged this increased genetic burden by performing an age-at-onset informed GWAS meta-analysis, including a large younger-onset SVS population, to identify novel associations with stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24840-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a three-stage age-at-onset informed GWAS to identify novel genetic variants associated with stroke. On identifying a novel locus associated with SVS, we assessed its influence on other small vessel disease phenotypes, as well as on messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of nearby genes, and on DNA methylation of nearby CpG sites in whole blood and in the fetal brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24840-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified an association with SVS in 4,203 cases and 50,728 controls on chromosome 16q24.2 (odds ratio [OR; 95% confidence interval {CI}] = 1.16 [1.10–1.22]; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 3.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;). The lead single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs12445022) was also associated with cerebral white matter hyperintensities (OR [95% CI] = 1.10 [1.05–1.16]; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 5.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;; N = 3,670), but not intracerebral hemorrhage (OR [95% CI] = 0.97 [0.84–1.12]; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.71; 1,545 cases, 1,481 controls). rs12445022 is associated with mRNA expression of &lt;em&gt;ZCCHC14&lt;/em&gt; in arterial tissues (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 9.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;) and DNA methylation at probe cg16596957 in whole blood (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 5.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24840-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;16q24.2 is associated with SVS. Associations of the locus with expression of &lt;em&gt;ZCCHC14&lt;/em&gt; and DNA methylation suggest the locus acts through changes to regulatory elements. Ann Neurol 2017;81:383–394&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Neuron: Selective Entrainment of Theta Oscillations in the Dorsal Stream Causally Enhances Auditory Working Memory Performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30198-8?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30198-8?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Albouy et al. show that driving brain oscillations with rhythmic stimulation can specifically improve auditory working memory performance and modulate brain activity and connectivity patterns. These findings suggest that oscillations can serve as targets for controlled interventions into brain function.</description>

	<description>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies in humans have shown that many behaviors engage processes that suppress excitability within the corticospinal tract. Inhibition of the motor output pathway has been extensively studied in the context of action stopping, where a planned movement needs to be abruptly aborted. Recent TMS work has also revealed markers of motor inhibition during the preparation of movement. Here, we review the evidence for motor inhibition during action stopping and action preparation, focusing on studies that have used TMS to monitor changes in the excitability of the corticospinal pathway.</description>

	<description>Obesity is now a worldwide health issue. Far from being limited to weight gain, obesity is generally associated with low-grade inflammation and with a cluster of disorders collectively known as the ‘metabolic syndrome’. When considering obesity and the subsequent neuroinflammation, the focus was long set on the hypothalamus. More recently, obesity-derived neuroinflammation has been shown to affect other brain structures such as the hippocampus, cortex, brainstem, or amygdala. Furthermore, obesity has been associated with increased occurrence of central disorders such as depression and impaired cognitive function.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Monoamine Transporters as Ionotropic Receptors</title>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30023-1?rss=yes</link>
	<description>It is well established that glutamate and GABA signal through both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Conversely, it is thought that, with one exception, monoamines (dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine) signal via metabotropic receptors. Given their capacity to generate fast-acting currents, I suggest that the monoamine transporters should be considered as ionotropic receptors.</description>

&lt;p&gt;NMDA receptors are preeminent neurotransmitter-gated channels in the CNS, which respond to glutamate in a manner that integrates multiple external and internal cues. They belong to the ionotropic glutamate receptor family and fulfil unique and crucial roles in neuronal development and function. These roles depend &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern optogenetics can be tuned to evoke activity that corresponds to naturally occurring local or global activity in timing, magnitude or individual-cell patterning. This outcome has been facilitated not only by the development of core features of optogenetics over the past 10 years (microbial-opsin variants, &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Where Does EEG Come From and What Does It Mean?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30024-3?rss=yes</guid>

	<description>Electroencephalography (EEG) has been instrumental in making discoveries about cognition, brain function, and dysfunction. However, where do EEG signals come from and what do they mean? The purpose of this paper is to argue that we know shockingly little about the answer to this question, to highlight what we do know, how important the answers are, and how modern neuroscience technologies that allow us to measure and manipulate neural circuits with high spatiotemporal accuracy might finally bring us some answers.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: The Insula: An Underestimated Brain Area in Clinical Neuroscience, Psychiatry, and Neurology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30017-6?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30017-6?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Supported by recent human neuroimaging studies, the insula is re-emerging as an important brain area not only in the physiological understanding of the brain, but also in pathological contexts in clinical research. In this opinion article, we briefly introduce the anatomical and histological features of the human insula. We then summarize the physiological functions of the insula and underscore its pathological roles in psychiatric and neurological disorders that have long been underestimated. We finally propose possible strategies through which the role of the insula may be further understood for both basic and clinical neuroscience.</description>
