	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outcome prediction in patients after cardiac arrest (CA) is challenging. EEG reactivity (EEG‐R) might be a reliable predictor. We aimed to determine the prognostic value of EEG‐R using a standardized assessment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a prospective cohort study, a strictly defined EEG‐R assessment protocol was executed twice a day in adult patients after CA. EEG‐R was classified as ‘present’ or ‘absent’ by three EEG readers, blinded for patient characteristics. Uncertain reactivity was classified as ‘present’. Primary outcome was best Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) in six months after CA, dichotomized as ‘good’ (CPC 1‐2) or ‘poor’ (CPC 3‐5). EEG‐R was considered reliable for predicting poor outcome if specificity was ≥ 95%. For good outcome prediction, a specificity of ≥ 80% was used. Added value of EEG‐R was the increase in specificity when combined with EEG background, neurological examination and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 160 patients enrolled, 149 were available for analyses. Absence of EEG‐R for poor outcome prediction had specificity of 82% and sensitivity of 73%. For good outcome prediction, specificity was 73% and sensitivity 82%. Specificity for poor outcome prediction increased from 98% to 99% when EEG‐R was added to a multimodal model. For good outcome prediction, specificity increased from 70% to 89%.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EEG‐R testing in itself is not sufficiently reliable for outcome prediction in patients after CA. For poor outcome prediction it has no substantial added value to EEG background, neurological examination and SSEP. For prediction of good outcome, EEG‐R seems to have added value.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Contextual Focus: A Cognitive Explanation for the Cultural Revolution of the Middle/Upper Paleolithic. (arXiv:1309.2609v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many elements of culture made their first appearance in the Upper
Paleolithic. Previous hypotheses put forth to explain this unprecedented burst
of creativity are found wanting. Examination of the psychological basis of
creativity leads to the suggestion that it resulted from the onset of
contextual focus: the capacity to focus or defocus attention in response to the
situation, thereby shifting between analytic and associative modes of thought.
New ideas germinate in a defocused state in which one is receptive to the
possible relevance of many dimensions of a situation. They are refined in a
focused state, conducive to filtering out irrelevant dimensions and condensing
relevant ones.

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Optically Induced Calcium-Dependent Gene Activation and Labeling of Active Neurons Using CaMPARI and Cal-Light</title>

	<description>The advent of optogenetic methods has made it possible to use endogeneously produced molecules to image and manipulate cellular, subcellular and synaptic activity. It has also led to the development of photoactivatable calcium-dependent indicators that mark active synapses, neurons and circuits. Furthermore, calcium-dependent photoactivation can be used to trigger gene expression in active neurons. Here we describe two sets of protocols, one using CaMPARI and a second one using Cal-Light. CaMPARI, a calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator, enables rapid network-wide, tunable, all-optical functional circuit mapping. Cal-Light, a photoactivatable calcium sensor, while slower to respond than CaMPARI, has the capacity to trigger the expression of genes, including effectors, activators, indicators or other constructs. Here we describe the rationale and provide procedures for using these two calcium-dependent constructs (1) in vitro in dissociated primary neuronal cell cultures (CaMPARI &amp;amp; Cal-Light); (2) in vitro in acute brain slices for circuit mapping (CaMPARI); (3) in vivo for triggering photoconversion or gene expression (CaMPARI &amp;amp; Cal-Light); and finally, (4) for recovering photoconverted neurons post-fixation with immunocytochemistry (CaMPARI). The approaches and protocols we describe are examples of the potential uses of both CaMPARI and Cal-Light. The ability to mark and manipulate neurons that are active during specific epochs of behavior has a vast unexplored experimental potential.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Accelerated Current Decay Kinetics of a Rare Human Acid-Sensing ion Channel 1a Variant That Is Used in Many Studies as Wild Type</title>

	<description>Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are neuronal Na+-permeable ion channels that are activated by extracellular acidification and are involved in fear sensing, learning, neurodegeneration after ischemia, and in pain sensation. We have recently found that the human ASIC1a (hASIC1a) wild type clone which has been used by many laboratories in recombinant expression studies contains a point mutation that occurs with a very low frequency in humans. Here we compared the function and expression of ASIC1a wild type and of this rare variant, in which the highly conserved residue Gly212 is substituted by Asp. Residue 212 is located at a subunit interface that undergoes changes during channel activity. We show that the modulation of channel function by commonly used ASIC inhibitors and modulators, and the pH dependence, are the same or only slightly different between hASIC1a-G212 and –D212. hASIC1a-G212 has however a higher current amplitude per surface-expressed channel and considerably slower current decay kinetics than hASIC1a-D212, and its current decay kinetics display a higher dependency on the type of anion present in the extracellular solution. We demonstrate for a number of channel mutants previously characterized in the hASIC1a-D212 background that they have very similar effects in the hASIC1a-G212 background. Taken together, we show that the variant hASIC1a-D212 that has been used as wild type in many studies is in fact a mutant, and that the properties of hASIC1a-D212 and hASIC1a-G212 are sufficiently close that the conclusions made in previous pharmacology and structure-function studies remain valid.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Conditioned Aversion and Neuroplasticity Induced by a Superagonist of Extrasynaptic GABAA Receptors: Correlation With Activation of the Oval BNST Neurons and CRF Mechanisms</title>

	<description>THIP (gaboxadol), a superagonist of the delta subunit-containing extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, produces persistent neuroplasticity in dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), similarly to rewarding drugs of abuse. However, unlike them THIP lacks abuse potential and induces conditioned place aversion in mice. The mechanism underlying the aversive effects of THIP remains elusive. Here, we show that mild aversive effects of THIP were detected 2 hours after administration likely reflecting an anxiety-like state with increased corticosterone release and with central recruitment of corticotropin-releasing factor CRF1 receptors. A detailed immunohistochemical c-Fos expression mapping for THIP-activated brain areas revealed a correlation between the activation of CRF-expressing neurons in the oval nucleus of the bed nuclei of stria terminalis and THIP-induced aversive effects. In addition, the neuroplasticity of mesolimbic DA system (24 hours after administration) and conditioned place aversion by THIP after 4 daily acute sessions were dependent on extrasynaptic GABAA receptors (abolished in delta-GABAA receptor knockout mice) and activation of the CRF1 receptors (abolished in wildtype mice by a CRF1 receptor antagonist). A selective THIP-induced activation of CRF-expressing neurons in the oval part of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis may constitute a novel mechanism for inducing plasticity in a population of VTA DA neurons and aversive behavioral states.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Comparison and Functional Genetic Analysis of Striatal Protein Expression Among Diverse Inbred Mouse Strains</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00128</guid>

	<description>C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) inbred mouse strains are highly variable genetically and differ in a large number of behavioral traits related to striatal function, including depression, anxiety, stress response, and response to drugs of abuse. The genetic basis of these phenotypic differences are, however, unknown. Here, we present a comparison of the striatal proteome between B6 and D2 and relate differences at the protein level to strain differences at the mRNA level. We also leverage a recombinant inbred BXD population derived from B6 and D2 strains to investigate the role of genetic variation on regulation of mRNA and protein levels. Finally, we test the hypothesis that differential protein expression contributes to differential behavioral responses between the B6 and D2 strain. We detected the expression over 2,500 proteins in membrane enriched protein fractions from B6 and D2 striatum. Of these, 160 proteins demonstrated significant differential expression between B6 and D2 strains at a 10% false discovery level, including COMT, GABRA2, and CNR1—key proteins involved in synaptic transmission and behavioral response. Similar to previous reports, there was little overlap between protein and transcript levels (25%). However, overlap was greater (51%) for proteins demonstrating genetic regulation of cognate gene expression . We also found that striatal proteins with significantly higher or lower relative expression in B6 and D2 were enriched for dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses and processes involved in synaptic plasticity (e.g. LTP and LTD). Finally, we validated higher expression of CNR1 in B6 striatum and demonstrated greater sensitivity of this strain to the locomotor inhibiting effects of the CNR1 agonist, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Our study is the first comparison of differences in striatal proteins between the B6 and D2 strains, and suggests that alterations in the striatal proteome may underlie strain differences in related behaviors, such as drug response. Furthermore, we propose that genetic variants that impact transcript levels are more likely to also exhibit differential expression at the protein level.</description>

	<description>Neurogenesis, the formation of new neurons in the adult brain, is important for memory formation and extinction. One of the most studied external interventions that affect the rate of adult neurogenesis is physical exercise. Physical exercise promotes adult neurogenesis via several factors including Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Here, we identified L-lactate, a physical exercise-induced metabolite, as a factor that promotes adult hippocampal neurogenesis. While prolonged exposure to L-lactate promoted neurogenesis, no beneficial effect was exerted on cognitive learning and memory. Systemic pharmacological blocking of Monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2), which transports L-lactate to the brain, prevented lactate-induced neurogenesis, while 3,5-DHBA, an agonist for the lactate-receptor hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1), did not affect adult neurogenesis. These data suggest that L-lactate partially mediates the effect of physical exercise on adult neurogenesis, but not cognition, in a MCT2-dependent manner.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Modulating Activity in the Prefrontal Cortex Changes Intertemporal Choice for Loss: A Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Study</title>

	<description>Intertemporal choice refers to decisions involving tradeoffs between costs and benefits occurring at different times. Studies have found that weighting the time and benefits during decision-making involves a complex neural network that includes the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). However, in contrast to literature regarding intertemporal choice for gains, studies have not provided causal evidence that the DLPFC is involved in intertemporal choice for losses. We examined whether bifrontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the right and left prefrontal cortex can alter the balance of intertemporal preference in the loss condition. A total of 60 participants performed delay discounting tasks for losses while receiving either right anodal/left cathodal, left anodal/right cathodal, or sham stimulation. The results showed that participants tended to choose larger delayed losses after receiving left anodal/right cathodal tDCS. Left anodal/right cathodal tDCS significantly decreased the discounting rate compared with the sham stimulation. These findings confirm that DLPFC activity is critical during intertemporal decision-making for losses.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Dysfunction of 67-kDa Laminin Receptor Disrupts BBB Integrity via Impaired Dystrophin/AQP4 Complex and p38 MAPK/VEGF Activation Following Status Epilepticus</title>

	<description>Status epilepticus (SE, a prolonged seizure activity) impairs brain-blood barrier (BBB) integrity, which results in secondary complications following SE. The non-integrin 67-kDa laminin receptor (67-kDa LR) plays a role in cell adherence to laminin (a major glycoprotein component in basement membrane), and participates laminin-mediated signaling pathways including p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). Thus, we investigated the role of 67-kDa LR in SE-induced vasogenic edema formation in the rat piriform cortex (PC). SE diminished 67-kDa LR expression, but increased laminin expression, in endothelial cells accompanied by the reduced SMI-71 (a rat BBB barrier marker) expression. Astroglial 67-kDa LR expression was also reduced in the PC due to massive astroglial loss. 67-kDa LR neutralization led to serum extravasation in the PC concomitant with the reduced SMI-71 expression. 67-kDa LR neutralization also decreased expressions of dystrophin and aquaporin-4 (AQP4). In addition, it increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation and expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), laminin and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which were abrogated by SB202190, a p38 MAPK inhibitor. Therefore, our findings indicate that 67-kDa LR dysfunction may disrupt dystrophin-AQP4 complex, which would evoke vasogenic edema formation and subsequent laminin over-expression via activating p38 MAPK/VEGF axis.</description>

	<description>Autophagy, a catabolic degradation system, is utilized for destroying and recycling the damaged or unnecessary cellular components. Brain plasticity refers to the remarkable characteristics of brain neurons that change their structure and function according to previous experience. This review was performed by searching the relevant articles in databases of SCIENCEDIRECT, PUBMED, and Web of Science, from respective inception to January 2019. Here, we review the neuroprotective effect of autophagy in neurological diseases and the mechanism of autophagy in brain plasticity. Moreover, the mechanism of autophagy in the process of brain plasticity can provide the possibility for the development of new treatment methods in the future, thus benefiting patients with neurological diseases. In summary, autophagy and brain plasticity play important roles in neurological diseases.</description>

	<description>Santiago Ramón y Cajal was still young when he came across the reazione nera, discovered by the Italian Camillo Golgi. Cajal became absolutely entranced by the fine structure of the nervous system this technique revealed, which led him to embark on one of the last truly epic endeavors in modern History: the characterization of nervous cells, and of their organization to form the brain. Cajal remained in Spain throughout his scientific career, working for years alone. With international recognition, Cajal began recruiting brilliant students as collaborators. A handful of his pupils also made decisive discoveries that served to lay the foundations of modern Neuroscience. Cajal´s brother Pedro, Tello, Domingo Sánchez, Achúcarro, Lafora, Río-Hortega, de Castro and Lorente de Nó worked side by side with El Maestro. While Cajal himself pronounced some of the basic rules that have helped us to understand the nervous system (the neuron theory, the law of dynamic polarization of the neuron), as well as providing innumerable details about the histological organization of the different neural structures, it was Pío del Río-Hortega who identified two of the four main cell types in the CNS (oligodendrocytes and microglia), and Fernando de Castro who described the innervation of the blood vessels and identified the first chemoreceptors in the carotid body. Together, this group of scientists is known as the Spanish Neurological School, and if they had not existed the History of Neuroscience would surely have been quite a different story; and proof that Cajal was a truly exceptional scientist but he was not an exception for Spanish Science.</description>

Analysis methods based on simulations and optimization have been previously developed to estimate relative translation rates from next-generation sequencing data. Translation involves molecules and chemical reactions, hence bioinformatics methods consistent with the laws of chemistry and physics are more likely to produce accurate results. Here, we derive simple equations based on chemical kinetic principles to measure the translation-initiation rate, transcriptome-wide elongation rate, and individual codon translation rates from ribosome profiling experiments. Our methods reproduce the known rates from ribosome profiles generated from detailed simulations of translation. By applying our methods to data from &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; and mouse embryonic stem cells, we find that the extracted rates reproduce expected correlations with various molecular properties, and we also find that mouse embryonic stem cells have a global translation speed of 5.2 AA/s, in agreement with previous reports that used other approaches. Our analysis further reveals that a codon can exhibit up to 26-fold variability in its translation rate depending upon its context within a transcript. This broad distribution means that the average translation rate of a codon is not representative of the rate at which most instances of that codon are translated, and it suggests that translational regulation might be used by cells to a greater degree than previously thought.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IEyz9tV6gdo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Health planners use forecasts of key metrics associated with influenza-like illness (ILI); near-term weekly incidence, week of season onset, week of peak, and intensity of peak. Here, we describe our participation in a weekly prospective ILI forecasting challenge for the United States for the 2016-17 season and subsequent evaluation of our performance. We implemented a metapopulation model framework with 32 model variants. Variants differed from each other in their assumptions about: the force-of-infection (FOI); use of uninformative priors; the use of discounted historical data for not-yet-observed time points; and the treatment of regions as either independent or coupled. Individual model variants were chosen subjectively as the basis for our weekly forecasts; however, a subset of coupled models were only available part way through the season. Most frequently, during the 2016-17 season, we chose; FOI variants with both school vacations and humidity terms; uninformative priors; the inclusion of discounted historical data for not-yet-observed time points; and coupled regions (when available). Our near-term weekly forecasts substantially over-estimated incidence early in the season when coupled models were not available. However, our forecast accuracy improved in absolute terms and relative to other teams once coupled solutions were available. In retrospective analysis, we found that the 2016-17 season was not typical: on average, coupled models performed better when fit without historically augmented data. Also, we tested a simple ensemble model for the 2016-17 season and found that it underperformed our subjective choice for all forecast targets. In this study, we were able to improve accuracy during a prospective forecasting exercise by coupling dynamics between regions. Although reduction of forecast subjectivity should be a long-term goal, some degree of human intervention is likely to improve forecast accuracy in the medium-term in parallel with the systematic consideration of more sophisticated ensemble approaches.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/j79UB0H6-wc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The effectiveness of a mass vaccination program can engender its own undoing if individuals choose to not get vaccinated believing that they are already protected by herd immunity. This would appear to be the optimal decision for an individual, based on a strategic appraisal of her costs and benefits, even though she would be vulnerable during subsequent outbreaks if the majority of the population argues in this manner. We investigate how voluntary vaccination can nevertheless emerge in a social network of rational agents, who make informed decisions whether to be vaccinated, integrated with a model of epidemic dynamics. The information available to each agent includes the prevalence of the disease in their local network neighborhood and/or globally in the population, as well as the fraction of their neighbors that are protected against the disease. Crucially, the payoffs governing the decision of agents vary with disease prevalence, resulting in the vaccine uptake behavior changing in response to contagion spreading. The collective behavior of the agents responding to local prevalence can lead to a significant reduction in the final epidemic size, particularly for less contagious diseases having low basic reproduction number R 0. Near the epidemic threshold (R 0 ≈ 1) the use of local prevalence information can result in divergent responses in the final vaccine coverage. Our results suggest that heterogeneity in the risk perception resulting from the spatio-temporal evolution of an epidemic differentially affects agents’ payoffs, which is a critical determinant of the success of voluntary vaccination schemes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/32m1qNH1d_E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Recent large cancer studies have measured somatic alterations in an unprecedented number of tumours. These large datasets allow the identification of cancer-related sets of genetic alterations by identifying relevant combinatorial patterns. Among such patterns, &lt;i&gt;mutual exclusivity&lt;/i&gt; has been employed by several recent methods that have shown its effectiveness in characterizing gene sets associated to cancer. Mutual exclusivity arises because of the complementarity, at the functional level, of alterations in genes which are part of a group (e.g., a &lt;i&gt;pathway&lt;/i&gt;) performing a given function. The availability of quantitative target profiles, from genetic perturbations or from clinical phenotypes, provides additional information that can be leveraged to improve the identification of cancer related gene sets by discovering groups with complementary functional associations with such targets. In this work we study the problem of finding groups of mutually exclusive alterations associated with a quantitative (functional) target. We propose a combinatorial formulation for the problem, and prove that the associated computational problem is computationally hard. We design two algorithms to solve the problem and implement them in our tool UNCOVER. We provide analytic evidence of the effectiveness of UNCOVER in finding high-quality solutions and show experimentally that UNCOVER finds sets of alterations significantly associated with functional targets in a variety of scenarios. In particular, we show that our algorithms find sets which are better than the ones obtained by the state-of-the-art method, even when sets are evaluated using the statistical score employed by the latter. In addition, our algorithms are much faster than the state-of-the-art, allowing the analysis of large datasets of thousands of target profiles from cancer cell lines. We show that on two such datasets, one from project Achilles and one from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer project, UNCOVER identifies several significant gene sets with complementary functional associations with targets.

In a flipped classroom, students complete automated modules to replace a traditional lecture, allowing the time devoted for the lecture to be devoted to constructive tasks reinforcing student knowledge. Yet although the flipped classroom offers a compelling approach for fostering a constructivist, student-centric learning environment, research on the efficacy of flipped classes has been mixed. For that matter, is it possible to successfully flip a classroom in an advanced, heavily specialized course like a bioinformatics algorithms course? Over the past several years, the author has implemented a flipped version of such a course and will discuss some of the successes and pitfalls encountered.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mZsslISQP14&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Mispositioned Neurokinin-1 receptor-expressing neurons underlie heat hyperalgesia in Disabled-1 mutant mice</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Reelin (Reln) and Disabled-1 (Dab1) participate in the Reelin-signaling pathway and when either is deleted, mutant mice have the same spinally mediated behavioral abnormalities – increased sensitivity to noxious heat and a profound loss in mechanical sensitivity. Both Reln and Dab1 are highly expressed in dorsal horn areas that receive and convey nociceptive information – laminae I-II, lateral lamina V, and the lateral spinal nucleus. Lamina I contains both projection neurons and interneurons that express Neurokinin-1 receptors (NK1Rs) and they transmit information about noxious heat both within the dorsal horn and to the brain. Here we ask if the increased heat nociception in &lt;i&gt;Reln&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;dab1&lt;/i&gt; mutants is due to incorrectly positioned dorsal horn neurons that express NK1Rs. We found more NK1R-expressing neurons in &lt;i&gt;Reln&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;dab1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; laminae I-II than in their respective wild-type mice, and some NK1R neurons co-expressed Dab1 and the transcription factor Lmx1b, confirming their excitatory phenotype. Importantly, heat stimulation in &lt;i&gt;dab1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;mice induced Fos in incorrectly positioned NK1R neurons in laminae I-II. Next we asked if these ectopically placed and noxious-heat responsive NK1R neurons participated in pain behavior. Ablation of the superficial NK1Rs with an intrathecal injection of a substance P analog conjugated to the toxin Saporin eliminated the thermal hypersensitivity of &lt;i&gt;dab1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, without altering their mechanical insensitivity. These results suggest that ectopically positioned NK1R-expressing neurons underlie the heat hyperalgesia of Reelin-signaling pathway mutants, but do not contribute to their profound mechanical insensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Mutants deficient in Reelin signaling have increased sensitivity to noxious heat and decreased mechanical sensitivity, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we ask if the heat hyperalgesia results from additional activation of misplaced dorsal horn neurons that express Neurokinin-1 receptors (NK1Rs). Compared to wild-type mice, &lt;i&gt;dab1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice have more NK1R- expressing neurons in the superficial dorsal horn and these neurons express Fos in response to noxious heat stimulation. Ablation of these neurons by intrathecal injection of a substance P analog conjugated to Saporin abolished the hypersensitivity of the heat responses of mutant mice, but the mechanical insensitivity was preserved. Mispositioned NK1R-expressing neurons, therefore, underlie the heat hyperalgesia that characterizes Reelin-signaling mutant mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Allosteric HIV-1 integrase (IN) inhibitors (ALLINIs) are a promising new class of antiretroviral agents that disrupt proper viral maturation by inducing hyper-multimerization of IN. Here we show that lead pyridine-based ALLINI KF116 exhibits striking selectivity for IN tetramers versus lower order protein oligomers. IN structural features that are essential for its functional tetramerization and HIV-1 replication are also critically important for KF116 mediated higher-order IN multimerization. Live cell imaging of single viral particles revealed that KF116 treatment during virion production compromises the tight association of IN with capsid cores during subsequent infection of target cells. We have synthesized the highly active (-)-KF116 enantiomer, which displayed EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of ~7 nM against wild type HIV-1 and ~10-fold higher, sub-nM activity against a clinically relevant dolutegravir resistant mutant virus suggesting potential clinical benefits for complementing dolutegravir therapy with pyridine-based ALLINIs.</description>

	<description>One of the challenges faced by global disease surveillance efforts is the lack of comparability across systems. Reporting commonly focuses on overall incidence, despite differences in surveillance quality between and within countries. For most immunizing infections, the age distribution of incident cases provides a more robust picture of trends in transmission. We present a framework to estimate transmission intensity for dengue virus from age-specific incidence data, and apply it to 359 administrative units in Thailand, Colombia, Brazil and Mexico. Our estimates correlate well with those derived from seroprevalence data (the gold standard), capture the expected spatial heterogeneity in risk, and correlate with known environmental drivers of transmission. We show how this approach could be used to guide the implementation of control strategies such as vaccination. Since age-specific counts are routinely collected by many surveillance systems, they represent a unique opportunity to further our understanding of disease burden and risk for many diseases.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Early-generated interneurons regulate neuronal circuit formation during early postnatal development</title>

	<description>A small subset of interneurons that are generated earliest as pioneer neurons are the first cohort of neurons that enter the neocortex. However, it remains largely unclear whether these early-generated interneurons (EGIns) predominantly regulate neocortical circuit formation. Using inducible genetic fate mapping to selectively label EGIns and pseudo-random interneurons (pRIns), we found that EGIns exhibited more mature electrophysiological and morphological properties and higher synaptic connectivity than pRIns in the somatosensory cortex at early postnatal stages. In addition, when stimulating one cell, the proportion of EGIns that influence spontaneous network synchronization is significantly higher than that of pRIns. Importantly, toxin-mediated ablation of EGIns after birth significantly reduce spontaneous network synchronization and decrease inhibitory synaptic formation during the first postnatal week. These results suggest that EGIns can shape developing networks and may contribute to the reﬁnement of neuronal connectivity before the establishment of the adult neuronal circuit.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Complementary congruent and opposite neurons achieve concurrent multisensory integration and segregation</title>

	<description>Our brain perceives the world by exploiting multisensory cues to extract information about various aspects of external stimuli. The sensory cues from the same stimulus should be integrated to improve perception, and otherwise segregated to distinguish different stimuli. In reality, however, the brain faces the challenge of recognizing stimuli without knowing in advance the sources of sensory cues. To address this challenge, we propose that the brain conducts integration and segregation concurrently with complementary neurons. Studying the inference of heading-direction via visual and vestibular cues, we develop a network model with two reciprocally connected modules modelling interacting visual-vestibular areas. In each module, there are two groups of neurons whose tunings under each sensory cue are either congruent or opposite. We show that congruent neurons implement integration, while opposite neurons compute cue disparity information for segregation, and the interplay between two groups of neurons achieves efficient multisensory information processing.</description>

	<description>Lesions of primary visual cortex (V1) lead to loss of conscious visual perception with significant impact on human patients. Understanding the neural consequences of such damage may aid the development of rehabilitation methods. In this rare case of a Rhesus macaque (monkey S), likely born without V1, the animal’s in-group behaviour was unremarkable, but visual task training was impaired. With multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging, visual structures outside of the lesion appeared normal. Visual stimulation under anaesthesia with checkerboards activated lateral geniculate nucleus of monkey S, while full-field moving dots activated pulvinar. Visual cortical activation was sparse but included face patches. Consistently across lesion and control monkeys, functional connectivity analysis revealed an intact network of bilateral dorsal visual areas temporally correlated with V5/MT activation, even without V1. Despite robust subcortical responses to visual stimulation, we found little evidence for strengthened subcortical input to V5/MT supporting residual visual function or blindsight-like phenomena.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Estimating the burden of α-thalassaemia in Thailand using a comprehensive prevalence database for Southeast Asia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.40580</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40580</link>
	<description>Severe forms of α-thalassaemia, haemoglobin H disease and haemoglobin Bart’s hydrops fetalis, are an important public health concern in Southeast Asia. Yet information on the prevalence, genetic diversity and health burden of α-thalassaemia in the region remains limited. We compiled a geodatabase of α-thalassaemia prevalence and genetic diversity surveys and, using geostatistical modelling methods, generated the first continuous maps of α-thalassaemia mutations in Thailand and sub-national estimates of the number of newborns with severe forms in 2020. We also summarised the current evidence-base for α-thalassaemia prevalence and diversity for the region. We estimate that 3595 (95% credible interval 1,717–6,199) newborns will be born with severe α-thalassaemia in Thailand in 2020, which is considerably higher than previous estimates. Accurate, fine-scale epidemiological data are necessary to guide sustainable national and regional health policies for α-thalassaemia management. Our maps and newborn estimates are an important first step towards this aim.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Does nonlinear neural network dynamics explain human confidence in a sequence of perceptual decisions ?</title>

	<description>Recently single neurons measurements during perceptual decision tasks in monkeys have coupled the neural mechanisms of decision making and the establishment of a degree of confidence. These neural mechanisms have been investigated in the context of a spiking attractor network model. It has been shown that confidence about a decision under uncertainty can be computed using a simple neural signal in individual trials. However, it remains unclear if a neural attractor network can reproduce the behavioral effects of confidence in humans. To answer this question, we designed an experiment in which participants were asked to perform an orientation discrimination task, followed by a confidence judgment. Here we show for the first time that an attractor neural network model, calibrated separately on each participant, accounts for full sequences of decision-making. Remarkably, the model is able to reproduce quantitatively the relations between accuracy, response times and confidence, as well as various sequential effects such as the influence of confidence on the subsequent trial. Our results suggest that a metacognitive process such as confidence in perceptual decision can be based on the intrinsic dynamics of a nonlinear attractor neural network.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Perception of rhythmic speech is modulated by focal bilateral tACS</title>

	<description>We tested whether the phase relation between transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and the rhythm of acoustically-degraded (noise-vocoded) words, presented in silence, modulates word report accuracy. We found a significant tACS-induced modulation of speech perception, but only if the stimulation was applied bilaterally using ring electrodes (not for unilateral left hemisphere stimulation with square electrodes). Significant results were obtained when data was analyzed using a statistical approach that was identified as optimal in a previous simulation study. This effect was driven by a phasic disruption of word report by tACS; no enhancement of word report scores was observed compared with sham stimulation. Our results suggest a causal role of neural entrainment for speech perception and emphasize the importance of optimizing stimulation protocols and statistical approaches for brain stimulation research.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Individual Prediction of Psychotherapy Outcome in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder using Neuroimaging Data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/647925v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Objective: Trauma-focused psychotherapy is the first-line treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but 30-50% of patients do not benefit sufficiently. We investigated whether structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI/rs-fMRI) data could distinguish between treatment responders and non-responders on the group and individual level. Methods: Forty-four male veterans with PTSD underwent baseline scanning followed by trauma-focused psychotherapy. Voxel-wise gray matter volumes were extracted from the structural MRI data and resting-state networks (RSNs) were calculated from rs-fMRI data using independent component analysis. Data were used to detect differences between responders and non-responders on the group level using permutation testing, and the single-subject level using Gaussian process classification with cross-validation. Results: A RSN centered on the bilateral superior frontal gyrus differed between responders and non-responder groups (PFWE &amp;lt; 0.05) while a RSN centered on the pre-supplementary motor area distinguished between responders and non-responders on an individual-level with 81.4% accuracy (P &amp;lt; 0.001, 84.8% sensitivity, 78% specificity and AUC of 0.93). No significant single-subject classification or group differences were observed for gray matter volume. Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of using rs-fMRI to develop neuroimaging biomarkers for treatment response, which could enable personalized treatment of patients with PTSD.</description>

	<description>Processing regular patterns in auditory scenes is important for navigating complex environments. Electroencephalography (EEG) studies find enhancement of sustained brain activity, correlating with the emergence of a regular pattern in sounds. How aging, aging-related diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), and treatment of PD affect this fundamental function remain unknown. We addressed this knowledge gap. Healthy younger and older adults, and PD patients listened to sounds that contained or were devoid of regular patterns. Healthy older adults and PD patients were tested twice - on and off dopaminergic medication in counterbalanced order. Regularity-evoked, sustained EEG activity was reduced in older, compared to younger adults. PD patients and older controls had comparable attenuation of the sustained response. Dopaminergic therapy further weakened the sustained response in both groups. These findings suggest that fundamental regularity processing is impacted by aging related neural changes but not those underlying PD. The finding that dopaminergic therapy attenuates rather than improves the sustained response coheres with the dopamine overdose response and implicates brain regions receiving dopamine from the ventral tegmental area in regularity processing.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Loss of the Alzheimer\'s-linked bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) protein affects synaptic structure and disrupts tau localisation and release</title>

	<description>Background: Post-translational modifications of tau modify its interaction with binding partners and cause tau mislocalisation and altered tau function in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The AD risk gene BIN1, is a binding partner for tau, however the mechanism by which BIN1 influences tau function is not fully understood. We hypothesised that BIN1 modulates AD risk by causing damaging tau mis-sorting to the synapse. Methods: Tau and BIN1 levels, distribution and interactions were assessed in post-mortem control and AD brain and in primary neurons. In primary neurons, tau was further examined using structured illumination microscopy and immunoblotting following BIN1 knockdown, BIN1-tau interactions were examined using proximity ligation assays and tau release from neurons was measured by sensitive sandwich ELISA. Results: Proline 216 in tau was identified as critical for tau interaction with the BIN1-SH3 domain, and tau phosphorylation at serine/threonine residues disrupted this interaction. Subcellular fractionation showed that BIN1 is lost from the cytoplasm of AD brain and this correlated with the mislocalisation of phosphorylated tau to synapses. Mimicking BIN1 loss in AD by knockdown of the protein in primary neurons altered the structure of dendritic spines, caused phosphorylated tau to mis-sort to synapses and reduced the physiological release of predominantly dephosphorylated tau. Conclusions: These data suggest that BIN1 loss in AD allows phosphorylated tau to be mis-sorted to synapses which likely alters the integrity of the post-synapse, alongside reducing the functionally important release of physiological forms of tau.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: BOLD and EEG Signal Variability at Rest Differently Relate to Aging in the Human Brain</title>

	<description>Variability of neural activity is regarded as a crucial feature of healthy brain function, and several neuroimaging approaches have been employed to assess it noninvasively. Studies on the variability of both evoked brain response and spontaneous brain signals have shown remarkable changes with aging but it is unclear if the different measures of brain signal variability - identified with either hemodynamic or electrophysiological methods - reflect the same underlying physiology. In this study, we aimed to explore age differences of spontaneous brain signal variability with two different imaging modalities (EEG, fMRI) in healthy younger (25{+/-}3 years, N=135) and older (67{+/-}4 years, N=54) adults. Consistent with the previous studies, we found lower blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) variability in the older subjects as well as less signal variability in the amplitude of low-frequency oscillations (1-12 Hz), measured in source space. These age-related reductions were mostly observed in the areas that overlap with the default mode network. Moreover, age-related increases of variability in the amplitude of beta-band frequency EEG oscillations (15-25 Hz) were seen predominantly in fronto-temporal and sensorimotor brain regions. There were significant sex differences in BOLD and EEG signal variability in various brain regions, but no significant interactions between age and sex were observed. Further, both univariate and multivariate correlation analyses revealed no significant associations between these two variability measures. In summary, we show that both BOLD and EEG signal variability reflect aging-related processes but are likely to be dominated by different physiological origins, which relate differentially to age and sex.</description>

	<description>Social isolation strongly modulates behavior across the animal kingdom. We utilized the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to study social isolation-driven changes in animal behavior and gene expression in the brain. RNA-seq identified several head-expressed genes strongly responding to social isolation or enrichment. Of particular interest, social isolation downregulated expression of the gene encoding the neuropeptide Drosulfakinin (Dsk), the homologue of vertebrate cholecystokinin (CCK), which is critical for many mammalian social behaviors. Dsk knockdown significantly increased social isolation-induced aggression. Genetic activation or silencing of Dsk neurons each similarly increased isolation-driven aggression. Our results suggest a U-shaped dependence of social isolation-induced aggressive behavior on Dsk signaling, similar to the actions of many neuromodulators in other contexts.</description>

	<description>In neurons, the specific spatial and temporal localization of protein synthesis is of great importance for function and survival. In this work, we visualized tRNA and protein synthesis events in fixed and live mouse primary cortical culture using fluorescently-labeled tRNAs. We were able to characterize the distribution and movement of tRNAs in different neuronal sub-compartments and to study their association with the ribosome. We found that tRNA motion in neural processes is lower than in somata and corresponds to patterns of slow transport mechanisms, and that larger tRNA puncta co-localize with translational machinery components and are likely the functional fraction. Furthermore, chemical induction of LTP in culture revealed GluR-dependent biphasic up-regulation of mRNA translation with a similar effect in dendrites and somata. Importantly, measurement of protein synthesis in neurons with high resolutions offers new insights into neuronal function in health and disease states.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Inhibition of de novo ceramide biosynthesis affects aging phenotype in an in vitro model of neuronal senescence</title>

	<description>Although aging is considered to be an unavoidable event, recent experimental evidence suggests that the process can be delayed, counteracted, if not completely interrupted. Aging is the primary risk factor for the onset and development of neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Intracellular calcium (Ca2+i) dyshomeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and lipid dysregulation are critical factors that contribute to senescence-related processes. Ceramides, a class of sphingolipids involved in a wide array of biological functions, are important mediators of cellular senescence, but their role in neuronal aging is still largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the effects of L-cycloserine (L-CS), an inhibitor of de novo ceramide biosynthesis, on the aging phenotype of cortical neurons that have been maintained in culture for 22 days, a setting employed as an in vitro model of cellular senescence. Our findings indicate that 'aged' neurons display, when compared to control cultures, overt dysregulation of cytosolic and subcellular [Ca2+]i levels, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species generation, altered synaptic activity as well as the activation of neuronal death-related molecules. Treatment with L-CS (30 M) positively affected the senescent phenotype, a result accompanied by recovery of neuronal [Ca2+]i signaling, and reduction of mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species generation. The results suggest that the de novo ceramide biosynthesis may represent a critical intermediate in the molecular and functional cascade leading to neuronal senescence. Our findings also identify ceramide biosynthesis inhibitors as promising pharmacological tools to decrease age-related neuronal dysfunctions.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/645499v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>It is an open question as to whether macroscopic human brain responses to repeatedly presented external inputs show consistent patterns across trials. We here provide experimental evidence that human brain responses to noisy time-varying visual inputs, as measured by scalp electroencephalography (EEG), show a signature of consistency. The results indicate that the EEG-recorded responses are robust against fluctuating ongoing activity, and that they respond to visual stimuli in a repeatable manner. This consistency presumably mediates robust information processing in the brain. Moreover, the EEG response waveforms were discriminable between individuals, and were invariant over a number of days within individuals. We reveal that time-varying noisy visual inputs can harness macroscopic brain dynamics and can manifest hidden individual variations.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/644849v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Altered neural dynamics in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus may contribute to cognitive impairments in the complex chromosomal disorder, Down Syndrome (DS). Here, we demonstrate non-overlapping behavioural differences associated with distinct abnormalities in hippocampal and mPFC electrophysiology during a canonical spatial memory task in three partially trisomic mouse models of DS (Dp1Tyb, Dp10Yey, Dp17Yey) that together cover all regions of homology with human chromosome 21 (Hsa21). Dp1Tyb mice showed slower decision-making (unrelated to the gene dose of DYRK1A, which has been implicated in DS cognitive dysfunction) and altered theta dynamics (reduced frequency, increased hippocampal-mPFC coherence, increased modulation of hippocampal high gamma); Dp10Yey mice showed impaired alternation performance and reduced theta modulation of hippocampal low gamma; while Dp17Yey mice were no different from wildtype mice. These results link specific hippocampal and mPFC circuit dysfunctions to cognitive deficits in DS models and, importantly, map them to discrete regions of Hsa21.</description>

	<description>Stimuli are represented in the brain by the collective population responses of sensory neurons, and an object presented under varying conditions gives rise to a collection of neural population responses called an 'object manifold.' Changes in the object representation along a hierarchical sensory system are associated with changes in the geometry of those manifolds, and recent theoretical progress connects this geometry with 'classification capacity,' a quantitative measure of the ability to support object classification. Deep neural networks trained on object classification tasks are a natural testbed for the applicability of this relation. We show how classification capacity improves along the hierarchies of deep neural networks with different architectures. We demonstrate that changes in the geometry of the associated object manifolds underlie this improved capacity, and shed light on the functional roles different levels in the hierarchy play to achieve it, through orchestrated reduction of manifolds' radius, dimensionality and inter-manifold correlations.</description>

	<description>Immediate early genes (IEGs) are transcribed in response to neural activity and necessary for many forms of plasticity. However, the dynamics of their expression during learning, as well as their relationship to neural activity, remain unclear. Here we used two-photon imaging in transgenic mice that express a GFP-tagged variant of Arc or c-Fos and a red-shifted calcium indicator to measure learning-related changes in IEG expression levels and neural activity in hippocampal region CA1 as mice learned to perform a two-alternative forced choice task. Neural activity levels correlated positively with IEG expression levels in vivo. In addition, we found that with learning, a subset of neurons in CA1 increased their responses to the reward-predicting cue, and IEG expression levels early in learning were selectively increased in neurons that would exhibit the strongest learning-related changes. Our findings are consistent with an interpretation of IEG expression levels as markers for experience dependent plasticity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Biological Aging in Childhood and Adolescence Following Experiences of Threat and Deprivation: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>

	<description>Life history theory argues that exposure to early-life adversity (ELA) accelerates development, although existing evidence for this varies. We present a meta-analysis and systematic review testing the hypothesis that ELA involving threat (e.g., violence exposure) will be associated with accelerated biological aging across multiple metrics, whereas exposure to deprivation (e.g., neglect, institutional rearing) and low-socioeconomic status (SES) will not. We meta-analyze 46 studies (n=64,925) examining associations of ELA with pubertal timing and cellular aging (telomere length and DNA methylation age), systematically review 19 studies (n=2276) examining ELA and neural markers of accelerated development (cortical thickness and amygdala-prefrontal cortex functional connectivity) and evaluate whether associations of ELA with biological aging vary according to the nature of adversity experienced. ELA overall was associated with accelerated pubertal timing (d=-0.12) and cellular aging (d=-0.32). Moderator analysis revealed that ELA characterized by threat (d=-0.26), but not deprivation or SES, was associated with accelerated pubertal development. Similarly, exposure to threat-related ELA was associated with accelerated cellular aging (d=-0.43), but not deprivation or SES. Systematic review revealed associations between ELA and accelerated cortical thinning, with threat-related ELA consistently associated with thinning in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and deprivation and SES associated with thinning in frontoparietal, default, and visual networks. There was no consistent association of ELA with amygdala-PFC connectivity. These findings suggest specificity in the types of early environmental experiences associated with accelerated biological aging and highlight the importance of evaluating how accelerated aging contributes to health disparities and whether this process can be mitigated through early intervention.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Noise-precision tradeoff in predicting combinations of mutations and drugs</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Avichai Tendler, Anat Zimmer, Avi Mayo, Uri Alon&lt;/p&gt;

Many biological problems involve the response to multiple perturbations. Examples include response to combinations of many drugs, and the effects of combinations of many mutations. Such problems have an exponentially large space of combinations, which makes it infeasible to cover the entire space experimentally. To overcome this problem, several formulae that predict the effect of drug combinations or fitness landscape values have been proposed. These formulae use the effects of single perturbations and pairs of perturbations to predict triplets and higher order combinations. Interestingly, different formulae perform best on different datasets. Here we use Pareto optimality theory to quantitatively explain why no formula is optimal for all datasets, due to an inherent bias-variance (noise-precision) tradeoff. We calculate the Pareto front of log-linear formulae and find that the optimal formula depends on properties of the dataset: the typical interaction strength and the experimental noise. This study provides an approach to choose a suitable prediction formula for a given dataset, in order to best overcome the combinatorial explosion problem.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mcVDX50DSXQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Hippocampal Mossy Fibers Synapses in CA3 Pyramidal Cells Are Altered at an Early Stage in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Early Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects the brain non-uniformly, causing hippocampal memory deficits long before wide-spread brain degeneration becomes evident. Here we addressed whether mossy fiber inputs from the dentate gyrus onto CA3 principal cells are affected in an AD mouse model before amyloid β plaque deposition. We recorded from CA3 pyramidal cells in a slice preparation from 6-month-old male APP/PS1 mice, and studied synaptic properties and intrinsic excitability. In parallel we performed a morphometric analysis of mossy fiber synapses following viral based labeling and 3D-reconstruction. We found that the basal structural and functional properties as well as presynaptic short-term plasticity at mossy fiber synapses are unaltered at 6 months in APP/PS1 mice. However, transient potentiation of synaptic transmission mediated by activity-dependent release of lipids was abolished. Whereas the presynaptic form of mossy fiber long-term potentiation (LTP) was not affected, the postsynaptic LTP of NMDAR-EPSCs was reduced. In addition, we also report an impairment in feedforward inhibition in CA3 pyramidal cells. This study, together with our previous work describing deficits at CA3–CA3 synapses, provides evidence that early AD affects synapses in a projection-dependent manner at the level of a single neuronal population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Because loss of episodic memory is considered the cognitive hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is important to study whether synaptic circuits involved in the encoding of episodic memory are compromised in AD mouse models. Here we probe alterations in the synaptic connections between the dentate gyrus and CA3, which are thought to be critical for enabling episodic memories to be formed and stored in CA3. We found that forms of synaptic plasticity specific to these synaptic connections are markedly impaired at an early stage in a mouse model of AD, before deposition of β amyloid plaques. Together with previous work describing deficits at CA3–CA3 synapses, we provide evidence that early AD affects synapses in an input-dependent manner within a single neuronal population.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Endothelial Adora2a Activation Promotes Blood-Brain Barrier Breakdown and Cognitive Impairment in Mice with Diet-Induced Insulin Resistance</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Obesity and insulin resistance elicit blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown in humans and animal models, but the relative contributions of the two pathologies remain poorly understood. These studies initially addressed the temporal progression of cerebrovascular dysfunction relative to dietary obesity or diet-induced insulin resistance in male mice. Obesity increased BBB permeability to the low molecular weight fluorophore sodium fluorescein (NaFl), whereas diet-induced insulin resistance increased permeability to both NaFl and Evans blue, which forms a high molecular weight complex with serum albumin. Serial section transmission electron microscopy analysis of hippocampal capillaries revealed that diabetes promotes involution of tight junctions, fenestration of endothelial cells, and pericyte regression. Chronic activation of adenosine receptor 2a (Adora2a) erodes tight junctions between endothelial cells of the cerebral vasculature in other models of chronic neuropathology, and we observed that acute Adora2a antagonism normalized BBB permeability in wild-type mice with diet-induced insulin resistance. Experiments in mice with inducible deletion of Adora2a in endothelial cells revealed protection against BBB breakdown with diet-induced insulin resistance, despite comparable metabolic dysfunction relative to nontransgenic littermates. Protection against BBB breakdown was associated with decreased vascular inflammation, recovery of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and restoration of hippocampus-dependent memory. These findings indicate that Adora2a-mediated signaling in vascular endothelial cells disrupts the BBB in dietary obesity, and implicate cerebrovascular dysfunction as the underlying mechanism for deficits in synaptic plasticity and cognition with obesity and insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The blood–brain barrier (BBB) restricts the entry of circulating factors into the brain, but obesity promotes BBB breakdown in humans and animal models. We used transgenic mice with resistance to BBB breakdown to investigate the role of neurovascular dysfunction in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced cognitive impairment. Transgenic mice with inducible ablation of Adora2a in endothelial cells were protected against BBB breakdown on HFD, despite comparable metabolic impairments relative to normal mice. Transgenic mice were also resistant to HFD-induced cognitive dysfunction and were protected against deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity. These findings indicate that Adora2a-mediated signaling in endothelial cells mediates obesity-induced BBB breakdown, and implicate cerebrovascular dysfunction as the mechanism for deficits in synaptic plasticity and cognition with obesity and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Kappa Opioid Receptors Drive a Tonic Aversive Component of Chronic Pain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/21/4162?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pain is a multidimensional experience and negative affect, or how much the pain is &quot;bothersome&quot;, significantly impacts the sufferers' quality of life. It is well established that the  opioid system contributes to depressive and dysphoric states, but whether this system contributes to the negative affect precipitated by the occurrence of chronic pain remains tenuous. Using a model of persistent pain, we show by quantitative real-time-PCR, florescence &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization, Western blotting and GTPgS autoradiography an upregulation of expression and the function of  opioid receptors (KORs) and its endogenous ligand dynorphin in the mesolimbic circuitry in animals with chronic pain compared with surgical controls. Using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microdialysis and microinjection of drugs into the mesolimbic dopamine system, we demonstrate that inhibiting KORs reinstates evoked dopamine release and reward-related behaviors in chronic pain animals. Chronic pain enhanced KOR agonist-induced place aversion in a sex-dependent manner. Using various place preference paradigms, we show that activation of KORs drives pain aversive states in male but not female mice. However, KOR antagonist treatment was effective in alleviating anxiogenic and depressive affective-like behaviors in both sexes. Finally, ablation of KORs from dopamine neurons using AAV-TH-cre in KOR&lt;sup&gt;loxP&lt;/sup&gt; mice prevented pain-induced aversive states as measured by place aversion assays. Our results strongly support the use of KOR antagonists as therapeutic adjuvants to alleviate the emotional, tonic-aversive component of chronic pain, which is argued to be the most significant component of the pain experience that impacts patients' quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We show that KORs are sufficient to drive the tonic-aversive component of chronic pain; the emotional component of pain that is argued to significantly impact a patient's quality of life. The impact of our study is broadly relevant to affective disorders associated with disruption of reward circuitry and thus likely contributes to many of the devastating sequelae of chronic pain, including the poor response to treatment of many patients, debilitating affective disorders (other disorders including anxiety and depression that demonstrate high comorbidity with chronic pain) and substance abuse. Indeed, coexisting psychopathology increases pain intensity, pain-related disability and effectiveness of treatments (Jamison and Edwards, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Attention Periodically Binds Visual Features As Single Events Depending on Neural Oscillations Phase-Locked to Action</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/21/4153?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent psychophysical studies have demonstrated that periodic attention in the 4–8 Hz range facilitates performance on visual detection. The present study examined the periodicity of feature binding, another major function of attention, in human observers (3 females and 5 males for behavior, with 7 males added for the EEG experiment). In a psychophysical task, observers reported a synchronous pair of brightness (light/dark) and orientation (clockwise/counterclockwise) patterns from two combined brightness–orientation pairs presented in rapid succession. We found that temporal binding performance exhibits periodic oscillations at ~8 Hz as a function of stimulus onset delay from a self-initiated button press in conditions where brightness–orientation pairs were spatially separated. However, as one would expect from previous studies on pre-attentive binding, significant oscillations were not apparent in conditions where brightness–orientation pairs were spatially superimposed. EEG results, while fully compatible with behavioral oscillations, also revealed a significant dependence of binding performance across trials on prestimulus neural oscillatory phases within the corresponding band. The peak frequency of this dependence was found to be correlated with intertrial phase coherence (ITPC) around the timing of button press in parietal sensors. Moreover, the peak frequency of the ITPC was found to predict behavioral frequency in individual observers. Together, these results suggest that attention operates periodically (at ~8 Hz) on the perceptual binding of multimodal visual information and is mediated by neural oscillations phase-locked to voluntary action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent studies in neuroscience suggest that the brain's attention network operates rhythmically at 4–8 Hz. The present behavioral task revealed that attentional binding of visual features is performed periodically at ~8 Hz, and EEG analysis showed a dependence of binding performance on prestimulus neural oscillatory phase. Furthermore, this association between perceptual and neural oscillations is triggered by voluntary action. Periodic processes driven by attention appear to contribute not only to sensory processing but also to the temporal binding of diverse information into a conscious event synchronized with action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cannabinoids Stimulate the TRP Channel-Dependent Release of Both Serotonin and Dopamine to Modulate Behavior in C. elegans</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/i&gt; alters sensory perception and exhibits potential medicinal benefits. In mammals, cannabinoids activate two canonical receptors, CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as well additional receptors/ion channels whose overall contributions to cannabinoid signaling have yet to be fully assessed. In &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, the endogenous cannabinoid receptor agonist, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) activates a CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ortholog, NPR-19, to modulate behavior (Oakes et al., 2017). In addition, 2-AG stimulates the NPR-19 independent release of both serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) from subsets of monoaminergic neurons to modulate locomotory behaviors through a complex monoaminergic signaling pathway involving multiple serotonin and dopamine receptors. 2-AG also inhibits locomotion in remodeled monoamine receptor mutant animals designed to measure the acute release of either 5-HT or DA, confirming the direct effects of 2-AG on monoamine release. 2-AG-dependent locomotory inhibition requires the expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and TRPN-like channels in the serotonergic or dopaminergic neurons, respectively, and the acute pharmacological inhibition of the TRPV1-like channel abolishes both 2-AG-dependent 5-HT release and locomotory inhibition, suggesting the 2-AG may activate the channel directly. This study highlights the advantages of identifying and assessing both CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent and independent cannabinoid signaling pathways in a genetically tractable, mammalian predictive model, where cannabinoid signaling at the molecular/neuronal levels can be correlated directly with changes in behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study is focused on assessing CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-independent cannabinoid signaling in a genetically tractable, whole-animal model where cannabinoid signaling at the molecular/neuronal levels can be correlated with behavioral change. &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; contains a cannabinoid signaling system mediated by a canonical cannabinoid receptor, NPR-19, with orthology to human CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Oakes et al., 2017). The present study has characterized an NPR-19-independent signaling pathway that involves the cannabinoid-dependent release of both serotonin and dopamine and the expression of distinct TRP-like channels on the monoaminergic neurons. Our work should be of interest to those studying the complexities of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-independent cannabinoid signaling, the role of TRP channels in the modulation of monoaminergic signaling, and the cannabinoid-dependent modulation of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Heightened Defensive Responses Following Subtotal Lesions of Macaque Orbitofrontal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/21/4133?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive attention to threat. Several brain areas, including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), have been associated with threat processing, with more recent work implicating specialized roles for the medial and lateral subregions of the OFC in mediating specific symptoms of anxiety disorders. Virtually no causal work, however, has evaluated the role of these OFC subregions in regulating behavioral responses under threat. To address this gap, we compared male rhesus monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;) with bilateral excitotoxic lesions restricted to either the lateral OFC (lOFC), targeting Walker's areas 11 and 13, or the medial OFC (mOFC), targeting Walker's area 14, to a group of unoperated controls on behavioral responses to the presentation of a fake rubber snake, fake spider, and neutral stimuli. Both lesion groups showed heightened defensive and reduced approach responses, accompanied by longer latencies to retrieve a food reward, in the presence of the threatening stimuli. Compared to unoperated controls, the mOFC lesion group also showed longer latencies to reach for rewards and a greater proportion of defensive responses (e.g., piloerection) in the presence of neutral stimuli. Thus, monkeys with mOFC lesions displayed a greater tendency to express defensive responses even in the absence of threat. Overall, our data reveal that both the mOFC and lOFC contribute to the attenuation of defensive responses. Notably, these findings, obtained following selective, excitotoxic lesions of the OFC, are diametrically opposed to the effects of aspiration lesions of OFC observed in macaques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Engaging in adaptive defensive responses under threat promotes biological fitness. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been implicated in regulating defensive responses to threat, with distinct subregions likely playing different roles. Here we tested the effects of excitotoxic damage restricted to either the lateral or medial subdivisions of the OFC in rhesus macaques. We found significantly heightened defense and reduced approach responses to threatening stimuli in both lesion groups. While lateral OFC lesions led to an increase in defense responses to the threatening stimuli, medial OFC lesions produced increases in defense responses to both threatening and neutral stimuli. Our findings provide insights into the neural regulation of defensive responses to threat and inform the etiology and treatment of anxiety disorders in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Critical Role for Human Ventromedial Frontal Lobe in Value Comparison of Complex Objects Based on Attribute Configuration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/21/4124?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/21/4124?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In making decisions, we often choose from among options with multiple value-relevant attributes. Neuroeconomic models propose that the value associated with each attribute is integrated in a global value for each option. However, some evidence from patients with ventromedial frontal lobe (VMF) damage argues against a very general role for this region in value integration, suggesting instead that it contributes critically to a specific value inference or comparison process. Here, we tested value-based decision-making involving artificial multiattribute objects in humans with focal damage to the VMF (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 12) compared with a healthy group matched for age and education (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 24) and with a group with frontal lobe damage sparing the VMF (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 12). In a &quot;configural&quot; condition, overall object value was predicted by the conjunction of two attributes, while in an &quot;elemental&quot; condition, object value could be assessed by combining the independent values of individual attributes. Patients with VMF damage were impaired in making choices when value was uniquely predicted by the configuration of attributes, but intact when choosing based on elemental attribute values. This is evidence that the VMF is critical for inferring the value of whole objects in a multiattribute choice. These findings have implications for models of value-based choice and add to emerging views of how this region may interact with medial temporal lobe systems involved in configural object processing and relational memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuroeconomic models propose that the ventromedial frontal lobe (VMF) supports multiattribute decisions by integrating the values of attributes. However, researchers have been uncertain about the underlying mechanisms for this process. Patients with VMF damage made multiattribute choices under two conditions: in one, attribute values could be summed to guide choice; in the other, value was predicted by the conjunction of attributes. VMF damage impaired only the latter. This argues that the VMF is critical for inferring value from configural information to guide multiattribute object choice. This region may be key for judging the emergent &quot;value of the forest,&quot; rather than for integrating the individual &quot;value of each tree.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Representations of Faces Are Tuned to Eye Movements</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/21/4113?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/21/4113?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Eye movements provide a functional signature of how human vision is achieved. Many recent studies have consistently reported robust idiosyncratic visual sampling strategies during face recognition. Whether these interindividual differences are mirrored by idiosyncratic neural responses remains unknown. To this aim, we first tracked eye movements of male and female observers during face recognition. Additionally, for every observer we obtained an objective index of neural face discrimination through EEG that was recorded while they fixated different facial information. We found that foveation of facial features fixated longer during face recognition elicited stronger neural face discrimination responses across all observers. This relationship occurred independently of interindividual differences in preferential facial information sampling (e.g., eye vs mouth lookers), and started as early as the first fixation. Our data show that eye movements play a functional role during face processing by providing the neural system with the information that is diagnostic to a specific observer. The effective processing of identity involves idiosyncratic, rather than universal face representations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When engaging in face recognition, observers deploy idiosyncratic fixation patterns to sample facial information. Whether these individual differences concur with idiosyncratic face-sensitive neural responses remains unclear. To address this issue, we recorded observers' fixation patterns, as well as their neural face discrimination responses elicited during fixation of 10 different locations on the face, corresponding to different types of facial information. Our data reveal a clear interplay between individuals' face-sensitive neural responses and their idiosyncratic eye-movement patterns during identity processing, which emerges as early as the first fixation. Collectively, our findings favor the existence of idiosyncratic, rather than universal face representations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Representation of Haltere Oscillations and Integration with Visual Inputs in the Fly Central Complex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/21/4100?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/21/4100?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The reduced hindwings of flies, known as halteres, are specialized mechanosensory organs that detect body rotations during flight. Primary afferents of the haltere encode its oscillation frequency linearly over a wide bandwidth and with precise phase-dependent spiking. However, it is not currently known whether information from haltere primary afferent neurons is sent to higher brain centers where sensory information about body position could be used in decision making, or whether precise spike timing is useful beyond the peripheral circuits that drive wing movements. We show that in cells in the central brain, the timing and rates of neural spiking can be modulated by sensory input from experimental haltere movements (driven by a servomotor). Using multichannel extracellular recording in restrained flesh flies (&lt;i&gt;Sarcophaga bullata&lt;/i&gt; of both sexes), we examined responses of central complex cells to a range of haltere oscillation frequencies alone, and in combination with visual motion speeds and directions. Haltere-responsive units fell into multiple response classes, including those responding to any haltere motion and others with firing rates linearly related to the haltere frequency. Cells with multisensory responses showed higher firing rates than the sum of the unisensory responses at higher haltere frequencies. They also maintained visual properties, such as directional selectivity, while increasing response gain nonlinearly with haltere frequency. Although haltere inputs have been described extensively in the context of rapid locomotion control, we find haltere sensory information in a brain region known to be involved in slower, higher-order behaviors, such as navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Many animals use vision for navigation; however, these cues must be interpreted in the context of the body's position. In mammalian brains, hippocampal cells combine visual and vestibular information to encode head direction. A region of the arthropod brain, known as the central complex (CX), similarly encodes heading information, but it is unknown whether proprioceptive information is integrated here as well. We show that CX neurons respond to input from halteres, specialized proprioceptors in flies that detect body rotations. These neurons also respond to visual input, providing one of the few examples of multiple sensory modalities represented in individual CX cells. Haltere stimulation modifies neural responses to visual signals, providing a mechanism for integrating vision with proprioception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Phase Locking of Auditory-Nerve Fibers Reveals Stereotyped Distortions and an Exponential Transfer Function with a Level-Dependent Slope</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/21/4077?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/21/4077?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Phase locking of auditory-nerve-fiber (ANF) responses to the fine structure of acoustic stimuli is a hallmark of the auditory system's temporal precision and is important for many aspects of hearing. Period histograms from phase-locked ANF responses to low-frequency tones exhibit spike-rate and temporal asymmetries, but otherwise retain an approximately sinusoidal shape as stimulus level increases, even beyond the level at which the mean spike rate saturates. This is intriguing because apical cochlear mechanical vibrations show little compression, and mechanoelectrical transduction in the receptor cells is thought to obey a static sigmoidal nonlinearity, which might be expected to produce peak clipping at moderate and high stimulus levels. Here we analyze phase-locked responses of ANFs from cats of both sexes. We show that the lack of peak clipping is due neither to ANF refractoriness nor to spike-rate adaptation on time scales longer than the stimulus period. We demonstrate that the relationship between instantaneous pressure and instantaneous rate is well described by an exponential function whose slope decreases with increasing stimulus level. Relatively stereotyped harmonic distortions in the input to the exponential can account for the temporal asymmetry of the period histograms, including peak splitting. We show that the model accounts for published membrane-potential waveforms when assuming a power-of-three, but not a power-of-one, relationship to exocytosis. Finally, we demonstrate the relationship between the exponential transfer functions and the sigmoidal pseudotransducer functions obtained in the literature by plotting the maxima and minima of the voltage responses against the maxima and minima of the stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Phase locking of auditory-nerve-fiber responses to the temporal fine structure of acoustic stimuli is important for many aspects of hearing, but the mechanisms underlying phase locking are not fully understood. Intriguingly, period histograms retain an approximately sinusoidal shape across sound levels, even when the mean rate has saturated. We find that neither refractoriness nor spike-rate adaptation is responsible for this behavior. Instead, the peripheral auditory system operates as though it contains an exponential transfer function whose slope changes with stimulus level. The underlying mechanism is distinct from the comparatively weak cochlear mechanical compression in the cochlear apex, and likely resides in the receptor cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Anti-Nogo-A Antibodies As a Potential Causal Therapy for Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction after Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/21/4066?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Loss of bladder control is common after spinal cord injury (SCI) and no causal therapies are available. Here we investigated whether function-blocking antibodies against the nerve-fiber growth inhibitory protein Nogo-A applied to rats with severe SCI could prevent development of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction. Bladder function of rats with SCI was repeatedly assessed by urodynamic examination in fully awake animals. Four weeks after SCI, detrusor sphincter dyssynergia had developed in all untreated or control antibody-infused animals. In contrast, 2 weeks of intrathecal anti-Nogo-A antibody treatment led to significantly reduced aberrant maximum detrusor pressure during voiding and a reduction of the abnormal EMG high-frequency activity in the external urethral sphincter. Anatomically, we found higher densities of fibers originating from the pontine micturition center in the lumbosacral gray matter in the anti-Nogo-A antibody-treated animals, as well as a reduced number of inhibitory interneurons in lamina X. These results suggest that anti-Nogo-A therapy could also have positive effects on bladder function clinically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; After spinal cord injury, loss of bladder control is common. Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia is a potentially life-threatening consequence. Currently, only symptomatic treatment options are available. First causal treatment options are urgently needed in humans. In this work, we show that function-blocking antibodies against the nerve-fiber growth inhibitory protein Nogo-A applied to rats with severe spinal cord injury could prevent development of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, in particular detrusor sphincter dyssynergia. Anti-Nogo-A therapy has entered phase II clinical trial in humans and might therefore soon be the first causal treatment option for neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Screen for Synaptic Growth Mutants Reveals Mechanisms That Stabilize Synaptic Strength</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/21/4051?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synapses grow, prune, and remodel throughout development, experience, and disease. This structural plasticity can destabilize information transfer in the nervous system. However, neural activity remains stable throughout life, implying that adaptive countermeasures exist that maintain neurotransmission within proper physiological ranges. Aberrant synaptic structure and function have been associated with a variety of neural diseases, including Fragile X syndrome, autism, and intellectual disability. We have screened 300 mutants in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larvae of both sexes for defects in synaptic growth at the neuromuscular junction, identifying 12 mutants with severe reductions or enhancements in synaptic growth. Remarkably, electrophysiological recordings revealed that synaptic strength was unchanged in all but one of these mutants compared with WT. We used a combination of genetic, anatomical, and electrophysiological analyses to illuminate three mechanisms that stabilize synaptic strength despite major disparities in synaptic growth. These include compensatory changes in (1) postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor abundance, (2) presynaptic morphology, and (3) active zone structure. Together, this characterization identifies new mutants with defects in synaptic growth and the adaptive strategies used by synapses to homeostatically stabilize neurotransmission in response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study reveals compensatory mechanisms used by synapses to ensure stable functionality during severe alterations in synaptic growth using the neuromuscular junction of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; as a model system. Through a forward genetic screen, we identify mutants that exhibit dramatic undergrown or overgrown synapses yet express stable levels of synaptic strength, with three specific compensatory mechanisms discovered. Thus, this study reveals novel insights into the adaptive strategies that constrain neurotransmission within narrow physiological ranges while allowing considerable flexibility in overall synapse number. More broadly, these findings provide insights into how stable synaptic function may be maintained in the nervous system during periods of intensive synaptic growth, pruning, and remodeling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Region- and Cell Type-Specific Facilitation of Synaptic Function at Destination Synapses Induced by Oligodendrocyte Depolarization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/21/4036?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/21/4036?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The axonal conduction of action potentials affects the absolute time it takes to transmit nerve impulses as well as temporal summation at destination synapses. At the physiological level, oligodendrocyte depolarization facilitates axonal conduction along myelinated fibers in the hippocampus; however, the functional significance of this facilitation is largely unknown. In this study, we examined the physiology of the facilitation of axonal conduction by investigating the changes in synaptic responses at destination synapses using male and female mice in which channelrhodopsin-2 expression was restricted to oligodendrocytes. The subiculum, one of the projection areas of the examined axons at the alveus of the hippocampus, is divided into three regions (proximal, mid, and distal) and contains two types of principal neurons: regular firing and bursting pyramidal cells. We found a significant increase in excitatory synaptic responses following optogenetic oligodendrocyte depolarization in bursting neurons at two of the three regions, but not in regular firing neurons at any region. The long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by theta burst stimulation at the synapses showing a significant increase was also enhanced after oligodendrocyte depolarization. Conversely, the reduction of oligodendrocyte depolarization during theta burst stimulation, which was achieved by photostimulation of archaerhodopsin-T expressed selectively on oligodendrocytes, reduced the magnitude of LTP. These results show that oligodendrocyte depolarization contributes to the fine control of synaptic activity between the axons they myelinate and targets subicular cells in a region- and cell type-specific manner, and suggest that oligodendrocyte depolarization during conditioning of stimuli is involved in the induction of LTP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; All activity in the nervous system depends on the propagation of action potentials. Changes in the axonal conduction of action potentials influence the timing of synaptic transmission and information processing in neural circuits. At the physiological level, oligodendrocyte depolarization facilitates axonal conduction along myelinated fibers. In this study, we investigated the functional significance of the facilitation of axonal conduction induced by physiological oligodendrocyte depolarization. Using optogenetics and electrophysiological recordings, we demonstrated that oligodendrocyte depolarization in mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 on oligodendrocytes increased excitatory synaptic responses and enhanced the induction of long-term potentiation at destination synapses in a region- and cell type-specific manner. This facilitation may have a hitherto unappreciated influence on the transfer of information between regions in the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Homeodomain Transcription Factor NKX2.1 Is Essential for the Early Specification of Melanocortin Neuron Identity and Activates Pomc Expression in the Developing Hypothalamus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/21/4023?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Food intake is tightly regulated by a group of neurons present in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, which release &lt;i&gt;Pomc&lt;/i&gt;-encoded melanocortins, the absence of which induces marked hyperphagia and early-onset obesity. Although the relevance of hypothalamic POMC neurons in the regulation of body weight and energy balance is well appreciated, little is known about the transcription factors that establish the melanocortin neuron identity during brain development and its phenotypic maintenance in postnatal life. Here, we report that the transcription factor NKX2.1 is present in mouse hypothalamic POMC neurons from early development to adulthood. Electromobility shift assays showed that NKX2.1 binds &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to NKX binding motifs present in the neuronal &lt;i&gt;Pomc&lt;/i&gt; enhancers nPE1 and nPE2 and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays detected &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; binding of NKX2.1 to nPE1 and nPE2 in mouse hypothalamic extracts. Transgenic and mutant studies performed in mouse embryos of either sex and adult males showed that the NKX motifs present in nPE1 and nPE2 are essential for their transcriptional enhancer activity. The conditional early inactivation of &lt;i&gt;Nkx2.1&lt;/i&gt; in the ventral hypothalamus prevented the onset of &lt;i&gt;Pomc&lt;/i&gt; expression. Selective &lt;i&gt;Nkx2.1&lt;/i&gt; ablation from POMC neurons decreased &lt;i&gt;Pomc&lt;/i&gt; expression in adult males and mildly increased their body weight and adiposity. Our results demonstrate that NKX2.1 is necessary to activate &lt;i&gt;Pomc&lt;/i&gt; expression by binding to conserved canonical NKX motifs present in nPE1 and nPE2. Therefore, NKX2.1 plays a critical role in the early establishment of hypothalamic melanocortin neuron identity and participates in the maintenance of &lt;i&gt;Pomc&lt;/i&gt; expression levels during adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Food intake and body weight regulation depend on hypothalamic neurons that release satiety-inducing neuropeptides, known as melanocortins. Central melanocortins are encoded by&lt;i&gt;Pomc&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Pomc&lt;/i&gt; mutations may lead to hyperphagia and severe obesity. Although the importance of central melanocortins is well appreciated, the genetic program that establishes and maintains fully functional POMC neurons remains to be explored. Here, we combined molecular, genetic, developmental, and functional studies that led to the discovery of NKX2.1, a transcription factor that participates in the early morphogenesis of the developing hypothalamus, as a key player in establishing the early identity of melanocortin neurons by activating &lt;i&gt;Pomc&lt;/i&gt; expression. Thus, &lt;i&gt;Nkx2.1&lt;/i&gt; adds to the growing list of genes that participate in body weight regulation and adiposity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dopamine Release Dynamics in the Tuberoinfundibular Dopamine System</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The relationship between neuronal impulse activity and neurotransmitter release remains elusive. This issue is especially poorly understood in the neuroendocrine system, with its particular demands on periodically voluminous release of neurohormones at the interface of axon terminals and vasculature. A shortage of techniques with sufficient temporal resolution has hindered real-time monitoring of the secretion of the peptides that dominate among the neurohormones. The lactotropic axis provides an important exception in neurochemical identity, however, as pituitary prolactin secretion is primarily under monoaminergic control, via tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA) neurons projecting to the median eminence (ME). Here, we combined electrical or optogenetic stimulation and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to address dopamine release dynamics in the male mouse TIDA system. Imposing different discharge frequencies during brief (3 s) stimulation of TIDA terminals in the ME revealed that dopamine output is maximal at 10 Hz, which was found to parallel the TIDA neuron action potential frequency distribution during phasic discharge. Over more sustained stimulation periods (150 s), maximal output occurred at 5 Hz, similar to the average action potential firing frequency of tonically active TIDA neurons. Application of the dopamine transporter blocker, methylphenidate, significantly increased dopamine levels in the ME, supporting a functional role of the transporter at the neurons' terminals. Lastly, TIDA neuron stimulation at the cell body yielded perisomatic release of dopamine, which may contribute to an ultrafast negative feedback mechanism to constrain TIDA electrical activity. Together, these data shed light on how spiking patterns in the neuroendocrine system translate to vesicular release toward the pituitary and identify how dopamine dynamics are controlled in the TIDA system at different cellular compartments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A central question in neuroscience is the complex relationship between neuronal discharge activity and transmitter release. By combining optogenetic stimulation and voltammetry, we address this issue in dopamine neurons of the neuroendocrine system, which faces particular spatiotemporal demands on exocytotic release; large amounts of neurohormone need to be secreted into the portal capillaries with precise timing to adapt to physiological requirements. Our data show that release is maximal around the neurons' default firing frequency. We further provide support for functional dopamine transport at the neurovascular terminals, shedding light on a long-standing controversy about the existence of neuroendocrine transmitter reuptake. Finally, we show that dopamine release occurs also at the somatodendritic level, providing a substrate for an ultrashort autoregulatory feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inappropriate and pathological aggression plays a leading role in the suffering and death of millions of people, and further places an untenable strain on the caregivers and families of those afflicted. In some cases, such as addictive drugs, aggression can be highly rewarding (appetitive) and continually pursued despite short- and long-term negative consequences. Similarly, recidivism (relapse) rates for repeat violent offenders are as high as relapse rates for drug addicts. Appetitive aggression and relapse to aggression seeking can be modeled in mice studies using conditioned place preference and self-administration procedures followed by a period of abstinence and subsequent tests for relapse to aggression preference and aggression seeking. These procedures allow for the study of the mechanisms that control the appetitive versus the consummatory (attack) phases of aggressive behavior. In this review, we first discuss the behavioral procedures developed to probe appetitive aggression in mouse models, spanning from Pavlovian to operant tasks, and we also describe the recently proposed phenomenon of &quot;aggression addiction.&quot; Next, we discuss the pharmacological and circuit mechanisms of aggression conditioned place preference and aggression self-administration, seeking, and relapse, highlighting mechanistic congruence and divergence between appetitive and consummatory phases of aggression. We conclude by discussing clinical implications of the studies reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Dendritic spines are the post-synaptic targets of excitatory synaptic inputs that undergo extensive proliferation and maturation during the first postnatal month in mice. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate spines during this critical period is limited. Previous work has shown that Pannexin 1 (Panx1) regulates neurite growth and synaptic plasticity. We therefore investigated the impact of global Panx1 KO on spontaneous cortical neuron activity using Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; network analysis. Panx1 KO increased both the number and size of spontaneous co-active cortical neuron network ensembles. To understand the basis for these findings, we investigated Panx1 expression in postnatal synaptosome preparations from early postnatal mouse cortex. Between 2 and 4 postnatal weeks, we observed a precipitous drop in cortical synaptosome protein levels of Panx1, suggesting it regulates synapse proliferation and/or maturation. At the same time points, we observed significant enrichment of the excitatory postsynaptic density proteins PSD-95, GluA1 and GluN2a in cortical synaptosomes from global Panx1 knockout mice. &lt;i&gt;Ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; analysis of pyramidal neuron structure in somatosensory cortex revealed a consistent increase in dendritic spine densities in both male and female Panx1 KO mice. Similar findings were observed in an excitatory neuron-specific Panx1 KO line (Emx1-Cre driven; Panx1 cKO&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;) and in primary Panx1 KO cortical neurons cultured &lt;i&gt;in vitro.&lt;/i&gt; Altogether, our study suggests that Panx1 negatively regulates cortical dendritic spine development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Our findings reveal an important regulatory role for Pannexin 1 (Panx1) in the formation of connections between nerve cells. We found that removal of the Panx1 altered the ability of nerve cells from the cerebral cortex to fire together. We studied the impact of removing Panx1 on the formation of 'dendritic spines', which are microscopic protrusions that receive information from other nerve cells. We found that removing Panx1 increased the expression of proteins involved in dendritic spine function and also increased the density of dendritic spines on nerve cells of the cerebral cortex. Together these findings suggest Panx1 is a 'brake' on the development of dendritic spines with important implications for the development of nerve cell connections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The Golgi apparatus plays an indispensable role in posttranslational modification and transport of proteins to their target destinations. Although it is well established that the Golgi apparatus requires an acidic luminal pH for optimal activity, morphological and functional abnormalities at the neuronal circuit level because of perturbations in Golgi pH are not fully understood. In addition, morphological alteration of the Golgi apparatus is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Here, we used anatomical and electrophysiological approaches to characterize morphological and functional abnormalities of neuronal circuits in Golgi pH regulator conditional knockout mice. Purkinje cells (PCs) from the mutant mice exhibited vesiculation and fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus, followed by axonal degeneration and progressive cell loss. Morphological analysis provided evidence for the disruption of basket cell (BC) terminals around PC soma, and electrophysiological recordings showed selective loss of large amplitude responses, suggesting BC terminal disassembly. In addition, the innervation of mutant PCs was altered such that climbing fiber terminals abnormally synapsed on the somatic spines of mutant PCs in the mature cerebellum. The combined results describe an essential role for luminal acidification of the Golgi apparatus in maintaining proper neuronal morphology and neuronal circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The Golgi luminal acidic condition is essential for normal activity of the Golgi apparatus and its dysregulation contributes to several human diseases. In neurons, however, pharmacological tools cannot be used for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies because they lack specificity. Here, the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; role of Golgi luminal acidification by inactivation of the Golgi pH regulator (GPHR) in cerebellar neurons is reported. The GPHR is indispensable for neuronal survival, normal Golgi morphology and axonal integrity. Intriguingly, after formation of Pinceau structures, basket cells exhibited significant loss of function, resulting in an alteration of neuronal circuitry around Purkinje cells. These results highlight an essential role of the Golgi luminal pH in the maintenance of gross axonal morphology and subcellular structures in Purkinje cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a great opportunity to recapitulate both normal and pathological development of brain tissues. Recently, three research teams have developed human-PSC technology and direct somatic cell reprogramming to allow induction of human serotonin (5-HT; 5-hydroxytryptamine) neurons in vitro. While preclinical studies have repeatedly shown that 5-HT suppresses 5-HT neuronal firing activity, one group has tested the effect of 5-HT on the neuronal activity of those 5-HT-like cells and found a paradoxical excitatory action of 5-HT. Here, we argue that few cautions in translational interpretations have to be taken into account. Nonetheless, utilizing patient-derived cells for generating disease relevant cell types truly offers a new and powerful approach for investigating mechanisms playing fundamental roles in psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Critical Analysis of Particle Detection Artifacts in Synaptosome Flow Cytometry</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated sorting are powerful techniques that hold great promise for studying heterogeneous populations of submicron particles such as synaptosomes, but many technical challenges arise in these experiments. To date, most flow cytometry studies of synaptosomes have relied on particle detection using forward scatter (FSC) measurements and size estimation with polystyrene (PS) bead standards. However, these practices have serious limitations, and special care must be taken to overcome the poor sensitivity of conventional flow cytometers in the analysis of submicron particles. Technical artifacts can confound these experiments, especially the detection of multiple particles as a single event. Here, we compared analysis of P2 crude synaptosomal preparations from murine forebrain on multiple flow cytometers using both FSC- and fluorescence-triggered detection. We implemented multicolor fluorescent dye-based assays to quantify coincident particle detection and aggregation, and we assessed the false colocalization of antigens in immunostaining analyses. Our results demonstrate that fluorescence-triggering and proper dilution can control for coincident particle detection, but not particle aggregation. We confirmed previous studies showing that FSC-based size estimation with PS beads underestimates biological particle size, and we identified pervasive aggregation in the FSC range analyzed in most synaptosome flow cytometry studies. We found that analyzing P2 samples in sucrose/tris/EDTA (SET) buffer reduces aggregation compared to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), but does not completely eliminate the presence of aggregates, especially in immunostaining experiments. Our study highlights challenges and pitfalls in synaptosome flow cytometry and provides a methodological framework for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Synaptosomes are an invaluable model for synaptic biology, but these synaptic particles are traditionally analyzed in bulk preparations rather than at the level of single particles. Although flow cytometry is a powerful technique for high throughput particle analysis, submicron particles present unique challenges. Here, the authors investigate key elements of synaptosome flow cytometry experiments, especially those related to artifacts that confound the analysis of single synaptosomes. They identify aggregation as especially problematic and implement methods to minimize its impact on flow cytometry analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Genetic risk of dementia mitigated by cognitive reserve: A cohort study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25501?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25501?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated whether cognitive reserve modifies the risk of dementia attributable to apolipoprotein ε4 (&lt;i&gt;APOE‐&lt;/i&gt;ε4), a well‐known genetic risk factor for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We followed 2,556 cognitively intact participants aged ≥60 years from the ongoing prospective community‐based Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC‐K). Dementia was ascertained through clinical and neuropsychological assessments and diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition criteria. Structural equation modeling was used to generate a cognitive reserve indicator from 4 previously validated contributors: early life education, midlife substantive work complexity, late life leisure activities, and late life social networks. Cox proportional hazard models estimated dementia risk in relation to cognitive reserve indicator. The interaction between the cognitive reserve indicator and &lt;i&gt;APOE‐&lt;/i&gt;ε4 was assessed on multiplicative and additive scales.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an average of 6.3 years (range = 2.1–10.7) of follow‐up, 232 dementia cases were ascertained. Relative to individuals in the lowest tertile of cognitive reserve indicator, those with moderate and high reserve were at a reduced risk of dementia. There was no multiplicative interaction between &lt;i&gt;APOE‐&lt;/i&gt;ε4 status and cognitive reserve indicator (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.113). Additive interaction was statistically significant. Relative to &lt;i&gt;APOE‐&lt;/i&gt;ε4 carriers with low cognitive reserve, ε4 carriers with high reserve had a reduced risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.13–0.59). The magnitude of risk reduction was similar in ε4 noncarriers with a high cognitive reserve indicator (HR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.15–0.40).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifelong engagement in reserve‐enhancing activities attenuates the risk of dementia attributable to &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;‐ε4. Promoting cognitive reserve might be especially effective in subpopulations with high genetic risk of dementia. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Formation of synapses between neurons depends in part on binding between axonal and dendritic cell surface synaptic organizing proteins, which recruit components of the developing presynaptic and postsynaptic specializations. One of these presynaptic organizing molecules is protein tyrosine phosphatase σ (PTPσ). Although the protein domains involved in adhesion between PTPσ and its postsynaptic binding partners are known, the mechanisms by which it signals into the presynaptic neuron to recruit synaptic vesicles and other necessary components for regulated transmitter release are not well understood. One attractive candidate to mediate this function is liprin-α, a scaffolding protein with well-established roles at the synapse. We systematically mutated residues of the PTPσ intracellular region and used the yeast dihydrofolate reductase protein complementation assay to screen for disrupted interactions between these mutant forms of PTPσ and its various binding partners. Using a molecular replacement strategy, we show that disrupting the interaction between PTPσ and liprin-α, but not between PTPσ and itself or another binding partner, caskin, abolishes presynaptic differentiation. Furthermore, phosphatase activity of PTPσ and binding to extracellular heparan sulfate proteoglycans are dispensable for presynaptic induction. Previous reports have suggested that binding between PTPσ and liprin-α is mediated by the PTPσ membrane-distal phosphatase-like domain. However, we provide evidence here that both of the PTPσ phosphatase-like domains mediate binding to liprin-α and are required for PTPσ-mediated presynaptic differentiation. These findings further our understanding of the mechanistic basis by which PTPσ acts as a presynaptic organizer.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Putting the “Sensory” Into Sensorimotor Control: The Role of Sensorimotor Integration in Goal-Directed Hand Movements After Stroke</title>

	<description>Integration of sensory and motor information is one-step, among others, that underlies the successful production of goal-directed hand movements necessary for interacting with our environment. Disruption of sensorimotor integration is prevalent in many neurologic disorders, including stroke. In most stroke survivors, persistent paresis of the hand reduces function and overall quality of life. Current rehabilitative methods are based on neuroplastic principles to promote motor learning that focus on regaining motor function lost due to paresis, but the sensory contributions to motor control and learning are often overlooked and currently understudied. There is a need to evaluate and understand the contribution of both sensory and motor function in the rehabilitation of skilled hand movements after stroke. Here, we will highlight the importance of integration of sensory and motor information to produce skilled hand movements in healthy individuals and individuals after stroke. We will then discuss how compromised sensorimotor integration influences relearning of skilled hand movements after stroke. Finally, we will propose an approach to target sensorimotor integration through manipulation of sensory input and motor output that may have therapeutic implications.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Amide Proton Transfer Contrast Distribution in Different Brain Regions in Young Healthy Subjects</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00520</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00520</link>
	<description>Objectives
To define normal signal intensity values of amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in different brain regions.
Materials and Methods
Twenty healthy subjects (9 females, mean age 29 years, range 19 – 37 years) underwent MR imaging at 3 Tesla. 3D APTw (RF saturation B1,rms = 2 T, duration 2 s, 100% duty cycle) and 2D T2-weighted turbo spin echo images were acquired. Postprocessing (image fusion, ROI measurements of APTw intensity values in 22 different brain regions) was performed and controlled by two independent neuroradiologists. Values were measured separately for each brain hemisphere. A subject was scanned both in prone and supine position to investigate differences between hemispheres. A mixed model on a 5% significance level was used to assess the effect of gender, brain region and side on APTw intensity values.
Results
Mean APTw intensity values in the hippocampus and amygdala varied between 1.13 - 1.57%, in the deep subcortical nuclei (putamen, globus pallidus, head of caudate nucleus, thalamus, red nucleus, substantia nigra) between 0.73 - 1.84%, in the frontal, occipital and parietal cortex between 0.56 - 1.03%; in the insular cortex between 1.11 - 1.15%, in the temporal cortex between 1.22 - 1.37%, in the frontal, occipital and parietal white matter between 0.32 - 0.54% and in the temporal white matter between 0.83 - 0.89%.
APTw intensity values were significantly impacted both by brain region (p&amp;lt;0.001) and by side (p&amp;lt;0.001), whereby overall values on the left side were higher than on the right side (1.13 vs 0.9%). Gender did not significantly impact APTw intensity values (p=0.24). APTw intensity values between the left and the right side were reversed after changing the position of one subject from supine to prone.
Conclusions
We determined normal baseline APTw intensity values in different anatomical localisations in healthy subjects. APTw intensity values differed both between anatomical regions and between left and right brain hemisphere.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Obesity as a Risk Factor for Alzheimer’s Disease: Implication of Leptin and Glutamate</title>

	<description>Obesity is known to induce leptin and insulin resistance. Leptin is a peptide hormone synthesized in adipose tissue that mainly regulates food intake. It has been shown that insulin stimulates the production of leptin when adipocytes are exposed to glucose to encourage satiety; while leptin, via a negative feedback, decreases the insulin release and enhances tissue sensitivity to it, leading to glucose uptake for energy utilization or storage. Therefore, resistance to insulin is closely related to leptin resistance. Obesity in middle age has also been related to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In recent years, the relation between impaired leptin signaling pathway and the onset of AD has been studied. In all this context the role of the blood brain barrier (BBB) is crucial. Slow excitotoxicity happens in AD due to an excess of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Since leptin has been shown to regulate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, we want to review the link between these pathological pathways, and how they are affected by other AD triggering factors and its role in the onset of AD.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: A Simplified Crossing Fiber Model in Diffusion Weighted Imaging</title>

	<description>1.	Abstract

Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a vital source of imaging data for identifying anatomical connections in the living human brain that form the substrate for information transfer between brain regions. dMRI can thus play a central role towards our understanding of brain function. The quantitative modeling and analysis of dMRI data deduces the features of neural fibers at the voxel level, such as direction and density. The modeling methods that have been developed range from deterministic to probabilistic approaches. Currently, the Ball-and-Stick model serves as a widely implemented probabilistic approach in the tractography toolbox of the popular FSL software package and FreeSurfer/TRACULA software package. However, estimation of the features of neural fibers is complex under the scenario of two crossing neural fibers, which occurs in a sizeable proportion of voxels within the brain. A Bayesian non-linear regression is adopted, comprised of a mixture of multiple nonlinear components. Such models can pose a difficult statistical estimation problem computationally. To make the approach of Ball-and-Stick model more feasible and accurate, we propose a simplified version of Ball-and-Stick model that reduces parameter space dimensionality. This simplified model is vastly more efficient in the terms of computation time required in estimating parameters pertaining to two crossing neural fibers through Bayesian simulation approaches. Moreover, the performance of this new model is comparable or better in terms of bias and estimation variance as compared to existing models.</description>

	<description>Japanese martial arts, Budo, have been reported to improve cognitive function, especially attention. However, the underlying neural mechanisms of the effect of Budo on attention processing has not yet been investigated. Kendo, a type of fencing using bamboo swords, is one of the most popular forms of Budo worldwide. We investigated the difference in functional connectivity (FC) between Kendo players (KPs) and non-Kendo players (NKPs) during an attention-related auditory oddball paradigm and during rest. The analyses focused on the brain network related to “motivation”. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and task-based fMRI using the oddball paradigm were performed in healthy male volunteers (14 KPs and 11 NKPs). Group differences in FC were tested using CONN-software within the motivation network, which consisted of 22 brain regions defined by a previous response-conflict task-based fMRI study with a reward cue. Daily general physical activities were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). We also investigated the impact of major confounders, namely, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, IPAQ score, body mass index, and reaction time (RT) in the oddball paradigm. Resting-state fMRI revealed that KPs had a significantly lower FC than NKPs between the right nucleus accumbens and right frontal eye field within the motivation network. Conversely, KPs exhibited a significantly higher FC than NKPs between the left intraparietal sulcus and the left precentral gyrus within the network during the auditory oddball paradigm (statistical thresholds, FDR &amp;lt; 0.05). These results remained significant after controlling for major covariates. Our results suggest that attenuated motivation network integrity at rest together with enhanced motivation network integrity during attentional demands might underlie the instantaneous concentration abilities of KPs.</description>

	<description>Creativity has been defined as requiring both novelty and effectiveness, but little is known about how this standard definition applies in music. Here we present results from a pilot study in which we combine behavioral testing in musical improvisation and structural neuroimaging to relate brain structure to performance in a creative musical improvisation task. Thirty-eight subjects completed a novel improvisation continuation task and underwent T1 MRI. Recorded performances were rated by expert jazz instructors for creativity. Voxel-based morphometric analyses on T1 data showed that creativity ratings were negatively associated with grey matter volume in the right inferior temporal gyrus and bilateral hippocampus. The duration of improvisation training, which was significantly correlated with creativity ratings, was negatively associated with grey matter volume in the rolandic operculum. Together, results show that musical improvisation ability and training are associated with grey matter volume in regions that are previously linked to learning and memory formation, perceptual categorization, and sensory integration. The present study takes a first step towards understanding the neuroanatomical basis of musical creativity by relating creative musical improvisation to individual differences in grey matter structure.</description>

	<description>Brain oscillations and connectivity have emerged as promising measures of evaluating memory processes, including encoding, maintenance, and retrieval, as well as the related executive function. Although many studies have addressed the neural mechanisms underlying working memory, most of these studies have focused on the visual modality. Neurodynamics and functional connectivities related to auditory working memory have yet been well established. In this study, we explored the dynamic of high density (128-channel) electroencephalography (EEG) in a musical delayed match-to-sample task (DMST), in which thirty-six participants were recruited and were instructed to recognize and distinguish the target melodies from similar distractors. Event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs), event-related phase-amplitude coupling (ERPAC), and phase-locking value (PLV) were used to determine the corresponding brain oscillations and connectivities. First, we observed that low-frequency oscillations in the frontal, temporal, and parietal regions were increased during the processing of both target and distracting melodies. Second, cross-frequency coupling between low-frequency phase and high-frequency amplitude was elevated in the frontal and parietal regions when the participants were distinguishing between the target and distractor, suggesting that phase-amplitude coupling could be an indicator of the neural mechanisms underlying memory retrieval. Finally, phase-locking, an index evaluating brain functional connectivity, revealed that there was fronto-temporal phase-locking in theta band and fronto-parietal phase-locking in alpha band during the recognition of both the two stimuli. These findings suggest the existence of functional connectivity and phase-amplitude coupling in the neocortex during musical memory retrieval, and provide a highly resolved timeline to evaluate brain dynamics. Furthermore, inter-regional phase-locking and phase-amplitude coupling among the frontal, temporal and parietal regions occurred at the very beginning of musical memory retrieval, which might reflect the precise timing when cognitive resources are involved in the retrieval of targets and the rejection of similar distractions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first EEG study employing a naturalistic task to study auditory memory processes and functional connectivity during memory retrieval, by which can shed light on the use of natural stimuli in studies that are closer to the real-life applications of cognitive evaluations, mental treatments, and brain-computer interface.</description>

	<description>Monitoring the hypnotic component of anesthesia during surgeries is critical to prevent intraoperative awareness and reduce adverse side effects. For this purpose, electroencephalographic methods complementing measures of autonomic functions and behavioral responses are in use in clinical practice. However, in human neonates and infants existing methods may be unreliable and the correlation between brain activity and anesthetic depth is still poorly understood. Here, we characterize the effects of different anesthetics on activity of several brain areas in neonatal mice and develop machine learning approaches to identify electrophysiological features predicting inspired or end-tidal anesthetic concentration as a proxy for anesthetic depth. We show that similar features from electroencephalographic recordings can be applied to predict anesthetic concentration in neonatal mice, and human neonates and infants. These results might support a novel strategy to monitor anesthetic depth in human newborns.</description>

	<description>ABSTRACT 
Growing evidence suggests that synaptic signalling is compromised in the ageing brain and in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), contributing to synaptic decline. Wnt signalling is a prominent pathway at the synapse and is required for synaptic plasticity and maintenance in the adult brain. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge on deregulation of Wnt signalling in the context of ageing and AD. Emerging studies suggest that enhancing Wnt signalling could boost synaptic function during ageing, and ameliorate synaptic pathology in AD. Although further research is needed to determine the precise contribution of deficient Wnt signalling to AD pathogenesis, targeting Wnt signalling components may provide novel therapeutic avenues for synapse protection or restoration in the brain.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cochlea-Specific Deletion of Cav1.3 Calcium Channels Arrests Inner Hair Cell Differentiation and Unravels Pitfalls of Conditional Mouse Models</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00225</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00225</link>
	<description>Inner hair cell (IHC) Cav1.3 Ca2+ channels are multifunctional channels mediating Ca2+ influx for exocytosis at ribbon synapses, the generation of Ca2+ action potentials in pre-hearing IHCs and gene expression. IHCs of deaf systemic Cav1.3-deficient (Cav1.3-/-) mice stay immature because they fail to up-regulate voltage- and Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels but persistently express small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK2) channels. In pre-hearing wildtype mice, cholinergic neurons from the superior olivary complex (SOC) exert efferent inhibition onto spontaneously active immature IHCs by activating their SK2 channels. Because Cav1.3 plays an important role for survival, health and function of superior olivary complex (SOC) neurons, SK2 channel persistence and lack of BK channels in systemic Cav1.3-/- IHCs may result from malfunctioning neurons of the SOC. Here we analyze cochlea-specific Cav1.3 knockout mice with green fluorescent protein (GFP) switch reporter function, Pax2::cre;Cacna1d-eGFPflex/flex and Pax2::cre;Cacna1d-eGFPflex/-. Profound hearing loss, lack of BK channels and persistence of SK2 channels in Pax2::cre;Cacna1d-eGFPflex/- mice recapitulated the phenotype of systemic Cav1.3-/- mice, indicating that in wildtype mice, regulation of SK2 and BK channel expression is independent of Cav1.3 expression in SOC neurons. In addition, we noticed dose-dependent GFP toxicity leading to death of basal coil IHCs of Pax2::cre;Cacna1d-eGFPflex/flex mice, likely because of high GFP concentration and small repair capacity. This and the slower time course of Pax2-driven Cre recombinase in switching two rather than one Cacna1d-eGFPflex allele lead us to study Pax2::cre;Cacna1d-eGFPflex/- mice. Notably, control Cacna1d-eGFPflex/- IHCs showed a significant reduction in Cav1.3 channel cluster sizes and currents, suggesting that the intronic construct interfered with gene translation or splicing. These pitfalls are likely to be a frequent problem of many genetically modified mice with complex or multiple gene-targeting constructs or fluorescent proteins. Great caution and appropriate controls are therefore required.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Effects of Surgical Antiseptics and Time Delays on RNA Isolated From Human and Rodent Peripheral Nerves</title>

	<description>Peripheral Nerve Injury (PNI) is common following blunt or penetrating trauma with an estimated prevalence of 2% among the trauma population. The resulting economic and societal impacts are significant.

Nerve regeneration is a key biological process in those recovering from neural trauma. Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) and RNA sequencing (RNA seq) are investigative methods that are often deployed by researchers to characterise the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underpin this process. However, the ethical and practical challenges associated with studying human nerve injury have meant that studies of nerve injury have largely been limited to rodent models of reinnervation. 

In some circumstances it is possible to liberate human nerve tissue for study, for example during reconstructive nerve repair. This complex surgical environment affords numerous challenges for optimising the yield of RNA in sufficient quantity and quality for downstream RT-qPCR and/or RNA seq applications. This study characterised the effect of: 1) Time delays between surgical liberation and cryopreservation and 2) contact with antiseptic surgical reagents, on the quantity and quality of RNA isolated from human and rodent nerve samples.

It was found that time delays of greater than 3 minutes between surgical liberation and cryopreservation of human nerve samples significantly decreased RNA concentrations to be sub-optimal for downstream RT-qPCR/RNA seq applications (&amp;lt;5 ng/µl). Minimising the exposure of human nerve samples to antiseptic surgical reagents significantly increased yield of RNA isolated from samples. The detrimental effect of antiseptic reagents on RNA yield was further confirmed in a rodent model where RNA yield was impaired by 8.3-fold lower compared to non-exposed samples.

In summary, this study has shown that changes to the surgical tissue collection protocol can have significant effects on the yield of RNA isolated from nerve samples. This will enable the optimisation of protocols in future studies, facilitating characterisation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underpin the regenerative capacity of the human peripheral nervous system.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Corticotectal Projections From the Premotor or Primary Motor Cortex After Cortical Lesion or Parkinsonian Symptoms in Adult Macaque Monkeys: A Pilot Tracing Study</title>

	<description>The corticotectal projections, together with the corticobulbar (corticoreticular) projections, work in parallel with the corticospinal tract to influence motoneurons in the spinal cord both directly and indirectly via the brainstem descending pathways. The tectospinal tract originates in the deep layers of the superior colliculus. In the present study we analysed the corticotectal projections from two motor cortical areas, namely the premotor cortex (PM) and the primary motor cortex (M1) in eight macaque monkeys subjected to either a cortical lesion of the hand area in M1 (n=4) or Parkinson’s disease-like symptoms PD (n=4). A subgroup of monkeys with cortical lesion was subjected to anti-Nogo-A antibody treatment whereas all PD monkeys were transplanted with Autologous Neural Cell Ecosystems (ANCE). The anterograde tracer BDA was used to label the axonal boutons both en passant and terminaux in the ipsilateral superior colliculus. Individual axonal boutons were charted in the different layers of the superior colliculus. In intact animals, we previously observed that corticotectal projections were denser when originating from PM than from M1. In the present M1 lesioned monkeys, as compared to intact ones the corticotectal projection originating from PM was decreased when treated with anti-Nogo-A antibody but not in untreated monkeys. In PD-like symptoms’ monkeys, on the other hand, there was no consistent change affecting the corticotectal projection as compared to intact monkeys. The present pilot study overall suggests that the corticotectal projection is less affected by M1 lesion or PD symptoms than the corticoreticular projection previously reported in the same animals.</description>

	<description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been associated with dysregulation of brain cholesterol homeostasis. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), beyond the known role in the regulation of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, was firstly identified in the brain with a potential involvement on brain development and apoptosis. However, its role in the central nervous system and in AD pathogenesis is still far from being understood. While in vitro and in vivo evidence led to controversial results, genetic studies did not apparently find an association between PCSK9 loss of function mutations and AD risk or prevalence. In addition, a potential impairment of cognitive performances by the treatment with the PCSK9 inhibitors alirocumab and evolocumab, have been excluded, although ongoing studies with longer follow-up will provide further insights. PCSK9 is able to affect the expression of neuronal receptors involved in cholesterol homeostasis and neuroinflammation and higher PCSK9 concentrations have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients. In this review, we critically examined the science of PCSK9 with respect to its modulatory role of the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD. In addition, based on literature data, we made the hypothesis to consider brain PCSK9 as a negative modulator of brain cholesterol homeostasis and neuroinflammation and a potential pharmacological target for treatment.</description>

	<description>Recent works have extensively investigated the possibility to predict brain aging from T1-weighted MRI brain scans. The main purposes of these studies are the investigation of subject-specific aging mechanisms and the development of accurate models for age prediction. Deviations between predicted and chronological age are known to occur in several neurodegenerative diseases; as a consequence, reaching higher levels of age prediction accuracy is of paramount importance to develop diagnostic tools. In this work, we propose a novel complex network model for brain based on segmenting T1-weighted MRI scans in rectangular boxes, called patches, and measuring pairwise similarities using Pearson's correlation to define a subject-specific connectivity network. We fed a deep neural network with nodal metrics, evaluating both the intensity and the uniformity of connections, to predict subjects' ages. Our model reaches high accuracies which compare favorably with state-of-the-art approaches. We observe that the complex relationships involved in this brain description cannot be accurately modeled with standard machine learning approaches, such as Ridge and Lasso regression, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines, instead a deep neural network has to be used.</description>

	<description>Centrioles play critical roles in organizing the assembly of the mitotic spindle and templating the formation of primary cilia. Centriole duplication occurs once per cell cycle and is regulated by Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4). Although significant progress has been made in understanding centriole composition, we have limited knowledge of how PLK4 activity controls specific steps in centriole formation. Here we show that PLK4 phosphorylates its centriole substrate STIL on a conserved site, S428, to promote STIL binding to CPAP. This phospho-dependent binding interaction is conserved in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; and facilitates the stable incorporation of both STIL and CPAP into the centriole. We propose that procentriole assembly requires PLK4 to phosphorylate STIL in two different regions: phosphorylation of residues in the STAN motif allow STIL to bind SAS6 and initiate cartwheel assembly, while phosphorylation of S428 promotes the binding of STIL to CPAP, linking the cartwheel to microtubules of the centriole wall.</description>

	<description>During their final maturation in the cytoplasm, pre-60S ribosomal particles are converted to translation-competent large ribosomal subunits. Here, we present the mechanism of peptidyltransferase centre (PTC) completion that explains how integration of the last ribosomal proteins is coupled to release of the nuclear export adaptor Nmd3. Single-particle cryo-EM reveals that eL40 recruitment stabilizes helix 89 to form the uL16 binding site. The loading of uL16 unhooks helix 38 from Nmd3 to adopt its mature conformation. In turn, partial retraction of the L1 stalk is coupled to a conformational switch in Nmd3 that allows the uL16 P-site loop to fully accommodate into the PTC where it competes with Nmd3 for an overlapping binding site (base A2971). Our data reveal how the central functional site of the ribosome is sculpted and suggest how the formation of translation-competent 60S subunits is disrupted in leukaemia-associated ribosomopathies.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Structure of the gene therapy vector, adeno-associated virus with its cell receptor, AAVR</title>

	<description>Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are preeminent in emerging clinical gene therapies. Generalizing beyond the most tractable genetic diseases will require modulation of cell specificity and immune neutralization. Interactions of AAV with its cellular receptor, AAVR, are key to understanding cell-entry and trafficking with the rigor needed to engineer tissue-specific vectors. &lt;i&gt;Cryo&lt;/i&gt;-electron tomography shows ordered binding of part of the flexible receptor to the viral surface, with distal domains in multiple conformations. Regions of the virus and receptor in close physical proximity can be identified by cross-linking / mass spectrometry. &lt;i&gt;Cryo&lt;/i&gt;-electron microscopy with a two-domain receptor fragment reveals the interactions at 2.4 Å resolution. AAVR binds between AAV's spikes on a plateau that is conserved, except in one clade whose structure is AAVR-incompatible. AAVR's footprint overlaps the epitopes of several neutralizing antibodies, prompting a re-evaluation of neutralization mechanisms. The structure provides a roadmap for experimental probing and manipulation of viral-receptor interactions.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Context-dependent signaling of coincident auditory and visual events in primary visual cortex</title>

	<description>Detecting rapid, coincident changes across sensory modalities is essential for recognition of sudden threats or events. Using two-photon calcium imaging in identified cell types in awake, head-fixed mice, we show that, among the basic features of a sound envelope, loud sound onsets are a dominant feature coded by the auditory cortex neurons projecting to primary visual cortex (V1). In V1, a small number of layer 1 interneurons gates this cross-modal information flow in a context-dependent manner. In dark conditions, auditory cortex inputs lead to suppression of the V1 population. However, when sound input coincides with a visual stimulus, visual responses are boosted in V1, most strongly after loud sound onsets. Thus, a dynamic, asymmetric circuit connecting AC and V1 contributes to the encoding of visual events that are coincident with sounds.</description>

	<description>Paul Greengard died suddenly and peacefully on April 13, 2019, at the age of 93. He was a giant of molecular neuroscience during the last decades of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st. His achievements were recognized by a host of awards, most notably the Nobel Prize in 2000. I had the privilege and thrill of working in Paul’s laboratory as an undergraduate in 1969 and 1970. That single year a half century ago had a profound influence on my career and sparked a life-long friendship. This does not explain why I was asked to write this memorial, but it may help excuse my accepting the offer.</description>

	<description>We guarantee that you’ve never met anyone quite like Charlie Gross, an iconoclast and pioneer who blazed a trail through the uncharted territories of the cerebral cortex. Charles Gordon Gross was unconventional from the moment he was born on a leap day, February 29, 1936, to Communist parents (a “red-diaper baby”). Charlie was, by his own account, a mediocre young student, but he turned it around. He became a Westinghouse Science Finalist, the youngest Eagle Scout in Brooklyn, a Harvard graduate, and a Fulbright Scholar.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/646802v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>This paper describes and evaluates FMRIB's nonlinear image registration tool (FNIRT), that is part of the FMRIB software library (FSL). It is a small deformation framework using sum of squared differences (SSD) as its cost function and Gauss-Newton for minimisation. The framework uses a joint shape and intensity model that attempts to explain the observed differences between two images in terms of having different shape and/or contrast, being differently affected by intensity bias-fields etc. Thus the estimation of the warps will be relatively unaffected by intensity differences that would otherwise violate the assumptions behind the SSD cost function. It uses a projection onto a manifold defined by a specified range of allowed Jacobian determinants to ensure that the warps are diffeomorphic. The utility of the model is demonstrated on a variety of simulated and experimental data with good results. FNIRT is also quantitatively evaluated using previously published datasets consisting of scans from multiple subjects, all with anatomically defined brain regions that are manually outlined. In this evaluation FNIRT performs well in comparison to previously published results with other registration algorithms.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Novel Strategies for Glutamate Clearance in the Glia-Deprived Synaptic Hub of C. elegans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/645812v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/645812v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Brain function requires the ability to form neuronal circuits that mediate focused and accurate communication. Since the vast majority of brain synapses use Glutamate (Glu) as their neurotransmitter, unintended spillover of Glu between adjacent synapses is a critical challenge. To ensure accurate neurotransmission and avert synaptic mix-up, specialized Glu Transporters (GluTs) clear the synapse of released Glu. While classical views of neuronal morphology and physiology depict isolated spiny synapses enwrapped by GluT-expressing glia, in reality, a considerable portion of synapses are flat, glial coverage in some parts of the brain is rather sparse, and extracellular space is larger than previously estimated. This suggests that diffusion in interstitial fluids might have an important role in Glu clearance in these synapses. To understand basic principles of Glu clearance in flat-, glia-deprived synapses, we study the physiology of neuronal circuits in the C. elegans nerve ring, the nematode's aspiny synaptic hub. We use behavioral assays, Ca2+ imaging, and iGluSnFR to follow synaptic activity in intact animals. We find that synapses in a nociceptive avoidance circuit are dramatically affected by distal GluTs, while an adjacent chemoattraction circuit is controlled by proximal GluTs. We also find that pharyngeal pulsatility and mobility, which could agitate interstitial fluids, are critical for synaptic physiology. We therefore conclude that robust Glu clearance in the nematode is provided differentially by distal and proximal GluTs, aided by agitation of interstitial fluids. Such principles might be informative in determining additional factors that contribute to robust Glu clearance in other neuronal systems.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/645234v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Evolutionary adaptations can affect different aspects of brain architecture, including areal expansion, relocation, or changes in connectivity profiles. Distinguishing between different types of reorganization is critical for our understanding of brain evolution. We propose to address this using a computational neuroanatomy approach. We investigate the extent to which between-species cortical alignment based on myelin can predict changes in connectivity patterns across macaque, chimpanzee and human brains. We show that expansion and relocation of brain areas as predicted by the myelin-based alignment are sufficient to predict reorganization of several white matter tracts and their terminations in temporal, frontal and parietal cortex. A notable exception is the arcuate fasciculus, in which we found extensive tract expansion into new territories that cannot be explained by cortical expansion. The presented approach can flexibly be extended to include other features of cortical organization and other species, which allows us to directly test and quantify evolutionary hypotheses.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: DYRK1A up-regulation specifically impairs a presynaptic form of long-term potentiation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/645200v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/645200v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Chromosome 21 DYRK1A kinase has long been associated with a variety of psychiatric diseases including Down Syndrome. We previously showed that Dyrk1A interacts with SWI/SNF (SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable) nucleosome remodeling complex inducing expression changes of genes encoding key neuronal proteins. However, the functional impact of this kinase at the synapse level remains unclear. We studied a mouse model that incorporated the YAC 152F7 (570 kb) encoding six chromosome 21 genes including DYRK1A. We found that DYRK1A Interacts with the key chromatin remodelers EP300 and CREBBP. Moreover, we observed changes in the transcriptional levels of genes encoding presynaptic proteins involved in glutamate vesicle exocytosis, namely Rims1, Munc13-1, Syn2, Rab3A. This result prompted us to investigate the two main forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) required for learning and memory: the (N-methyl d-aspartate) receptor-dependent postsynaptic form versus the glutamate release-dependent presynaptic form. Interestingly, extracellular electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal slices of the YAC mouse line revealed that only the presynaptic forms of plasticity were impacted, leaving the post-synaptic form of plasticity intact. To refine our findings, we used a mouse BAC 189N3 (152 kb) line that only triplicate the gene Dyrk1A. Again, we found that this presynaptic form of LTP is also impaired in this mouse line. This result demonstrates that abnormal up-regulation of Dyrk1A alone is sufficient to inhibit specifically the presynaptic forms of LTP. Altogether, our results suggest that impairment of DYRK1A gene dosage may impact memory precision, and therefore reinforce our mechanistic understanding of the cognitive impairment detected in this mouse model.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The structure of the population code in neural ensembles of V4 shapes pair-wise interactions on different time scales.</title>

	<description>In visual areas of primates, neurons activate in parallel while the animal is engaged in a behavioral task. In this study, we examine the structure of the population code while the animal performs delayed match to sample task on complex natural images. The macaque monkeys visualized two consecutive stimuli that were either the same or different, while recorded with laminar arrays across the cortical depth in V1 and V4 cortical areas. We decoded correct choice behavior from the activity of single neurons as well as from neural populations of simultaneously recorded units. Comparing the predictive power of the activity of single neurons with the high-dimensional model of the population activity, we find that the high-dimensional read-out predicts correct choices better than an average single neuron from the same recording session. Utilizing decoding weights, we divide neurons in informative and uninformative, and show that informative neurons in V4, but not in V1, are more strongly synchronized and also have stronger correlations than uninformative neurons. As neurons are divided in two coding pools according to their coding preference for matching and non-matching stimuli, in V4, but not in V1, spiking synchrony and correlations within the coding pool are stronger than across coding pools. Finally, decorrelating neural activities within the coding pool increases the performance of the decoder, while decorrelating across pools does not affect the performance of the decoder. In summary, our analysis points out that cortical microcircuits are structured and that the structure of the population code importantly shapes pairwise correlations.</description>

	<description>Learning and memorizing sequences of events is an important function of the human brain and the basis for forming expectations and making predictions. Learning is facilitated by repeating a sequence several times, causing rhythmic appearance of the individual sequence elements. This observation invites to consider the resulting multitude of rhythms as a spectral `fingerprint' which characterizes the respective sequence. Here we explore the implications of this perspective by developing a neurobiologically plausible computational model which captures this `fingerprint' by attuning an ensemble of neural oscillators. In our model, this attuning process is based on a number of oscillatory phenomena that have been observed in electrophysiological recordings of brain activity like synchronization, phase locking and reset as well as cross-frequency coupling. We compare the learning properties of the model with behavioral results from a study in human participants and observe good agreement of the errors for different levels of complexity of the sequence to be memorized. Finally, we suggest an extension of the model for processing sequences that extend over several sensory modalities.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Host contact dynamics shapes richness and dominance of pathogen strains</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Francesco Pinotti, Éric Fleury, Didier Guillemot, Pierre-Yves Böelle, Chiara Poletto&lt;/p&gt;

The interaction among multiple microbial strains affects the spread of infectious diseases and the efficacy of interventions. Genomic tools have made it increasingly easy to observe pathogenic strains diversity, but the best interpretation of such diversity has remained difficult because of relationships with host and environmental factors. Here, we focus on host-to-host contact behavior and study how it changes populations of pathogens in a minimal model of multi-strain interaction. We simulated a population of identical strains competing by mutual exclusion and spreading on a dynamical network of hosts according to a stochastic susceptible-infectious-susceptible model. We computed ecological indicators of diversity and dominance in strain populations for a collection of networks illustrating various properties found in real-world examples. Heterogeneities in the number of contacts among hosts were found to reduce diversity and increase dominance by making the repartition of strains among infected hosts more uneven, while strong community structure among hosts increased strain diversity. We found that the introduction of strains associated with hosts entering and leaving the system led to the highest pathogenic richness at intermediate turnover levels. These results were finally illustrated using the spread of &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; in a long-term health-care facility where close proximity interactions and strain carriage were collected simultaneously. We found that network structural and temporal properties could account for a large part of the variability observed in strain diversity. These results show how stochasticity and network structure affect the population ecology of pathogens and warn against interpreting observations as unambiguous evidence of epidemiological differences between strains.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/76azSIoRDBg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Immediate early genes (IEGs) are useful markers of neuronal activation and essential components of neuronal response. While studies of gastropods have provided many insights into the basic learning and memory mechanisms, the genome-wide assessment of IEGs has been mainly restricted to vertebrates. In this study, we identified IEGs in the terrestrial snail &lt;i&gt;Helix lucorum&lt;/i&gt;. In the absence of the genome, we conducted &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; transcriptome assembly using reads with short and intermediate lengths cumulatively covering more than 98 billion nucleotides. Based on this assembly, we identified 37 proteins corresponding to contigs differentially expressed (DE) in either the parietal ganglia (PaG) or two giant interneurons located within the PaG of the snail in response to the neuronal stimulation. These proteins included homologues of well-known mammalian IEGs, such as &lt;i&gt;c-jun/jund&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C/EBP&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;c-fos/fosl2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Egr1&lt;/i&gt;, as well as homologues of genes not yet implicated in the neuronal response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrathecal baclofen treatment is used for the treatment of dystonia in patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy; however, the current level of evidence for the effect is low. The primary aim of this study was to provide evidence for the effect of intrathecal baclofen treatment on individual goals in patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial was performed at 2 university medical centers in the Netherlands. Patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy (Gross Motor Functioning Classification System level IV–V) aged 4 to 24 years who were eligible for intrathecal baclofen were included. Patients were assigned by block randomization (2:2) for treatment with intrathecal baclofen or placebo for 3 months via an implanted microinfusion pump. The primary outcome was goal attainment scaling of individual treatment goals (GAS T score). A linear regression model was used for statistical analysis with study site as a covariate. Safety analyses were done for number and type of (serious) adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐six patients were recruited from January 1, 2013, to March 31, 2018. Data for final analysis were available for 17 patients in the intrathecal baclofen group and 16 in the placebo group. Mean (standard deviation) GAS T score at 3 months was 38.9 (13.2) for intrathecal baclofen and 21.0 (4.6) for placebo (regression coefficient = 17.8, 95% confidence interval = 10.4‐25.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Number and types of (serious) adverse events were similar between groups.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrathecal baclofen treatment is superior to placebo in achieving treatment goals in patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain is an assembly of neuronal populations interconnected by structural
pathways. Brain activity is expressed on and constrained by this substrate.
Therefore, statistical dependencies between functional signals in directly
connected areas can be expected higher. However, the degree to which brain
function is bound by the underlying wiring diagram remains a complex question
that has been only partially answered. Here, we introduce the
structural-decoupling index to quantify the coupling strength between structure
and function, and we reveal a macroscale gradient from brain regions more
strongly coupled, to regions more strongly decoupled, than expected by
realistic surrogate data. This gradient spans behavioral domains from
lower-level sensory function to high-level cognitive ones and shows for the
first time that the strength of structure-function coupling is spatially
varying in line with evidence derived from other modalities, such as functional
connectivity, gene expression, microstructural properties and temporal
hierarchy.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The form of genotype-phenotype maps are typically modular. However, the form
of the genotype-phenotype map in human brain connectivity is unknown. A modular
mapping could exist, in which distinct sets of genes' coexpression across brain
regions is similar to distinct brain regions' functional or structural
connectivity, and in which single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at distinct
sets of genes alter distinct brain regions' functional or structural
connectivity. Here, we leverage multimodal human neuroimaging, genotype, and
post-mortem gene expression datasets to determine the form of the
genotype-phenotype map of human brain connectivity. Across multiple analytic
approaches, we find that both gene coexpression and SNPs are consistently more
strongly related to functional brain connectivity than to structural brain
connectivity. Critically, network analyses of genes and brain connectivity
demonstrate that different sets of genes account for the connectivity of
different regions in the brain. Moreover, the genetic signature of each brain
region reflects its community affiliation and role in network communication.
Connector hubs have genetic signatures that are similarly connector-like, in
that they are representative of the genetic signature of nodes in multiple
other modules. Remarkably, we find a tight relationship between gene
coexpression and genetic variance: SNPs that are located at the genes whose
coexpression is similar to a region's connectivity across cortex tend to
predict more variance in that region's connectivity across subjects than SNPs
at other genes. Finally, brain regions whose connectivity are well explained by
gene coexpression and genetic variance (SNPs) also display connectivity
variance across subjects that tracks variance in human performance on
cognitively demanding tasks, heritability, development, and evolutionary
expansion.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human thinking requires the brain to understand the meaning of language
expression and to properly organize the thoughts flow using the language.
However, current natural language processing models are primarily limited in
the word probability estimation. Here, we proposed a Language guided
imagination (LGI) network to incrementally learn the meaning and usage of
numerous words and syntaxes, aiming to form a human-like machine thinking
process. LGI contains three subsystems: (1) vision system that contains an
encoder to disentangle the input or imagined scenarios into abstract population
representations, and an imagination decoder to reconstruct imagined scenario
from higher level representations; (2) Language system, that contains a
binarizer to transfer symbol texts into binary vectors, an IPS (mimicking the
human IntraParietal Sulcus, implemented by an LSTM) to extract the quantity
information from the input texts, and a textizer to convert binary vectors into
text symbols; (3) a PFC (mimicking the human PreFrontal Cortex, implemented by
an LSTM) to combine inputs of both language and vision representations, and
predict text symbols and manipulated images accordingly. LGI has incrementally
learned eight different syntaxes (or tasks), with which a machine thinking loop
has been formed and validated by the proper interaction between language and
vision system. The paper provides a new architecture to let the machine learn,
understand and use language in a human-like way that could ultimately enable a
machine to construct fictitious 'mental' scenario and possess intelligence.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding, predicting, and learning from other people's actions are
fundamental human social-cognitive skills. Little is known about how and when
we consider other's actions and outcomes when making our own decisions. We
developed a novel task to study social influence in decision-making: the social
multi-armed bandit task. This task assesses how people learn policies for
optimal choices based on their own outcomes and another player's (observed)
outcomes. The majority of participants integrated information gained through
observation of their partner similarly as information gained through their own
actions. This lead to a suboptimal decision-making strategy. Interestingly,
event-related potentials time-locked to stimulus onset qualitatively similar
but the amplitudes are attenuated in the solo compared to the dyadic version.
This might indicate that arousal and attention after receiving a reward are
sustained when a second agent is present but not when playing alone.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Could an Impairment in Local Translation of mRNAs in Glia be Contributing to Pathogenesis in ALS?</title>

	<description>One of the key pathways implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis is abnormal RNA processing. Studies to date have focussed on defects in RNA stability, splicing, and translation, but this review will focus on the largely overlooked RNA processing mechanism of RNA trafficking, with particular emphasis on the importance of glia. In the central nervous system (CNS), oligodendrocytes can extend processes to myelinate and metabolically support up to 50 axons and astrocytes can extend processes to cover up to 100,000 synapses, all with differing local functional requirements. Furthermore, many of the proteins required in these processes are large, aggregation-prone proteins which would be difficult to transport in their fully translated, terminally-folded state. This therefore highlights a critical requirement in these cells for local control of protein translation, which is achieved through specific trafficking of mRNAs to each process and local translation therein. Given that a large number of RNA-binding proteins have been implicated in ALS, and RNA-binding proteins are essential for trafficking mRNAs from the nucleus to glial processes for local translation, RNA misprocessing in glial cells is a likely source of cellular dysfunction in ALS. To date, neurons have been the focus of ALS research, but a cell autonomous deficit in glia, namely astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, could have an additive effect on declining neuronal function in ALS. This review aims to highlight the key evidence that supports the contention that RNA trafficking deficits in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes may contribute to in ALS.</description>

	<description>The small GTPases from the Ras superfamily play crucial roles in basic cellular processes during practically the entire process of neurodevelopment, including neurogenesis, differentiation, gene expression, membrane and protein traffic, vesicular trafficking, and synaptic plasticity. Small GTPases are key signal transducing enzymes that link extracellular cues to the neuronal responses required for the construction of neuronal networks, as well as for synaptic function and plasticity. Different subfamilies of small GTPases have been linked to a number of non-neoplastic cerebral diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), intellectual disability, epilepsy, drug addiction, Huntington’s disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and a large number of idiopathic cerebral diseases. Here, we attempted to make a clearer illustration of the relationship between Ras superfamily GTPases and non-neoplastic cerebral diseases, as well as their roles in the neural system. In future studies, potential treatments for non-neoplastic cerebral diseases which are based on small GTPase related signaling pathways should be explored further. In this paper, we review all the available literature in support of this possibility.</description>

	<description>The astrocyte-specific enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS), which catalyzes the amidation to glutamate to glutamine, plays an essential role in supporting neurotransmission and in limiting NH4+ toxicity. Accordingly, deficits in GS activity contribute to epilepsy and neurodegeneration. Despite its central role in brain physiology, the mechanisms that regulate GS activity are poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that GS is directly phosphorylated on threonine residue 301 (T301) within the enzyme active site by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation of T301 leads to a dramatic decrease in glutamine synthesis. Enhanced T301 phosphorylation was evident in a mouse model of epilepsy, which may contribute to decreased GS activity seen during this trauma. Thus, our results highlight a novel molecular mechanism that determines GS activity under both normal and pathological conditions.</description>

	<description>Research suggests that maternal exercise in pregnancy may have beneficial effects on the brain function of offspring. This study sought to determine if voluntary wheel running during pregnancy improves depression-like behavior, temporal order memory, and hippocampal neurogenesis in both female and male offspring mice. Pregnant mice were allowed to run voluntarily by introducing running wheels into the housing cages throughout the gestational period. Male and female mice offspring at the age of 8- to 9-week-old offspring were then tested for temporal order test and forced swim test, then euthanized for immunostaining for examining adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Results showed that both male and female pups have reduced depression-like behavior, while only male offspring demonstrated improvement in temporal order memory. Immunostaining revealed that male offspring showed an increase in number of immature neurons in the ventral hippocampus, whereas female offspring show enhanced cell proliferation in the dorsal hippocampus. The findings confirm that maternal physical exercise benefits both female and male offspring on reducing depression-like behaviour, but with gender effect on promoting hippocampal cell proliferation and newborn neurons.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: In vivo Recording Quality of Mechanically Decoupled Floating Versus Skull-Fixed Silicon-Based Neural Probes</title>

	<description>Throughout the past decade, silicon-based neural probes comprising sophisticated integrated CMOS electronics providing a large number of recording sites along slender probe shanks have become a driving force in neural engineering. Using such neural probes in a chronic setting often requires them to be mechanically anchored with respect to the skull. However, any relative motion between brain and implant causes recording instabilities and tissue responses such as glial scarring, thereby shielding recordable neurons from the recording sites integrated on the probe and decreasing the signal quality. In the current work, we present we present a comparison of results obtained using mechanically fixed and floating silicon neural probes implanted into the cortex of a non-human primate. We demonstrate that the neural signal quality of the floating probe is initially superior to the fixed device. Nonetheless, the skull-fixed probe also allowed long-term recording of multi-unit activity and low frequency signals over several months, especially once pulsations of the brain were properly controlled.</description>

	<description>The process through which neurons are labeled is a key methodological choice in measuring neuron morphology. However little is known about how this choice may bias measurements. To quantify this bias we compare the extracted morphology of neurons collected from the same rodent species, experimental condition, gender distribution, age distribution, brain region and putative cell type, but obtained with 19 distinct staining methods. We found strong biases on measured features of morphology. These were largest in features related to the coverage of the dendritic tree, e.g. the total dendritic tree length. Understanding measurement biases is crucial for interpreting morphological data.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Closed-Loop Acoustic Stimulation During Sleep in Children With Epilepsy: A Hypothesis-Driven Novel Approach to Interact With Spike-Wave Activity and Pilot Data Assessing Feasibility</title>

	<description>Slow waves, the EEG hallmark of deep sleep, can be systematically manipulated by acoustic stimulation: Stimulation time-locked to the down phase of slow waves reduces, whereas stimulation time-locked to the up phase increases slow waves. Spike-waves during sleep seem to be related to slow waves, raising the question whether spike-waves can be systematically influenced by such acoustic stimulation. In 5 patients, all-night EEG was recorded, combined with real-time slow wave detection. Throughout the night, acoustic stimulation was performed in a 3 x 5-min-block design (no stimulation - stimulation - no stimulation). Tones were applied time-locked either to the up or to the down phase of the detected slow waves in an alternating pattern. All patients tolerated the acoustic stimulation during sleep well. They showed high sleep quality and no signs of clinical or non-convulsive electrographic seizures. Our preliminary analysis shows no systematic effect of acoustic stimulation on spike-wave activity. Moreover, with our stimulation approach tones were distributed over a rather broad phase-range during the DOWN or UP stimulation and showed inter-individual differences in their distribution. In this study we applied for the first time an acoustic closed-loop slow wave stimulation tool for a non-invasive manipulation of spike-wave activity. Thus, our pilot data shows that closed-loop acoustic stimulation is feasible and well tolerated in children with spike wave activity during sleep. Improved precision in phase targeting and personalized stimulation parameters in a larger sample of subjects might be needed to show systematic effects.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Language Brain Representation in Bilinguals With Different Age of Appropriation and Proficiency of the Second Language: A Meta-Analysis of Functional Imaging Studies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00154</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00154</link>
	<description>Language representation in the bilingual brain is the result of many factors, of which age of appropriation (AoA) and proficiency of the second language (L2) are probably the most studied. Many studies indeed compared early and late bilinguals, although it is not clear the role of the so-called critical period for L2 learning. In this study, we carried out coordinate-based meta-analysis to address this issue and to inspect the role of proficiency besides that of AoA. After the preliminary inspection of the early (also very early) and late bilinguals’ language networks, we explored the specific activations associated with each language and compared them within and between the groups. Results confirmed that the language network associated with L2 was wider than that associated with L1 irrespective to AoA, although differences were more relevant in the late bilinguals’ group. In particular, L2 entailed a greater enrollment of the brain areas devoted to executive functions, and this was observed also in proficient bilinguals.. Also the early bilinguals showed a wide language network and as well activated areas involved in cognitive control. Interestingly, these regions activated even in L1 of both early and late bilinguals groups, although less consistently. Overall, these findings suggest that bilinguals in general are constantly subjected to cognitive effort to monitor and regulate the language use, although early AoA and high proficiency are likely to reduce it.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: TFEB Probably Involved in Midazolam-Disturbed Lysosomal Homeostasis and Its Induced β-Amyloid Accumulation</title>

	<description>Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, β-amyloid play a leading role in the pathogenesis of AD. TFEB, a main regulating factor of autophagy and lysosome biosynthesis, is involved in the pathogenesis of AD by regulating autophagy-lysosomal pathways. To date, the choice of anesthetics during surgery in patients with neurodegenerative diseases and evaluation of the effects and underlying mechanisms in these patients have rarely been reported. In this study, the HEK293-APP cells overexpressing APP and Hela cells were used. The cells were treated with midazolam at different concentrations and different times, then lysosomes were stained by lysotracker and their morphology were observed under a fluorescence microscope. The number and size of lysosomes were analyzed using the imagj j software. The levels of TFEB in the nucleus and APP-cleaved proteins intracellular were detected by nuclear separation and Western Blot. Finally, ELISA was used to detect the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the cells after drug treatment. We found that 30μM midazolam decreased the number of lysosomes and increased its size in HEK293 and HeLa cells. However, 15μM midazolam transiently disturbed lysosomal homeostasis at 24h and recovered it at 36h. Notably, there was no significant difference in the extent to which lysosomal homeostasis was disturbed between treatments of different concentrations of midazolam at 24 hours. In addition, 30 μM midazolam prevents the transport of TFEB to the nucleus in either normal or starved cells. Finally, the intracellular CTFβ, CTFα, Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were all significantly elevated in 30μM midazolam-treated HKE293-APP cells. Collectively, the inhibition of TFEB transport to nucleus may be involved in midazolam-disturbed lysosomal homeostasis and its induced β-amyloid accumulation in vitro. The results indicated the risk of accelerating the pathogenesis of AD by midazolam and suggested that TFEB might be a candidate target for reduction of midazolam-dependent neurotoxicity.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Cannabinoids Modulate Light Signaling in ON-Sustained Retinal Ganglion Cells of the Mouse</title>

	<description>The sole output of the retina to the brain is a signal that results from the integration of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs at the level of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Endogenous cannabinoids (eCBs) are found throughout the central nervous system where they modulate synaptic excitability. Cannabinoid receptors and their ligands have been localized to most retinal neurons in mammals, yet their impact on retinal processing is not well known. Here, we set out to investigate the role of the cannabinoid system in retinal signalling using electrophysiological recordings from ON sustained (ON-S) RGCs that displayed morphological and physiological signatures of ON alpha RGCs in dark adapted mouse retina. We studied the effect of the cannabinoid agonist WIN55212-2 and the inverse agonist AM251 on the spatial tuning of ON-S RGCs. WIN55212-2 significantly reduced their spontaneous spiking activity and responses to optimal spot size as well as altered their spatial tuning by reducing light driven excitatory and inhibitory inputs to RGCs. AM251 produced the opposite effect, increasing spontaneous spiking activity and peak response as well as increasing inhibitory and excitatory inputs. In addition, AM251 sharpened the spatial tuning of ON-S RGCs by increasing the inhibitory effect of the surround. These results demonstrate the presence of a functional cannabinergic system in the retina as well as sensitivity of ON-RGCs to cannabinoids. These results reveal a neuromodulatory system that can regulate the sensitivity and excitability of retinal synapses in a dynamic, activity dependent manner and that endocannabinoids may play a significant role in retinal processing.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: A Novel Type of Neuron Within the Dorsal Striatum</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00032</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00032</link>
	<description>The striatum is predominantly composed of medium spiny projection neurons, with the remaining neurons consisting of several types of interneurons. Among the interneurons are a group of cells that express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Although the intrinsic electrical properties of these TH-expressing interneurons have been characterized, there is no agreement on the number of TH-expressing cell types and their electrical properties. Here we have used transgenic mice in which YFP-tagged channelrhodopsin-2 was expressed in putative TH-expressing cells in a Cre-dependent manner. We found that the YFP+ neurons in the striatum were heterogeneous in their intrinsic electrical properties; unbiased clustering indicated that there are three main neuronal subtypes. One population of neurons had aspiny dendrites with high-frequency action potential firing and plateau potentials, resembling the TH interneurons (THIN) described previously. A second, very small population of labelled neurons resembled MSN. The third population of neurons had dendrites with an intermediated density of spines, showed substantial action potential adaptation and generated prolonged spikes. This type of striatal neuron has not been previously identified in the adult mouse and we have named them Frequency-Adapting Neurons with Spines (FANS). Because of their distinctive properties, FANS may play a unique role in striatal information processing.</description>

	<description>Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are multipotential stem cells considered to have immense clinical value for revascularization. However, the clinical application of EPCs has been hampered by their clinical potency in ischemic anoxic environments. This study aimed to explore the effect of microRNA-210 (miR-210) on EPCs under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions. We generated a model of EPCs cultured under OGD conditions to simulate ischemia and explore the expression of miR-210 in vitro. With longer exposure to hypoxia, we found that miR-210-3p expression was highly upregulated in OGD groups compared to that in controls from 4 to 24 h,but not miR-210-5p. We then transfected a miR-210-3p mimic and inhibitor into EPCs, and after 24 h, we exposed them to OGD conditions for 4 h to simulate ischemia. We detected miR-210 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and tested the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of normal EPCs and OGD-treated EPCs by CCK-8, transwell chamber, and Matrigel assays, respectively. The direct targets of miR-210-3p were predicted using miRWalk. Compared to that in normal EPCs, higher miR-210-3p expression was found in OGD-treated EPCs (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Moreover, upregulation of miR-210-3p was found to promote proliferation, migration, and tube formation in EPCs under normal and OGD conditions (p &amp;lt; 0.05), whereas down-regulation inhibited these abilities in OGD-treated EPCs (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMA), a negative regulator of angiogenesis, was predicted to be a target of miR-210-3p. Accordingly, upregulation of miR-210-3p was found to inhibit its expression at the protein level in OGD-treated EPCs, whereas downregulation of miR-210-3p inhibited its expression (p&amp;lt;0.05). A dual-luciferase reporter system confirmed that RGMA is a direct target of miR-210-3p. MicroRNA-210-3p overexpression enhances the angiogenic properties of OGD-treated EPCs by inhibiting RGMA.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Synapsin I Controls Synaptic Maturation of Long-Range Projections in the Lateral Amygdala in a Targeted Selective Fashion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00220</guid>

	<description>The amygdala, and more precisely its lateral nucleus, is thought to confer emotional valence to external stimuli by generating long-term plasticity changes at long-range projections to principal cells. Aversive experience has also been shown to modify pre- and post-synaptic markers in the amygdala, suggesting their possible role in the structural organization of adult amygdala networks.  Here, we focused on the maturation of cortical and thalamic long-term projections on principal neurons and interneurons in the lateral amygdala (LA) and on how it is affected by deletion of the presynaptic protein synapsin I. We firstly performed dual electrophysiological recordings of identified cells in juvenile and adult GAD67-GFP mice after independent stimulation of cortical and thalamic afferent systems. The results demonstrate that synaptic strengthening occurs during development at synapses projecting to LA principal neurons, but not interneurons.  As synaptic strengthening underlying fear conditioning depends on the presence and increasing expression of synapsin I, we successively tested if synapsin I contributes to synaptic strengthening during development. Interestingly, the physiological strengthening of cortical and thalamic synapses projecting to LA principal neurons was virtually abolished in synapsin I knockout mice, while no differences were observed in the excitatory projections to interneurons, suggesting that the synapse-specificity of synaptic strengthening by synapsin I is attributable to its neuronal target. Immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated that the presence of synapsin I is restricted to excitatory contacts projecting to principal neurons in LA of adult mice. These results indicate that synapsin I is a key regulator of the maturation of synaptic connectivity in this brain region and that is expression is dependent on postsynaptic identity.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Histamine Modulates Midbrain Dopamine Neuron Differentiation Through the Regulation of Epigenetic Marks</title>

	<description>During midbrain development, dopamine neuron differentiation occurs before birth. Epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation and demethylation as well as post-translational modification of histones occur during neurogenesis. Here we administered histamine (HA) into the brain of E12 embryos in vivo and observed significant lower immunoreactivity of Lmx1a+ and Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH)+ cells, with parallel decreases in the expression of early (Lmx1a, Msx1) and late (Th) midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) genes. With MEDIP assays we found that HA decreases the percentage of 5-methylcytosine of Pitx3 and Th, without changes in 5-hydroxymethylcitosine. Additionally, HA treatment caused a significant increase in the repressive epigenetic modifications H3K9me3 in Pitx3 and Th, and also more H3K27me3 marks in Th. Furthermore, HA has a long-term effect on the formation of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic/mesocortical pathways, since it causes a significant decrease in midbrain TH immunoreactivity, as well as alterations in dopaminergic neuronal fibers, and significant lower TH-positive area in the forebrain in whole-mount stainings. These findings suggest that HA diminishes dopaminergic gene transcription by altering several epigenetic components related to DNA and histone modifications, which affects mDA neuron progression during development.</description>

	<description>Until recently, glial cells have been considered mainly support cells for neurons in the mammalian brain. However, many studies have unveiled a variety of glial functions including electrolyte homeostasis, inflammation, synapse formation, metabolism, and the regulation of neurotransmission. The importance of these functions illuminates significant crosstalk between glial and neuronal cells. Importantly, it is known that astrocytes secrete signals that can modulate both presynaptic and postsynaptic function. It is also known that the lipid compositions of the pre- and postsynaptic membranes of neurons greatly impact functions such as vesicle fusion and receptor mobility. These data suggest an essential lipid-mediated communication between glial cells and neurons. Little is known, however, about how the lipid metabolism of both cell types may interact. In this review, we discuss neuronal and glial lipid metabolism and suggest how they might interact to impact neurotransmission.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Tau Phosphorylation Rates Measured by Mass Spectrometry Differ in the Intracellular Brain vs. Extracellular Cerebrospinal Fluid Compartments and Are Differentially Affected by Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>Tau protein aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles in the central nervous system contributes to the etiology of certain neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Though the mechanism of tau destabilization is not fully understood yet, tau protein has been found to be hyperphosphorylated in tau aggregates. To investigate this further, we developed a highly sensitive and specific mass spectrometry (MS) method using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) to identify tau phosphorylation sites. This method enables us to compare the abundance of phosphorylation sites in tau proteins in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in humans with and without AD. 
We detected 29 distinct phosphorylated tau (p-tau) sites in full-length tau from soluble human brain lysate and 12 sites on truncated tau in CSF, mainly in the mid-domain. Brain soluble tau phosphorylation sites are localized on 3 domains including a proline rich mid-domain, the C-terminus, and a cluster on the N-terminal projection domain not previously characterized. Some phosphorylation sites increased in CSF, while others decreased compared to brain. Notably, phosphorylation on T205 and S208, recognized by AT8 antibody defining Braak stages of brain tau aggregation, were not detected in normal brain soluble tau but were found in the CSF. Comparison of the p-tau rates from the brain and the CSF indicated that the abundance of phosphorylated sites varied in a site-specific manner. CSF tau proteins from non-AD participants were significantly hyperphosphorylated on T111, T205, S208, T217 and T231. In AD CSF, hyperphosphorylation on these sites was exacerbated, and phosphorylation on T153 and T175 specifically were detected. This supports the hypothesis that tau hyperphosphorylation could be a physiological process amplified by AD pathology. Conversely, we found that S199 and S202 were hypophosphorylated in CSF and were not hyperphosphorylated in AD, demonstrating that phosphorylated tau isoforms could have different metabolisms depending on which sites are phosphorylated. 
These site-specific p-tau rates are independent from tau concentration and distinct from current CSF tau and p-tau assays measuring tau isoforms levels. Targeted MS multiplexing ability and high-througput capacity lets us envision the use of these new p-tau measurements as promising biomarkers for AD diagnosis and tracking therapeutic responses.</description>

	<description>Playing video games is a prevalent leisure activity in current daily life, and studies have found that video game experience has positive effects in several cognitive domains. However, few studies have examined the effect of video game experience on the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) among older adults. In the current study, we compared behavioral performance in the flanker task and ALFF activities of older adults, of whom fifteen were video game players (VGPs) and eighteen non-video game players (NVGPs). The results showed that VGPs outperformed NVGPs in the flanker task and that VGPs showed significantly increased ALFF relative to NVGPs in the left inferior occipital gyrus, left cerebellum and left lingual gyrus. Furthermore, the ALFF in the left inferior occipital gyrus and left lingual gyrus was positively correlated with cognitive performance as measured by Mini-Mental State Examination scores. These results revealed that playing video games might improve behavioral performance and change intrinsic brain activity in older adults. Future video game training studies in older adults are warranted to provide more evidence of the positive effects of video game experience on behavioral and brain function.</description>

	<description>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) causes the progressive deterioration of neural connections, disrupting structural connectivity (SC) networks within the brain. Graph-based analyses of SC networks have shown that topological properties can reveal the course of AD propagation. Different whole-brain parcellation schemes have been developed to define the nodes of these SC networks, although it remains unclear which scheme can best describe the AD-related deterioration of SC networks. In this study, four whole-brain parcellation schemes with different numbers of parcels were used to define SC network nodes. SC networks were constructed based on high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) tractography for a mixed cohort that includes 20 normal controls (NC), 20 early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), 20 late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and 20 AD patients, from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Parcellation schemes investigated in this study include the OASIS-TRT-20 (62 regions), AAL (116 regions), HCP-MMP (180 regions), and Gordon-rsfMRI (333 regions), which have all been widely used for the construction of brain structural or functional connectivity networks. Topological characteristics of the SC networks, including the network strength, global efficiency, clustering coefficient, rich-club, characteristic path length, k-core, rich-club coefficient, and modularity, were fully investigated at the network level. Statistical analyses were performed on these metrics using Kruskal-Wallis tests to examine the group differences that were apparent at different stages of AD progression. Results suggest that the HCP-MMP scheme is the most robust and sensitive to AD progression, while the OASIS-TRT-20 scheme is sensitive to group differences in network strength, global efficiency, k-core, and rich-club coefficient at k-levels from 18 and 39. With the exception of the rich-club and modularity coefficients, AAL could not significantly identify group differences on other topological metrics. Further, the Gordon-rsfMRI atlas only significantly differentiates the groups on network strength, characteristic path length, k-core, and rich-club coefficient. Results show that the topological examination of SC networks with different parcellation schemes can provide important complementary AD-related information and thus contribute to a more accurate and earlier diagnosis of AD.</description>

	<description>Background: Genetic factors have a well-known influence on Parkinson disease (PD) susceptibility, however, no previous studies have investigated the inﬂuence of SNCA mutations on the natural history of Parkinson’s disease using prospective follow-up study. The aim of this study was to assess the risk factors of variation of SNCA on the prognosis symptoms of PD patients.
Methods: Fifty PD patients were recruited with 38 v-PSG confirmed PD+RBD patients, and the median follow-up period was 30 months. All patients underwent a comprehensive clinical evaluation at baseline and follow-up, and six SNPs of SNCA (rs356165, rs3857053, rs1045722, rs894278, rs356186, and rs356219) were analyzed. Cox proportional hazards regression models and Kaplan-Meier plot analysis were used to assess the associations between the SNCA variation and the primary and secondary progression outcomes.
Results: Based on the clinical assessment, we found that hyposmia was substantially easier to aggravate. Regression analysis showed that patients with T allele of rs1045722 and G allele of rs356219 presented a 34% and 20% decreased risk of progression to the H-Y stage respectively (p=0.022; p=0.005). While for rs894278, G allele-patients showed a 47% decreased risk of olfactory dysfunction (p=0.029). Further subgroup analysis showed that PD+RBD patients with rs356219/G exhibited a 30% and 20% decreased risk of progression on the H-Y stage and MOCA score (p=0.038; p=0.045). 
Conclusions: Our results indicated that genetic variation in SNCA may contribute to variability natural progression of PD and could possibly be used as a prognostic marker.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Identification of Temporal Characteristic Networks of Peripheral Blood Changes in Alzheimer’s Disease Based on Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis</title>

	<description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. The study of blood-based biomarkers has been lasted for a long time in AD, because it supports the concept that peripheral changes involve in AD pathology. But there is still unclear that how peripheral blood is involved in the temporal characteristic molecular mechanisms of AD from aging to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD and which cells are responsible for the molecular mechanisms. The main purpose of our study is to gain a systematic and comprehensive understanding of temporal characteristic networks of peripheral blood in AD using whole blood samples with 329 case-control samples including 104  control (CTL), 80 MCI who are susceptible to AD, and 145 AD by the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The module-trait relationships were constructed and validated in independent datasets GSE63061, GSE97760, GSE18309, GSE29378, GSE28146 and GSE29652. Our results indicate that the down-regulated of protein modification and ubiquitin degradation systems and the up-regulated of insulin resistance play a major role in MCI, while the up-regulated of inflammatory cascade dominates in AD, which is mainly mediated by monocytes, macrophages, and microglia. Although there are mixed activation of M1 and M2 macrophages in all stage of AD, the immune neutral state or M2 polarization may predominates in MCI, and M1 polarization may predominates in AD. Moreover, we found that TRPV2, NDUFV1, ATF4, LUC7L3 may mediate the pathological changes in MCI, while SIRPA, LAMP-2, NDUFB5, FPR2 may mediate the conversion from MCI-AD or the pathological changes in AD, which provide a basis for the treatment based on the peripheral blood system. In addition, we also found that the combined diagnosis based on a panel of genes from the red, blue, and brown modules have a moderate diagnostic effect on distinguishing MCI and AD from CTL, suggesting that those panels of genes may be used for detection of MCI and prediction of this conversion from MCI to AD. Our research emphasizes that pathological changes based on temporal characteristics of peripheral blood providing a theoretical basis for targeted peripheral treatment based on appropriate times and identified several panel of genes markers.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Synergy between serum amyloid A and secretory phospholipase A2 suggests a vital role for an ancient protein in lipid clearance</title>

	<description>Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an evolutionally conserved enigmatic biomarker of inflammation. In acute inflammation, SAA plasma levels increase ~1,000-fold suggesting a vital beneficial role. SAA increases simultaneously with secretory phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (sPLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), compelling us to determine how SAA influences sPLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrolysis of lipoproteins. SAA solubilized phospholipid bilayers to form lipoproteins that provided substrates for sPLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, SAA sequestered free fatty acids and lysophospholipids to form stable proteolysis-resistant complexes. Unlike albumin, SAA effectively removed free fatty acids under acidic conditions, which characterize inflammation sites. Therefore, SAA solubilized lipid bilayers to generate substrates for sPLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and removed its bioactive products. Consequently, SAA and sPLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can act synergistically to remove cellular membrane debris from the injured sites, which is a prerequisite for tissue healing. We postulate that removal of lipids and their degradation products constitutes a vital primordial role of SAA in innate immunity; this role remains to be tested &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

	<description>Most sensory systems are organized into parallel neuronal pathways that process distinct aspects of incoming stimuli. In the insect olfactory system, second order projection neurons target both the mushroom body, required for learning, and the lateral horn (LH), proposed to mediate innate olfactory behavior. Mushroom body neurons form a sparse olfactory population code, which is not stereotyped across animals. In contrast, odor coding in the LH remains poorly understood. We combine genetic driver lines, anatomical and functional criteria to show that the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; LH has ~1400 neurons and &amp;gt;165 cell types. Genetically labeled LHNs have stereotyped odor responses across animals and on average respond to three times more odors than single projection neurons. LHNs are better odor categorizers than projection neurons, likely due to stereotyped pooling of related inputs. Our results reveal some of the principles by which a higher processing area can extract innate behavioral significance from sensory stimuli.</description>

	<description>Inputs from the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we show that the vHIP-mPFC projection is hyperactive in the &lt;i&gt;Mecp2 &lt;/i&gt;knockout mouse model of the autism spectrum disorder Rett syndrome, which has deficits in social memory. Long-term excitation of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons in wild-type mice impaired social memory, whereas their long-term inhibition in Rett mice rescued social memory deficits. The extent of social memory improvement was negatively correlated with vHIP-evoked responses in mPFC slices, on a mouse-per-mouse basis. Acute manipulations of the vHIP-mPFC projection affected social memory in a region and behavior selective manner, suggesting that proper vHIP-mPFC signaling is necessary to recall social memories. In addition, we identified an altered pattern of vHIP innervation of mPFC neurons, and increased synaptic strength of vHIP inputs onto layer 5 pyramidal neurons as contributing factors of aberrant vHIP-mPFC signaling in Rett mice.</description>

	<description>Female &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes are deadly vectors of arboviral pathogens and breed in containers of freshwater associated with human habitation. Because high salinity is lethal to offspring, correctly evaluating water purity is a crucial parenting decision. We found that the DEG/ENaC channel &lt;i&gt;ppk301&lt;/i&gt; and sensory neurons expressing &lt;i&gt;ppk301&lt;/i&gt; control egg-laying initiation and choice in &lt;i&gt;Ae. aegypti&lt;/i&gt;. Using calcium imaging, we found that &lt;i&gt;ppk301&lt;/i&gt;-expressing cells show &lt;i&gt;ppk301&lt;/i&gt;-dependent responses to water but, unexpectedly, also respond to salt in a &lt;i&gt;ppk301&lt;/i&gt;-independent fashion. This suggests that &lt;i&gt;ppk301 &lt;/i&gt;is instructive for egg-laying at low salt concentrations, but that a &lt;i&gt;ppk301-&lt;/i&gt;independent pathway is responsible for inhibiting egg-laying at high salt concentrations. Water is a key resource for insect survival and understanding how mosquitoes interact with water to control different behaviors is an opportunity to study the evolution of chemosensory systems.</description>

	<description>Animals exhibit innate behaviours to a variety of sensory stimuli including olfactory cues. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, one higher olfactory centre, the lateral horn (LH), is implicated in innate behaviour. However, our structural and functional understanding of the LH is scant, in large part due to a lack of sparse neurogenetic tools for this region. We generate a collection of split-GAL4 driver lines providing genetic access to 82 LH cell types. We use these to create an anatomical and neurotransmitter map of the LH and link this to EM connectomics data. We find ~30% of LH projections converge with outputs from the mushroom body, site of olfactory learning and memory. Using optogenetic activation, we identify LH cell types that drive changes in valence behavior or specific locomotor programs. In summary, we have generated a resource for manipulating and mapping LH neurons, providing new insights into the circuit basis of innate and learned olfactory behavior.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: GPCR signaling inhibits mTORC1 via PKA phosphorylation of Raptor</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43038</link>
	<description>The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates cell growth, metabolism, and autophagy. Extensive research has focused on pathways that activate mTORC1 like growth factors and amino acids; however, much less is known about signaling cues that directly inhibit mTORC1 activity. Here, we report that G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) paired to Gα&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; proteins increase cyclic adenosine 3’5’ monophosphate (cAMP) to activate protein kinase A (PKA) and inhibit mTORC1. Mechanistically, PKA phosphorylates the mTORC1 component Raptor on Ser 791, leading to decreased mTORC1 activity. Consistently, in cells where Raptor Ser 791 is mutated to Ala, mTORC1 activity is partially rescued even after PKA activation. Gα&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;-coupled GPCRs stimulation leads to inhibition of mTORC1 in multiple cell lines and mouse tissues. Our results uncover a signaling pathway that directly inhibits mTORC1, and suggest that GPCRs paired to Gα&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; proteins may be potential therapeutic targets for human diseases with hyperactivated mTORC1.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The COMA complex interacts with Cse4 and positions Sli15/Ipl1 at the budding yeast inner kinetochore</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.42879</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42879</link>
	<description>Kinetochores are macromolecular protein complexes at centromeres that ensure accurate chromosome segregation by attaching chromosomes to spindle microtubules and integrating safeguard mechanisms. The inner kinetochore is assembled on CENP-A nucleosomes and has been implicated in establishing a kinetochore-associated pool of Aurora B kinase, a chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) subunit, which is essential for chromosome biorientation. By performing crosslink-guided &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; reconstitution of budding yeast kinetochore complexes we showed that the Ame1/Okp1&lt;sup&gt;CENP-U/Q &lt;/sup&gt;heterodimer, which forms the COMA complex with Ctf19/Mcm21&lt;sup&gt;CENP-P/O&lt;/sup&gt;, selectively bound Cse4&lt;sup&gt;CENP-A&lt;/sup&gt; nucleosomes through the Cse4 N-terminus. The Sli15/Ipl1&lt;sup&gt;INCENP/Aurora-B&lt;/sup&gt; core-CPC interacted with COMA &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; through the Ctf19 C-terminus whose deletion affects accurate chromosome segregation in a Sli15 wild-type background. Tethering Sli15 to Ame1/Okp1 rescued synthetic lethality upon Ctf19 depletion in a Sli15 centromere-targeting deficient mutant. This study shows molecular characteristics of the point-centromere inner kinetochore architecture and suggests a role for the Ctf19 C-terminus in mediating accurate chromosome segregation.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Detecting interaction networks in the human microbiome with conditional Granger causality</title>

Human microbiome research is rife with studies attempting to deduce microbial correlation networks from sequencing data. Standard correlation and/or network analyses may be misleading when taken as an indication of taxon interactions because “correlation is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish causation”; environmental filtering can lead to correlation between non-interacting taxa. Unfortunately, microbial ecologists have generally used correlation as a proxy for causality although there is a general consensus about what constitutes a causal relationship: causes both precede and predict effects. We apply one of the first causal models for detecting interactions in human microbiome samples. Specifically, we analyze a long duration, high resolution time series of the human microbiome to decipher the networks of correlation and causation of human-associated microbial genera. We show that correlation is not a good proxy for biological interaction; we observed a weak negative relationship between correlation and causality. Strong interspecific interactions are disproportionately positive, whereas almost all strong intraspecific interactions are negative. Interestingly, intraspecific interactions also appear to act at a short time-scale causing vast majority of the effects within 1–3 days. We report how different taxa are involved in causal relationships with others, and show that strong interspecific interactions are rarely conserved across two body sites whereas strong intraspecific interactions are much more conserved, ranging from 33% between the gut and right-hand to 70% between the two hands. Therefore, in the absence of guiding assumptions about ecological interactions, Granger causality and related techniques may be particularly helpful for understanding the driving factors governing microbiome composition and structure.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/K6AVJdHj6UU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) control cellular signaling and responses. Many of these GPCRs are modulated by cholesterol and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) which have been shown to co-exist with saturated lipids in ordered membrane domains. However, the lipid compositions of such domains extracted from the brain cortex tissue of individuals suffering from GPCR-associated neurological disorders show drastically lowered levels of PUFAs. Here, using free energy techniques and multiscale simulations of numerous membrane proteins, we show that the presence of the PUFA DHA helps helical multi-pass proteins such as GPCRs partition into ordered membrane domains. The mechanism is based on hybrid lipids, whose PUFA chains coat the rough protein surface, while the saturated chains face the raft environment, thus minimizing perturbations therein. Our findings suggest that the reduction of GPCR partitioning to their native ordered environments due to PUFA depletion might affect the function of these receptors in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, where the membrane PUFA levels in the brain are decreased. We hope that this work inspires experimental studies on the connection between membrane PUFA levels and GPCR signaling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0m2M7u1HivE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Drug combination sensitivity scoring facilitates the discovery of synergistic and efficacious drug combinations in cancer</title>

High-throughput drug screening has facilitated the discovery of drug combinations in cancer. Many existing studies adopted a full matrix design, aiming for the characterization of drug pair effects for cancer cells. However, the full matrix design may be suboptimal as it requires a drug pair to be combined at multiple concentrations in a full factorial manner. Furthermore, many of the computational tools assess only the synergy but not the sensitivity of drug combinations, which might lead to false positive discoveries. We proposed a novel cross design to enable a more cost-effective and simultaneous testing of drug combination sensitivity and synergy. We developed a drug combination sensitivity score (CSS) to determine the sensitivity of a drug pair, and showed that the CSS is highly reproducible between the replicates and thus supported its usage as a robust metric. We further showed that CSS can be predicted using machine learning approaches which determined the top pharmaco-features to cluster cancer cell lines based on their drug combination sensitivity profiles. To assess the degree of drug interactions using the cross design, we developed an S synergy score based on the difference between the drug combination and the single drug dose-response curves. We showed that the S score is able to detect true synergistic and antagonistic drug combinations at an accuracy level comparable to that using the full matrix design. Taken together, we showed that the cross design coupled with the CSS sensitivity and S synergy scoring methods may provide a robust and accurate characterization of both drug combination sensitivity and synergy levels, with minimal experimental materials required. Our experimental-computational approach could be utilized as an efficient pipeline for improving the discovery rate in high-throughput drug combination screening, particularly for primary patient samples which are difficult to obtain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/umAf3OS2eYk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation is critical for maintenance and modification of synapse strength. Specifically, NMDAR activation by spontaneous glutamate release has been shown to mediate some forms of synaptic plasticity as well as synaptic development. Interestingly, there is evidence that within individual synapses each release mode may be segregated such that postsynaptically there are distinct pools of responsive receptors. In order to examine potential regulators of NMDAR activation due to spontaneous glutamate release in cultured hippocampal neurons, we utilized GCaMP6f imaging at single synapses in concert with confocal and super-resolution imaging. Using these single spine approaches, we found that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry activated by spontaneous release tends to be carried by GluN2B-NMDARs. Additionally, the amount of NMDAR activation varies greatly both between synapses and within synapses, and is unrelated to spine and synapse size, but does correlate loosely with synapse distance from the soma. Despite the critical role of spontaneous activation of NMDARs in maintaining synaptic function, their activation seems to be controlled factors other than synapse size or synapse distance from the soma. It is most likely that NMDAR activation by spontaneous release influenced variability in subsynaptic receptor position, release site position, vesicle content, and channel properties. Therefore, spontaneous activation of NMDARs appears to be regulated distinctly from other receptor types, notably AMPARs, within individual synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the synaptic mechanisms of learning and memory is critically to the field of neuroscience and for human health. A key neurotransmitter receptor involved in learning is the NMDA receptor, and exploration of its regulation is vital. Here, we optimized optical tools to allow detailed characterization of NMDA receptor activity at single synapses, along with analysis of synaptic structural features. The amount of receptor activation is independent of synapse size, but weakly dependent on synapse position within the dendritic tree. Notably, we found that NMDA receptors activated following spontaneous neurotransmitter release tend be GluN2B-containing receptors. The unique mechanisms that regulate the number and positioning of these receptors within synapses will have important consequences for control of synaptic development and signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Characteristics of Waveform Shape in Parkinsons Disease Detected with Scalp Electroencephalography</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Neural activity in the beta frequency range (13-30 Hz) is excessively synchronized in Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Previous work using invasive intracranial recordings and non-invasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) has shown that correlations between beta phase and broad-band gamma amplitude (i.e., phase amplitude coupling) are elevated in PD, perhaps a reflection of this synchrony. Recently, it has also been shown, in invasive human recordings, that nonsinusoidal features of beta oscillation shape also characterize PD. Here we show that these features of beta waveform shape also distinguish PD patients on and off medication using non-invasive recordings in a dataset of 15 PD patients with resting scalp EEG. Specifically, beta oscillations over sensorimotor electrodes in PD patients off medication had greater sharpness asymmetry and steepness asymmetry than on medication (sign rank, p&amp;lt;0.02, corrected). We also showed that beta oscillations over sensorimotor cortex most often had a canonical shape, and that using this prototypical shape as an inclusion-criteria increased the effect size of our findings. Together our findings suggest that novel ways of measuring beta synchrony that incorporate waveform shape could improve detection of PD pathophysiology in non-invasive recordings. Moreover, they motivate the consideration of waveform shape in future EEG studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Diagnosis and long-term monitoring of Parkinson's disease (PD) is mainly assessed via clinical rating scales which are subjective and can be imprecise. An objective measure of PD would be extremely valuable, especially one that could be acquired non-invasively. Here we show, using scalp electroencephalography (EEG), that the nonsinusoidal shape of beta (13-30 Hz) oscillations over sensorimotor cortex distinguishes PD patients on and off medication and patients off medication from controls. This change in waveform shape may reflect hypersynchronous input, possibly originating from basal ganglia. Thus, waveform shape is a putative non-invasive electrophysiology biomarker of PD state with potential utility for assessing treatments, monitoring disease, or diagnosis. This signature can be detected with a safe, affordable, and available method (i.e. EEG).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Cerebellar stellate cell excitability is coordinated by shifts in the gating behavior of voltage-gated Na+ and A-type K+ channels</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Neuronal excitability in the vertebrate brain is governed by the coordinated activity of both ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels. In the cerebellum, spontaneous action potential (AP) firing of inhibitory stellate cells (SCs) is variable, typically operating within the 5-30 Hz frequency range. AP frequency is shaped by the activity of somatodendritic A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and the inhibitory effect of GABAergic transmission. An added complication, however, is that whole-cell recording from SCs induces a time-dependent and sustained increase in membrane excitability making it difficult to define the full range of firing rates. Here, we show that whole-cell recording in cerebellar SCs of both male and female mice augments firing rates by reducing the membrane potential at which APs are initiated. AP threshold is lowered due to a hyperpolarizing shift in the gating behavior of voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. Whole-cell recording also elicits a hyperpolarizing shift in the gating behavior of A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels which contributes to increased firing rates. Hodgkin-Huxley modeling and pharmacological experiments reveal that gating shifts in A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel activity do not impact AP threshold, but rather promote channel inactivation which removes restraint on the upper limit of firing rates. Taken together, our work reveals an unappreciated impact of voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels that work in coordination with A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels to regulate the firing frequency of cerebellar SCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The cerebellum is a brain region that fulfills critical roles in motor function in adults as well as being linked to neurodevelopmental disorders in the developing brain. Significant attention has been directed towards understanding connectivity within the cerebellum and how its neuronal circuits are regulated. Stellate cells are inhibitory GABAergic interneurons that make-up neuronal circuits that control the output from the cerebral cortex by regulating the firing properties of Purkinje cells. The strength of GABAergic inhibition of Purkinje cells is governed by the excitability of stellate cells which fire action potentials at a wide range of frequencies. Our study reveals an unappreciated role of voltage-gated sodium channels that work in coordination with A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-channels to establish stellate cell firing rates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Epilepsy in families: Age at onset is a familial trait, independent of syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25499?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25499?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested 2 hypotheses regarding age at onset within familial epilepsies: (1) family members with epilepsy tend to have similar ages at onset, independent of epilepsy syndrome; and (2) age at onset is younger in successive generations after controlling for sampling bias.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyzed clinical data collected by the Epi4K Consortium (303 multiplex families, 1,120 individuals). To test hypothesis 1, we used both linear mixed models commonly used for heritability analysis and Cox regression models with frailty terms to assess clustering of onset within families after controlling for other predictors. To test hypothesis 2, we used mixed effects models, pairwise analyses, and survival analysis to address sampling‐related bias that may mimic anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding hypothesis 1, age at seizure onset was significantly heritable (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.17, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) after adjusting for epilepsy type, sex, site, history of febrile seizure, and age at last observation. This finding remained significant after adjusting for epilepsy syndromes, and was robust across statistical methods in all families and in generalized families. Regarding hypothesis 2, the mean age at onset decreased in successive generations (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). After adjusting for age at last observation, this effect was not significant in mixed effects models (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.14), but remained significant in pairwise (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0003) and survival analyses (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age at seizure onset is an independent familial trait, and may have genetic determinants distinct from the determinants of particular epilepsy syndromes. Younger onsets in successive generations can be explained in part by sampling bias, but the presence of genetic anticipation cannot be excluded. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Embodied robots driven by self-organized environmental feedback. (arXiv:1905.07153v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Which kind of complex behavior may arise from self-organizing principles? We
investigate this question for the case of snake-like robots composed of
passively coupled segments, with every segment containing two wheels actuated
separately by a single neuron. The robot is self organized both on the level of
the individual wheels and with respect to inter-wheel coordination, which
arises exclusively from the mechanical coupling of the individual wheels and
segments. For the individual wheel, the generating principle proposed results
in locomotive states that correspond to self-organized limit cycles of the
sensorimotor loop.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our robot interacts with the environment by monitoring the state of its
actuators, that is via propriosensation. External sensors are absent. In a
structured environment the robot shows complex emergent behavior that includes
pushing movable blocks around, reversing direction when hitting a wall and
turning when climbing a slope. On flat grounds the robot wiggles in a
snake-like manner, when moving at higher velocities. We also investigate the
emergence of motor primitives, viz the route to locomotion, which is
characterized by a series of local and global bifurcations in terms of
dynamical system theory.

	<description>NRF2 is emerging as a major regulator of cellular metabolism. However, most studies have been performed in cancer cells, where co-occurring mutations and tumor selective pressures complicate the influence of NRF2 on metabolism. Here we use genetically engineered, non-transformed primary murine cells to isolate the most immediate effects of NRF2 on cellular metabolism. We find that NRF2 promotes the accumulation of intracellular cysteine and engages the cysteine homeostatic control mechanism mediated by cysteine dioxygenase 1 (CDO1), which catalyzes the irreversible metabolism of cysteine to cysteine sulfinic acid (CSA). Notably, &lt;i&gt;CDO1&lt;/i&gt; is preferentially silenced by promoter methylation in human non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring mutations in KEAP1, the negative regulator of NRF2. CDO1 silencing promotes proliferation of NSCLC by limiting the futile metabolism of cysteine to the wasteful and toxic byproducts CSA and sulfite (SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;), and depletion of cellular NADPH. Thus, CDO1 is a metabolic liability for NSCLC cells with high intracellular cysteine, particularly NRF2/KEAP1 mutant cells.</description>

	<description>Oncogenic Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are small DNA viruses that infect keratinocytes. After HPV binding to cell surface receptors a cascade of molecular interactions mediates the infectious cellular internalization of virus particles. Aside from the virus itself, important molecular players involved in virus entry include the tetraspanin CD151 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). To date, it is unknown how these components are coordinated in space and time. Here, we studied plasma membrane dynamics of CD151 and EGFR and the HPV16 capsid during the early phase of infection. We find that the proteinase ADAM17 activates the extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK1/2) pathway by the shedding of growth factors that trigger the formation of an endocytic entry platform. Infectious endocytic entry platforms carrying virus particles consist of two-fold larger CD151 domains containing the EGFR. Our finding clearly dissects initial virus binding from ADAM17-dependent assembly of a HPV/CD151/EGFR entry platform.</description>

Blocking amacrine cell synaptic activity potentiates IGF1-mediated axon regeneration by maintaining IGF1R localization to primary cilia, a localization that is normally lost in injured RGCs.</description>

	<description>Methotrexate chemotherapy results in a microglial-dependent reduction of Bdnf expression and loss of activity-regulated myelination, which requires Bdnf to TrkB signaling. OPC-specific loss of TrkB results in cognitive impairment. Stimulating OPC TrkB signaling restores myelination and rescues cognition after MTX.</description>

In the last several years, technological advances improving our ability to identify mRNA modifications, coupled with the discovery of proteins that add and remove these marks, have substantially expanded our knowledge of how the epitranscriptome shapes gene expression. Efforts to uncover functional roles for mRNA modifications have begun to reveal important roles for some marks within the nervous system, and animal models have emerged which demonstrate severe neurodevelopmental and neurocognitive abnormalities resulting from the loss of mRNA modification machinery. Here, we review the recent advances in the field of neuroepitranscriptomics, with a particular emphasis on how modifications to mRNAs within the brain contribute to synaptic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Residual Descending Motor Pathways Influence Spasticity after Spinal Cord Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spasticity is one of the most common symptoms manifested in humans with spinal cord injury (SCI). The neural mechanisms contributing to its development are not yet understood. Using neurophysiological and imaging techniques, we examined the influence of residual descending motor pathways on spasticity in humans with SCI.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We measured spasticity in 33 individuals with motor complete SCI (determined by clinical exam) without preservation of voluntary motor output in the quadriceps femoris muscle. To examine residual descending motor pathways, we used magnetic and electrical stimulation over the leg motor cortex to elicit motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the quadriceps femoris muscle and structural magnetic resonance imaging to measure spinal cord atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that 60% of participants showed symptoms of spasticity while the other 40% showed no spasticity, demonstrating the presence of two clear subgroups of humans with motor complete SCI. MEPs were only present in individuals who had spasticity and MEP size correlated with the severity of spasticity. Spinal cord atrophy was greater in non‐spastic compared with spastic subjects. Notably, the degree of spared tissue in the lateral regions of the spinal cord was positively correlated with the severity of spasticity, indicating preservation of white matter related to motor tracts when spasticity was present.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results support the hypothesis that preservation of descending motor pathways influence spasticity in humans with motor complete SCI; a knowledge that might help the rehabilitation and assessment of people with SCI.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To define a distinct, dominantly inherited, mild skeletal myopathy associated with prominent and consistent tremor in two unrelated, three‐generation families.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical evaluations as well as exome and panel sequencing analyses were performed in affected and nonaffected members of two families to identify genetic variants segregating with the phenotype. Histological assessment of a muscle biopsy specimen was performed in 1 patient, and quantitative tremor analysis was carried out in 2 patients. Molecular modeling studies and biochemical assays were performed for both mutations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two novel missense mutations in &lt;i&gt;MYBPC1&lt;/i&gt; (p.E248K in family 1 and p.Y247H in family 2) were identified and shown to segregate perfectly with the myopathy/tremor phenotype in the respective families. &lt;i&gt;MYBPC1&lt;/i&gt; encodes slow myosin binding protein‐C (sMyBP‐C), a modular sarcomeric protein playing structural and regulatory roles through its dynamic interaction with actin and myosin filaments. The Y247H and E248K mutations are located in the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐terminal M‐motif of sMyBP‐C. Both mutations result in markedly increased binding of the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; terminus to myosin, possibly interfering with normal cross‐bridge cycling as the first muscle‐based step in tremor genesis. The clinical tremor features observed in all mutation carriers, together with the tremor physiology studies performed in family 2, suggest amplification by an additional central loop modulating the clinical tremor phenomenology.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we link two novel missense mutations in &lt;i&gt;MYBPC1&lt;/i&gt; with a dominant, mild skeletal myopathy invariably associated with a distinctive tremor. The molecular, genetic, and clinical studies are consistent with a unique sarcomeric origin of the tremor, which we classify as “myogenic tremor.” ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Functional brain networks self-assemble during development, although the molecular basis of network assembly is poorly understood. Protocadherin-19 (&lt;i&gt;pcdh19&lt;/i&gt;) is a homophilic cell adhesion molecule that is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, and influences multiple cellular and developmental events in zebrafish. Although loss of &lt;i&gt;PCDH19&lt;/i&gt; in humans and model organisms leads to functional deficits, the underlying network defects remain unknown. Here, we employ multiplane, resonant-scanning &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon calcium imaging of developing zebrafish, and use graph theory to characterize the development of resting state functional networks in both wild-type and &lt;i&gt;pcdh19&lt;/i&gt; mutant larvae. We find that the brain networks of &lt;i&gt;pcdh19&lt;/i&gt; mutants display enhanced clustering and an altered developmental trajectory of network assembly. Our results show that functional imaging and network analysis in zebrafish larvae is an effective approach for characterizing the developmental impact of lesions in genes of clinical interest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: December 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 59&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Priit Pruunsild, Hilmar Bading&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuronal activity-induced gene expression programs involved in synaptic structure- and plasticity-related functions are similar in mice and humans, yet bear distinct features. These include gains or losses of activity-responsiveness of certain genes and differences in gene induction profiles. Here, we discuss a possible origin of dissimilarities in activity-regulated transcription between species. We highlight that while synapse-to-nucleus signalling pathways are evolutionarily conserved, &lt;em&gt;cis&lt;/em&gt;-regulatory plasticity has been driving species-specific remodelling of the activity-controlled enhancer landscape, thereby affecting gene regulation. In particular, evolutionary rearrangements of transcription factor binding site placements together with potential species-dependent developmental stage- and/or cell type-specific epigenetic and other &lt;em&gt;trans&lt;/em&gt;-acting mechanisms are most likely at least in part accountable for between-species diversity in activity-regulated transcription. It is conceivable that &lt;em&gt;cis&lt;/em&gt;-regulatory plasticity may have equipped the synaptic activity-driven adaptive gene program in human neurons with unique, species-specific qualities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Hold Your Methods! How Multineuronal Firing Ensembles Can Be Studied Using Classical Spike-Train Analysis Techniques</title>

	<description>Responses of neuronal populations play an important role in the encoding of stimulus related information. However, the inherent multidimensionality required to describe population activity has imposed significant challenges and has limited the applicability of classical spike train analysis techniques. Here, we show that these limitations can be overcome. We first quantify the collective activity of neurons as multidimensional vectors (patterns). Then we characterize the behavior of these patterns by applying classical spike train analysis techniques: peri-stimulus time histograms, tuning curves and auto- and cross- correlation histograms. We find that patterns can exhibit a broad spectrum of properties, some ressembling and others substantially differing from those of their component neurons. We show that in some cases pattern behavior cannot be intuitively inferred from the activity of component neurons. Importantly, silent neurons play a critical role in shaping pattern expression. By correlating pattern timing with local-field potentials, we show that the method can reveal fine temporal coordination of cortical circuits at the mesoscale. Because of its simplicity and reliance on well understood classical analysis methods the proposed approach is valuable for the study of neuronal population dynamics.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Unbalanced Occlusion Modifies the Pattern of Brain Activity During Execution of a Finger to Thumb Motor Task</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00499</link>
	<description>In order to assess possible influences of occlusion on motor performance, we studied by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) the changes in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal induced at brain level by a finger to thumb motor task in a population of subjects characterized by an asymmetric activation of jaw muscles during clenching (malocclusion). In these subjects, appropriate occlusal correction by an oral orthotic (bite) reduced the masticatory asymmetry. The finger to thumb task was performed while the subject’s dental arches were touching, in two conditions: a) with the teeth in direct contact (Bite OFF) and b) with the bite interposed between the arches (Bite ON). Both conditions required only a very slight activation of masticatory muscles. Maps of the BOLD signal recorded during the movement were contrasted with the resting condition (activation maps). Areas of increased BOLD signal in the activation maps were observed bilaterally, being larger in Bite OFF than Bite ON. These areas included the sensorimotor cortex, the supplementary-premotor cortex, the cerebellum and the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca’s area). Between conditions comparison of the activation maps (Bite OFF/Bite ON) showed that, in Bite OFF, the BOLD signal was significantly higher at the level of the trigeminal sensorimotor region, the premotor cortex, the cerebellum, the parietal, temporal, occipital and limbic regions (bilaterally) as well as within the left Broca’s area. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that malocclusion makes movement performance more difficult, requiring a stronger activation of the Broca’s area, which participate in planning of the motor sequence, and of the cerebellum, which is essential in motor coordination. Moreover, malocclusion leads to a higher spread of activation in motor regions not directly involved in the control of the moving body parts and generates an higher engagement of regions involved in visuo-spatial and temporal processing, as well as in the control of cognitive activities and alertness levels.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: A Nutraceutical Strategy to Slowing Down the Progression of Cone Death in an Animal Model of Retinitis Pigmentosa</title>

	<description>Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal dystrophy characterized by progressive degeneration of the visual cells and abnormalities in retinal pigment epithelium, the vision is lost slowly and the final outcome is total blindness. The primary mutation responsible for RP is in rod but subsequently cone photoreceptors are also affected. The main modality of photoreceptor cell death is activation of apoptosis pathway but the biological mechanism linking the primary degeneration of rod to the secondary death of cone is still poorly understood. Possible causes of the secondary cone death are oxidative stress and/ or release of toxic factors from dying rods. The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of nutraceutical molecules with antioxidant properties on the progression of the disease in an established animal model of RP, rd10 mice. We show that chronic treatment per os with a flavanone (naringenin) or a flavonol (quercetin) present in citrus fruits, grapes and apples, preserves retinal morphology and ameliorate functionality. These actions are associated with a significant reduction of stress-oxidative markers, such as the detoxifying enzymes Sod1 and Sod2. In addition, naringenin and quercetin treatment reduces the levels of acrolein staining associated with a reduction of ROS in the cellular environment. The study demonstrates the beneficial effects of naringenin and quercetin, two molecules that possess antioxidant properties, limiting neurodegeneration and thus preventing cone damage.</description>

	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00447</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00447</link>
	<description>Objectives: The utility of continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) as index of cortical plasticity is limited by inadequate characterization of its test-retest reliability. Thus, we evaluated the reliability of cTBS aftereffects, and explored the roles of age, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphisms.

Methods: 28 healthy adults (age range 21–65) underwent two identical cTBS sessions (median interval = 9.5 days) targeting the motor cortex. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of the log-transformed, baseline-corrected amplitude of motor evoked potentials (ΔMEP) at 5–60 minutes post-cTBS (T5–T60) were calculated. 

Results: ΔMEP at T50 was the most-reliable cTBS measure in the whole sample (ICC = 0.53). Area under-the-curve (AUC) of ΔMEPs was most reliable when calculated over the full 60 minutes post-cTBS (ICC = 0.40). cTBS measures were substantially more reliable in younger participants (&amp;lt; 35 yr) and those with BDNF Val66Val and APOE ε4– genotypes.

Conclusions: cTBS aftereffects are most reliable when assessed 50 minutes post-cTBS, or when cumulative ΔMEP measures are calculated over 30–60 minutes post-cTBS. Reliability of cTBS aftereffects is influenced by age, and BDNF and APOE polymorphisms. Reliability coefficients are used to adjust effect-size calculations for interpretation and planning of cTBS studies.</description>

	<description>Cerebral micro-bleedings (CMBs) as a type of small chronic brain bleeding could have many side effects to patients who suffer from it, such as inducing stroke, loss of brain functions or side effects from other medications and treatment. Therefore, it is important and essential to detect CMBs timely and better to be in an early stage for prompt treatment. In this research, we proposed employing DenseNet 201 as the basic method, and transfer learning for CMBs detection. In order to generate the samples for training, we used sliding window to cover the whole image from left to right and from up to bottom, and based on the central pixel, we can decide target value. Considering the data imbalance, the cost matrix was used in this research. Then, based on the new model, we tested the classification accuracy, and it achieved 97.71%, which provides better performance than the state of art methods.</description>

	<description>Vesicular storage of neurotransmitters, which allows their subsequent exocytotic release, is essential for chemical transmission in the central nervous system. Neurotransmitter uptake into secretory vesicles is carried out by vesicular transporters, which use the electrochemical proton gradient generated by a vacuolar H+-ATPase to drive neurotransmitter vesicular accumulation. ATP and other nucleotides are relevant extracellular signaling molecules that participate in a variety of biological processes. Although the active transport of nucleotides into secretory vesicles has been characterized from the pharmacological and biochemical point of view, the protein responsible for such vesicular accumulation remained unidentified for some time. In 2008, the human SLC17A9 gene, the last identified member of the SLC17 transporters, was found to encode the vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT). VNUT is expressed in various ATP-secreting cells and is able to transport a wide variety of nucleotides in a vesicular membrane potential-dependent manner. VNUT knockout mice lack vesicular storage and release of ATP, resulting in blockage of the purinergic transmission. This review summarizes the current studies on VNUT and analyzes the physiological relevance of the vesicular nucleotide transport in the central nervous system. The possible role of VNUT in the development of some pathological processes, such as chronic neuropathic pain or glaucoma is also discussed. The putative involvement of VNUT in these pathologies raises the possibility of the use of VNUT inhibitors for therapeutic purposes.</description>

	<description>The axon is responsible for integrating synaptic signals, generating action potentials (APs), propagating those APs to downstream synapses and converting them into patterns of neurotransmitter vesicle release. This process is mediated by a rich assortment of voltage-gated ion channels and vesicle exocytosis machinery. Moreover, neuromodulators control the activity of these proteins through G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling cascades. Here, we review cellular mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in axonal ion channel neuromodulation and examine how changes to ion channel function affect AP initiation, AP propagation, and the release of neurotransmitter. We then examine how these mechanisms could modulate synaptic function by focusing on three key features of synaptic information transmission: synaptic strength, synaptic variability, and short-term plasticity.  Viewing these cellular mechanisms of neuromodulation from a functional perspective may assist in extending these findings to theories of neural circuit function and its neuromodulation.</description>

MHC genes, which code for proteins responsible for presenting pathogen-derived antigens to the host immune system, show remarkable copy-number variation both between and within species. However, the evolutionary forces driving this variation are poorly understood. Here, we use computer simulations to investigate whether evolution of the number of MHC variants in the genome can be shaped by the number of pathogen species the host population encounters (pathogen richness). Our model assumed that while increasing a range of pathogens recognised, expressing additional MHC variants also incurs costs such as an increased risk of autoimmunity. We found that pathogen richness selected for high MHC copy number only when the costs were low. Furthermore, the shape of the association was modified by the rate of pathogen evolution, with faster pathogen mutation rates selecting for increased host MHC copy number, but only when pathogen richness was low to moderate. Thus, taking into account factors other than pathogen richness may help explain wide variation between vertebrate species in the number of MHC genes. Within population, variation in the number of unique MHC variants carried by individuals (INV) was observed under most parameter combinations, except at low pathogen richness. This variance gave rise to positive correlations between INV and host immunocompetence (proportion of pathogens recognised). However, within-population variation in host immunocompetence declined with pathogen richness. Thus, counterintuitively, pathogens can contribute more to genetic variance for host fitness in species exposed to fewer pathogen species, with consequences to predictions from “Hamilton-Zuk” theory of sexual selection.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WrYdAi7ec8M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

GABAergic interneurons play an important role in shaping the activity of excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs). How the various inhibitory cell types contribute to neuronal information processing, however, is not resolved. Here, we propose a functional role for a widespread network motif consisting of parvalbumin- (PV), somatostatin- (SOM) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons. Following the idea that PV and SOM interneurons control the distribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition onto PCs, we suggest that mutual inhibition between VIP and SOM cells translates weak inputs to VIP interneurons into large changes of somato-dendritic inhibition of PCs. Using a computational model, we show that the neuronal and synaptic properties of the circuit support this hypothesis. Moreover, we demonstrate that the SOM-VIP motif allows transient inputs to persistently switch the circuit between two processing modes, in which top-down inputs onto apical dendrites of PCs are either integrated or canceled.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cHeR4X37sog&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Author summary: Improvements in technology often drive scientific discovery. Therefore, research requires sustained investment in the latest equipment and training for the researchers who are going to use it. Prioritising and administering infrastructure investment is challenging because future needs are difficult to predict. In the past, highly computationally demanding research was associated primarily with particle physics and astronomy experiments. However, as biology becomes more quantitative and bioscientists generate more and more data, their computational requirements may ultimately exceed those of physical scientists. Computation has always been central to bioinformatics, but now imaging experiments have rapidly growing data processing and storage requirements. There is also an urgent need for new modelling and simulation tools to provide insight and understanding of these biophysical experiments. Bioscience communities must work together to provide the software and skills training needed in their areas. Research-active institutions need to recognise that computation is now vital in many more areas of discovery and create an environment where it can be embraced. The public must also become aware of both the power and limitations of computing, particularly with respect to their health and personal data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/juDy-TmxPJM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Somatosensory thalamocortical (TC) neurons from the ventrobasal (VB) thalamus are central components in the flow of sensory information between the periphery and the cerebral cortex, and participate in the dynamic regulation of thalamocortical states including wakefulness and sleep. This property is reflected at the cellular level by the ability to generate action potentials in two distinct firing modes, called tonic firing and low-threshold bursting. Although the general properties of TC neurons are known, we still lack a detailed characterization of their morphological and electrical properties in the VB thalamus. The aim of this study was to build biophysically-detailed models of VB TC neurons explicitly constrained with experimental data from rats. We recorded the electrical activity of VB neurons (N = 49) and reconstructed morphologies in 3D (N = 50) by applying standardized protocols. After identifying distinct electrical types, we used a multi-objective optimization to fit single neuron electrical models (e-models), which yielded multiple solutions consistent with the experimental data. The models were tested for generalization using electrical stimuli and neuron morphologies not used during fitting. A local sensitivity analysis revealed that the e-models are robust to small parameter changes and that all the parameters were constrained by one or more features. The e-models, when tested in combination with different morphologies, showed that the electrical behavior is substantially preserved when changing dendritic structure and that the e-models were not overfit to a specific morphology. The models and their analysis show that automatic parameter search can be applied to capture complex firing behavior, such as co-existence of tonic firing and low-threshold bursting over a wide range of parameter sets and in combination with different neuron morphologies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_9xs4TQa7N4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Influence of temperature on motor behaviors in newborn opossums (Monodelphis domestica): an in vitro study</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;External thermosensation is crucial to regulate animal behavior and homeostasis, but the development of the mammalian thermosensory system is not well known. We investigated if temperature could play a role in the control of movements in a mammalian model born very immature, the opossum (&lt;i&gt;Monodelphis domestica&lt;/i&gt;). Like other marsupials, at birth the opossum performs alternate and rhythmic movements with its forelimbs to reach a teat where it attaches in order to continue its development. It was shown that forelimb movements can be induced by mechanical stimulation of the snout in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; preparations of newborns consisting of the neuraxis with skin and forelimbs intact. In the present study, we used puff ejections of cold, neutral (bath temperature) and hot liquid directed towards the snout to induce forelimb responses in such preparations. Either the responses were visually observed under a microscope or triceps muscle activity was recorded. Cold liquid systematically induced forelimb movements and triceps contractions, but neutral and hot temperatures were less potent to do so. Sections of the trigeminal nerves and removal of the facial skin diminished responses to cold and nearly abolished those to hot and neutral stimulations. TRPM8 being the major cold receptor cation channel in adult mammals, we employed immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR to test for its expression, but found that it is not expressed before 13 postnatal days. Overall our results indicate that cold thermosensation exerts a strong influence on motor behaviors in newborn opossums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; External thermosensation is crucial for survival, but its development in mammals is not well understood, particularly at the systemic level. Herein, we tested if temperature perceived by the face influences motor behaviors in newborn opossums, a marsupial with a gestation period one week shorter than rodents of comparable size, thus offering access to early developmental stages. We found that cold temperatures systematically induced forelimb motor responses, but neutral and hot temperatures rarely did so. Moreover, in newborn opossums, cold thermosensation does not involve the major cold receptor in adult mammals, TRPM8. Cold avoidance may be important to sustain motor behaviors of newborn marsupials, when they must find a teat and attach to it in order to pursue their development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Synaptic Wiring of Corticostriatal Circuits in Basal Ganglia: Insights into the Pathogenesis of Neuropsychiatric Disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0076-19.2019v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;The striatum is a key hub in the basal ganglia for processing neural information from the sensory, motor and limbic cortices. The massive and diverse cortical inputs entering the striatum allow the basal ganglia to perform a repertoire of neurological functions ranging from basic level of motor control to high level of cognition. The heterogeneity of the corticostriatal circuits, however, also renders the system susceptible to a repertoire of neurological diseases. Clinical and animal model studies have indicated that defective development of the corticostriatal circuits is linked to various neuropsychiatric disorders, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Importantly, many neuropsychiatric disease-risk genes have been found to form the molecular building blocks of the circuit wiring at the synaptic level. It is therefore imperative to understand how corticostriatal connectivity is established during development. Here, we review the construction during development of these corticostriatal circuits at the synaptic level, which should provide important insights into the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders related to the basal ganglia and help the development of appropriate therapies for these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cortico-basal ganglia circuits control a range of neurobiological functions, ranging from motor control and reward to cognition. The functional diversity of cortico-basal ganglia circuits rests on their diverse inputs from the cerebral cortex. It is likely that the highly heterogeneous nature of corticostriatal inputs makes the corticostriatal circuits vulnerable to a broad range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Here, we highlight the developmental progression and maturation of the morphology and physiology of corticostriatal pathways using neonatal and postnatal rodent brains. We also review the pathogenesis of various neurodevelopmental disorders that are related to dysfunctions of corticostriatal circuits. Exploring synaptic wiring of corticostriatal circuits should create a research window for the development of therapeutic approaches for treating basal ganglia-related neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Reward-related behavior is complex and its dysfunction correlated with neuropsychiatric illness. Dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) have long been associated with different aspects of reward function, but it remains to be disentangled how distinct VTA dopamine neurons contribute to the full range of behaviors ascribed to the VTA. Here, a recently identified subtype of VTA neurons molecularly defined by NeuroD6 (NEX1M) was addressed. Among all VTA dopamine neurons, less than 15% were identified as positive for NeuroD6. In addition to dopaminergic markers, sparse NeuroD6 neurons expressed the &lt;i&gt;Vesicular glutamate transporter 2&lt;/i&gt; gene. To achieve manipulation of NeuroD6 VTA neurons, NeuroD6(NEX)-Cre-driven mouse genetics and optogenetics were implemented. First, expression of &lt;i&gt;Vesicular monoamine transporter 2&lt;/i&gt; was ablated to disrupt dopaminergic function in NeuroD6 VTA neurons. Comparing &lt;i&gt;Vmat2&lt;sup&gt;lox/lox;NEX-Cre&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; conditional knockout (cKO) mice with littermate controls, it was evident that baseline locomotion, preference for sugar and ethanol, and place preference upon amphetamine- and cocaine-induced conditioning were similar between genotypes. However, locomotion upon repeated psychostimulant administration was significantly elevated above control level in cKO mice. Second, optogenetic activation of NEX-Cre VTA neurons was shown to induce dopamine release and glutamatergic post-synaptic currents within the nucleus accumbens. Third, optogenetic stimulation of NEX-Cre VTA neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; induced significant place preference behavior, while stimulation of VTA neurons defined by Calretinin failed to cause a similar response. The results show that NeuroD6 VTA neurons exert distinct regulation over specific aspects of reward-related behavior, findings that contribute to the current understanding of VTA neurocircuitry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Reward-related behavior is complex and its dysfunction is implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders, including drug addiction. Midbrain dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are crucial for reward behavior, but due to recently uncovered heterogeneity, it remains to be fully resolved how they regulate reward responsiveness and how their dysfunction might contribute to disease. Here we show that the recently described NeuroD6 (NEX) subtype of VTA dopamine neurons is involved in psychostimulant sensitization and that optogenetic stimulation of NEX-Cre VTA neurons induces dopamine release, glutamatergic post-synaptic currents and real time place preference behavior. NeuroD6 VTA neurons thus exert distinct regulation over specific aspects of reward-related behavior, findings that contribute to the current understanding of VTA neurocircuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mapping all the neurons in the brain requires automatic reconstruction of
entire cells from volume electron microscopy data. The flood-filling networks
(FFN) architecture can achieve leading performance. However, the training of
the network is computationally very expensive. In order to reduce the training
time, we implemented synchronous and data-parallel distributed training using
the Horovod framework on top of the published FFN code. We demonstrated the
scaling of FFN training up to 1024 Intel Knights Landing (KNL) nodes at Argonne
Leadership Computing Facility. We investigated the training accuracy with
different optimizers, learning rates, and optional warm-up periods. We
discovered that square root scaling for learning rate works best beyond 16
nodes, which is contrary to the case of smaller number of nodes, where linear
learning rate scaling with warm-up performs the best. Our distributed training
reaches 95% accuracy in approximately 4.5 hours on 1024 KNL nodes using Adam
optimizer.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06225</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Information processing in the brain is conducted by a concerted action of
multiple neural populations. Gaining insights in the organization and dynamics
of such populations can best be studied with broadband intracranial recordings
of so-called extracellular field potential, reflecting neuronal spiking as well
as mesoscopic activities, such as waves, oscillations, intrinsic large
deflections, and multiunit spiking activity. Such signals are critical for our
understanding of how neuronal ensembles encode sensory information and how such
information is integrated in the large networks underlying cognition. The
aforementioned principles are now well accepted, yet the efficacy of extracting
information out of the complex neural data, and their employment for improving
our understanding of neural networks, critically depends on the mathematical
processing steps ranging from simple detection of action potentials in noisy
traces - to fitting advanced mathematical models to distinct patterns of the
neural signal potentially underlying intra-processing of information, e.g.
interneuronal interactions. Here, we present a robust strategy for detecting
signals in broadband and noisy time series such as spikes, sharp waves and
multi-unit activity data that is solely based on the intrinsic statistical
distribution of the recorded data. By using so-called higher criticism - a
second-level significance testing procedure comparing the fraction of observed
significances to an expected fraction under the global null - we are able to
detect small signals in correlated noisy time-series without prior filtering,
denoising or data regression. Results demonstrate the efficiency and
reliability of the method and versatility over a wide range of experimental
conditions and suggest the appropriateness of higher criticism to characterize
neuronal dynamics without prior manipulation of the data.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06038</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The theory of communication through coherence (CTC) proposes that brain
oscillations reflect changes in the excitability of neurons, and therefore the
successful communication between two oscillating neural populations depends not
only on the strength of the signal emitted but also on the relative phases
between them. More precisely, effective communication occurs when the emitting
and receiving populations are properly phase locked so the inputs sent by the
emitting population arrive at the phases of maximal excitability of the
receiving population. To study this setting, we consider a population rate
model consisting of excitatory and inhibitory cells modelling the receiving
population, and we perturb it with a time-dependent periodic function modelling
the input from the emitting population. We consider the stroboscopic map for
this system and compute numerically the fixed and periodic points of this map
and their bifurcations as the amplitude and the frequency of the perturbation
are varied. From the bifurcation diagram, we identify the phase-locked states
as well as different regions of bistability. We explore carefully the dynamics
emphasizing its implications for the CTC theory. In particular, we study how
the input gain depends on the timing between the input and the inhibitory
action of the receiving population. Our results show that naturally an optimal
phase locking for CTC emerges, and provide a mechanism by which the receiving
population can implement selective communication. Moreover, the presence of
bistable regions, suggests a mechanism by which different communication regimes
between brain areas can be established without changing the structure of the
network

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sleep change is commonly reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and
their brain wave studies show decrease in dreaming and non-dreaming stages.
Although sleep disturbance is generally considered as a consequence of AD, it
might also be a risk factor of AD as new biological evidence shows. Leveraging
National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR), we built a unique cohort of 83 cases
and 331 controls with clinical variables and EEG signals. Supervised tensor
factorization method was applied for this temporal dataset to extract
discriminative sleep patterns. Among the 30 patterns extracted, we identified 5
significant patterns (4 patterns for AD likely and 1 pattern for normal ones)
and their visual patterns provide interesting linkage to sleep with repeated
wakefulness, insomnia, epileptic seizure, and etc. This study is preliminary
but findings are interesting, which is a first step to provide quantifiable
evidences to measure sleep as a risk factor of AD.

	<description>Although we know a great deal about monosynaptic connectivity, transmission and integration in the mammalian nervous system from in vitro studies, very little is known in vivo. This is partly because it is technically difficult to evoke action potentials and simultaneously record small amplitude subthreshold responses in closely (&amp;lt; 150 µm) located pairs of neurons. To address this, we have developed in vivo two-photon targeted multiple (2 – 4) whole-cell patch clamp recordings of nearby neurons in superficial cortical layers 1 to 3. Here we describe a step-by-step guide to this approach in the anesthetised mouse primary somatosensory cortex, including: the design of the setup, surgery, preparation of pipettes, targeting and acquisition of multiple whole-cell recordings, as well as in vivo and post-hoc histology. The procedure takes ~ 4 hours from start of surgery to end of recording and allows examinations both into the electrophysiological features of unitary excitatory and inhibitory monosynaptic inputs during different brain states as well as the synaptic mechanisms of correlated neuronal activity.</description>

	<description>Background: Syndecan-1 is an important component of endothelial cell glycocalyx, and has been reported to be a negative regulator of various inflammatory processes. The clinical implication of circulating and CSF syndecan-1 (sCD138) in patients with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis remains unclear.
Objective: We aimed to investigate the association of serum and CSF syndecan-1 levels in anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients.
Methods: A total of 27 patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, 11 viral meningoencephalitis and 22 controls were enrolled in this study. At the time of admission and 3-6-month follow-up, all patients, were measured sCD138, TNF-α, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in serum and CSF by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 
Results: Serum and CSF levels of sCD138 were significantly increased in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Furthermore, at 3-6 months follow-up, CSF levels of sCD138 were significantly decreased in anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients. Changes of sCD138 levels also significantly correlated to ameliorate of mRS scores in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis.
Conclusions: In anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients, high circulating and CSF sCD138 is associated with inflammation and poor clinical prognosis. In this study, we present data supporting the sCD138 as a new biomarker for inflammation of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.</description>

SMA is caused by mutations in the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. SMN functions in the assembly of spliceosomal RNPs and is well conserved in many model systems including mouse, zebrafish, fruit fly, nematode, and fission yeast. Work in Drosophila has primarily focused on loss of SMN function during larval stages, primarily using null alleles or strong hypomorphs. A systematic analysis of SMA-related phenotypes in the context of moderate alleles that more closely mimic the genetics of SMA has not been performed in the fly, leading to debate over the validity and translational value of this model. We therefore examined fourteen Drosophila lines expressing SMA patient-derived missense mutations in Smn, with a focus on neuromuscular phenotypes in the adult stage. Animals were evaluated on the basis of organismal viability and longevity, locomotor function, neuromuscular junction structure, and muscle health. In all cases, we observed phenotypes similar to those of SMA patients, including progressive loss of adult motor function. The severity of these defects is variable, and forms a broad spectrum across the fourteen lines examined, recapitulating the full range of phenotypic severity observed in human SMA. This includes late-onset models of SMA, which have been difficult to produce in other model systems. The results provide direct evidence that SMA-related locomotor decline can be reproduced in the fly and support the use of patient-derived SMN missense mutations as a comprehensive system for modeling SMA.</description>

	<description>Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) is a focal neurodegenerative disease with a strong genetic background, that causes early onset dementia. The present knowledge about the risk loci and causative mutations of FTD mainly derives from genetic linkage analysis, studies of candidate genes, Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) applications. In this review we report recent insights into the genetics of FTD, and, specifically, the results achieved thanks to GWAS and NGS approaches. Linkage studies of large FTD pedigrees have prompted the identification of causal mutations in different genes: mutations in C9orf72, MAPT and GRN genes explain the large majority of cases with a high family history of the disease. In cases with a less clear inheritance, GWAS and NGS have contributed to further understand the genetic picture of FTD. GWAS identified several common genetic variants with a modest risk effect. Of interest, many of these variants are in genes belonging to the endo-lysosomal pathway, the immune response and neuronal survival. On the opposite, the NGS approach allowed the identification of rare variants with a strong risk effect. These variants were identified in known FTD-associated genes and again in genes, involved in the endo-lysosomal pathway and in the immune response. Interestingly, both approaches demonstrated that several genes are associated to multiple neurodegenerative disorders including FTD. Thanks to these complementary approaches, the genetic picture of FTD is becoming more clear and novel key molecular processes are emerging. This will foster opportunities to move toward prevention and therapy for this incurable disease.</description>

	<description>Embelin is well known in ethnomedicine and reported to have central nervous system activities. However, there is no report on blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of embelin. Here the BBB permeability of embelin was evaluated using in vitro primary porcine brain endothelial cell (PBEC) model of the BBB. Embelin was also evaluated for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity and docking prediction for interaction with AChE and amyloid beta (Aβ) binding sites. Embelin was found to be non-toxic to the PBECs and did not disturb the PBEC barrier function. The PBECs showed restrictive tight junctions with average transendothelial electrical resistance of 365.37 ± 113.00 Ω.cm2, for monolayers used for permeability assays. Permeability assays were conducted from apical-to-basolateral direction (blood-to-brain side). Embelin showed apparent permeability (Papp) value of 35.46 + 20.33 × 10-6 cm/s with 85.53% recovery. In vitro AChE inhibitory assay demonstrated that embelin could inhibit the enzyme. Molecular docking study showed that embelin binds well to active site of AChE with CDOCKER interaction energy of -65.75 kcal/mol which correlates with the in vitro results. Docking of embelin with Aβ peptides also revealed the promising binding with low CDOCKER interaction energy. Thus, findings from this study indicate that embelin could be a suitable molecule to be further developed as therapeutic molecule to treat neurological disorders particularly Alzheimer's disease.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: S100 Proteins in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>S100 proteins are calcium-binding proteins that regulate several processes associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) but whose contribution and direct involvement in disease pathophysiology remains to be fully established. Due to neuroinflammation in AD patients, the levels of several S100 proteins are increased in the brain and some S100s play roles related to the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), regulation of amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) levels and Tau phosphorylation. S100 proteins are found associated with protein inclusions, either within plaques or as isolated S100-positive puncta, which suggests an active role in the formation of amyloid aggregates. Indeed, interactions between S100 proteins and aggregating Aβ indicate regulatory roles over the aggregation process, which may either delay or aggravate aggregation, depending on disease stage and relative S100 and Aβ levels. Additionally, S100s are also known to influence AD-related signaling pathways and levels of other cytokines. Recent evidence also suggests that metal-ligation by S100 proteins influences trace metal homeostasis in the brain, particularly of zinc, which is also a major deregulated process in AD. Altogether, this evidence strongly suggests a role of S100 proteins as key players in several AD-linked physiopathological processes, which we discuss in this review.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Increased Serum S100B Levels in Patients With Epilepsy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00456</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00456</link>
	<description>IMPORTANCE Accumulating evidence suggests that serum levels of S100B may play a role in epilepsy.
OBJECTIVE We performed a meta-analysis to quantitatively summarize the serum S100B data available for patients with epilepsy. 
DATA SOURCE Two independent researchers conducted a systematic s investigation of Harvard Hollis+, Open Grey, Clinicaltrials, Wanfangdata and CNKI databases through February 8, 2018, for all studies published in English and Chinese. The search terms included S100B, Calcium-binding protein B in combination with Epilepsy. 
STUDY SELECTION Original studies and reported data from these search terms are included. Studies that data were overlapped with other studies were excluded. 
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Investigators extracted, pooled and analysed data from the included studies using a Fixed-effects model in the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis3.3 and R software. 
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Peripheral blood levels of S100B in patients with epilepsy compared with controls. Aberrations in Peripheral blood levels of S100B were hypothesized to be related to epilepsy.
RESULTS A fixed -effects meta-analysis of all 18 studies, including 1057 unique participants, indicated that patients with Epilepsy had significantly increased peripheral blood levels of S100B compared to controls (Hedges g = 1.568, 95% CI =1.431-1.706, P 0.001). Sensitivity analysis showed that no single study significantly influenced the overall association of peripheral blood levels of S100B and the Epilepsy. Most of the subgroup analyses, including those of Country, assay type and publication language, demonstrated a statistically significant association between peripheral blood levels of S100B and the Epilepsy. Meta-regression analyses indicated that suggesting that more Gender and  Mean age might present serum S100B reductions, but samples size, years, assay type, publication language and country did not show moderating effects on the effect sizes. Furthermore, the trim-and-fill method used to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry in our meta-analysis confirmed that a positive outcome is unlikely to be due to publication bias.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE The results of this meta-analysis provide evidence for a significant increase in serum S100B levels in patients with Epilepsy. Serum S100B is the most worthwhile biomarker of Epilepsy, which is helpful for the clinical diagnosis and prognosis of epilepsy.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: The Extent of Human Apolipoprotein A-I Lipidation Strongly Affects the β-Amyloid Efflux Across the Blood-Brain Barrier in vitro</title>

	<description>Much evidence suggests a protective role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and its major apolipoprotein apoA-I, in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The biogenesis of nascent HDL derived from a first lipidation of apoA-I, which is synthesized by the liver and intestine but not in the brain, in a process mediated by ABCA1. The maturation of nascent HDL in mature spherical HDL is due to a subsequent lipidation step, LCAT-mediated cholesterol esterification and the change of apoA-I conformation. Therefore, different subclasses of apoA-I-HDL simultaneously exist in the blood circulation. Here, we investigated if and how the lipidation state affects the ability of apoA-I-HDL to target and modulate the cerebral beta-amyloid (Abeta) content from the periphery, that is thus far unclear. In particular, different subclasses of HDL, each with different apoA-I lipidation state, were purified from human plasma and their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), to interact with Abeta aggregates, and to affect Abeta efflux across the BBB was assessed in vitro using a transwell system. The results showed that discoidal HDL displayed a superior capability to promote Abeta efflux in vitro (9 x 10-5 cm/min), when compared to apoA-I in other lipidation states. In particular, no effect on Abeta efflux was detected when apoA-I was in mature spherical HDL, suggesting that apoA-I conformation and lipidation could play a role in Abeta clearance from the brain. Finally, when apoA-I folded its structure in discoidal HDL, rather than in spherical ones, it was able to cross the BBB in vitro and strongly destabilize the conformation of Aβ fibrils by decreasing the order of the fibril structure (-24%) and the beta-sheet content (-14%).
These data suggest that the extent of apoA-I lipidation, and consequently its conformation, may represent crucial features that could exert their protective role in AD pathogenesis.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Selective Axonal Expression of the Kv1 Channel Complex in Pre-myelinated GABAergic Hippocampal Neurons</title>

	<description>IIn myelinated fibers, the voltage-gated sodium channels Nav1 are concentrated at the nodal gap to ensure the saltatory propagation of action potentials. The voltage-gated potassium channels Kv1 are segregated at the juxtaparanodes under the compact myelin sheath and may stabilize axonal conduction. It has been recently reported that hippocampal GABAergic neurons display high density of Nav1 channels remarkably in clusters along the axon before myelination (Freeman et al., 2015). In inhibitory neurons, the Nav1 channels are trapped by the ankyrinG scaffold at the axon initial segment (AIS) as observed in pyramidal and granule neurons, but are also forming “pre-nodes”, which may accelerate conduction velocity in pre-myelinated axons. However, the distribution of the Kv1 channels along the pre-myelinated inhibitory axons is still unknown. In the present study, we show that two subtypes of hippocampal GABAergic neurons, namely the somatostatin and parvalbumin positive cells, display a selective high expression of Kv1 channels at the AIS and all along the unmyelinated axons. These inhibitory axons are also highly enriched in molecules belonging to the juxtaparanodal Kv1 complex, including the cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) TAG-1, Caspr2 and ADAM22 and the scaffolding protein 4.1B. Here, taking advantage of hippocampal cultures from 4.1B and TAG-1 knock-out mice, we observed that 4.1B is required for the proper positioning of Caspr2 and TAG-1 along the distal axon, and that TAG-1 deficiency induces alterations in the axonal distribution of Caspr2. However, the axonal expression of Kv1 channels and clustering of ankyrinG were not modified. In conclusion, this study allowed the analysis of the hierarchy between channels, CAMs and scaffolding proteins for their expression along hippocampal inhibitory axons before myelination. The early steps of channel compartmentalization preceding myelination may be crucial for stabilizing nerve impulses switching from a continuous to saltatory conduction during network development.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Impairment and Restoration of Homeostatic Plasticity in Cultured Cortical Neurons From a Mouse Model of Huntington Disease</title>

	<description>Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the huntingtin gene. The onset of symptoms is preceded by synaptic dysfunction. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) refers to processes that maintain the stability of networks of neurons, thought to be required to enable new learning and cognitive flexibility. One type of HSP is synaptic scaling, in which the strength of all of the synapses onto a cell increases or decreases following changes in the cell’s level of activity. Several pathways implicated in synaptic scaling are dysregulated in HD, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and calcium signaling. Here, we investigated whether HSP is disrupted in cortical neurons from an HD mouse model. We treated cultured cortical neurons from wild-type (WT) FVB/N or YAC128 HD mice with tetrodotoxin (TTX) for 48 hours to silence action potentials and then recorded miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). In WT cultures, these increased in both amplitude and frequency after TTX treatment, and further experiments showed that this was a result of insertion of AMPA receptors and formation of new synapses, respectively. Manipulation of BDNF concentration in the culture medium revealed that BDNF signaling contributed to these changes. In contrast to WT cortical neurons, YAC128 cultures showed no response to action potential silencing. Strikingly, we were able to restore the TTX-induced changes in YAC128 cultures by treating them with pridopidine, a drug which enhances BDNF signaling through stimulation of the sigma-1 receptor (S1R), and with the S1R agonist 3-PPP. These data provide evidence for disruption of HSP in cortical neurons from an HD mouse model that is restored by stimulation of S1R. Our results suggest a potential new direction for developing therapy to mitigate cognitive deficits in HD.</description>

	<description>Radiotherapy is a highly effective tool for the treatment of brain cancer. However, radiation also causes detrimental effects in the healthy tissue, leading to neurocognitive sequelae that compromise the quality of life of brain cancer patients. Despite the recognition of this serious complication, no satisfactory solutions exist at present. Here we investigated the effects of intranasal administration of human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSCs) as a neuroprotective strategy for cranial radiation in mice. Our results demonstrated that intranasally delivered hMSCs promote radiation-induced brain injury repair, improving neurological function. This intervention confers protection against inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal loss. hMSC administration reduces persistent activation of damage-induced c-AMP response element-binding signaling in irradiated brains. Furthermore, hMSC treatment did not compromise the survival of glioma-bearing mice. Our findings encourage the therapeutic use of hMSCs as a non-invasive approach to prevent neurological complications of radiotherapy, improving the quality of life of brain tumor patients.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Slow Depolarization Following Individual Spikes in Thin, Unmyelinated Axons in Mammalian Cortex</title>

	<description>An important goal in neuroscience is to understand how neuronal excitability is controlled. Therefore, Gardner-Medwin’s 1972 discovery, that cerebellar parallel fibers were more excitable up to 100 ms after individual action potentials, could have had great impact. If this long-lasting effect were due to intrinsic membrane mechanisms causing a depolarizing after-potential (DAP) this was an important finding. However, that hypothesis met resistance because the use of K+ sensitive electrodes showed that synchronous activation, as commonly used in excitability tests, increased extracellular K+ concentration sufficiently to explain much of the hyperexcitability. It is still controversial because intra-axonal recordings, which could have settled the debate, have not been made from parallel fibers or other axons of similar calibers. If it had not been for the fact that such thin axons are, by far, the most common axon type in cortical areas and control almost all glutamate release, it would be tempting to ignore them until an appropriate intra-axonal recording technique is invented. 
I will go through the literature that, taken together, supports the hypothesis that a DAP is an intrinsic membrane mechanism due to a well-controlled process that stops the fast repolarization at a membrane potential positive to resting membrane potential, leaving the membrane more excitable for ~100 ms during a slow, passive discharge of the membrane capacitance. The DAP helps reduce failures but can also cause uncontrolled bursting if it is not properly controlled. The voltage at which the fast repolarization stops, and the DAP starts, is close the activation range of both Na+ and Ca2+ voltage activated channels and is therefore essential for neuronal function.</description>

	<description>For adults age 65 and older, the brain shows acute functional connectivity decreases after total knee arthroplasty with the severity of change predicted by preoperative cognitive function and brain disease burden. The extent of acute structural microstructural brain changes acutely after surgery remains unknown within the literature. For the current study, we report on the severity of acute post-surgery microstructural brain changes as measured by diffusion imaging and free-water analysis. Participants who underwent total knee arthroplasty under general anesthesia and non-surgery peers were part of a federally funded prospective cohort investigation involving participants. Recruitment occurred between 2013 – 2017. Data were collected in outpatient and inpatient settings within a university-affiliated medical center. A total of 232 TKA patients were referred by the study surgeon and contacted for study inclusion. Of these, 78 met inclusion and exclusion criteria and completed assessment. Five participants were excluded due to anesthetic protocol changes (spinal instead of general) with an additional 12 excluded for imaging-related complications. The total included sample size was 61. A total of 127 non-surgery participants were screened with 66 enrolled. One non-surgery participant was excluded for an imaging-related complication. Total knee arthroplasty and general anesthetic protocols were standardized. Participants received preoperative neurocognitive assessment and brain magnetic resonance imaging, with repeat imaging 48 hours after surgery or pseudosurgery. Free-water analyses were performed using diffusion weighted images and tract-based spatial statistics with baseline cognitive data used to predict free-water changes. Surgery participants had widespread increases in white matter free-water. Surgery participants with higher cognitive functions as measured by immediate memory and less evidence of brain atrophy and disease (i.e., brain integrity) had greater free-water increase. Non-surgery peers had no free-water change. We interpret the surgery group’s free-water change as indicating widespread brain white matter glial response, with greater change indicative of better brain response to the acute surgery/anesthesia experience.</description>

	<description>Decline in information processing with age is well-documented in the scientific literature. However, some discrepancy remains in relation to which cognitive domains are most susceptible to the aging process and which may remain intact. Furthermore, information processing has not been investigated nor considered as a function of affect, familiarity and complexity of tasks in a single experimental study. Thus, the current study investigated rate of visual information processing in 67 young university students (Mage=19.64 years) and 33 educated healthy older adults (Mage=70.33 years), while accounting for depression, anxiety and stress symptoms using the DASS. Rates of visual processing were measured as minimum time of stimulus exposure duration required for correct object recognition on a simple visual task (Inspection Time [IT]), and on a more complex visual cognitive task known as Change Detection [CD]) as well as words per minute on a text reading task (FastaReada). Results demonstrated significantly slower performance by older adults on the IT and CD, but comparable rates of text reading on a semantically more complex, but ecologically valid and familiar visual task that requires organized sequential shifts in attention via eye movements, continuous visual processing, access to working memory and semantic comprehension. The results also demonstrated that affective influences did not play a role in the older adults task performance, and that changes in cognitive domains may begin with older adults being slower to attend to and identify newly appearing familiar objects, as well as slower to encode and embed new information in memory during tasks that require a less practiced/familiar task strategy.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Accelerated Deficits of Spatial Learning and Memory Resulting From Prenatal Inflammatory Insult Are Correlated With Abnormal Phosphorylation and Methylation of Histone 3 in CD-1 Mice</title>

	<description>Gestational infection causes various neurological deficits in offspring, such as age-related spatial learning and memory (SLM) decline. How inflammation causes age-related SLM dysfunction remains unknown. Previous research has indicated that histone modifications, such as phosphorylation of H3S10 (H3S10p) and trimethylation of H3K9 (H3K9me3) may be involved. In our study, pregnant mice received an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 50 or 25 μg/kg) or normal saline during gestational days 15–17. After normal parturition, the offspring were randomly separated into 1-, 6-, 12-, 18-, and 22-month-old groups. SLM performance was assessed using a radial six-arm water maze. The hippocampal levels of H3S10p and H3K9me3 were detected using an immunohistochemical method. The results indicated that the offspring had significantly impaired SLM, with decreased H3S10p and increased H3K9me3 levels from 12 months onward. Maternal LPS exposure during late gestation significantly and dose-dependently exacerbated the age-related impairment of SLM, with the decrease in H3S10p and increase in H3K9me3 beginning at 12 months in the offspring. The histone modifications (H3S10p and H3K9me3) were significantly correlated with impairment of SLM. Our findings suggest that prenatal exposure to inflammation could exacerbate age-related impairments of SLM and changes in histone modifications in CD-1 mice from 12 months onward, and SLM impairment might be linked to decreased H3S10p and increased H3K9me3.</description>

Chemicals interact with genes in the process of disease development and treatment. Although much biomedical research has been performed to understand relationships among genes, chemicals, and diseases, which have been reported in biomedical articles in Medline, there are few studies that extract disease–gene–chemical relationships from biomedical literature at a PubMed scale. In this study, we propose a deep learning model based on bidirectional long short-term memory to identify the evidence sentences of relationships among genes, chemicals, and diseases from Medline abstracts. Then, we develop the search engine DigChem to enable disease–gene–chemical relationship searches for 35,124 genes, 56,382 chemicals, and 5,675 diseases. We show that the identified relationships are reliable by comparing them with manual curation and existing databases. DigChem is available at http://gcancer.org/digchem.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GXIOdOI_fsc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Beyond core object recognition: Recurrent processes account for object recognition under occlusion</title>

Core object recognition, the ability to rapidly recognize objects despite variations in their appearance, is largely solved through the feedforward processing of visual information. Deep neural networks are shown to achieve human-level performance in these tasks, and explain the primate brain representation. On the other hand, object recognition under more challenging conditions (i.e. beyond the core recognition problem) is less characterized. One such example is object recognition under occlusion. It is unclear to what extent feedforward and recurrent processes contribute in object recognition under occlusion. Furthermore, we do not know whether the conventional deep neural networks, such as AlexNet, which were shown to be successful in solving core object recognition, can perform similarly well in problems that go beyond the core recognition. Here, we characterize neural dynamics of object recognition under occlusion, using magnetoencephalography (MEG), while participants were presented with images of objects with various levels of occlusion. We provide evidence from multivariate analysis of MEG data, behavioral data, and computational modelling, demonstrating an essential role for recurrent processes in object recognition under occlusion. Furthermore, the computational model with local recurrent connections, used here, suggests a mechanistic explanation of how the human brain might be solving this problem.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oJA8ILumRvM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Type III taste cells in mammalian taste buds are implicated in the detection and communication of sour and some salty stimuli, as well as carbonation and water. With this variety of proposed roles, it is unclear what information activated type III cells are communicating to the CNS. To better elucidate the role of type III cells in the taste bud, we use a type III cell-specific protein (polycystic kidney disease 2-like 1) to drive Cre-dependent expression of light-sensitive channelrhodopsin (Ai32) in mouse type III taste cells. Activation of these cells with light produces a taste nerve response in both the chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal nerves, and elicits a slight but significant aversion in two-bottle preference tests in both male and female mice. Unlike previous reports (Zocchi et al., 2017), our mice did not react to blue light stimulation with sustained drinking responses. These data suggest that type III cells are capable of communicating the presence of aversive stimuli in the oral cavity, which is in line with their responsiveness to sour and high concentrations of salt stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Cleavage Product Improves Cognitive Function in a Mouse Model of Down Syndrome</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Currently there is no effective therapy available for cognitive impairments in Down syndrome (DS), one of the most prevalent forms of intellectual disability in humans associated with the chromosomes 21 trisomy. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that maintains glucose homeostasis by stimulating insulin secretion. Its natural cleavage product GLP-1 (9-36) lacks insulinotropic effects and has a low binding affinity for GLP-1 receptors; thus, GLP-1 (9-36) has historically been identified as an inactive metabolite. Conversely, recent work has demonstrated interesting physiological properties of GLP-1 (9-36) such as cardioprotection and neuroprotection. We have previously shown that GLP-1 (9-36) administration enhances neuronal plasticity in young WT mice and ameliorates cognitive deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we report that systemic administration of GLP-1 (9-36) in Ts65Dn DS model mice of either sex resulted in decreased mitochondrial oxidative stress in hippocampus and improved dendritic spine morphology, increase of mature spines and reduction of immature spines. Importantly, these molecular alterations translated into functional changes in that long-term potentiation failure and cognitive impairments in TsDn65 DS model mice were rescued with GLP-1 (9-36) treatment. We also show that chronic GLP-1 (9-36) treatment did not alter glucose tolerance in either WT or DS model mice. Our findings suggest that GLP-1 (9-36) treatment may have therapeutic potential for DS and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with increased neuronal oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Disruption in calcium homeostasis is linked to several pathologies and is suggested to play a pivotal role in the cascade of events leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Synaptopodin (SP) residing in dendritic spines has been associated with ryanodine receptor (RyR), such that spines lacking SP release less calcium from stores. In this work, we mated SPKO with 3xTg mice (3xTg/SPKO) to test the effect of SP deficiency in the AD mouse. We found that 6-month-old male 3xTg/SPKO mice restored normal spatial learning in the Barns maze, LTP in hippocampal slices, and expression levels of RyR in the hippocampus that were altered in the 3xTg mice. In addition, there was a marked reduction in 3xTg-associated phosphorylated tau, amyloid β plaques, and activated microglia in 3xTg/SPKO male and female mice. These experiments indicate that a reduction in the expression of SP ameliorates AD-associated phenotype in 3xTg mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study strengthens the proposed role of calcium stores in the development of AD-associated phenotype in the 3xTg mouse model, in that a genetic reduction of the functioning of ryanodine receptors using synaptopodin-knock-out mice ameliorates AD symptoms at the behavioral, electrophysiological, and morphological levels of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper predicts the ability to externally control the firing times of a
cortical neuron whose behavior follows the Izhikevich neuron model. The
Izhikevich neuron model provides an efficient and biologically plausible method
to track a cortical neuron's membrane potential and its firing times. The
external control is a simple optogenetic model represented by a constant
current source that can be turned on or off. This paper considers firing
frequencies that are sufficiently low for the membrane potential to return to
its resting potential after it fires. The time required for the neuron to
charge and for the neuron to recover to the resting potential are numerically
fitted to functions of the Izhikevich neuron model parameters and the input
current. Results show that simple functions of the model parameters and input
current can be used to predict the charging and recovery times, even when there
are deviations in the actual parameter values. Furthermore, the predictions
lead to lower bounds on the firing frequency that can be achieved without
significant distortion.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI) models inspired by the brain
have made unprecedented progress in performing real-world perceptual tasks like
object classification and speech recognition. Recently, researchers of natural
intelligence have begun using those AI models to explore how the brain performs
such tasks. These developments suggest that future progress will benefit from
increased interaction between disciplines. Here we introduce the Algonauts
Project as a structured and quantitative communication channel for
interdisciplinary interaction between natural and artificial intelligence
researchers. The project's core is an open challenge with a quantitative
benchmark whose goal is to account for brain data through computational models.
This project has the potential to provide better models of natural intelligence
and to gather findings that advance AI. The 2019 Algonauts Project focuses on
benchmarking computational models predicting human brain activity when people
look at pictures of objects. The 2019 edition of the Algonauts Project is
available online: &lt;a href=&quot;http://algonauts.csail.mit.edu/.&quot;&gt;this http URL&lt;/a&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Robotic research is often built on approaches that are motivated by insights
from self-examination of how we interface with the world. However, given
current theories about human cognition and sensory processing, it is reasonable
to assume that the internal workings of the brain are separate from how we
interface with the world and ourselves. To amend some of these misconceptions
arising from self-examination this article reviews human visual understanding
for cognition and action, specifically manipulation. Our focus is on
identifying overarching principles such as the separation into visual
processing for action and cognition, hierarchical processing of visual input,
and the contextual and anticipatory nature of visual processing for action. We
also provide a rudimentary exposition of previous theories about visual
understanding that shows how self-examination can lead down the wrong path. Our
hope is that the article will provide insights for the robotic researcher that
can help them navigate the path of self-examination, give them an overview of
current theories about human visual processing, as well as provide a source for
further relevant reading.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We describe the experimental procedures for a dataset that we have made
publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2649006 in mat and csv
formats. This dataset contains electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of 25
subjects testing the Brain Invaders (Congedo, 2011), a visual P300
Brain-Computer Interface inspired by the famous vintage video game Space
Invaders (Taito, Tokyo, Japan). The visual P300 is an event-related potential
elicited by a visual stimulation, peaking 240-600 ms after stimulus onset. EEG
data were recorded by 16 electrodes in an experiment that took place in the
GIPSA-lab, Grenoble, France, in 2012 (Van Veen, 2013 and Congedo, 2013). Python
code for manipulating the data is available at
https://github.com/plcrodrigues/py.BI.EEG.2012-GIPSA. The ID of this dataset is

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Black-boxing and cause-effect power. (arXiv:1608.03461v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reductionism assumes that causation in the physical world occurs at the micro
level, excluding the emergence of macro-level causation. We challenge this
reductionist assumption by employing a principled, well-defined measure of
intrinsic cause-effect power - integrated information ({\Phi}), and showing
that, according to this measure, it is possible for a macro level to &quot;beat&quot; the
micro level. Simple systems were evaluated for {\Phi} across different spatial
and temporal scales by systematically considering all possible black boxes.
These are macro elements that consist of one or more micro elements over one or
more micro updates. Cause-effect power was evaluated based on the inputs and
outputs of the black boxes, ignoring the internal micro elements that support
their input-output function. We show how black-box elements can have more
common inputs and outputs than the corresponding micro elements, revealing the
emergence of high-order mechanisms and joint constraints that are not apparent
at the micro level. As a consequence, a macro, black-box system can have higher
{\Phi} than its micro constituents by having more mechanisms (higher
composition) that are more interconnected (higher integration). We also show
that, for a given micro system, one can identify local maxima of {\Phi} across
several spatiotemporal scales. The framework is demonstrated on a simple
biological system, the Boolean network model of the fission-yeast cell-cycle,
for which we identify stable local maxima during the course of its simulated
biological function. These local maxima correspond to macro levels of
organization at which emergent cause-effect properties of physical systems come
into focus, and provide a natural vantage point for scientific inquiries.

	<description>Recent studies have shown that neurologic inflammation may both precipitate and sustain seizures, suggesting that inflammation may be involved not only in epileptogenesis but also in the development of the drug-resistant profile. Extensive literature data, during these last years, have identified a number of inflammatory markers involved in these processes of &quot;neuroimmunoinflammation&quot; in epilepsy, underlying a key role for other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as: IL-6, IL-17 and IL-17 Receptor (IL-17R) axis, Tumor-Necrosis-Factor Alpha (TNF-α) and Transforming-Growth-Factor Beta (TGF-β), all responsible for the induction of processes of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and inflammation of the Central Nervous System (CNS) itself. Nevertheless, many of these inflammatory biomarkers have been also implicated in other neurologic pathologies, and future perspectives have to address the disease-individuality in order to identify panels of biomarkers that discriminate epilepsies from other diseases and among different epileptic semiology. 
In this context, markers of blood-brain barrier integrity and disruption are useful tools to determine the sequelae in a variety of neurologic diseases, but how these markers may predict the prognosis and the diagnosis of epileptic disorders is being currently investigated. 
Herein authors present a review of extensive literature data on the involvement of both systemic and neuronal immune system in the early onset of epileptic encephalopathy.</description>

	<description>When faced with a novel object, we explore it to understand its shape. This way we combine information coming from different senses, as touch, proprioception and vision, together with the motor information embedded in our motor execution plan. The exploration process provides a structure and constrains this rich flow of inputs, supporting the formation of a unified percept and the memorization of the object features. However, how the exploration strategies are planned is still an open question. In particular, is the exploration strategy used to memorize an object different from the exploration strategy adopted in a recall task? To address this question we used iCube, a sensorized cube which measures its orientation in space and the location of the contacts on its faces. Participants were required to explore the cube faces where little pins were positioned in varying number. Participants had to explore the cube twice and individuate potential differences between the two presentations, which could be performed either haptically alone, or with also vision available. The haptic and visuo-haptic exploratory strategies changed significantly when finalized to memorize the structure of the object with respect to when the same object was explored to recall and compare it with its memorized instance. These findings indicate that exploratory strategies are finely tuned not only to the property of the object to be analyzed, but also to the prospective use of the resulting representation, be it memorization or recall. The results are discussed in light of the possibility of a systematic modeling of natural visuo-haptic exploration strategies.</description>

	<description>Neuroimaging research is growing rapidly, providing expansive resources for synthesizing data. However, navigating these dense resources is complicated by the volume of research articles and variety of experimental designs implemented across studies. The advent of machine learning algorithms and text-mining techniques has advanced automated labeling of published articles in biomedical research to alleviate such obstacles. As of yet, a comprehensive examination of document features and classifier techniques for annotating neuroimaging articles has yet to be undertaken. Here, we evaluated which combination of corpus (abstract-only or full-article text), features (bag-of-words or Cognitive Atlas terms), and classifier (Bernoulli Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, or support vector classifier) resulted in the highest predictive performance in annotating a selection of 2,633 manually annotated neuroimaging articles. We found that, when utilizing full article text, data-driven features derived from the text performed the best, whereas if article abstracts were used for annotation, features derived from the Cognitive Atlas performed better. Additionally, we observed that when features were derived from article text, anatomical terms appeared to be the most frequently utilized for classification purposes and that cognitive concepts can be identified based on similar representations of these anatomical terms. Optimizing parameters for the automated classification of neuroimaging articles may result in a larger proportion of the neuroimaging literature being annotated with labels supporting the meta-analysis of psychological constructs.</description>

	<description>Given the complicated pathological process, peripheral nerve injury has not yet been well resolved. SB216763 is a small molecular compound that can enhance remyelination of peripheral nerves by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β). A previous study showed that GSK-3β inhibitor stimulated myelin gene expression and restored the myelin structure. Herein, we present the effect of small gap tubulization integrated with SB216763-loaded microspheres by using chitosan conduit. In vitro, SB216763 could promote DRGs axons growth. In vivo studies showed that SB216763 increased the number of myelinated axons and thickness of myelin sheaths. The electrophysiological examination and sciatic functional index results also indirectly indicated the role of SB216763 in repairing peripheral nerve injury. Meanwhile, SB216763 promoted the recovery of muscle function. In conclusion, combining SB216763-loaded PLGA microspheres with conduit small gap tubulization has promising potential applications in repairing peripheral nerve injury.</description>

	<description>Tau-related dementias appear to involve specific to each disease aggregation pathways and morphologies of filamentous tau assemblies. Here we elucidate molecular mechanism of tau aggregation based on the PMO theory of protein secondary and tertiary structure (Cieplak, A. S. (2017). PLoS ONE 12: e0180905) and the recent structural evidence, aiming to account for the reported differences in fibril-core structure, cross-seeding of isoforms, response to non-reducing conditions, and homologs’ aggregation properties. The proposed model suggests that in contrast to Alzheimer’s disease, the assembly of tau prions in Pick’s disease would be facilitated by a moderate drop in pH that accompanies e.g. transit in the endosomal system, neuroinflammation or ischemic injury.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Astrocytes and Microglia as Potential Contributors to the Pathogenesis of C9orf72 Repeat Expansion-Associated FTLD and ALS</title>

	<description>Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are neurodegenerative diseases with a complex, but often overlapping, genetic and pathobiological background and thus they are considered to form a disease spectrum. Although neurons are the principal cells affected in FTLD and ALS, increasing amount of evidence has recently proposed that other central nervous system-resident cells, including microglia and astrocytes, may also play roles in neurodegeneration in these diseases. Therefore, deciphering the mechanisms underlying the disease pathogenesis in different types of brain cells is fundamental in order to understand the etiology of these disorders. The major genetic cause of FTLD and ALS is a hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in the intronic region of the C9orf72 gene. In neurons, specific pathological hallmarks, including decreased expression of the C9orf72 RNA and proteins and generation of toxic RNA and protein species, and their downstream effects have been linked to C9orf72 HRE-associated FTLD and ALS. In contrast, it is still poorly known to which extent these pathological changes are presented in other brain cells. Here, we summarize the current literature on the potential role of astrocytes and microglia in C9orf72 HRE-linked FTLD and ALS and discuss their possible phenotypic alterations and neurotoxic mechanisms that may contribute to neurodegeneration in these diseases.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: A Novel Role of VEGFC in Cerebral Ischemia With Lung Injury</title>

	<description>Cerebral ischemia (CI) is a severe brain injury resulting in a variety of motor impairments combined with secondary injury in remote organs, especially the lung. This condition occurs due to insufficient blood supply to the brain during infancy. However, it has a molecular linkage that needs to be thoroughly covered. Here, we report on the role of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC) in lung injury induced by CI. The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was depended to establish the animal model of CI. Rats were used and brain ischemia was confirmed through TTC staining. Serum was used for protein chip analysis to study the proteomic interaction. Immunohistochemistry analyses were used to quantify and locate the VEGFC in the lung and brain. The role of VEGFC was detected by siVEGFC technology in SY5Y, HUCEV and A549 cell lines, under normal and oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions in vitro. As a result, the TTC staining demonstrated that the model of brain ischemia was successfully established, and MPO experiments reported that lung damage was induced in MCAO rats. VEGFC levels were up-regulated in serum. On the other hand, immunohistochemistry showed that VEGFC increased significantly in the cytoplasm of neurons, the endothelium of small trachea and the lung cells of CI animals. On a functional level, siVEGFC effectively inhibited the proliferation of SY5Y cells and decreased the viability of HUVEC cells in normal cell lines. But under OGD conditions, siVEGFC decreased the growth of HUVEC and increased the viability of A549 cells, while no effect was noticed on SYSY cells. Therefore, we confirmed the different role of VEGFC played in neurons and lung cells in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. These findings may contribute to the understanding the molecular linkage of brain ischemia and lung injury, which therefore provides a new idea for the therapeutic approach to cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials on the Efficacy and Safety of Donepezil, Galantamine, Rivastigmine, and Memantine for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>To study the impact of donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and memantine on cognitive, functional, behavioral, global changes and adverse effects in patients with mild, moderate and severe Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we screened the literature published before September 2017 in the Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane library and Web of Science Electronic databases according to the inclusion criteria. Thirty-six studies were finally determined from 1560 preliminary screened articles. The AD Assessment Scale-cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog), AD Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and Clinician’s Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input scale (CIBIC+) were used as valid endpoints. Of the 36 trials included, meta-analyses of these placebo-control trials showed that there were significant differences between the donepezil, rivastigmine and placebo groups using ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL, and CIBIC+. Meta-analyses of these placebo-controlled trials showed that there were significant differences between the galantamine and placebo groups using ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL, NPI, and CIBIC+. These observations suggest that memantine is beneficial for stabilizing or slowing the decline in ADAS-cog and ADCS-ADL19 changes in AD patients. However, there was no significant effect according to the ADCS-ADL23, NPI, and CIBIC+ tests, which indicated that memantine treatment has no significant effect on these cognitive aspects of AD patients. Different effects of donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, or memantine on AD were found in this study. According to the results, we conclude that galantamine is effective in treating all aspects of AD and is the first choice for the treatment of AD. However, due to limited data, we should consider additional data to obtain more stable results.</description>

	<description>Learning a new language requires the use of extensive neural networks and can represent a potent tool to reorganize brain neuroplasticity. In this study, we analyze how 4-month long second language learning program (16, 2-h sessions) can lead to functional changes in the brain of healthy elderly individuals. A large number of studies point out a declining of brain-skills with age; here we analyze how cognition together with functional brain organization can be improved late in life. Twenty-six older adults (59 to 79 years old) were enrolled in the present study. A complete neuropsychological examination was administered pre- and post-intervention to measure global cognition level, short- and long-term memory, attention, language access, and executive functions. After the program, in the intervention group, we observed a significant improvement in global cognition together with increased functional connectivity in the right inferior frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus and left superior parietal lobule. These findings can be added to the current neurobiological breakthroughs of reshaping brain networks with a short language learning practice in healthy elderly subjects. We, therefore, suggest that learning a foreign-language may represent a potentially helpful cognitive intervention for promoting healthy aging.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Reconstruction and Simulation of a Scaffold Model of the Cerebellar Network</title>

	<description>Reconstructing neuronal microcircuits through computational models is fundamental to simulate local neuronal dynamics. Here a scaffold model of the cerebellum has been developed in order to flexibly place neurons in space, connect them synaptically and endow neurons and synapses with biologically-grounded mechanisms. The scaffold model can keep neuronal morphology separated from network connectivity, which can in turn be obtained from convergence/divergence ratios and axonal/dendritic field 3D geometries. We first tested the scaffold on the cerebellar microcircuit, which presents a challenging 3D organization, at the same time providing appropriate datasets to validate emerging network behaviors. The scaffold was designed to integrate the cerebellar cortex with deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), including different neuronal types: Golgi cells, granule cells, Purkinje cells, stellate cells, basket cells and DCN principal cells. Mossy fiber inputs were conveyed through the glomeruli. An anisotropic volume (0.077 mm3) of mouse cerebellum was reconstructed, in which point-neuron models were tuned toward the specific discharge properties of neurons and were connected by exponentially decaying excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Simulations using both pyNEST and pyNEURON showed the emergence of organized spatio-temporal patterns of neuronal activity similar to those revealed experimentally in response to background noise and burst stimulation of mossy fiber bundles. Different configurations of granular and molecular layer connectivity consistently modified neuronal activation patterns, revealing the importance of structural constraints for cerebellar network functioning. The scaffold provided thus an effective workflow accounting for the complex architecture of the cerebellar network. In principle, the scaffold can incorporate cellular mechanisms at multiple levels of detail and be tuned to test different structural and functional hypotheses. A future implementation using detailed 3D multi-compartment neuron models and dynamic synapses will be needed to investigate the impact of single neuron properties on network computation.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Current Change Rate Influences Sensorimotor Cortical Excitability During Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation</title>

	<description>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is frequently used in rehabilitation therapy to improve motor recovery. To optimize the stimulatory effect of NMES, the parameters of NMES, including stimulation mode, location, current intensity, and duration, among others have been investigated; however, these studies mainly focused on the effects of changing parameters on the current plateau stage of the NMES cycle, while the impacts on other stages, such as the current rising stage, have yet to be investigated. In this paper, we studied the electroencephalograph (EEG) effects during NMES, with different rates of current change in the rising stage, and stable current intensity in the plateau stage. EEG signals (64-channel) were collected from 28 healthy subjects, who were administered with high, medium, or low current change rate (CCR) NMES through a right-hand wrist extensor. Time-frequency analysis and brain source analysis, using the LORETA method, were used to investigate neural activity in sensorimotor cortical areas. The strengths of cortical activity induced by different CCR conditions were compared. NMES with a high CCR activated the sensorimotor cortex, despite the NMES current intensity in the plateau stage lower than the motor threshold. Reduction of the Alpha 2 band (10–13 Hz) event related spectral power (ERSP) during NMES stimulation was significantly enhanced by increasing CCR (p &amp;lt; 0.05). LORETA-based source analysis demonstrated that, in addition to typical sensory areas, such as primary somatosensory cortex (S1), sensorimotor areas including primary motor cortex (M1), premotor cortex (PMC), and somatosensory association cortex (SAC) were all activated by within threshold NMES. Furthermore, compared with the low CCR condition, cortical activity was significantly enhanced in the S1, M1, and PMC areas under high CCR conditions. This study shows CCR in the NMES rising stage can affect EEG responses in the sensorimotor cortex, and suggests that CCR is an important parameter applicable to the optimization of NMES treatment.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: People of Lower Social Status Are More Sensitive to Hedonic Product Information—Electrophysiological Evidence From an ERP Study</title>

	<description>Consumer psychology research have found that individuals of different social status have different purchase intentions for different products. Individuals of high social status will simultaneously measure the status symbolic meaning and utilitarian value of the product, but they won’t show strong preferences for certain attributes; however, individuals of low social status show a strong purchasing tendency for hedonic products which contain status symbolic meanings and which satisfy their spiritual needs. This phenomenon may be due to their self-threat, which is caused by hedonic products. Based on the above, this study is the first to explore the cognitive process difference of hedonic and utilitarian label products in high- and low-social-status groups by recording event related potentials (ERPs). The result showed that under the P2, P3 and LPP components, low-social-status group elicited more negative deﬂections in hedonic label stimuli than in utilitarian label stimuli, while high-social-status group did not have significant difference in these components. These suggested that humans with low social status are more sensitive to hedonic products information, because high-status information contained in the hedonic label brings a sense of threat to them and generates their certain negative emotions, which make them preferentially process such information in the information processing.</description>

	<description>The brain as a neuronal system has very complex structure with large diversity of neuronal types. The most basic complexity is seen from the structure of neuronal morphology, which usually has a complex tree-like structure with dendritic spines distributed in branches. For simulating a large-scale network with spiking neurons, the simple point neuron, such as integrate-and-fire neuron, is often used. However, recent experimental evidence suggests that the computational ability of a single neuron is largely enhanced
by its morphological structure, in particular, by various types of dendritic dynamics. As morphology reduction of detailed biophysical models is one of classic questions for systems neuroscience, much effort has been taken to simulate a neuron with a few compartments to include the interaction between soma and dendritic spines. 
Yet, novel reduction methods are still needed to deal with complex dendritic tree.
Here by using ten individual Purkinje cells of the cerebellum from three species of guinea-pig, mouse and rat, we consider four types of reduction methods and study their effects on the coding capacity of Purkinje cells in terms of firing rate, timing coding, spiking pattern, and modulated firing under different stimulation protocols. We find that there is a variation of reduction performance depending on individual cells and species, however, all reduction methods can preserve, to some degree, firing activity of the full model of Purkinje cell. Therefore, when stimulating large-scale network of neurons, one has to choose a proper type of reduced neuronal model depending on the questions addressed.
Among these reduction schemes, Branch method, that preserves the geometrical volume of neurons, can achieve the best balance among different performance measures of accuracy, simplification, and computational efficiency, and reproduce various phenomena shown in the full morphology model of Purkinje cells. Taken together, these results suggest that Branch reduction scheme seems to provide a general guideline for reducing complex morphology into a few compartments without loss of basic characteristics of firing property of neurons.</description>

	<description>The human cerebral cortex is highly convoluted as convex gyri and concave sulci. In the past decades, extensive studies have consistently revealed substantial differences between gyri and sulci in terms of genetics, anatomy, morphology, axonal fiber connections, and function. Although interesting findings have been reported to date to elucidate the functional difference between gyri and sulci, the temporal variability of functional activity, which could explain individual differences in learning and higher-order cognitive functions, and as well as differences in gyri and sulci, remains to be explored. The present study explored the temporal variability of cortical gyral-sulcal resting state functional activity and its association with fluid intelligence measures on the Human Connectome Project dataset. We found that the temporal variance of resting state fMRI BOLD signal was significantly larger in gyri than in sulci. We also found that the temporal variability of certain regions including middle frontal cortex, inferior parietal lobe and visual cortex was positively associated with fluid intelligence. Moreover, those regions were predominately located in gyri rather than in sulci. This study reports initial evidence for temporal variability difference of functional activity between gyri and sulci, and its association with fluid intelligence measures, and thus provides novel insights to understand the mechanism and functional relevance of gyri and sulci.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Necrostatin-1 Ameliorates Peripheral Nerve Injury-Induced Neuropathic Pain by Inhibiting the RIP1/RIP3 Pathway</title>

	<description>Necrostatin-1 is an inhibitor of necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death that has been reported to be involved in various neurological diseases. Presently, the role of necroptosis in neuropathic pain induced by peripheral nerve injury is still unclear. This study was focused on investigating the potential effects of necroptosis in the development and progression of neuropathic pain in a rat model and the possible neuroprotective effects of necrostatin-1 in neuropathic pain. The results indicated that the necroptosis-related proteins RIP1 and RIP3 significantly increased postoperation in the spinal cord in a neuropathic pain model and peaked 7 days postoperation, which was consistent with the time-dependent changes of hyperalgesia. Additionally, we found that peripheral nerve injury-related behavioral and biochemical changes were significantly reduced by necrostatin-1. In particular, hyperalgesia was attenuated, and the levels of RIP1 and RIP3 were decreased. Furthermore, the ultrastructure of necrotic cell death and neuroinflammation were alleviated by necrostatin-1. Collectively, these results suggest that necroptosis is an important mechanism of cell death in neuropathic pain induced by peripheral nerve injury and that necrostatin-1 may be a promising neuroprotective treatment for neuropathic pain.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Thinking About the Nerve Impulse: The Prospects for the Development of a Comprehensive Account of Nerve Impulse Propagation</title>

	<description>Currently, a scientific debate is ongoing about modelling nerve impulse propagation. One of the models discussed is the celebrated Hodgkin-Huxley model of the action potential, which is central to the electricity-centered conception of the nerve impulse that dominates contemporary neuroscience. However, this model cannot represent the nerve impulse completely, since it does not take into account non-electrical manifestations of the nerve impulse for which there is ample experimental evidence. As a result, alternative models of nerve impulse propagation have been proposed in contemporary (neuro)scientific literature. One of these models is the Heimburg-Jackson model, according to which the nerve impulse is an electromechanical density pulse in the neural membrane. This model is usually contrasted with the Hodgkin-Huxley model and is supposed to potentially be able to replace the latter. However, instead of contrasting these models of nerve impulse propagation, another approach integrates these models in a general unifying model. This general unifying model, the Engelbrecht model, is developed to unify all relevant manifestations of the nerve impulse and their interaction(s). Here, we want to contribute to the debate about modelling nerve impulse propagation by conceptually analyzing the Engelbrecht model. Combining the results of this conceptual analysis with insights from philosophy of science, we make recommendations for (future) approaches to studying nerve impulse propagation. The first conclusion of this analysis is that attempts to develop models that represent the nerve impulse accurately and completely appear unfeasible. Instead, models are and should be used as tools to study nerve impulse propagation for varying purposes, representing the nerve impulse accurately and completely enough to achieve the specified goals. The second conclusion is that integrating distinct models into a general unifying model that provides a consistent picture of nerve impulse propagation is impossible due to the distinct purposes for which they are developed and the conflicting assumptions these purposes often require. Instead of explaining nerve impulse propagation with a single general unifying model, it appears advisable to explain this complex phenomenon using a ‘mosaic’ framework of models in which each model contributes to an overall explanation by providing a partial explanation of nerve impulse propagation.</description>

	<description>Purinergic signalling regulates important physiological processes and the homeostatic response to stress in the cochlea via extracellular nucleosides (adenosine) and nucleotides (ATP, UTP). Using a previously established organotypic culture model, the current study investigated the effect of purinergic P1 (adenosine) and P2 (ATP) receptor activation on the survival of the sensory hair cell population in the cochlea exposed to the ototoxic aminoglycoside neomycin. Organ of Corti explants were obtained from C57BL/6 mice at postnatal day 3 (P3) and maintained in normal culture medium (with or without purine receptor agonists or analogues) for 19.5 hours prior to neomycin exposure (1 mM, 3 hours) followed by a further incubation for 19.5 hours in culture medium. The cochlear explants were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and sensory hair cells labelled with Alexa 488-phalloidin. Neomycin induced a substantial loss of the sensory hair cells, mostly in the middle segment of the cochlea. This neomycin-induced ototoxicity was unaffected by the addition of P2 receptor agonists (ATP and UTP) in the culture medium, whilst the addition of their slowly-hydrolysable analogues (ATPγS, UTPγS) aggravated neomycin-induced sensory hair cell loss. In contrast, the activation of P1 receptors by adenosine or adenosine amine congener (ADAC) conferred partial protection from neomycin ototoxicity. This study demonstrates a pro-survival effect of P1 receptor stimulation, whilst prolonged P2 receptors activation has an opposite effect. Based on these findings, we postulate that P1 and P2 receptors orchestrate differential responses to cochlear injury and that the balance of these receptors is important for maintaining cochlear homeostasis following ototoxic injury.

	<description>Social behavior, a highly adaptive and crucial component of mammalian life, is regulated by particularly sensitive regulatory brain mechanisms. Substantial evidence implicates classical epigenetic mechanisms including histone modifications, DNA methylation, and nucleosome remodeling as well as nonclassical mechanisms mediated by noncoding RNA in the regulation of social behavior. These mechanisms collectively form the ‘epigenetic network’ that orchestrates genomic integration of salient and transient social experiences.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Spatial neuronal synchronization and the waveform of oscillations: Implications for EEG and MEG</title>

Neuronal oscillations are ubiquitous in the human brain and are implicated in virtually all brain functions. Although they can be described by a prominent peak in the power spectrum, their waveform is not necessarily sinusoidal and shows rather complex morphology. Both frequency and temporal descriptions of such non-sinusoidal neuronal oscillations can be utilized. However, in non-invasive EEG/MEG recordings the waveform of oscillations often takes a sinusoidal shape which in turn leads to a rather oversimplified view on oscillatory processes. In this study, we show in simulations how spatial synchronization can mask non-sinusoidal features of the underlying rhythmic neuronal processes. Consequently, the degree of non-sinusoidality can serve as a measure of spatial synchronization. To confirm this empirically, we show that a mixture of EEG components is indeed associated with more sinusoidal oscillations compared to the waveform of oscillations in each constituent component. Using simulations, we also show that the spatial mixing of the non-sinusoidal neuronal signals strongly affects the amplitude ratio of the spectral harmonics constituting the waveform. Finally, our simulations show how spatial mixing can affect the strength and even the direction of the amplitude coupling between constituent neuronal harmonics at different frequencies. Validating these simulations, we also demonstrate these effects in real EEG recordings. Our findings have far reaching implications for the neurophysiological interpretation of spectral profiles, cross-frequency interactions, as well as for the unequivocal determination of oscillatory phase.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N0Etve-bRHE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Human representation of multimodal distributions as clusters of samples</title>

Behavioral and neuroimaging evidence shows that human decisions are sensitive to the statistical regularities (mean, variance, skewness, etc.) of reward distributions. However, it is unclear what representations human observers form to approximate reward distributions, or probability distributions in general. When the possible values of a probability distribution are numerous, it is cognitively costly and perhaps unrealistic to maintain in mind the probability of each possible value. Here we propose a Clusters of Samples (CoS) representation model: The samples of the to-be-represented distribution are classified into a small number of clusters and only the centroids and relative weights of the clusters are retained for future use. We tested the behavioral relevance of CoS in four experiments. On each trial, human subjects reported the mean and mode of a sequentially presented multimodal distribution of spatial positions or orientations. By varying the global and local features of the distributions, we observed systematic errors in the reported mean and mode. We found that our CoS representation of probability distributions outperformed alternative models in accounting for subjects’ response patterns. The ostensible influence of positive/negative skewness on the over/under estimation of the reported mean, analogous to the “skewness preference” phenomenon in decisions, could be well explained by models based on CoS.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Cjl-cbibIkY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Meta‐analyses identify differentially expressed micrornas in Parkinson's disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25490?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MicroRNA (miRNA)‐mediated (dys)regulation of gene expression has been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD), although results of miRNA expression studies remain inconclusive. We aimed to identify miRNAs that show consistent differential expression across all published expression studies in PD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a systematic literature search on miRNA expression studies in PD and extracted data from eligible publications. After stratification for brain, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)‐derived specimen, we performed meta‐analyses across miRNAs assessed in three or more independent data sets. Meta‐analyses were performed using effect‐size– and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;‐value–based methods, as applicable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After screening 599 publications, we identified 47 data sets eligible for meta‐analysis. On these, we performed 160 meta‐analyses on miRNAs quantified in brain (n = 125), blood (n = 31), or CSF (n = 4). Twenty‐one meta‐analyses were performed using effect sizes. We identified 13 significantly (Bonferroni‐adjusted α = 3.13 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–4&lt;/sup&gt;) differentially expressed miRNAs in brain (n = 3) and blood (n = 10) with consistent effect directions across studies. The most compelling findings were with hsa‐miR‐132‐3p (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 6.37 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–5&lt;/sup&gt;), hsa‐miR‐497‐5p (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 1.35 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–4&lt;/sup&gt;), and hsa‐miR‐133b (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 1.90 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–4&lt;/sup&gt;) in brain and with hsa‐miR‐221‐3p (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 4.49 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–35&lt;/sup&gt;), hsa‐miR‐214‐3p (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 2.00 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–34&lt;/sup&gt;), and hsa‐miR‐29c‐3p (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 3.00 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–12&lt;/sup&gt;) in blood. No significant signals were found in CSF. Analyses of genome‐wide association study data for target genes of brain miRNAs showed significant association (α = 9.40 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–5&lt;/sup&gt;) of genetic variants in nine loci.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified several miRNAs that showed highly significant differential expression in PD. Future studies may assess the possible role of the identified brain miRNAs in pathogenesis and disease progression as well as the potential of the top blood miRNAs as biomarkers for diagnosis, progression, or prediction of PD. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:835–851.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists after recent ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25489?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25489?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We compared outcomes after treatment with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and a recent cerebral ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted an individual patient data analysis of seven prospective cohort studies. We included patients with AF and a recent cerebral ischemia (&amp;lt;3 months before starting oral anticoagulation) and a minimum follow‐up of 3 months. We analyzed the association between type of anticoagulation (DOAC versus VKA) with the composite primary endpoint (recurrent ischemic stroke [AIS], intracerebral hemorrhage [ICH], or mortality) using mixed‐effects Cox proportional hazards regression models; we calculated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 4,912 patients (median age, 78 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 71–84]; 2,331 [47.5%] women; median National Institute of Health Stroke Severity Scale at onset, 5 [IQR, 2–12]); 2,256 (45.9%) patients received VKAs and 2,656 (54.1%) DOACs. Median time from index event to starting oral anticoagulation was 5 days (IQR, 2–14) for VKAs and 5 days (IQR, 2–11) for DOACs (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.53). There were 262 acute ischemic strokes (AISs; 4.4%/year), 71 intracranial hemorrrhages (ICHs; 1.2%/year), and 439 deaths (7.4%/year) during the total follow‐up of 5,970 patient‐years. Compared to VKAs, DOAC treatment was associated with reduced risks of the composite endpoint (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67–1.00; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.05) and ICH (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24–0.71; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01); we found no differences for the risk of recurrent AIS (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.70–1.19; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.5) and mortality (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.68–1.03; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.09).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOAC treatment commenced early after recent cerebral ischemia related to AF was associated with reduced risk of poor clinical outcomes compared to VKA, mainly attributed to lower risks of ICH. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:823–834.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: A hexanucleotide repeat modifies expressivity of X‐linked dystonia parkinsonism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25488?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25488?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X‐linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder caused by a single mutation: SINE‐VNTR‐Alu (SVA) retrotransposon insertion in &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt;. Recently, a (CCCTCT)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; repeat within the SVA insertion has been reported as an age‐at‐onset (AAO) modifier in XDP. Here we investigate the role of this hexanucleotide repeat in modifying expressivity of XDP.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We genotyped the hexanucleotide repeat in 355 XDP patients and correlated the repeat number (RN) with AAO (n = 295), initial clinical manifestation (n = 294), site of dystonia onset (n = 238), disease severity (n = 28), and cognitive function (n = 15). Furthermore, we investigated i) repeat instability by segregation analysis and Southern blotting using postmortem brain samples from two affected individuals and ii) relative &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt; expression in blood RNA from 31 XDP patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RN showed significant inverse correlations with AAO and with &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt; expression and a positive correlation with disease severity and cognitive dysfunction. Importantly, AAO (and not RN) was directly associated with whether dystonia or parkinsonism will manifest at onset. RN was lower in patients affected by mouth/tongue dystonia compared with blepharospasm. RN was unstable across germline transmissions with an overall tendency to increase in length and exhibited somatic mosaicism in brain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hexanucleotide repeat within the SVA insertion acts as a genetic modifier of disease expressivity in XDP. RN‐dependent &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt; repression and subsequent differences in &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA levels in patients may be potentiated in the brain through somatic variability leading to the neurological phenotype. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:812–822.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: TMEM106B Effect on cognition in Parkinson disease and frontotemporal dementia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25486?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25486?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common variants near &lt;i&gt;TMEM106B&lt;/i&gt; associate with risk of developing frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Emerging evidence suggests a role for &lt;i&gt;TMEM106B&lt;/i&gt; in neurodegenerative processes beyond FTD. We evaluate the effect of &lt;i&gt;TMEM106B&lt;/i&gt; genotype on cognitive decline across multiple neurogenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We longitudinally followed 870 subjects with diagnoses of Parkinson disease (PD; n = 179), FTD (n = 179), Alzheimer disease (AD; n = 300), memory‐predominant mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 75), or neurologically normal control subjects (NC; n = 137) at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). All participants had annual Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE; median follow‐up duration = 3.0 years) and were genotyped at &lt;i&gt;TMEM106B&lt;/i&gt; index single nucleotide polymorphism rs1990622. Genotype effects on cognition were confirmed by extending analyses to additional cognitive instruments (Mattis Dementia Rating Scale‐2 [DRS‐2] and Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]) and to an international validation cohort (Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative [PPMI], N = 371).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;TMEM106B&lt;/i&gt; rs1990622&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; allele, linked to increased risk of FTD, associated with greater MMSE decline over time in PD subjects but not in AD or MCI subjects. For FTD subjects, rs1990622&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; associated with more rapid decrease in MMSE only under the minor‐allele, rs1990622&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;, dominant model. Among PD patients, rs1990622&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; carriers from the UPenn cohort demonstrated more rapid longitudinal decline in DRS‐2 scores. Finally, in the PPMI cohort, &lt;i&gt;TMEM106B&lt;/i&gt; risk allele carriers demonstrated more rapid longitudinal decline in MoCA scores.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of cognitive instrument or cohort assessed, &lt;i&gt;TMEM106B&lt;/i&gt; acts as a genetic modifier for cognitive trajectory in PD. Our results implicate lysosomal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of cognitive decline in 2 different proteinopathies. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:801–811.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Flow diverters are new generation stents that have recently garnered a large amount of interest for use in treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Flow diverters reduce blood flow into the aneurysm, with redirection along the path of the parent vessel. Flow stagnation into the aneurysm and neck coverage with subsequent endothelialization are the important synergistic mechanisms by which the therapy acts. Several studies have examined the mechanisms by which flow diverters subsequently lead to aneurysm occlusion. This review aims to provide a general overview of the flow diverters and their mechanism of action and potential implications. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:793–800.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Recurrent de novo MAPK8IP3 variants cause neurological phenotypes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;c‐Jun‐amino‐terminal kinase‐interacting protein 3 (JIP3), encoded by &lt;i&gt;MAPK8IP3&lt;/i&gt;, is an adaptor protein of the kinesin‐1 complex and essential for axonal transport in neurons. However, an association between &lt;i&gt;MAPK8IP3&lt;/i&gt; variants and human disease has not been established. We identified 5 individuals from four families with recurrent de novo variants c.1732C&amp;gt;T (p.Arg578Cys) and c.3436C&amp;gt;T (p.Arg1146Cys) in &lt;i&gt;MAPK8IP3&lt;/i&gt;. The core phenotype includes spastic diplegia, intellectual disability, cerebral atrophy, and corpus callosum hypoplasia. Zebrafish embryos overexpressing human mutant JIP3 showed axon varicosities of the posterior lateral line nerve, suggesting an adverse effect on the developing axons.

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease is most commonly caused by duplication of a chromosomal segment surrounding &lt;i&gt;Peripheral Myelin Protein 22&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;PMP22&lt;/i&gt; gene, which is classified as CMT1A. Several candidate therapies reduce &lt;i&gt;Pmp22&lt;/i&gt; mRNA levels in CMT1A rodent models, but development of biomarkers for clinical trials in CMT1A is a challenge given its slow progression and difficulty in obtaining nerve samples. Quantitative PCR measurements of &lt;i&gt;PMP22&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in dermal nerves were performed using skin biopsies in human clinical trials for CMT1A, but this approach did not show increased &lt;i&gt;PMP22&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in CMT1A patients compared to controls. One complicating factor is the variable amounts of Schwann cells (SCs) in skin. The objective of the study was to develop a novel method for precise evaluation of &lt;i&gt;PMP22&lt;/i&gt; levels in skin biopsies that can discriminate CMT1A patients from controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have developed methods to normalize &lt;i&gt;PMP22&lt;/i&gt; transcript levels to SC‐specific genes that are not altered by CMT1A status. Several CMT1A‐associated genes were assembled into a custom Nanostring panel to enable precise transcript measurements that can be normalized to variable SC content.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digital expression data from Nanostring analysis showed reproducible elevation of PMP22 levels in CMT1A versus control skin biopsies, particularly after normalization to SC‐specific genes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This platform should be useful in clinical trials for CMT1A as a biomarker of target engagement that can be used to optimize dosing, and the same normalization framework is applicable to other types of CMT. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:887–898.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Penumbra detection in acute stroke with perfusion magnetic resonance imaging: Validation with 15O‐positron emission tomography</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurate identification of the ischemic penumbra, the therapeutic target in acute clinical stroke, is of critical importance to identify patients who might benefit from reperfusion therapies beyond the established time windows. Therefore, we aimed to validate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) mismatch–based penumbra detection against full quantitative positron emission tomography (&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;O‐PET), the gold standard for penumbra detection in acute ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten patients (group A) with acute and subacute ischemic stroke underwent perfusion‐weighted (PW)/diffusion‐weighted MRI and consecutive full quantitative &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;O‐PET within 48 hours of stroke onset. Penumbra as defined by &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;O‐PET cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction fraction, and oxygen metabolism was used to validate a wide range of established PW measures (eg, time‐to‐maximum [Tmax]) to optimize penumbral tissue detection. Validation was carried out using a voxel‐based receiver‐operating‐characteristic curve analysis. The same validation based on penumbra as defined by quantitative &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;O‐PET CBF was performed for comparative reasons in 23 patients measured within 48 hours of stroke onset (group B).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PW map Tmax (area‐under‐the‐curve = 0.88) performed best in detecting penumbral tissue up to 48 hours after stroke onset. The optimal threshold to discriminate penumbra from oligemia was Tmax &amp;gt;5.6 seconds with a sensitivity and specificity of &amp;gt;80%.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance of the best PW measure Tmax to detect the upper penumbral flow threshold in ischemic stroke is excellent. Tmax &amp;gt;5.6 seconds–based penumbra detection is reliable to guide treatment decisions up to 48 hours after stroke onset and might help to expand reperfusion treatment beyond the current time windows. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:875–886.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Signature Patterns for Top-Down and Bottom-Up Information Processing via Cross-Frequency Coupling in Macaque Auditory Cortex</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Predictive coding is a theoretical framework that provides a functional interpretation of top-down and bottom-up interactions in sensory processing. The theory suggests there are differences in message passing up versus down the cortical hierarchy. These differences result from the linear feedforward of prediction errors, and the nonlinear feedback of predictions. This implies that cross-frequency interactions should predominate top-down. But it remains unknown whether these differences are expressed in cross-frequency interactions in the brain. Here we examined bidirectional cross-frequency coupling across four sectors of the auditory hierarchy in the macaque. We computed two measures of cross-frequency coupling, phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) and amplitude–amplitude coupling (AAC). Our findings revealed distinct patterns for bottom-up and top-down information processing among cross-frequency interactions. Both top-down and bottom-up interactions made prominent use of low frequencies: low-to-low-frequency (theta, alpha, beta) and low-frequency-to-high- gamma couplings were predominant top-down, while low-frequency-to-low-gamma couplings were predominant bottom-up. These patterns were largely preserved across coupling types (PAC and AAC) and across stimulus types (natural and synthetic auditory stimuli), suggesting that they are a general feature of information processing in auditory cortex. Our findings suggest the modulatory effect of low frequencies on gamma-rhythms in distant regions is important for bidirectional information transfer. The finding of low-frequency-to-low-gamma interactions in the bottom-up direction suggest that nonlinearities may also play a role in feedforward message passing. Altogether, the patterns of cross-frequency interaction we observed across the auditory hierarchy are largely consistent with the predictive coding framework.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Inhibiting Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 Type I Receptor Signaling Promotes Remyelination by Potentiating Oligodendrocyte Differentiation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Blocking inhibitory factors within CNS demyelinating lesions is regarded as a promising strategy to promote remyelination. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) is an inhibitory factor present in demyelinating lesions. Noggin, an endogenous antagonist to BMP, has previously been shown to increase the number of oligodendrocytes and promote remyelination &lt;i&gt;in vivo.&lt;/i&gt; However, it remains unclear how BMP4 signaling inhibits remyelination. Here we investigated the downstream signaling pathway that mediates the inhibitory effect that BMP4 exerts upon remyelination through pharmacological and transgenic approaches. Using the cuprizone mouse model of central demyelination, we demonstrate that selectively blocking BMP4 signaling via the pharmacological inhibitor LDN-193189 significantly promotes oligodendroglial differentiation and the extent of remyelination &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. This was accompanied by the downregulation of transcriptional targets that suppress oligodendrocyte differentiation. Further, selective deletion of BMP receptor type IA (BMPRIA) within primary mouse oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) significantly enhanced their differentiation and subsequent myelination &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Together, the results of this study identify that BMP4 signals via BMPRIA within OPCs to inhibit oligodendroglial differentiation and their capacity to myelinate axons, and suggest that blocking the BMP4/BMPRIA pathway in OPCs is a promising strategy to promote CNS remyelination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is constantly processing and integrating information in order
to make decisions and interact with the world, for tasks from recognizing a
familiar face to playing a game of tennis. These complex cognitive processes
require communication between large populations of neurons. The non-invasive
neuroimaging methods of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography
(MEG) provide population measures of neural activity with millisecond precision
that allow us to study the temporal dynamics of cognitive processes. However,
multi-sensor M/EEG data is inherently high dimensional, making it difficult to
parse important signal from noise. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) or
&quot;decoding&quot; methods offer vast potential for understanding high-dimensional
M/EEG neural data. MVPA can be used to distinguish between different conditions
and map the time courses of various neural processes, from basic sensory
processing to high-level cognitive processes. In this chapter, we discuss the
practical aspects of performing decoding analyses on M/EEG data as well as the
limitations of the method, and then we discuss some applications for
understanding representational dynamics in the human brain.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An artificial neural network (ANN) based on fundamental principles of physics
can simulate the operation of neurobiological reality of membrane potential as
well as the properly defined order parameter. This ANN operates in conditions
of criticality and simulates the behavior of an excitatory biological neuron,
especially the relaxation phase where the critical fluctuations of biological
neuron appear. These critical fluctuations can not be explained by the
Hodgkin-Huxley (H-H) model. A proposal for the origin of these fluctuations is
being discussed.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical systems such as the visual cortex exhibit behaviors that change
according to behavioral and stimulus context. It is still unknown what
mechanisms underlie this adaptive processing in cortical circuitry. In this
paper, we present a model of randomly coupled supercritical Andronov-Hopf
oscillators, which as a whole system can act as an adaptive processor by
exhibiting drastically different dynamics depending on the value of a single
network parameter. Despite being only composed of supercritical subunits, the
full system can exhibit either supercritical or subcritical Andronov-Hopf
bifurcations. This model might provide a novel mechanism for switching between
globally asymptotically stable and nonhyperbolic neural network types in
pattern recognition theory.

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Major Contribution of Somatostatin-Expressing Interneurons and Cannabinoid Receptors to Increased GABA Synaptic Activity in the Striatum of Huntington’s Disease Mice</title>

	<description>Huntington’s Disease (HD) is a heritable neurological disorder that affects cognitive and motor performance in patients carrying the mutated huntingtin (HTT) gene. In mouse models of HD, previous reports showed a significant increase in spontaneous GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic activity in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs). In this study, using optogenetics and slice electrophysiology, we examined the contribution of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic parvalbumin (PV)- and somatostatin (SOM)-expressing interneurons to the increase in GABA neurotransmission using the Q175 (heterozygote) mouse model of HD. Patch clamp recordings in voltage-clamp mode, were performed on SPNs from brain slices of presymptomatic (2 month) and symptomatic (8 and 12 month) Q175 mice and wildtype (WT) littermates. While inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) evoked in SPNs following optical activation of PV- and SOM-expressing interneurons differed in amplitude, no genotype-dependent differences were observed at all ages from both interneuron types; however, responses evoked by either type were found to have faster kinetics in symptomatic mice. Since SOM-expressing interneurons are constitutively active in striatal brain slices, we then examined the effects of acutely silencing these neurons in symptomatic mice with halorhodopsin (eNpHR). Optically silencing SOM-expressing interneurons resulted in a greater decrease in the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) in a subset of SPNs from Q175 mice compared to WTs, suggesting that SOM-expressing interneurons are the main contributors to the overall increased GABA synaptic activity in HD SPNs. Additionally, the effects of activating GABAB and cannabinoid (CB1) receptors were investigated to determine whether these receptors were involved in modulating interneuron-specific GABA synaptic transmission and if this modulation differed in HD mice. When selectively activating PV- and SOM-expressing interneurons in the presence of the CB1 receptor agonist WIN-55,212, the magnitudes of the evoked IPSCs in SPNs decreased for both interneuron types although this change was less prominent in symptomatic Q175 SPNs during SOM-expressing interneuron activation. Overall, these findings show that dysfunction of SOM-expressing interneurons contributes to the increased GABA synaptic activity found in HD mouse models and that dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system may contribute to this effect.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: NGL-1/LRRC4C Deletion Moderately Suppresses Hippocampal Excitatory Synapse Development and Function in an Input-Independent Manner</title>

	<description>Netrin-G ligand-1 (NGL-1), also known as LRRC4C, is a PSD-95–interacting postsynaptic adhesion molecule that interacts trans-synaptically with presynaptic netrin-G1. NGL-1 and its family member protein NGL-2 are thought to promote excitatory synapse development through largely non-overlapping neuronal pathways. While NGL-2 has been shown to be critical for excitatory synapse development in specific dendritic segments of neurons in an input-specific manner, whether NGL-1 has similar functions is unclear. Here, we show that NGL-1 deletion in male mice moderately suppresses excitatory synapse development and function, but surprisingly, does so in an input-independent manner. While NGL-1 is mainly detected in the stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM) layer of the hippocampus relative to the stratum radiatum (SR) layer, NGL-1 deletion leads to decreases in dendritic spine density in both SLM and SR layers in the ventral hippocampus. In addition, both SLM and SR excitatory synapses display suppressed short-term synaptic plasticity in the ventral hippocampus. These morphological and functional changes are either absent or modest in the dorsal hippocampus. The input-independent synaptic changes induced by NGL-1 deletion involve abnormal translocation of NGL-2 from the SR to SLM layer. These results suggest that NGL-1 deletion moderately suppresses hippocampal excitatory synapse development and function in an input-independent manner.</description>

	<description>Neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), have shown promise as neuroprotective agents, indicating their potential in therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disease. However, the inherent bioactivity and pharmaceutical limitations of BDNF compromise its clinical efficacy. Research has documented the beneficial effects of electroacupuncture (EA) against neurodegeneration, possibly by BDNF-mediated mechanisms. The present study was designed to clarify whether EA can mount a neuroprotective effect in mice lesioned with MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) via stimulation of the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway. We found that EA not only ameliorated the motor dysfunction but also restored the dopaminergic neuronal function and upregulated BDNF expression in MPTP-lesioned mice. Interestingly, the TrkB inhibitor K252a abolished the neuroprotective effects of EA. Western blot analyses further demonstrated that EA might recover the level of phospho-Akt, phospho-ERK1/2, and BDNF against MPTP neurotoxicity via reversing the imbalance between TrkB FL and TrkB T1. Taken together, the results of the present study show that EA stimulation can ameliorate MPTP-induced parkinsonism in mice. Such a neuroprotective effect may be partially mediated via restoring TrkB neurotrophic signaling.</description>

	<description>Groupwise image registration tackles biases that can potentially arise from inappropriate template selection. It typically involves simultaneous registration of a cohort of images to a common space that is not specified a priori. Existing groupwise registration methods are computationally complex and are only effective for image populations without large anatomical variations. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework to rapidly estimate large deformations between images to significantly reduce structural variability. Specifically, we employ a multi-level graph coarsening method to agglomerate similar images into clusters, each represented by an exemplar image. We then use a deep learning framework to predict the initial deformations between images. Warping with the estimated deformations brings the images closer in the image manifold and their alignment can be further refined using conventional groupwise registration algorithms. We evaluated the effectiveness of our method in groupwise registration of MR brain images and compared it against state-of-the-art groupwise registration methods. Experimental results indicate that deformation initialization enables groupwise registration to converge significantly faster with competitive accuracy, therefore facilitates large-scale imaging studies.</description>

	<description>To study the interplay of metabolic state (hungry vs. satiated) and glucose administration (including hormonal modulation) on brain function, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and blood samples were obtained in 24 healthy normal-weight men in a repeated measurement design. Participants were measured twice: once after a 36 hours fast (except water) and once under satiation (three meals/day for 36 hours). During each session, rs-fMRI and hormone concentrations were recorded before and after a 75 g oral dose of glucose. We calculated the amplitude map from BOLD signals by using the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) approach for each volunteer per condition. Using multiple linear regression analysis the interdependence of brain activity, plasma insulin and blood glucose was investigated. We observed a modulatory impact of fasting state on intrinsic brain activity in the posterior cingulate cortex. Strikingly, differences in plasma insulin levels between hunger and satiety states after glucose administration at the time of the scan were negatively related to brain activity in the posterior insula and superior frontal gyrus, while plasma glucose levels were positively associated with activity changes in the fusiform gyrus. Furthermore, we could show that changes in plasma insulin enhanced the connectivity between the posterior insula and superior frontal gyrus. Our results indicate that hormonal signals like insulin alleviate an acute hemostatic energy deficit by modifying the homeostatic and frontal circuitry of the human brain.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Perspective on Objective Measurement of the Perceived Challenge of Walking</title>

	<description>Perceived challenge of walking is a broad term that we use to encompass walking-related anxiety, balance self-efficacy/confidence, and fear of falling. Evidence shows that even after accounting for physical performance capabilities, a higher perceived challenge can cause individuals to self-impose restrictions in walking-related activities. Perceived challenge is typically measured by self-report, which is susceptible to subjective measurement bias and error. We assert that measurement of perceived challenge can be enhanced by augmenting self-report with objective, physiologically based measures. A promising approach that has emerged in the literature is measurement of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity by recording skin conductance. Heightened SNS activity is a physiological stress response to conditions that are cognitively, emotionally, or physically challenging. In the present article we explain the rationale and physiological basis for measuring SNS activity to assess perceived challenge of walking. We also present existing and new evidence supporting the feasibility of this approach for assessing perceived challenge in lab-based and real-world walking environments. Future research directions are also discussed.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Sleep Is a Refreshing Process: An fNIRS Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00160</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00160</link>
	<description>Sleep is a very critical process that constitutes up to one third of daytime of a healthy adult. It is known to be an active period where body and brain is refreshed for the next day. It is both part of a larger cycle, i.e. circadian rhythm, and has subcsycles in it, i.e. sleep stages. Although hemodynamics of these stages have been investigated especially in the last two decades, there are still points in the hemodynamics to be illuminated especially in terms of refreshment. This study aims to investigate refreshing property of sleep in terms of sleep stages using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for measuring prefrontal cortex (PFC) hemodynamics.
Nine healthy subjects slept in sleep laboratories, monitored by polysomnography and fNIRS before, during, and after night sleep. REM stage had lower oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and total hemoglobin (HbT) than the other sleep stages and wakefulness. Deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) did not differ between any stages. All sleep stages and wakefulness stage at the end of the sleep had higher HbO and lower HbR than the beginning of the sleep. HbT levels did not differ between the beginning and the end of the sleep for any stages.
During REM sleep, PFC seems to get lower blood supply, possibly due to increased demand in other brain regions. Regardless of the stage, PFC has higher oxygenation towards the end of sleep, indicating refreshment.
Overall, our brain seems to be on duty during sleep throughout the night for “cleaning” and “refreshing” itself. Hemodynamic changes from the beginning to end of sleep might be the indicator of this work. Thus, accordingly REM stage seems to be at a central point for this work.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cross-Frequency Coupling in Developmental Perspective</title>

	<description>It is generally assumed that different EEG frequency bands are somehow related to different computational modes in the brain. Integration of these computational modes is reflected in the phenomenon of cross-frequency coupling (CFC). On slow temporal scales, CFC may reflect trait-like properties, which posits a question of its developmental trends. This is the first study that explored source-level CFC measures in developmental perspective using both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. CFC measures demonstrated good test-retest stability and proved to be higher in adults in cortical areas participating in sensory-motor integration, response inhibition, and attentional control. In children, greater CFC was observed in parietal regions involved in self-centered cognition. Over the period from 7 to 10 years, CFC demonstrated nonlinear growth trajectories. Introversion was associated with higher CFC in cortical areas related to emotion, attention, and social cognition implying that the association between introversion and CFC appears early in the development.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Grief, Mindfulness and Neural Predictors of Improvement in Family Dementia Caregivers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00155</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00155</link>
	<description>Background: Family dementia caregivers often suffer from an immense toll of grief while caring for their loved ones.  We sought to identify the clinical relationship between grief, depression and mindfulness and identify neural predictors of symptomatology and improvement. 

Methods: 23 family dementia caregivers were assessed at baseline for grief, mindfulness and depression, of which 17 underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).  During fMRI, caregivers were shown faces of either their dementia-stricken relative or that of a stranger, paired with grief-related or neutral words.  In 9 subjects, post fMRI scans were also obtained after four weeks of either guided imagery or relaxation.  Robust regression was used to predict changes in symptoms with longitudinal brain activation changes as the dependent variable. 

Results:  Grief and depression symptoms were correlated (r = 0.50, p = .01), and both were negatively correlated with mindfulness (r = -.70, p = .0002; r = -.52, p = .01).  Relative to viewing strangers, caregivers shown pictures of their loved ones (picture factor) exhibited increased activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus.  Improvement in grief but not mindfulness or depression was predicted by increased relative brain activation in the precuneus and anterior cingulate (different subregions from baseline).  Viewing grief-related vs. neutral words elicited activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus.  

Conclusions: Caregiver grief, depression and mindfulness are interrelated but have at least partially nonoverlapping neural mechanisms.  Picture and word stimuli related to grief evoked brain activity in regions previously identified with bereavement grief.  These activation foci might be useful as biomarkers of treatment response.</description>

	<description>Falls are a leading cause of serious injury and restricted participation among persons with stroke (PwS). Reactive balance control is essential for fall prevention, however, only a few studies have explored the effects of lesion characteristics (location and extent) on balance control in PwS. We aimed to assess the impact of lesion characteristics on reactive and anticipatory balance capacity, gait, and hemiparetic lower limb function, in PwS. Forty-six subacute PwS were exposed to forward, backward, right and left unannounced horizontal surface translations in 6 increasing intensities, while standing. Fall threshold (i.e., perturbation intensity that results in a fall into the harness system) was measured. In addition, the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and Lower Extremity Fugl-Meyer (LEFM) were measured. Lesion effects were analyzed separately for left- and right-hemisphere damaged (LHD, RHD) patients, using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM). Our results show that voxel clusters where damage exerted a significant impact on balance, gait and lower-limb function were found in the corticospinal tract, in its passage in the corona radiata and in the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Additional significant impact was found to lesions affecting the putamen and the external capsule. Balance, gait, and hemiparetic lower limb function showed much overlap of the corresponding ‘significant’ voxel clusters. Test scores of RHD and LHD patients were affected largely by damage to homologous regions, with the LHD group showing a wider distribution of ‘significant’ voxels. The study corroborates and extends previous findings by demonstrating that balance control, gait, and lower limb function are all affected mainly by damage to essentially the same brain structures, namely - the corticospinal tract and adjacent structures in the capsular-putaminal region.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Frequency-Dependent Spatial Distribution of Functional Hubs in the Human Brain and Alterations in Major Depressive Disorder</title>

	<description>Alterations in large-scale brain intrinsic functional connectivity (FC), i.e., coherence between fluctuations of ongoing activity, have been implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD). Yet, little is known about the frequency-dependent alterations of FC in MDD. We calculated frequency specific degree centrality (DC)—a measure of overall FC of a brain region—within 10 distinct frequency bands accessible from the full range of resting-state fMRI BOLD fluctuations (i.e., 0.01–0.25 Hz) in 24 healthy controls and 24 MDD patients. 

In healthy controls, results reveal a frequency-specific spatial distribution of highly connected brain regions—i.e., hubs—which play a fundamental role in information integration in the brain. MDD patients exhibited significant deviations from the healthy DC patterns, with decreased overall connectedness of widespread regions, in a frequency-specific manner. Decreased DC in MDD patients was observed predominantly in the occipital cortex at low frequencies (0.01–0.1 Hz), in the middle cingulate cortex, sensorimotor cortex, lateral parietal cortex, and the precuneus at middle frequencies (0.1–0.175 Hz), and in the anterior cingulate cortex at high frequencies (0.175–0.25 Hz). Additionally, decreased DC of distinct parts of the insula was observed across low, middle, and high frequency bands. Frequency-specific alterations in the DC of the temporal, insular, and lateral parietal cortices correlated with symptom severity.

Importantly, our results indicate that frequency-resolved analysis within the full range of frequencies accessible from the BOLD signal—also including higher frequencies (&amp;gt; 0.1 Hz)—reveals unique information about brain organization and its changes, which can otherwise be overlooked.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Mental Fatigue and Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) – Based Assessment of Cognitive Performance After Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00145</guid>

	<description>Pathological mental fatigue after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI-MF) is characterized by pronounced mental fatigue after cognitive activity. The neurological origin is unknown, and we aimed in the present study to investigate how prolonged mental activity affects cognitive performance and its neural correlates in individuals with TBI-MF.
We recruited individuals with TBI-MF (n=20) at least 5 months after injury, and age-matched healthy controls (n=20). We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to assess hemodynamic changes in the frontal cortex. The self-assessed mental energy level was measured with a visual analog scale before and after the experimental procedure. A battery of six neuropsychological tests including Stroop-Simon, Symbol Search, Digit Span, Parallel Serial Mental Operation, Sustained Attention and Working Memory test, and Digit Symbol Coding were used. The sequence was repeated once after an eight-minute sustained-attention test. The test procedure lasted 2 ½ hours.
The experimental procedure resulted in a decrease in mental energy in the TBI-MF group, compared to controls (interaction, p&amp;lt;0.001, ηp2 = 0.331). The TBI-MF group performed at a similar level on both Digit Symbol Coding tests, whereas the controls improved their performance in the second session (interaction, p&amp;lt;0.01, ηp2 = 0.268). During the Stroop-Simon test, the fNIRS event-related response showed no time effect. However, the TBI-MF group exhibited lower oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentrations in the frontal polar area, ventrolateral motor cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from the beginning of the test session. A Stroop and Group interaction was found in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex showing that the TBI-MF group did have the same oxy-Hb concentration for both congruent and incongruent trials, whereas the controls had more oxy-Hb in the incongruent trial compared to the congruent trial (interaction, p&amp;lt;0.01, ηp2 = 0.227). In sum these results indicate that individuals with TBI-MF have a reduced ability to recruit the frontal cortex, which is correlated with self-reported mental fatigue. This may result both in deterioration of cognitive function and the experience of a mental fatigue after extended mental activity.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Larger Amygdala Volume Mediates the Association Between Prenatal Maternal Stress and Higher Levels of Externalizing Behaviors: Sex Specific Effects in Project Ice Storm</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00144</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00144</link>
	<description>Introduction. The amygdala is a brain structure involved in emotional regulation. Studies have shown that larger amygdala volumes are associated with behavioral disorders. Prenatal maternal depression is associated with structural changes in the amygdala, which in turn, is predictive of an increase in behavioral problems. Girls may be particularly vulnerable. However, it is not known whether disaster-related prenatal maternal stress (PNMS), or which aspect of the maternal stress experience (i.e., objective hardship, subjective distress and cognitive appraisal), influences amygdala volumes. Nor is it known whether amygdala volumes mediate the effect of PNMS on behavioral problems in girls and boys. 
Aims. To assess whether aspects of PNMS are associated with amygdala volume, to determine whether timing of exposure moderates the effect, and to test whether amygdala volume mediates the association between PNMS and internalizing and externalizing problems in 11½ year old children exposed to varying levels of disaster-related PNMS. 
Methods. Bilateral amygdala volumes (AGV) and total brain volume (TBV) were acquired using magnetic resonance imaging, from 35 boys and 33 girls whose mothers were pregnant during the January 1998 Quebec Ice Storm. The mothers’ disaster-related stress was assessed in June 1998. Child internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed at 11½ years using the Child Behavior Checklist. Hierarchical regression analyses and mediation analyses were conducted on boys and girls separately, controlling for perinatal and postnatal factors.
Results. In boys, subjective distress was associated with larger right AGV/TBV when mothers where exposed during late pregnancy, which in turn explained higher levels of externalizing behavior. However when adjusting for postnatal factors, the effect was no longer significant. In girls, later gestational exposure to the ice storm was associated with larger AGV/TBV, but here, higher levels of objective PNMS were associated with more externalizing problems, which was, in part, mediated by larger AGV/TBV. No effects were detected on internalizing behaviors.
Conclusion. These results suggest that the effects of PNMS on amygdala development and externalizing symptoms, as assessed in boys and girls in early adolescence, can be influenced by the timing of the stress in pregnancy, and the particular aspect of the mother’s stress experience.</description>

	<description>Understanding the mechanisms of vision in health and disease requires knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the eye and the neural pathways relevant to visual perception. As such, development of imaging techniques for the visual system is crucial for unveiling the neural basis of visual function or impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers non-invasive probing of the structure and function of the neural circuits without depth limitation, and can help identify abnormalities in brain tissues in vivo. Among the advanced MRI techniques, manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) involves the use of active manganese contrast agents that positively enhance brain tissue signals in T1-weighted imaging with respect to the levels of connectivity and activity. Depending on the routes of administration, accumulation of manganese ions in the eye and the visual pathways can be attributed to systemic distribution or their local transport across axons in an anterograde fashion, entering the neurons through voltage-gated calcium channels. The use of the paramagnetic manganese contrast in MRI has a wide range of applications in the visual system from imaging normal neurodevelopment to assessing and monitoring neurodegeneration, neuroplasticity, neuroprotection, and neuroregeneration. In this review, we present four major domains of scientific inquiry where MEMRI can be put to imperative use — deciphering neuroarchitecture, tracing neuronal tracts, detecting neuronal activity, and identifying or differentiating glial activity. We deliberate upon each category studies that have successfully employed MEMRI to examine the visual system, including the delivery protocols, spatiotemporal characteristics, and biophysical interpretation. Based on this literature, we have identified some critical challenges in the field in terms of toxicity, and sensitivity and specificity of manganese enhancement. We also discuss the pitfalls and alternatives of MEMRI which will provide new avenues to explore in the future.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Hydroxyurea Improves Spatial Memory and Cognitive Plasticity in Mice and Has a Mild Effect on These Parameters in a Down Syndrome Mouse Model</title>

	<description>Down syndrome (DS), a genetic disorder caused by partial or complete triplication of chromosome 21, is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability. DS mouse models and cell lines display defects in cellular adaptive stress responses including autophagy, unfolded protein response, and mitochondrial bioenergetics. We tested the ability of hydroxyurea (HU), an FDA-approved pharmacological agent that activates adaptive cellular stress response pathways, to improve the cognitive function of Ts65Dn mice. The chronic HU treatment started at a stage when early mild cognitive deficits are present in this model (~3 months of age) and continued until a stage of advanced cognitive deficits in untreated mice (~ 5-6 months of age). The HU effects on cognitive performance were analyzed using a battery of water maze tasks designed to detect changes in different types of memory with sensitivity wide enough to detect deficits as well as improvements in spatial memory. The most common characteristic of cognitive deficits observed in trisomic mice at 5-6 months of age was their inability to rapidly acquire new information for long-term storage, a feature akin to episodic-like memory. On the background of severe cognitive impairments in untreated trisomic mice, HU-treatment produced mild but significant benefits in Ts65Dn by improving memory acquisition and short-term retention of spatial information. In control mice, HU treatment facilitated memory retention in constant (reference memory) as well as time-variant conditions (episodic-like memory) implicating a robust nootropic effect. This was the first proof-of-concept study of HU treatment in a DS model, and indicates that further studies are warranted to assess a window to optimize timing and dosage of the treatment in this pre-clinical phase. Findings of this study indicate that HU has potential for improving memory retention and cognitive flexibility that can be harnessed for the amelioration of cognitive deficits in normal aging and in cognitive decline (dementia) related to DS and other neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

	<description>Activation of microglia, the primary mediators of inflammation in the brain, is a major component of gliosis and neuronal loss in a number of age-related neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer disease.  The role of activated microglia in white matter, and its relationship to cognitive decline during aging, are unknown. The current study evaluated microglia densities in white matter of postmortem specimens from cognitively normal young adults, cognitively normal older adults, and cognitive “SuperAgers”, a unique group of individuals over age 80 whose memory test scores are at a level equal to or better than scores of 50-to-65-year-olds. 

Specimens from cognitively-normal old, young, and “SuperAgers” were cut into whole hemisphere sections and immunohistochemical procedures were used to visualize activated microglia with HLA-DR antibody. Densities of HLA-DR-positive activated microglia underlying five cortical regions were evaluated.  

Statistical findings showed a significant main effect of group on differences in microglia density where cognitively-normal old showed highest densities; no difference between SuperAgers and young specimens were detected.  In two autopsied SuperAgers with MRI FLAIR available, prominent hyperintensities in periventricular regions were observed, and interestingly, examination of corresponding postmortem sections showed only sparse microglia densities. 

In conclusion, activated microglia appear to respond to age-related pathologic changes in cortical white matter, and this phenomenon is largely spared in SuperAgers. Findings offer insights into the relationship between white matter neuroinflammatory changes and cognitive integrity during aging.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Current Issue: Neural Correlates of Personalized Spiritual Experiences</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Across cultures and throughout history, human beings have reported a variety of spiritual experiences and the concomitant perceived sense of union that transcends one’s ordinary sense of self. Nevertheless, little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms of spiritual experiences, particularly when examined across different traditions and practices. By adapting an individualized guided-imagery task, we investigated neural correlates of personally meaningful spiritual experiences as compared with stressful and neutral-relaxing experiences. We observed in the spiritual condition, as compared with the neutral-relaxing condition, reduced activity in the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), a result that suggests the IPL may contribute importantly to perceptual processing and self-other representations during spiritual experiences. Compared with stress cues, responses to spiritual cues showed reduced activity in the medial thalamus and caudate, regions associated with sensory and emotional processing. Overall, the study introduces a novel method for investigating brain correlates of personally meaningful spiritual experiences and suggests neural mechanisms associated with broadly defined and personally experienced spirituality.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Thoracic paravertebral sympathetic postganglionic neurons (tSPNs) comprise the final integrative output of the distributed sympathetic nervous system controlling vascular and thermoregulatory systems. Considered a non-integrating relay, what little is known of tSPN intrinsic excitability has been determined by sharp microelectrodes with presumed impalement injury. We thus undertook the first electrophysiological characterization of tSPN cellular properties using whole-cell recordings and coupled results with a conductance-based model to explore the principles governing their excitability in adult mice of both sexes. Recorded membrane resistance and time constant values were an order of magnitude greater than values previously obtained, leading to a demonstrable capacity for synaptic integration in driving recruitment. Variation in membrane resistivity was the primary determinant controlling cell excitability with vastly lower currents required for tSPN recruitment. Unlike previous microelectrode recordings in mouse which observed inability to sustain firing, all tSPNs were capable of repetitive firing. Computational modeling demonstrated that observed differences are explained by introduction of a microelectrode impalement injury conductance. Overall, tSPNs largely linearly encoded injected current magnitudes over a broad frequency range with distinct subpopulations differentiable based on repetitive firing signatures. Thus, whole-cell recordings reveal tSPNs have more dramatically amplified excitability than previously thought, with greater intrinsic capacity for synaptic integration and with the ability for maintained firing to support sustained actions on vasomotor tone and thermoregulatory function. Rather than acting as a relay, these studies support a more responsive role and possible intrinsic capacity for tSPNs to drive sympathetic autonomic function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;It is not known why there is increased risk to have seizures with increased anxiety and stress after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Stressors cause the release of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) both from the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and from CNS neurons located in the central amygdala and GABAergic interneurons. We have previously shown that CRF signaling is plastic, becoming excitatory instead of inhibitory after the kindling model of epilepsy. Here, using Sprague Dawley rats we have found that CRF signaling increased excitability after TBI. Following TBI, CRF type 1 receptor (CRFR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)-mediated activity caused abnormally large electrical responses in the amygdala, including fast ripples, which are considered to be epileptogenic. After TBI, we also found the ripple (120–250 Hz) and fast ripple activity (&amp;gt;250 Hz) was cross-frequency coupled with  (3–8 Hz) oscillations. CRFR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; antagonists reduced the incidence of phase coupling between ripples and fast ripples. Our observations indicate that pathophysiological signaling of the CRFR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; increases the incidence of epileptiform activity after TBI. The use for CRFR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; antagonist may be useful to reduce the severity and frequency of TBI associated epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Visuospatial short-term memory and dorsal visual gray matter volume. (arXiv:1905.04283v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual short-term memory (VSTM) is an important cognitive capacity that
varies across the healthy adult population and is affected in several
neurodevelopmental disorders. It has been suggested that neuroanatomy places
limits on this capacity through a map architecture that creates competition for
cortical space. This suggestion has been supported by the finding that primary
visual (V1) gray matter volume (GMV) is positively associated with VSTM
capacity. However, evidence from neurodevelopmental disorders suggests that the
dorsal visual stream more broadly is vulnerable and atypical volumes of other
map-containing regions may therefore play a role. For example, Turner syndrome
is associated with concomitantly reduced volume of the right intraparietal
sulcus (IPS) and deficits in VSTM. As posterior IPS regions (IPS0-2) contains
topographic maps, together this suggests that posterior IPS volumes may also
associate with VSTM. In this study, we assessed VSTM using two tasks, as well
as a composite score, and used voxel-based morphometry of T1-weighted magnetic
resonance images to assess GMV in V1 and right IPS0-2 in 32 healthy young
adults (16 female). For comparison with previous work, we also assessed
associations between VSTM and voxel-wise GMV on a whole-brain basis. We found
that total brain volume (TBV) significantly correlated with VSTM, and that
correlations between VSTM and regional GMV were substantially reduced in
strength when controlling for TBV. In our whole-brain analysis, we found that
VSTM was associated with GMV of clusters centered around the right putamen and
left Rolandic operculum, though only when TBV was not controlled for. Our
results suggest that VSTM ability is unlikely to be accounted for by the volume
of an individual cortical region and may instead rely on distributed structural
properties.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Diffusion tractography is routinely used to study white matter architecture
and brain connectivity in vivo. A key step for successful tractography of
neuronal tracts is the correct identification of tract directions in each
voxel. Here we propose a fingerprinting-based methodology to identify these
fiber directions in Orientation Distribution Functions, dubbed
ODF-Fingerprinting (ODF-FP). In ODF-FP, fiber configurations are selected based
on the similarity between measured ODFs and elements in a pre-computed library.
In noisy ODFs, the library matching algorithm penalizes the more complex fiber
configurations. ODF simulations and analysis of bootstrapped partial and
whole-brain in vivo datasets show that the ODF-FP approach improves the
detection of fiber pairs with small crossing angles while maintaining fiber
direction precision, which leads to better tractography results. Rather than
focusing on the ODF maxima, the ODF-FP approach uses the whole ODF shape to
infer fiber directions to improve the detection of fiber bundles with small
crossing angle. The resulting fiber directions aid tractography algorithms in
accurately displaying neuronal tracts and calculating brain connectivity.

	<description>The essential roles of microglia in maintaining homeostasis in the healthy brain and contributing to neuropathology are well documented. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic modulation regulates microglial behavior in both physiological and pathological conditions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding epigenetic regulators that repress target gene expression mostly via binding to 3’-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of mRNA in a Dicer-dependent manner. Dysregulation of certain miRNAs can contribute to microglial hyper-activation, persistent neuroinflammation, and abnormal macrophage polarization in the brain. These abnormal conditions can support the pathogenesis of neurological disorders such as glioma, Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, ischemia, and spinal cord injury. However, the roles of miRNAs in microglia in health and neurological disease have not been systematically summarized. This review will firstly report the role of Dicer, a key endoribonulease that is responsible for most miRNA biogenesis in microglia. Secondly, we will focus on recent research about the function of miRNAs in activation, inflammation and polarization of microglia, respectively. In addition, potential crosstalk between microglia and glioma cells via miRNAs will be discussed in this part. Finally, the role of two essential miRNAs, miR-124, and miR-155, in microglia will be highlighted.</description>

	<description>Despite decades of research, current therapeutic interventions for Parkinson`s disease (PD) are insufficient as they fail to modify disease progression by ameliorating the underlying pathology. Cellular proteostasis (protein homeostasis) is an essential factor in maintaining a persistent environment for neuronal activity. Proteostasis is ensured by mechanisms including regulation of protein translation, chaperone-assisted protein folding and protein degradation pathways. It is generally accepted that deficits in proteostasis are linked to various neurodegenerative diseases including PD. While the proteasome fails to degrade large protein aggregates, particularly alpha-synuclein (α-SYN) in PD, drug-induced activation of autophagy can efficiently remove aggregates and prevent degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Therefore, maintenance of these mechanisms is essential to preserve all cellular functions relying on a correctly folded proteome. The correlations between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) that aims to restore proteostasis within the secretory pathway are well established. However, while mild insults increase the activity of chaperones, prolonged cell stress or insufficient adaptive response causes cell death. Modulating the activity of molecular chaperones, such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) which assists refolding and contributes to the removal of unfolded proteins, and their associated pathways may offer a new approach for disease-modifying treatment. Here, we summarize some of the key concepts and emerging ideas on the relation of protein aggregation and imbalanced proteostasis with an emphasis on PD as our area of main expertise. Furthermore, we discuss recent insights into the strategies for reducing the toxic effects of protein unfolding in PD by targeting the ER UPR pathway.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Cognitive Syndromes and C9orf72 Mutation Are Not Related to Cerebellar Degeneration in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>

	<description>Objective The notion that cerebellar pathology may contribute to cognitive impairment in ALS, especially in patients with C9orf72 repeated expansion, has been inconsistently reported. This study aimed exploring the relationship between cerebellar involvement, cognitive impairment and C9orf72repeated expansion of patients with ALS.
Methods Quantitative in-vivo assessment of cerebellar lobules has been investigated in 66 non-demented patients with ALS and 28 healthy controls. Pathologic C9orf72 repeated expansion was found in 13 patients. Mild cognitive and/or behavioral impairment was diagnosed in 22 C9orf72 negative ALS patients. Measures of cortical volume (CV) and cortical thickness (CT) of cerebellar lobules of all participants were used for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify clusters of lobular measures highly correlated with each other. PCA outcomes were used for between group comparisons and correlation analyses with neuropsychological and clinical features. 
Results Disease severity measured with ALS functional rating scale and index of disease progression rate significantly correlated with CV reduction of the second PCA cluster loading CV measures of anterior lobules. In all patients, cognitive impairment, measured with verbal fluency, was related to CV reduction of the third cluster comprising posterior lobules. No specific cortical thinning or volume reduction of cerebellar clustering patterns could be detected in ALS subgroups. 
Conclusion Our data show that specific patterns of subregional cerebellar involvement are associated with physical disability or cognitive impairment in ALS, in line with the topographic organization of the cerebellum. However, there was no specific correlation between cerebellar degeneration and cognitive syndromes or C9orf72 mutations.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: The Effects of Amphetamine and Methamphetamine on the Release of Norepinephrine, Dopamine and Acetylcholine From the Brainstem Reticular Formation</title>

	<description>Amphetamine (AMPH) and methamphetamine (METH) are widely abused psychostimulants, which produce a variety of psychomotor, autonomic and neurotoxic effects. The behavioral and neurotoxic effects of both compounds (from now on defined as AMPHs) stem from a fair molecular and anatomical specificity for catecholamine-containing neurons, which are placed in the brainstem reticular formation. In fact, the structural cross-affinity joined with the presence of shared molecular targets between AMPHs and catecholamine provides the basis for a quite selective recruitment of brainstem catecholamine neurons following AMPHs administration. A great amount of investigations, commentary manuscripts and books reported a pivotal role of mesencephalic dopamine (DA)-containing neurons in producing behavioral and neurotoxic effects of AMPHs. Instead, the present review focuses on catecholamine reticular neurons of the low brainstem. In fact, these nuclei add on DA mesencephalic cells to mediate the effects of AMPHs. Among these, we also include two pontine cholinergic nuclei. Finally, we discuss the conundrum of a mixed neuronal population, which extends from the pons to the periaqueductal gray. In this way, a number of reticular nuclei beyond classic DA mesencephalic cells are considered to extend the scenario underlying the neurobiology of AMPHs abuse. The mechanistic approach followed here to describe the action of AMPHs within the reticular formation is rooted on the fine anatomy of this region of the brainstem. This is exemplified by a few medullary catecholamine neurons, which play a pivotal role compared with the bulk of peripheral sympathetic neurons in sustaining most of the cardiovascular effects induced by AMPHs.</description>

	<description>Background.  Increasingly favorable mortality prognosis in multiple sclerosis (MS) raises questions regarding MS-specific cognitive aging and the presence of comorbidities such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 
Objective.  To assess elderly with MS (EwMS) and age-matched healthy controls (HCs) using both MS- and AD-specific psychometrics.  
Methods.  EwMS (n=104) and 56 HCs were assessed on a broad spectrum of language, visual-spatial processing, memory, processing speed, and executive function tests.  Using logistic regression analysis, we examined cognitive performance differences between the EwMS and HC groups.  Cognitive impairment (CI) was defined using a -1.5 SD threshold relative to age and education years-matched HCs, in two cognitive domains. 
Results.  CI was observed in 47.1% of EwMS with differences most often seen on tests emphasizing cognitive processing speed as measured by Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) (d=0.9, p&amp;lt;0.001) and verbal fluency (both category-based d=0.87, p&amp;lt;0.001; letter-based d=0.67, p&amp;lt;0.001).  After adjusting for age, sex and years of education, MS/HC diagnosis was the best predicted (R2=0.27) by differences in category-based verbal fluency (Wald=9.935, p=0.002) and SDMT (Wald=13.937, p&amp;lt;0.001).  
Conclusion.  This study confirms the common hallmark of slowed cognitive processing speed in MS among elderly patients. Defective verbal fluency, less often observed in younger cohorts, may represent emerging cognitive pathology due to other etiologies.</description>

	<description>SYNGAP1, a Synaptic Ras-GTPase activating protein, regulates synapse maturation during a critical developmental window. Heterozygous mutation in SYNGAP1 (SYNGAP1+/-) has been shown to cause Intellectual Disability (ID) in children. Recent studies have provided evidence for altered neuronal protein synthesis in a mouse model of Syngap1+/-. However, the molecular mechanism behind the same is unclear. Here, we report the reduced expression of a known translation regulator, FMRP, during a specific developmental period in Syngap1+/- mice. Our results demonstrated that FMRP interacts with and regulates the translation of Syngap1 mRNA. We further show that, during development, reduced translation, and subsequent decrease in FMRP level leads to a compensatory increase of Syngap1 translation in Syngap1+/-. These developmental changes are reflected in the altered response of eEF2 phosphorylation downstream of NMDA Receptor (NMDAR)-mediated signalling. In this study, we propose a cross-talk between FMRP and SYNGAP1-mediated signalling which can also explain the compensatory effect of impaired signalling observed in Syngap1+/- mice.</description>

	<description>Metabolic syndrome including obesity and type 2 diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide. Similarly, there has been an increase in the cases of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) possibility due to increase in elderly population in the past few decades. Both, metabolic diseases and AD have one common feature that is insulin resistance.  Recent studies suggest a link between the regulatory functions of insulin in the brain and AD.  Hypoglycemia, a characteristic feature of AD may be a result of impaired insulin signaling in the affected regions of the brain. O-GlcNAcylation is a post-translational protein modification, the levels of which are dependent on the availability of glucose inside the cells. Hyperphosphorylation of Tau is a major molecular feature, which leads to its aggregation and neurotoxicity in AD.  In addition, impaired processing of Amyloid precursor protein (APP) leading to toxic amyloid β (Aβ) aggregation is also implicated in the pathogenesis of AD.  Both APP and Tau are also found to be O-GlcNAcylated. Reduced O-GlcNAcylation of APP and Tau due to hypoglycemia is found to be associated with their pathological features in AD brain. Recent studies have also identified perturbed O-GlcNAcylation/phosphorylation of several other proteins important for normal neuronal function, which may be contributing to the neuropathological development in AD. Herein, we discuss about the uptake and distribution of insulin inside the brain, brain insulin signaling and insulin resistance as well as its relation to neurodegenerative diseases with a special focus on protein O-GlcNAcylation and its potential role in the treatment of AD.</description>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00445</link>
	<description>Background: The exact mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative conditions are not fully known. The design of drugs that act on multiple targets represents a promising approach that should be explored for more effective clinical options for neurodegenerative disorders. B7C is s synthetic drug that has been studied for over 20 years and represents a promising multi-target drug for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, such as AD. 
Aims: The present systematic review, thus, aims at examining existing studies on the effect of B7C on different molecular targets and at discussing the relevance of B7C in neurological disorders.
Methods: A list of predefined search terms was used to retrieve relevant articles from the databases of Embase, Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The selection of articles was done by two independent authors, who were considering articles concerned primarily with the evaluation of the effect of B7C on neurological disorders. Only full-text articles written in English were included; whereas, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, book chapters, conference subtracts, and computational studies were excluded.   
Results: A total of 2266 articles were retrieved out of which 41 articles were included in the present systematic review. The effect of B7C on molecular targets, including AChE, BChE, BACE-1, NMDA receptor, GABA receptor, NOS, and Kv4.2 potassium channels was evaluated. Moreover, the studies that were included assessed the effect of B7C on biological processes, such as apoptosis, neuritogenesis, and amyloid beta aggregation. The animal studies examined in the review focused on the effect of B7C on cognition and memory. 
Conclusions: The beneficial effects observed on different molecular targets and biological processes relevant to neurological conditions confirm that B7C is a promising multi-target drug with the potential to treat neurological disorders.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cortical Functional Domains Show Distinctive Oscillatory Dynamic in Bimanual and Mirror Visual Feedback Tasks</title>

	<description>It is believed that Mirror Visual Feedback (MVF) increases the interlimb transfer but the exact mechanism is still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to compare between a bimanual task (BM) and a MVF task, within functionally rather than geometrically defined cortical domains. Measure Projection Analysis (MPA) approach was applied to compare the dynamic oscillatory activity (event-related synchronisation/desynchronisation ERS/ERD) between and within domains. EEG was recorded in 14 healthy participants performing a BM and an MVF task with the right hand. The MPA was applied on fitted equivalent current dipoles based on independent components to define domains containing functionally similar areas.  The measure of intradomain similarity was a “signed mutual information”, a parameter based on the coherence. Domain analysis was performed for joint tasks (BM and MVF) and for each task separately. MVF created 9 functional domains while MB task had only 4 functionally distinctive domains, two over the left hemispheres and two bilateraly. For all domains identified for BM task alone, similar domains could be identified in MVF and joint tasks analysis. In addition MVF had domains related to motor planning on the right hemisphere and to self-recognition of action. For joint tasks analysis, seven domains were identified, with similar functions for the left and the right hand with exception of a domain covering BA32 (self-recognition of action) of the left hand only.  In joint task domain analysis, the ERD/ERS showed a larger difference between domains than between tasks. All domains which involved the sensory cortex had a visible beta ERS at the onset of movement, and post movement beta ERS. The frequency of ERD varied between domains.  Largest difference between tasks existed in domains responsible for the awareness of action. In conclusion, functionally distinctive domains have different ERD/ERS patterns, similar for both tasks.  MVF activates contralateral hemisphere in similar manner to BM movements, while at the same time also activating the ipsilateral hemisphere. Significance: Following stroke cortical activation and interhemispheric inhibition from the contralesional side is reduced. MVF creates stronger ipsilateral activity than BM, which is highly relevant of neurorehabilitation of movements.</description>

	<description>A unique nucleus, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting nucleus, has recently been recognized in the brain parenchyma. The outstanding feature of this nucleus is that the neural somas are located in the parenchyma, but their processes stretch into the CSF, implying that it may be a key structure bridging the nervous and body fluids-regulating systems and may play a pivotal role in modulating physiological activities. However, the true biological significance of this nucleus needs to be uncovered. The morphology of a nucleus is one of the most important parameters for neuroscience studies. For this reason, a common experimental animal, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, was chosen. The position, adjacent structures, neuronal distribution, size, three-dimensional reconstruction, and core coordinates of the CSF-contacting nucleus in SD rats of different weights (90-400 g) were illustrated for the first time. Furthermore, the formulas for calculating the core coordinates of the CSF-contacting nucleus in rats of different weights were revealed. Finally, the possible biological functions uncovered by past research are reviewed in this paper. This study provides an indispensable methodology and a significant reference for researchers interested in this unique nucleus.</description>

	<description>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is reportedly associated with the accumulation of calcium ions (Ca2+), and this accumulation is responsible for the phosphorylation of tau. Although several lines of evidence demonstrate the above phenomenon, the inherent mechanisms remain unknown. Using APP/PS1 Tg mice and neuroblastoma (N)2a cells as in vivo and in vitro experimental models, we observed that Ca2+ stimulated the phosphorylation of tau by activating microsomal PGE synthase 1 (mPGES1) in a prostaglandin (PG) E2-dependent EP receptor-activating manner. Specifically, the highly accumulated Ca2+ stimulated the expression of mPGES1 and the synthesis of PGE2. Treatment with the inhibitor of Ca2+ transporter, NMDAR, attenuated the expression of mPGES1 and the production of PGE2 were attenuated in S(+)-ketamine-treated APP/PS1 Tg mice. Elevated levels of PGE2 were responsible for the hyperphosphorylation of tau in an EP-1-, EP-2- and EP-3-dependent but not EP4-dependent cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 5-activating manner. Reciprocally, the knockdown of the expression of mPGES1 ameliorated the expected cognitive decline by inhibiting the phosphorylation of tau in APP/PS1 Tg mice. Moreover, CDK5 was found to be located downstream of EP1-3 to regulate the phosphorylation of tau though the cleavage of p35 to p25. Finally, the phosphorylation of tau by Ca2+ contributed to the cognitive decline of APP/PS1 Tg mice.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Multi-Ingredient Nutritional Supplement in Combination With Resistance Exercise and High-Intensity Interval Training Improves Cognitive Function and Increases N-3 Index in Healthy Older Men: A Randomized Controlled Trial</title>

	<description>We aimed to evaluate the effect of multi-ingredient nutritional supplementation, with and without exercise training, on cognitive function in healthy older men. Forty-nine sedentary men (age: 73±6years [mean±SD]; body mass index: 28.5±3.6kg/m2) were randomized to consume a supplement (SUPP n=25; 1500mg n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, 30g whey protein, 2.5g creatine, 500IU vitamin D, and 400mg calcium) or control beverage (CON n=24; 22g maltodextrin) twice daily for 20wk consisting of Phase 1: SUPP/CON followed by Phase 2: 12-wk resistance exercise training plus high-intensity interval training, while continuing to consume the study beverages (SUPP/CON+EX). At baseline, 6wk, and 19wk we assessed cognitive function (Montréal Cognitive Assessment [MOCA]), memory (word recall during the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test [RAVLT]), and executive functions (working memory inhibition control), and nutrient bioavailability. We did not observe changes to any aspect of cognitive function after Phase 1; however, significant improvements in the following cognitive function outcomes were detected following Phase 2: MOCA scores increased (6wk: 23.5±3.3 vs. 19wk: 24.4±2.5, p=0.013); number of words recalled during the RAVLT (6wk: 6.6±3.6 vs. 19wk: 7.6±3.8, p=0.047); and reaction time improved (6wk: 567±49ms vs. 19wk: 551±51ms, p=0.002). Although between-group differences in these outcomes were not significant, we observed within-group improvements in composite cognitive function scores over the course of the entire study only in the SUPP group (Δ = 0.58±0.62, p=0.004) but not in the CON group (Δ = 0.31±0.61, p=0.06). We observed a progressive increase in n-3 index, and a concomitant decrease in the ratio of arachidonic acid (ARA) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) within erythrocyte plasma membranes, in the SUPP group only. At week 19, n-3 index (r=0.49, p=0.02) and the ARA:EPA ratio (r=-0.44, p=0.03) were significantly correlated with composite cognitive function scores. Our results show that 12 weeks of RET + HIIT resulted in improved MOCA scores, word recall, and reaction time during an executive functions task; and suggest that a multi-ingredient supplement combined with this exercise training program may improve composite cognitive function scores in older men possibly via supplementation-mediated alterations to n-3 PUFA bioavailability. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02281331).</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Life-Course Contribution of Prenatal Stress in Regulating the Neural Modulation Network Underlying the Prepulse Inhibition of the Acoustic Startle Reflex in Male Alzheimer’s Disease Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz089</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle reflex (ASR), as an index of sensorimotor gating, is one of the most extensively used paradigms in the field of neuropsychiatric disorders. Few studies have examined how prenatal stress (PS) regulates the sensorimotor gating during the lifespan and how PS modifies the development of amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology in brain areas underlying the PPI formation. We followed alternations in corticosterone levels, learning and memory, and the PPI of the ASR measures in APP&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NL-G-F/NL-G-F&lt;/span&gt; offspring of dams exposed to gestational noise stress. In-depth quantifications of the Aβ plaque accumulation were also performed at 6 months. The results indicated an age-dependent deterioration of sensorimotor gating, long-lasting PS-induced abnormalities in PPI magnitudes, as well as deficits in spatial memory. The PS also resulted in a higher Aβ aggregation predominantly in brain areas associated with the PPI modulation network. The findings suggest the contribution of a PS-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity in regulating the PPI modulation substrates leading to the abnormal development of the neural protection system in response to disruptive stimuli. The long-lasting HPA axis dysregulation appears to be the major underlying mechanism in precipitating the Aβ deposition, especially in brain areas contributed to the PPI modulation network.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Shifts of Spatial Attention in Visual and Tactile Working Memory are Controlled by Independent Modality-Specific Mechanisms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz088</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz088/5487003?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The question whether the attentional control of working memory (WM) is shared across sensory modalities remains controversial. Here, we investigated whether attention shifts in visual and tactile WM are regulated independently. Participants memorized visual and tactile targets in a first memory sample set (S1) before encoding targets in a second sample set (S2). Importantly, visual or tactile S2 targets could appear on the same side as the corresponding S1 targets, or on opposite sides, thus, requiring shifts of spatial attention in visual or tactile WM. The activation of WM representations in modality-specific visual and somatosensory areas was tracked by recording visual and tactile contralateral delay activity (CDA/tCDA). CDA/tCDA components emerged contralateral to the side of visual or tactile S1 targets, and reversed polarity when S2 targets in the same modality appeared on the opposite side. Critically, the visual CDA was unaffected by the presence versus absence of concurrent attention shifts in tactile WM, and the tactile CDA remained insensitive to visual attention shifts. Visual and tactile WM performance was also not modulated by attention shifts in the other modality. These results show that the dynamic control of visual and tactile WM activation processes operates in an independent modality-specific fashion.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Dynamics of Speech Motor Control Revealed with Time-Resolved fMRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz084</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Holding a conversation means that speech must be started, maintained, and stopped continuously. The brain networks that underlie these aspects of speech motor control remain poorly understood. Here we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while participants produced normal and fast rate speech in response to sequences of visually presented objects. We took a non-conventional approach to fMRI data analysis that allowed us to study speech motor behavior as it unfolded over time. To this end, whole-brain fMRI signals were extracted in stimulus-locked epochs using slice-based fMRI. These data were then subjected to group independent component analysis to discover spatially independent networks that were associated with different temporal activation profiles. The results revealed two basic brain networks with different temporal dynamics: a cortical network that was activated continuously during speech production, and a second cortico-subcortical network that increased in activity during the initiation and suppression of speech production. Additional analyses explored whether key areas involved in motor suppression such as the right inferior frontal gyrus, sub-thalamic nucleus and pre-supplementary motor area provide first-order signals to stop speech. The results reveal for the first time the brain networks associated with the initiation, maintenance, and suppression of speech motor behavior.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Coherence of Visual-Evoked Gamma Oscillations Is Disrupted by Propofol but Preserved Under Equipotent Doses of Isoflurane</title>

	<description>Previous research demonstrates that the underlying state of the brain influences how sensory stimuli are processed. Canonically, the state of the brain has been defined by quantifying the spectral characteristics of spontaneous fluctuations in local field potentials (LFP). Here, we utilized isoflurane and propofol anesthesia to parametrically alter the spectral state of the murine brain. With either drug, we produce slow wave delta dominant (1- 4Hz) activity, with low anesthetic doses, or burst suppression, with higher doses. We find that while spontaneous LFP oscillations were similar, the average visual-evoked potential (VEP) was always smaller in amplitude and shorter in duration under propofol than under comparable doses of isoflurane. This diminished average VEP results from increased trial-to-trial variability in VEPs under propofol.  One feature of single trial VEPs that was consistent in all animals was visual-evoked gamma band oscillation (20-60Hz). This gamma band oscillation was coherent between trials in the early phase (&amp;lt;250 ms) of the visual evoked potential under isoflurane. Inter trial phase coherence (ITPC) of gamma oscillations was dramatically attenuated in the same propofol anesthetized mice despite similar spontaneous oscillations in the LFP. This suggests that while both anesthetics lead to loss of consciousness, elicit slow oscillations and burst suppression, only the isoflurane permits phase resetting of gamma oscillations by visual stimuli. These results demonstrate that accurate characterization of a brain state must include both spontaneous as well as stimulus-induced perturbations of brain activity.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Large Scale Calcium Imaging of the Cerebellar Vermis During Sensory Stimulus Unravels Two Response’s Components That Differ in Their Spatiotemporal Properties</title>

	<description>The well documented precision of the cerebellar sagittal organization is commonly used to compose a comprehensive view on principles of cerebellar function. However, the physiological manifestation of this organization is either limited to information derived from single unit recordings or from imaging of a small group of closely located neurons. Here we used large scale imaging to monitor calcium concentration changes in the entire vermal area of folia V and VI in anesthetize mice. We found that the response to a strong auditory input or electrical shock to the tail area is composed of an early and a late component that differ in their spatiotemporal properties. The early component occurs throughout the scanned area whereas the late component reflects synchronous activation of Purkinje cells located along symmetric parasagittal bands that correspond well to sagittal band 2+ (Sugihara and Shinoda, 2004).  Similar organization was found in the rigorously disorganized cerebellum of Cxcr4 KO mice, suggesting that the sagittal organization is determined by the climbing fibers input to the cerebellar cortex. The responses for both stimuli are followed by prolonged recovery period but the rate of recovery from auditory stimulus is much longer reflecting different site of adapting process. We suggest that these sensory inputs, which are commonly used to evoke startle response, activate two sets of climbing fiber inputs that differ in their spatiotemporal properties and contribute to the motor organization and habituation of the startle response.</description>

	<description>Major depressive disorder is a debilitating condition that affects approximately 15 % of the U.S. population.  Though the neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie this disorder are not completely understood, both human and rodent studies suggest that excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance is reduced with the depressive phenotype. In contrast, antidepressant efficacy in responsive individuals correlates with increased excitatory neurotransmission in select brain regions, suggesting that the restoration of E/I balance may improve mood.
Enhanced excitatory transmission can occur through mechanisms including increased dendritic arborization and synapse formation in pyramidal neurons. Reduced activity of inhibitory neurons may also contribute to antidepressant efficacy.  Consistent with this possibility, the fast-acting antidepressant ketamine may act by selective inhibition of glutamatergic input to GABA releasing parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons. Recent work has also shown that a negative allosteric modulator of the GABA-A receptor  subunit can improve depression-related behavior. PV-expressing interneurons are thought to represent critical pacemakers for synchronous network events. These neurons also represent the predominant GABAergic neuronal population that is enveloped by the perineuronal net (PNN), a lattice-like structure that is thought to stabilize glutamatergic input to this cell type. Disruption of the PNN reduces PV excitability and increases pyramidal cell excitability. 
Various antidepressant medications increase the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes that can increase pyramidal cell dendritic arborization and spine formation. MMPs can also cleave PNN proteins to reduce PV neuron-mediated inhibition. The present review will focus on mechanisms that may underlie antidepressant efficacy, with a focus on monoamines as facilitators of increased matrix metalloprotease (MMP) expression and activation. Discussion will include MMP-dependent effects on pyramidal cell structure and function, as well as MMP-dependent effects on PV expressing interneurons. We conclude with discussion of antidepressant use for those at risk for Alzheimer’s disease, and we also highlight areas for further study.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Overexpression of CX3CR1 in Adipose-Derived Stem Cells Promotes Cell Migration and Functional Recovery After Experimental Intracerebral Hemorrhage</title>

	<description>Stem cell therapy has emerged as a new promising therapeutic strategy for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, the efficiency of stem cell therapy is partially limited by low retention and engraftment of the delivered cells. Therefore, it’s necessary to improve the migration ability of stem cells to the injured area in order to save the costs and duration of cell preparation. This study aimed to investigate whether overexpression of CX3CR1, the specific receptor of chemokine fractalkine (FKN), in adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) can stimulate the cell migration to the injured area in the brain, improve functional recovery and protect against cell death following experimental ICH. ADSCs were isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissues of rats. ICH was induced by means of an injection of collagenase type VII. ELISA showed that the expression levels of fractalkine/FKN were increased at early time points, with a peak at day 3 after ICH. And it was found that different passages of ADSCs could express the chemokine receptor CX3CR1. Besides, the chemotactic movements of ADSCs towards fractalkine have been verified by transwell migration assay. ADSCs overexpressing CX3CR1 were established through lentivirus transfection. We found that after overexpression of CX3CR1 receptor, the migration ability of ADSCs was increased both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, reduced cell death and improved sensory and motor functions were seen in the mice ICH model. Thus, ADSCs overexpression CX3CR1 might be taken as a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ICH.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Neuron-Derived Exosome Proteins May Contribute to Progression From Repetitive Mild Traumatic Brain Injuries to Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy</title>

	<description>The recent recognition that Alzheimer disease-like pathology may be found in  chronic traumatic encephalopathy even after mild acute traumatic brain injury has increased the urgency of elucidating mechanisms, identifying biomarkers predictive of high risk of development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and establishing biomarker profiles indicative of impactful effects of treatments. Of the many proteins that are loaded into neuron-derived exosomes (NDEs) from damaged neurons after acute traumatic brain injury, the levels of prion cellular protein, coagulation factor XIII, synaptogyrin-3, IL-6 and aquaporins remain elevated for months. Prolonged heightened expression of aquaporins and IL-6 may account for the persistent CNS edema and inflammation of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Prion cellular protein, coagulation factor XIII and synaptogyrin-3 bind and concentrate neurotoxic forms of oligomeric Aβ peptide or P-tau for delivery to neurons at or distant from the site of trauma. Our progression factor hypothesis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy asserts that physiological neuronal proteins, such as prion cellular protein, coagulation factor XIII, synaptogyrin-3, IL-6 and aquaporins, that increase in concentration in neurons and NDEs for months after acute traumatic brain injury, are etiological contributors to chronic traumatic encephalopathy by either direct actions or by mobilizing neurotoxic forms of Aβ peptides or P-tau. Such progression factors also may be useful new targets for development of drugs to prevent chronic traumatic encephalopathy.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Abnormal Resting-State Functional Connectivity in the Whole Brain in Lifelong Premature Ejaculation Patients Based on Machine Learning Approach</title>

	<description>Recent neuroimaging studies have indicated that abnormalities in brain structure and function may play an important role in the etiology of lifelong premature ejaculation (LPE). LPE patients have exhibited aberrant cortical structure, altered brain network function and abnormal brain activation in response to erotic pictures. However, it remains unclear whether resting-state whole brain functional connectivity (FC) is altered in LPE patients. Machine learning analysis has the advantage of screening the best classification features from high-throughput data (such as FC), which has the potential to identify the pathophysiological targets of disease by establishing classification indicators for patients and healthy controls (HCs). Therefore, the supported vector machine based classification model using FC as features was used in the present study to confirm the most specific FCs that distinguish LPE patients from healthy controls. After feature selection, the remained features were used to build the classification model, with an accuracy 0.85 ± 0.14, sensitivity of 0.92 ± 0.18, specificity of 0.72 ± 0.30, and recall index of 0.85 ± 0.17 across 1000 testing groups (100 times 10-folds cross validation). After that, two-sample t tests with family-wise error correction were used to compare these features that occurring more than 500 times during training steps between LPE patients and HCs. Four FCs, 1) between left medial part of orbital frontal cortex (mOFC) and right mOFC, 2) between the left rectus and right post-central gyrus, 3) between the right insula and left pallidum and 4) between the right middle part of temporal pole and right inferior part of temporal gyrus showed significant group difference. These results demonstrate that resting-state brain FC might be a discriminating feathers to distinguish LPE patients from HCs. These classification features, especially the FC between bilateral mOFC, provide underlying abnormal central functional targets in LPE etiology, which offers a novel alternative target for future intervention in LPE treatment.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Automatic Removal of Cardiac Interference (ARCI): A New Approach for EEG Data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00441</guid>

	<description>EEG recordings are generally affected by interference from physiological and non physiological sources which may obscure underlying brain activity and hinder effective EEG analysis. In particular, cardiac interference can be caused by the electrical activity of the heart and/or cardiovascular activity related to blood flow. Successful EEG application in sports science settings requires a method for artifact removal that is automatic and flexible enough to be applied in a variety of acquisition conditions without requiring simultaneous ECG recordings that could restrict movement.

We developed an automatic method for classifying and removing both electrical cardiac and cardiovascular artifacts (ARCI) that does not require additional ECG recording. Our method employs independent component analysis (ICA) to isolate data independent components (ICs) and identifies the artifactual ICs by evaluating specific IC features in the time and frequency domains. We applied ARCI to EEG datasets with cued artifacts and acquired during an eyes-closed condition. Data were recorded using a standard EEG wet cap with either 128 or 64 electrodes and using a novel dry electrode cap with either 97 or 64 dry electrodes. All data were decomposed into different numbers of components to evaluate the effect of ICA decomposition level on effective cardiac artifact detection. ARCI performance was evaluated by comparing automatic ICs classifications with classifications performed by experienced investigators. Automatic and investigator classifications were highly consistent resulting in an overall accuracy greater than 99% in all datasets and decomposition levels, and an average sensitivity greater than 90%. Best results were attained when data were decomposed into a fewer number of components where the method achieved perfect sensitivity (100%). Performance was also evaluated by comparing automatic component classification with externally recorded ECG. Results showed that ICs automatically classified as artifactual were significantly correlated with ECG activity whereas the other ICs were not. We also assessed that the interference affecting EEG signals was reduced by more than 82% after automatic artifact removal.

Overall, ARCI represents a significant step in the detection and removal of cardiac-related EEG artifacts and can be applied in a variety of acquisition settings making it ideal for sports science applications.</description>

	<description>Developing technologies for coupling neural activity and artificial neural components, is key for advancing neural interfaces and neuroprosthetics. We present a biohybrid experimental setting, where the activity of a biological neural network is coupled to a biomimetic hardware network. The implementation of the hardware network (denoted NeuroSoC) exhibits complex dynamics with a multiplicity of time-scales, emulating 2880 neurons and 12.7M synapses, designed on a VLSI chip. This network is coupled to a neural network in-vitro, where the activities of both the biological and the hardware networks can be recorded, processed and integrated bidirectionally in real-time. This experimental setup enables an adjustable and well-monitored coupling, while at the same time providing access to the key functional features of neural networks. We demonstrate the feasibility to functionally couple the two networks and of implementing control circuits to modify the biohybrid activity. Overall, we provide an experimental model for neuromorphic-neural interfaces, hopefully to advance the capability to interface with neural activity, and with its irregularities in pathology</description>

	<description>Electrical stimulation of the cervical vagus nerve is an emerging treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, cervical vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) can produce unwanted side effects. Here, we investigated whether stimulating the vagus nerve closer to the end organ has fewer off-target effects, while reducing intestinal inflammation. An electrode array was developed to stimulate and record vagal neural responses in rats. Acute VNS off-target experiment: The cervical and abdominal vagus nerves of anaesthetised rats (n=5) were acutely implanted with an electrode array, stimulation delivered (10 Hz; symmetric biphasic current pulse; 320 nC per phase) and changes to heart rate, respiration and blood pressure assessed. Chronic VNS efficacy experiment: The abdominal vagus nerve was chronically implanted with an electrode array. After 2 weeks, the intestine was inflamed with TNBS (2.5% 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid), an established method for rodent models of IBD. Rats were randomly selected to receive therapeutic VNS (n=7; 10 Hz; symmetric biphasic current pulse; 320 nC per phase; 3 hours/day) or no stimulation (n=8) for 5 days. Stool quality, C-reactive protein in blood and histology of the inflamed intestine were assessed. VNS off-target experiment: Abdominal VNS had no effect (two-way RM-ANOVA: P&amp;gt;0.05) on cardiac, respiratory and blood pressure parameters. However, during cervical VNS heart rate decreased by 31 ± 9 beats/minute (P&amp;gt;0.05), respiration was inhibited and blood pressure decreased. VNS efficacy experiment: During the implantation period, electrically-evoked neural response thresholds remained stable (one-way RM ANOVA: P&amp;gt;0.05), and were below stimulation levels. VNS rats, compared to unstimulated rats, had improved stool quality (two-way RM ANOVA: P&amp;lt;0.0001), no blood in faeces (P&amp;lt;0.0001), reduced plasma C-reactive protein (two-way RM ANOVA: P&amp;lt;0.05) and a reduction in resident inflammatory cell populations within the intestine (Kruskal-Wallis: P&amp;lt;0.05). Abdominal VNS did not evoke off-target effects, is an effective treatment of TNBS-induced inflammation, and may be an effective treatment of IBD in humans.</description>

	<description>F-wave test allows the non-invasive assessment of spinal motoneuron excitability. We investigated the difference in spinal motoneuron dysfunction between the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor digit minimi (ADM) muscles by investigating F-waves and to assess the contribution of spinal mechanisms to split-hand syndrome in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Sixty-five consecutive ALS patients and twenty age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled. Motor nerve conduction studies (NCSs) and F-waves were performed bilaterally on median and ulnar nerves in all subjects. HCs revealed prominently longer F-wave latencies, lower chronodispersion, mean F-wave amplitude, mean and maximal F/M amplitude ratio (P &amp;lt; 0.001) in the FDI compared to the ADM. However, no significant differences in almost all F-wave parameters between the FDI and ADM were observed in ALS patients with affected hands except the minimal and mean F-wave latency. These data suggest that excitability is greatly changed in the spinal motoneurons innervating the FDI. Furthermore, the mean F-wave amplitude (r = 0.454, P = 0.002) of the FDI was significantly correlated with the FDI/ADM CMAP amplitude ratio in ALS patients with affected hands but not of the ADM. Our findings suggested that the dysfunction of spinal motoneurons between the FDI and ADM was different in ALS, and spinal motoneuron dysfunction was associated with development of the split-hand phenomenon.</description>

	<description>Big Data promises to advance science through data-driven discovery. However, many standard lab protocols rely on manual examination, which is not feasible for large-scale datasets. Meanwhile, automated approaches lack the accuracy of expert examination. We propose to 1) start with expertly labelled data, 2) amplify labels through web applications that engage citizen scientists, and 3) train machine learning on amplified labels, to emulate the experts. Demonstrating this, we developed a system to quality control brain magnetic resonance images. Expert-labeled data were amplified by citizen scientists through a simple web interface. A deep learning algorithm was then trained to predict data quality, based on citizen scientist labels. Deep learning performed as well as specialized algorithms for quality control (AUC=0.99). Combining citizen science and deep learning can generalize and scale expert decision making; this is particularly important in disciplines where specialized, automated tools do not yet exist.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Theoretical Framework to Derive Simple, Firing-Rate-Dependent Mathematical Models of Synaptic Plasticity</title>

	<description>Synaptic plasticity serves as an essential mechanism underlying cognitive processes as learning and memory. For a better understanding detailed theoretical models combine experimental underpinnings of synaptic plasticity and match experimental results. However, these models are mathematically complex impeding the comprehensive investigation of their link to cognitive processes generally executed on the neuronal network level. Here, we derive a mathematical framework enabling the simplification of such detailed models of synaptic plasticity facilitating further mathematical analyses. By this framework we obtain a compact, firing-rate-dependent mathematical formulation, which includes the essential dynamics of the detailed model and, thus, of experimentally verified properties of synaptic plasticity. Amongst others, by testing our framework by abstracting the dynamics of two well-established calcium-dependent synaptic plasticity models, we derived that the synaptic changes depend on the square of the presynaptic firing rate, which is in contrast to previous assumptions. Thus, the here-presented framework enables the derivation of biologically plausible but simple mathematical models of synaptic plasticity allowing to analyze the underlying dependencies of synaptic dynamics from neuronal properties such as the firing rate and to investigate their implications in complex neuronal networks.</description>

	<description>Histological studies of myelin-stained sectioned cadaver brain and in-vivo myelin-weighted magnetic resonance imaging show that the cerebral cortex is organized into cortical areas with generally well-defined boundaries, which have consistent internal patterns of myelination. The process of myelination is largely driven by neural experience, in which the axonal passage of action potentials stimulates neighbouring oligodendrocytes to perform their task. This bootstrapping process, such that the traffic of action potentials facilitates increased traffic, suggests the hypothesis that the specific pattern of myelination (myeloarchitecture) in each cortical area reveals the principal cortical microcircuits required for the function of that area. If this idea is correct, the observable sequential maturation of specific brain areas can provide evidence for models of the stages of cognitive development.</description>

	<description>Parental migration has caused millions of children left behind, especially in China and India. Left behind children (LBC) have a high risk of mental disorders and may present negative life outcomes in the future. However, little is known whether there are cerebral structural alterations in LBC in relative to those with parents. This study is to explore the effect of parental migration on brain maturation by comparing gray matter volume (GMV) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of LBC with well-matched non-LBC. Thirty-eight LBC (21 boys, age=9.60±1.8yrs) and 30 non-LBC (19 boys, age=10.00±1.95yrs) were recruited and underwent brain scans in 3.0 T MR. IQ and other factors including family income, guardians’ educational level and separation time et al., were also acquired. Gray matter volume (GMV) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured for each participant and compared between groups using 2-sample t-tests with atlas-based analysis. Compared to non-LBC, LBC exhibited greater GMV in emotional and cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, and altered FA in bilateral superior occipitofrontal fasciculi and right medial lemniscus (P&amp;lt;0.05, Cohen's d&amp;gt;0.89, corrected for false-discovery rate). The increased GMV in bilateral parahippocampi was negatively correlated with IQ. Other factors including family income, guardians’ educational level and separation time were not associated with these brain changes. Our study provides empirical evidence of altered brain structure in LBC compared to non-LBC, responsible for emotion regulation and processing, which may account for mental disorders and negative life outcome of LBC. Our study suggests that absence of direct biological parental care may impact children's brain development. Therefore, public health efforts may be needed to provide additional academic and social/emotional supports to LBC when their parents migrate to seeking better economic circumstances, which has become increasingly common in developing countries.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Synaptic Failure Differentially Affects Pattern Formation in Heterogenous Networks</title>

	<description>The communication of the neurons is maintained by synapses, which play a crucial role in the functioning of the nervous system. Therefore, synaptic failure may impair information processing in the brain, to the extent of the loss of consciousness, as well as may underlie many neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, a number of studies suggested that anesthetics regulate conscious state by affecting synaptic transmission primarily of network hubs and subsequently reducing the coherence in the network activity. Here, we studied network-wide spatio-temporal patterning in scale-free networks with two types of synaptic failure: activity-dependent and activity-independent. Further, we defined scale-free network structures based on the dominating direction of the connections at the hub neurons: incoming and outgoing. We found that the two structures have significantly different dynamical properties. Moreover, synaptic failure may not only lead to the loss of coherence but, under some conditions, also can facilitate its emergence unintuitively. We showed that this is because activity-dependent synaptic failure homogenizes the activity levels in the network creating a dynamical substrate for the observed coherence increase. Our results indicate that coherence breakdown due to the synaptic failure may not be enough to explain the loss of consciousness, but at the same time can lead to such pathologies as epilepsy.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Large-Area Fluorescence and Electron Microscopic Correlative Imaging With Multibeam Scanning Electron Microscopy</title>

	<description>Recent improvements in correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) technology have led to dramatic improvements in the ability to observe tissues and cells. Fluorescence labeling has been used to visualize the localization of molecules of interest through immunostaining or genetic modification strategies for the identification of the molecular signatures of biological specimens. Newer technologies such as tissue clearing have expanded the field of observation available for fluorescence labeling; however, the area of correlative observation available for electron microscopy remains restricted.
In this study, we developed a large-area CLEM imaging procedure to show specific molecular localization in large-scale electron microscopy (EM) sections of mouse and marmoset brain. Target molecules were labeled with antibodies and sequentially visualized in cryostat sections using fluorescence and gold particles. Fluorescence images were obtained by light microscopy immediately after antibody staining. Immunostained sections were postfixed for EM, and silver-enhanced sections were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in resin. Ultrathin sections for EM were prepared from fully polymerized resin blocks, collected on silicon wafers, and observed by multibeam scanning electron microscopy. Multibeam scanning electron microscopy has made rapid, large-area observation at high resolution possible, paving the way for the analysis of detailed structures using the CLEM approach. Here, we describe detailed methods for large-area CLEM in various tissues of both rodents and primates.</description>

	<description>Long perceived as a primitive and poorly differentiated brain structure, the primate insular cortex recently emerged as a highly evolved, organized and richly connected cortical hub interfacing bodily states with sensorimotor, environmental and limbic activities. This insular interface likely substantiates emotional embodiment and has the potential to have a key role in the interoceptive shaping of cognitive processes, including perceptual awareness. In the present review, we present a novel working model of the insular cortex, based on an accumulation of neuroanatomical and functional evidence obtained essentially in the macaque monkey. This model proposes that interoceptive afferents that represent the ongoing physiological status of all the organs of the body are first being received in the granular dorsal fundus of the insula or “primary interoceptive cortex”, then processed through a series of dysgranular poly-modal “insular stripes”, and finally integrated in anterior agranular areas that serve as an additional sensory platform for visceral functions and as an output stage for efferent autonomic regulation. One of the agranular areas hosts the specialized von Economo and Fork neurons, which could provide a decisive evolutionary advantage for the role of the anterior insula in the autonomic and emotional binding inherent to subjective awareness.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Does Acupuncture Protect Dopamine Neurons in Parkinson's Disease Rodent Model?: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00102</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00102</link>
	<description>Background Acupuncture has been reported to have significant effects in not only alleviating motor function, but also rescuing dopamine neuron deficit of Parkinson’s disease (PD) rodent model. However, systemic analysis of these beneficial effects has yet to be evaluated.
Objective To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of acupuncture in animal models of PD
Methods A literature search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CNKI, RISS, and JJSAM to collect studies that investigated effects of acupuncture on PD. Study quality of each included article was evaluated based on the 10-item checklist modified from CAMARADES. The software RevMan 5.3 was used for the meta-analysis.
Results 42 studies were included and the included studies scored between 2 and 7 points, with a mean of 4.6. Outcome measures include TH level and dopamine content. The result of meta-analysis showed significance of acupuncture for increasing both TH level (33.97, 95% CI: 33.15 ~ 34.79; p &amp;lt; 0.00001) and dopamine content (4.23, 95% CI: 3.53 ~ 4.92; p &amp;lt; 0.00001) compared with the PD control groups. In addition, motor dysfunctions showed in PD animal were also mitigated as a result of acupuncture treatment. 
Conclusions While there are limitations in number and quality of included studies, this study suggests that acupuncture shows the effect of dopamine neuron protection in PD rodent models.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Structural Covariance Reveals Alterations in Control and Salience Network Integrity in Chronic Schizophrenia</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Schizophrenia (SCZ) is recognized as a disorder of distributed brain dysconnectivity. While progress has been made delineating large-scale functional networks in SCZ, little is known about alterations in grey matter integrity of these networks. We used a multivariate approach to identify the structural covariance of the salience, default, motor, visual, fronto-parietal control, and dorsal attention networks: salience, default, motor, visual, fronto-parietal control, and dorsal attention networks. We derived individual scores reflecting covariance in each structural image for a given network. Seed-based multivariate analyses were conducted on structural images in a discovery (n = 90) and replication (n = 74) sample of SCZ patients and healthy controls. We first validated patterns across all networks, consistent with well-established functional connectivity reports. Next, across two SCZ samples, we found reliable and robust reductions in structural integrity of the fronto-parietal control and salience networks, but not default, dorsal attention, motor and sensory networks. Well-powered exploratory analyses failed to identify relationships with symptoms. These findings provide evidence of selective structural decline in associative networks in SCZ. Such decline may be linked with recently identified functional disturbances in associative networks, providing more sensitive multi-modal network-level probes in SCZ. Absence of symptom effects suggests that identified disturbances may underlie a trait-type marker in SCZ.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>We propose a mechanism for myelin plasticity that would complement synaptic plasticity by adjusting conduction velocity for optimal spike-time arrival. In the proposed treadmilling model, myelin sheath thickness is a dynamic balance between the rates of new myelin deposited adjacent to the axon and removal of the outermost layer.</description>

Injury-induced axon degeneration is also observed within the well-studied process of Wallerian degeneration, a complex phenomenon triggered by axon injury to peripheral nerves in mammals. Recent studies have led to the identification of key molecular components of injury-induced axon degeneration. Axon survival factors, such as NMNAT2, act to protect injured axons from degeneration. By contrast, factors such as SARM1, MAPK, and PHR1 act to promote degeneration. The coordinated activity of these factors determines axon fate after injury. Since axon loss is an early feature of neurodegenerative diseases, it is possible that understanding the molecular mechanism of injury-induced degeneration will lead to new treatments for axon loss in neurodegenerative disease. Here, we discuss the critical pathways for injury-induced axon degeneration across species with an emphasis on their interactions in an integrated signaling network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>Detailed behavioral analysis is key to understanding the brain-behavior relationship. Here, we present deep learning-based methods for analysis of behavior imaging data in mice and humans. Specifically, we use three different convolutional neural network architectures and five different behavior tasks in mice and humans and provide detailed instructions for rapid implementation of these methods for the neuroscience community. We provide examples of three dimensional (3D) kinematic analysis in the food pellet reaching task in mice, social behavior analysis in freely moving mice with simultaneous miniscope calcium imaging, and 3D kinematic analysis of reaching and fine hand movements in humans. We demonstrate that the transfer learning approach accelerates the training of the network when using images from these types of behavior video recordings. We also provide code for post-processing of the data after initial analysis with deep learning. Our methods expand the repertoire of available tools using deep learning for behavior analysis by providing detailed instruction on implementation, applications in several behavior tests, and post-processing methods and annotated code for detailed behavior analysis. Moreover, our methods in human motor behavior can be used in the clinic to assess motor function during recovery after an injury such as stroke.</description>

	<description>Unraveling the alterations of the underlying circuits in neurobiological disorders is with no doubt one of the most interesting applications of studying brain oscillatory activity. Sleep and brain oscillatory activity in Down syndrome (DS) is a particularly explored field of study, with early findings in sleep alterations in DS patients. Nowadays it is well accepted the relationship of sleep with cognitive function, due to its implication in processes such as memory consolidation. As well, rhythmic activity of neural networks such as alpha or gamma waves has been related widely to cognition in the last decades. Both sleep and oscillatory activity are tightly related, as the major oscillatory feature of sleep -the slow oscillation (∼1Hz)- shows an exquisite interplay of different forms of rhythmic neuronal activity. Sleep and oscillatory activity in DS has been studied from the mid 20th century, but literature has appeared sporadically in the last decades. From the early descriptive studies, few works reported the differential features of sleep in DS individuals, showing a wide diversity of results. Some studies, addressed network oscillatory activity emerging from external brain circuits of DS individuals, with results related to different frequency bands of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. Even fewer studies have been published in models, but interestingly, some of them focused in the network mechanisms that may explain intellectual disability and cognitive deficits observed in DS. Here, a review is presented that aims to gather the work performed in the field and provide a wide and global view about the diversity of published studies. We aim to highlight the importance of studying network oscillatory activity in mouse models to infer alterations in the underlying circuits related to cognition, such as in intellectual disability. In this direction, we claim alpha and gamma rhythms generated by the cerebral cortex as a tool for evaluating an unbalance between excitation and inhibition in DS, which points out toward an over-inhibited network. Finally, we also aim to situate oscillatory activity as a key phenomenon that may be used as a biomarker for monitoring as well the effect of novel therapeutic strategies.</description>

	<description>The view that different kinds of memory are mediated by dissociable neural systems has received extensive experimental support.  Dissociations between memory systems are usually observed during initial acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval of memory, however increasing evidence also indicates a role for multiple memory systems in extinction behavior.  The present paper reviews a recent series of maze learning experiments that provide evidence for a multiple memory systems approach to extinction learning and memory. Evidence is described indicating that (1) the hippocampus and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) mediate different kinds of extinction learning, (2) the effectiveness of different extinction protocols depends on the kind of memory being extinguished, and (3) whether a neural system is involved in extinction is also determined by the extinction protocol and kind of memory undergoing extinction.  Based on these findings, a novel hypothetical model regarding the role of multiple memory systems in extinction is presented.  In addition, the relevance of this multiple memory systems approach to other learning paradigms involving extinction (i.e. extinction of conditioned fear) and for treating human psychopathologies characterized by maladaptive memories (e.g. drug addiction and relapse) is briefly considered.</description>

	<description>GABAergic interneuron diversity is a key feature in the brain that helps to create different brain activity patterns and behavioral states. Cell type classification schemes—based on anatomical, physiological and molecular features—have provided us with a detailed understanding of the distinct types that constitute this diversity and their contribution to brain function. Over recent years, the utility of single-cell RNAseq has majorly complemented this existing framework, vastly expanding our knowledge base, particularly regarding molecular features. Single-cell gene-expression profiles of tens of thousands of GABAergic cells from many different types are now available. The analysis of these data has shed new lights onto previous classification principles and illuminates a path towards a deeper understanding of molecular hallmarks behind interneuron diversity. A large part of such molecular features are synapse-related. These include ion channels and receptors, as well as key synaptic organizers and trans-synaptic signaling molecules. Increasing evidence suggest that transcriptional and post-transcriptional modifications further diversify these molecules and generate cell type-specific features. Thus, unraveling the cell type-specific nature of gene-isoform expression will be a key in cell type classification. This review discusses progress in the transcriptomic survey of interneurons and insights that have begun to manifest from isoform-level analyses.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Decreased Glycogenolysis by miR-338-3p Promotes Regional Glycogen Accumulation Within the Spinal Cord of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Mice</title>

	<description>Metabolic dysfunction is a hallmark of aging-related neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). But the crosstalk between metabolic alteration and disease progression in ALS is still largely unknown. Glycogen, a branched polymer of glucose residues, is identified as the energy reserve of central nervous system (CNS), where its aberrant accumulation leads to neurodegeneration. Glycogen was reported to be accumulated in both CNS and visceral organs of SOD1G93A mice, a well-known ALS model, and contributes to pathological process of ALS. However, the accumulative patterns and mechanisms are not well elucidated. Here, we provide extensive evidence to show that glycogen accumulated in the lumbar spinal cord of ALS mice along with the disease progression, but not in the motor cortex. This regional accumulation of glycogen was caused by deteriorated glycogenolysis, which was triggered by decreased PYGB (glycogen phosphorylase, brain form). Moreover, miR-338-3p, an elevated miRNA in the spinal cord of SOD1G93A mice, directly targeted PYGB and was responsible for the decreased glycogenolysis and subsequent glycogen accumulation. Our work is helpful for better understanding of metabolic dysfunctions in ALS and provides novel targets for the therapeutic intervention in the future.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Exploring the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer Disease in Basal Forebrain Cholinergic Neurons: Converging Insights From Alternative Hypotheses</title>

	<description>Alzheimer disease (AD) represents an oncoming epidemic that without an effective treatment promises to exact extraordinary financial and emotional burdens. Studies of pathogenesis are essential for defining critical molecular and cellular events and for discovering therapies to prevent or mitigate their effects. Through studies of neuropathology, genetic and cellular and molecular biology recent decades have provided many important insights. Several hypotheses have been suggested. Documentation in the 1980s of selective loss of cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, followed by clinical improvement in those treated with inhibitors of acetylycholinesterase, supported the “cholinergic hypothesis of age-related cognitive dysfunction”. A second hypothesis, prompted by the selective loss of cholinergic neurons and the discovery of central nervous system (CNS) neurotrophic factors, including NGF, prompted the “deficient neurotrophic hypothesis”. The most persuasive hypothesis, the amyloid cascade hypothesis first proposed more than 25 years ago, is supported by a wealth of observations. Genetic studies were exceptionally important, pointing to increased dose of the gene for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in Down syndrome (DS) and a familial AD (FAD) due to duplication of APP and to mutations in APP and in the genes for Presenilin 1 and 2 (PSEN1, 2), which encode the γ-secretase enzyme that processes APP. The “tau hypothesis” noted the prominence of tau-related pathology and its correlation with dementia. Recent interest in induction of microglial activation in the AD brain, as well as other manifestations of inflammation, supports the ‘inflammatory hypothesis” . We place these findings in the context of the selective, but by no means unique, involvement of BFCNs and their trophic dependence on NGF signaling and speculate as to how pathogenesis in these neurons is initiated, amplified and ultimately results in their dysfunction and death. In so doing we attempt to show how the different hypotheses for AD may interact and reinforce one another. Finally, we address current attempts to prevent and/or treat AD in light of advances in understanding pathogenetic mechanisms and suggest that studies in the Down syndrome population may provide unique insights into AD pathogenesis and treatment.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Correlation Between Hippocampus MRI Radiomic Features and Resting-State Intrahippocampal Functional Connectivity in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with main symptoms of chronic primary memory loss and cognitive impairment. The study aim is to investigate the correlation between hippocampal functional connectivity (FC) and MRI radiomic features in AD. A total of 67 AD patients and 44 normal controls (NC) were enrolled in this study. Using one method of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), the whole-brain FC with bilateral hippocampus as seed was performed, and the FC values were extracted from the bilateral hippocampus respectively. We observed that AD patients demonstrated disruptive FC in some brain regions in the left hippocampal functional network, including right gyrus rectus, right anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri, bilateral precuneus, bilateral angular gyrus, and bilateral middle occipital gyrus. In addition, decreased FC was witnessed in some brain regions in the right hippocampal functional network, including bilateral anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri, right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus, and right precentral gyrus. Bilateral hippocampal radiomics features were calculated and selected respectively using A.K software.  Pearson correlation analysis suggested that two gray level run-length matrix (RLM) radiomic features and one gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) radiomic features weakly associated with FC values in the left hippocampus. However, there were no significant correlations between radiomic features and FC values in the right hippocampus. Compared with the NC group, the AD group showed abnormalities of FC level in the bilateral hippocampal functional network. This is a prospective study revealed the correlation between the MRI radiomic features and the rs-fMRI in AD patients.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Cerebral Autoregulation Evidenced by Synchronized Low Frequency Oscillations in Blood Pressure and Resting-State fMRI</title>

	<description>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a widely used technique for mapping the brain’s functional architecture, so delineating the main sources of variance comprising the signal is crucial. Low frequency oscillations (LFO) that are not of neural origin, but which are driven by mechanisms related to cerebral autoregulation (CA), are present in the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal within the rs-fMRI frequency band. In this study we use a MR compatible device (Caretaker, Biopac) to obtain a non-invasive estimate of beat-to-beat mean arterial pressure (MAP) fluctuations concurrently with rs-fMRI at 3T. Healthy adult subjects (n=9; 5 male) completed two 20-minute rs-fMRI scans. MAP fluctuations were decomposed into different frequency scales using a discrete wavelet transform, and oscillations at approximately 0.1Hz show a high degree of spatially structured correlations with matched frequency fMRI fluctuations. On average across subjects, MAP fluctuations at this scale of the wavelet decomposition explain ~ 2.2% of matched frequency fMRI signal variance. Additionally, a simultaneous multi-slice multi-echo acquisition was used to collect 10-minute rs-fMRI at three echo times at 7T in a separate group of healthy adults (n=5; 5 male). Multiple echo times were used to estimate the R2* decay at every time point, and MAP was shown to strongly correlate with this signal, which suggests a purely BOLD (i.e. blood flow related) origin. This study demonstrates that there is a significant component of the BOLD signal that has a systemic physiological origin, and highlights the fact that not all localized BOLD signal changes necessarily reflect blood flow supporting local neural activity. Instead, these data show that a proportion of BOLD signal fluctuations in rs-fMRI are due to localized control of blood flow that is independent of local neural activity, most likely reflecting more general systemic autoregulatory processes. Thus, fMRI is a promising tool for studying flow changes associated with cerebral autoregulation with high spatial resolution.</description>

	<description>Two-photon imaging of fluorescently labelled microglia in vivo provides a direct approach to measure motility of microglial processes as a readout of microglial function that is crucial in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, as well as to understand the neuroinflammatory response to implanted substrates and brain-computer interfaces. In this longitudinal study, we quantified surveilling and photodamage-directed microglial processes motility in both acute and chronic cranial window preparations and compared the motility under isoflurane and ketamine anesthesia to awake condition in the same animal. The isoflurane anesthesia increased the length of surveilling microglial processes in both acute and chronic preparations, while ketamine increased the number of microglial branches in acute preparation only. In chronic (but not acute) preparation, the extension of microglial processes towards the laser-ablated microglial cell was faster under isoflurane (but not ketamine) anesthesia than in awake mice, indicating distinct effects of anesthetics and of preparation type. These data reveal potentiating effects of isoflurane on microglial response to damage, and provide a framework for comparison and optimal selection of experimental conditions for quantitative analysis of microglial function using two-photon microscopy in vivo.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: A Brief History of Simulation Neuroscience</title>

	<description>Our knowledge of the brain has evolved over millennia in philosophical, experimental and theoretical phases. We suggest that the next phase is simulation neuroscience. The main drivers of simulation neuroscience are big data generated at multiple levels of brain organization and the need to integrate these data to trace the causal chain of interactions within and across all these levels. Simulation neuroscience is currently the only methodology for systematically approaching the multiscale brain. In this review, we attempt to reconstruct the deep historical paths leading to simulation neuroscience, from the first observations of the nerve cell to modern efforts to digitally reconstruct and simulate the brain. Neuroscience began with the identification of the neuron as the fundamental unit of brain structure and function and has evolved towards understanding the role of each cell type in the brain, how brain cells are connected to each other, and how the seemingly infinite networks they form give rise to the vast diversity of brain functions. Neuronal mapping is evolving from subjective descriptions of cell types towards objective classes, subclasses and types. Connectivity mapping is evolving from loose topographic maps between brain regions towards dense anatomical and physiological maps of connections between individual genetically distinct neurons. Functional mapping is evolving from psychological and behavioral stereotypes towards a map of behaviors emerging from structural and functional connectomes. We show how industrialization of neuroscience and the resulting large disconnected datasets are generating demand for integrative neuroscience, how the scale of neuronal and connectivity maps is driving digital atlasing and digital reconstruction to piece together the multiple levels of brain organization, and how the complexity of the interactions between molecules, neurons, microcircuits and brain regions is driving brain simulation to understand the interactions in the multiscale brain.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Longitudinal Changes in Diffusion Tensor Imaging Following Mild Traumatic Brain Injury and Correlation With Outcome</title>

	<description>The chronic consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) may contribute to the increased risk for early cognitive decline and dementia, primarily due to the diffusion axonal injury. Previous studies in mild (mTBI) have been controversy in describing the white matter tracts integrity changes occurring at acute and sub-acute post-injury. In the prospective longitudinal study, we aim to investigate the longitudinal changes of white matter using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and their correlations with neuropsychological tests. Thirty-three patients with sub-acute mTBI, 31 matched healthy controls were studied with an extensive imaging and clinical battery. Neuroimaging was obtained within 7 days post-injury for acute scans and repeated at 1 month and 3 month post-injury. Using a region-of-interest-based approach, Tract-Based Spatial Statistics was used to conduct voxel-wise analysis on diffusion changes in mTBI and was compared to those of healthy matched controls, scanned during the same time period and rescanned with a similar interval as that of patients. We found decreased FA values in the left anterior limb of internal capsule (ALIC) and right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) during the 7 days post-injury, which showed longitudinal evidence of recovery following one-month post-injury. Increased FA values in these two tracts at 1 month post-injury was positively associated with better performance on cognitive information processing speed at initial assessment. By contrast, there were also some tracts (right anterior corona radiata, forceps major and body of corpus callosum) exhibiting the continuing loss of integrity sustaining even beyond 3 months, which can predict the persisting post-concussion syndromes. Continuing loss of structural integrity in some tracts may contribute to the persistent post-concussion syndromes in mTBI patients, suggesting certain tracts providing an objective biomarker for tracking the pathological recovery process following mTBI.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Direct Measurements of Abdominal Visceral Fat and Cognitive Impairment in Late Life: Findings From an Autopsy Study</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00109</link>
	<description>Background: The relationship between cognitive impairment and abdominal visceral is controversial. Moreover, all studies so far used imaging studies to evaluate visceral fat and this association has not been described yet using autopsy material, which allows the direct quantification of abdominal fat. We aimed to investigate the association between direct measurements of abdominal visceral fat and cognitive impairment in an autopsy study. 
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we collected information on sociodemographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and cognitive status from subjects aged 50 or older at time of death in a general autopsy service in Brazil. Abdominal visceral fat was obtained in natura by the dissection of perirenal, mesenteric, omental, and mesocolon fat. The associations of total abdominal visceral fat with cognitive impairment [Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score ≥0.5) and CDR-sum of boxes (CDR-SB) were evaluated using logistic regression and negative binomial regression models, respectively. All analyses were adjusted for height, age, sex, education, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke, smoking, alcohol use, and physical inactivity. In addition, we compared the discrimination of visceral fat, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (WC) measurements in predicting cognitive impairment.
Results: We evaluated 234 participants (mean age=71.2±12.9 years old, 59% male). Abdominal visceral fat was inversely associated with cognitive impairment (OR=0.46, CI=0.30; 0.70, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and with CDR-SB scores (β=-0.85, 95% CI=-1.28; -0.43, p&amp;lt;0.0001). When we compared the area under the ROC curve (AUC), visceral fat (AUC=0.754), BMI (AUC=0.729), and WC (AUC=0.720) showed similar discrimination in predicting cognitive impairment (p=0.38).
Conclusion: In an autopsy study, larger amount of directly measured abdominal visceral fat was associated with lower odds of cognitive impairment in older adults.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Transcriptional Dysregulation Study Reveals a Core Network Involving the Progression of Alzheimer's Disease</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00101</link>
	<description>Background: The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is associated with dysregulation at different levels from transcriptome to cellular functioning. Such complexity necessitates investigations of disease etiology to be carried out considering multiple aspects of the disease and the use of independent strategies. The established works more emphasized on the structural organization of gene regulatory network while neglecting the internal regulation changes.

Methods: Applying a strategy different from popularly used co-expression network analysis, this study investigated the transcriptional dysregulations during the transition from normal to disease states. 

Results: 97 genes were predicted as dysregulated genes, which were also associated with clinical outcomes of Alzheimer's disease. Both the co-expression and differential co-expression analysis suggested these genes to be interconnected as a core network and that their regulations were strengthened during the transition to disease states. Functional studies suggested the dysregulated genes to be associated with aging and synaptic function. Further, we checked the evolutionary conservation of the gene co-expression and found that human and mouse brain might have divergent transcriptional co-regulation even when they had conserved gene expression profiles.

Conclusion: Overall, our study reveals a core network of transcriptional dysregulation associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease by affecting the aging and synaptic functions related genes; the gene regulation  is not conserved in the human and mouse brains.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Non-fasting High-Density Lipoprotein Is Associated With White Matter Microstructure in Healthy Older Adults</title>

	<description>A growing body of evidence indicates that biomarkers of cardiovascular risk may be related to cerebral health. However, little is known about the role non-fasting lipoprotein play in assessing age-related declines in a cerebral biomarker sensitive to vascular compromise, white matter (WM) microstructure. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is atheroprotective and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major atherogenic lipoprotein. This study explored the relationships between non-fasting levels of cholesterol and WM microstructure in healthy older adults. A voxelwise and region of interest approach was used to determine the relationship between cholesterol and fractional anisotropy (FA). Participants were 87 older adults between the ages of 59 and 77 (mean age = 65.5 years, SD = 3.9). Results indicated that higher HDL-C was associated with higher FA in diffuse regions of the brain when controlling for age, sex, and body mass index. HDL-C was also positively associated with FA in the corpus callosum and fornix. No relationship was observed between LDL-C and FA. Findings suggest that a modifiable lifestyle variable associated with cardiovascular health may help to preserve cerebral WM.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Newly Developed TV-Based Cognitive Training Games Improve Car Driving Skills, Cognitive Functions, and Mood in Healthy Older Adults: Evidence From a Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00099</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00099</link>
	<description>Background
Cognitive training at a laboratory improves car driving skills of older car drivers. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether cognitive training of other types undertaken at home has beneficial effects on driving skills. Using our developed cognitive training games that work on a TV with a set-top box in a person’s home, we investigated effects of 6-week cognitive training on driving skills which assessed with on-road evaluation (primary outcome) and also check the benefit on cognitive functions and emotional states (secondary outcome) in older people.
Methods
For this double-blinded randomized control trial (RCT), 60 older licensed drivers were assigned randomly to two groups: a cognitive training game for car driving (CTCD) group and an active control cognitive training game (ACT) group. The CTCD, participants played CTCD (processing speed, dual attention, and speed prediction) for 20 min during 5 sessions per week for 6 weeks. The ACT group participants played ACT (select large number, select number from largest to smallest, rock–paper–scissors) for 20 min during 5 sessions per week for 6 weeks. We measured driving skills, several cognitive functions, and emotional states before and after the 6 week intervention period.
Results
Our main results demonstrated that, compared to ACT, CTCD improved driving skills (adjusted p = 0.034). Moreover, compared to ACT, CTCD improved inhibition (stroop, adjusted p = 0.042: reverse Stroop, adjusted p = 0.043) and processing speed performance (symbol search, adjusted p = 0.049; digit symbol coding, (adjusted p = 0.047). It increased vigor–activity mood scores (adjusted p = 0.041) as measured using the Profile of Mood State.
Discussion
This randomized controlled trial first provided scientific evidence related to benefits of 6-week CTCD on driving skills, cognitive functions such as processing speed, inhibition, and vigor–activity mood in healthy older people. Our results suggested cognitive training as a useful tool for improving driving skills of older adults.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Disruption of the Prefrontal Cortex Improves Implicit Contextual Memory-Guided Attention: Combined Behavioral and Electrophysiological Evidence</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Many studies have shown that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays an important role in top-down cognitive control over intentional and deliberate behavior. However, recent studies have reported that DLPFC-mediated top-down control interferes with implicit forms of learning. Here we used continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) combined with electroencephalography to investigate the causal role of DLPFC in implicit contextual memory-guided attention. We aimed to test whether transient disruption of the DLPFC would interfere with implicit learning performance and related electrical brain activity. We applied neuronavigation-guided cTBS to the DLPFC or to the vertex as a control region prior to the performance of an implicit contextual learning task. We found that cTBS applied over the DLPFC significantly improved performance during implicit contextual learning. We also noted that beta-band (13–19 Hz) oscillatory power was reduced at fronto-central channels about 140 to 370 ms after visual stimulus onset in cTBS DLPFC compared with cTBS vertex. Taken together, our results provide evidence that DLPFC-mediated top-down control interferes with contextual memory-guided attention and beta-band oscillatory activity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Stronger Functional Connectivity in the Default Mode and Salience Networks Is Associated With Youthful Memory in Superaging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz071</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz071/5485856?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;“Superagers” are older adults who, despite their advanced age, maintain youthful memory. Previous morphometry studies revealed multiple default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) regions whose cortical thickness is greater in superagers and correlates with memory performance. In this study, we examined the intrinsic functional connectivity within DMN and SN in 41 young (24.5 ± 3.6 years old) and 40 older adults (66.9 ± 5.5 years old). Superaging was defined as youthful performance on a memory recall task, the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Participants underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan and performed a separate visual–verbal recognition memory task. As predicted, within both DMN and SN, superagers had stronger connectivity compared with typical older adults and similar connectivity compared with young adults. Superagers also performed similarly to young adults and better than typical older adults on the recognition task, demonstrating youthful episodic memory that generalized across memory tasks. Stronger connectivity within each network independently predicted better performance on both the CVLT and recognition task in older adults. Variation in intrinsic connectivity explained unique variance in memory performance, above and beyond youthful neuroanatomy. These results extend our understanding of the neural basis of superaging as a model of successful aging.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: No Association of Variants of the NPY-System With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder in Children and Adolescents</title>

	<description>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) causes severe distress and is therefore counted by the WHO as one of the ten most impairing illnesses. There is evidence for a strong genetic under-pinning especially in early onset OCD. Though several genes involved in neurotransmission have been reported as candidates there is still need to identify new pathways. In this study, we focussed on genetic variants of the Neuropetide Y (NPY) system. NPY is one of the most abundant neuropeptides in the human brain with emerging evidence of capacity to modulate stress response, which is of high relevance in OCD. We focussed on tag-SNPs of NPY and its receptor gene NPY1R in a family-based approach. The sample comprised 86 patients (children and adolescents) with early onset OCD with both their biological parents. However, this first study on genetic variants of the NPY-system could not confirm association between the investi-gated SNPs and early onset OCD.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Association Between Connectivity of Hippocampal Sub-Regions and Auditory Verbal Hallucinations in Schizophrenia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00424</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00424</link>
	<description>Background: Hippocampal dysconnectivity has been detected in schizophrenia patients with auditory verbal hallucinations. Neuroanatomical evidence has indicated distinct sub-regions in the hippocampus, but which sub-regions within the hippocampus may emerge dysfunction in the brain network, and the relationship between connection strength and the severity of this debilitating disease have yet to be revealed. Masked independent component analysis (mICA), i.e., ICA restricted to a defined region of interest, can provide insight into observing local functional connectivity in a particular brain region. We aim to map out the sub-regions in the hippocampus with dysconnectivity linked to auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia.
Methods: In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study of schizophrenia patients with (n = 57) and without (n = 83) auditory verbal hallucinations, and 71 healthy controls, we first examined hippocampal connectivity using mICA, and then the correlation between connection metric and clinical severity was generated.
Results: As compared with patients without auditory verbal hallucinations, mICA showed a group of hyper-connections for the left middle part, as well as another group of hypo-connections for the bilateral antero-lateral and right antero-medial parts in patients with auditory verbal hallucinations. Connectivity was linked to the clinical symptoms scores in the sample of patients with auditory verbal hallucinations.
Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that the left middle part is more densely connected, but the bilateral antero-lateral and right antero-medial parts are more sparsely connected in schizophrenia patients with auditory verbal hallucinations. The findings in the present study show proof of precious location in the hippocampus mediating the neural mechanism behind auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Unraveling Diagnostic Biomarkers of Schizophrenia Through Structure-Revealing Fusion of Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Data</title>

	<description>Fusing complementary information from different modalities can lead to the discovery of more accurate diagnostic biomarkers for psychiatric disorders. However, biomarker discovery through data fusion is challenging since it requires extracting interpretable and reproducible patterns from data sets, consisting of shared/unshared patterns and of different orders. For example, multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals from multiple subjects can be represented as a third-order tensor with modes: subject, time, and channel, while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data may be in the form of subject by voxel matrices. Traditional data fusion methods rearrange higher-order tensors, such as EEG, as matrices to use matrix factorization-based approaches. In contrast, fusion methods based on coupled matrix and tensor factorizations (CMTF) exploit the potential multi-way structure of higher-order tensors. The CMTF approach has been shown to capture underlying patterns more accurately without imposing strong constraints on the latent neural patterns, i.e., biomarkers. In this paper, EEG, fMRI and structural MRI (sMRI) data collected during an auditory oddball task (AOD) from a group of subjects consisting of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls, are arranged as matrices and higher-order tensors coupled along the subject mode, and jointly analyzed using structure-revealing CMTF methods (also known as advanced CMTF (ACMTF)) focusing on unique identification of underlying patterns in the presence of shared/unshared patterns. We demonstrate that joint analysis of the EEG tensor and fMRI matrix using ACMTF reveals significant and biologically meaningful components in terms of differentiating between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls while also providing spatial patterns with high resolution and improving the clustering performance compared to the analysis of only the EEG tensor. We also show that these patterns are reproducible, and study reproducibility for different model parameters. In comparison to the joint independent component analysis (jICA) data fusion approach, ACMTF provides easier interpretation of EEG data by revealing a single summary map of the topography for each component. Furthermore, fusion of sMRI data with EEG and fMRI through an ACMTF model provides structural patterns; however, we also show that when fusing data sets from multiple modalities, hence of very different nature, preprocessing plays a crucial role.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: A Regression-Based Framework for Quantitative Assessment of Muscle Spasticity Using Combined EMG and Inertial Data From Wearable Sensors</title>

	<description>There have always been practical demands for objective and accurate assessment of muscle spasticity beyond its clinical routine. A novel regression-based framework for quantitative assessment of muscle spasticity is proposed in this paper using wearable surface electromyogram (EMG) and inertial sensors combined with a simple examination procedure. Sixteen subjects with elbow flexor or extensor (i.e., biceps brachii muscle or triceps brachii muscle) spasticity and eight healthy subjects were recruited for the study. The sEMG and inertial data were recorded from each subject when a series of passive elbow stretches with different stretch velocities were conducted. In the proposed framework, both lambda model and kinematic model were constructed from the recorded data, and biomarkers were extracted respectively from the two models to describe the neurogenic component and biomechanical component of the muscle spasticity, respectively. Subsequently, three evaluation methods using supervised machine learning algorithms including single-/multi-variable linear regression and support vector regression (SVR) were applied to calibrate biomarkers from each single model or combination of two models into evaluation scores. Each of these evaluation scores can be regarded as a prediction of the modified Ashworth scale (MAS) grades for spasticity assessment with the same meaning and clinical interpretation. In order to validate performance of three proposed methods within the framework, a 24-fold leave-one-out cross validation was conducted for each of all subjects. Both methods with each individual model achieved satisfactory performance, with low mean square error (MSE, 0.14 and 0.47) between the resultant evaluation score and the MAS. By contrast, the method using SVR to fuse biomarkers from both models outperformed other two methods with the lowest MSE at 0.059. The experimental results demonstrated the usability and feasibility of the proposed framework, and it provides an objective, quantitative and convenient solution to spasticity assessment, suitable for clinical, community and home-based rehabilitation.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Kcnab1 Is Expressed in Subplate Neurons With Unilateral Long-Range Inter-Areal Projections</title>

	<description>Subplate (SP) neurons are among the earliest-born neurons in the cerebral cortex and heterogeneous in terms of gene expression. SP neurons consist mainly of projection neurons, which begin to extend their axons to specific target areas very early during development. However, the relationships between axon projection and gene expression patterns of the SP neurons, and their remnant layer 6b (L6b) neurons, are largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the corticocortical projections of L6b/SP neurons in the mouse cortex and searched for a marker gene expressed in L6b/SP neurons that have ipsilateral inter-areal projections. Retrograde tracing experiments demonstrated that L6b/SP neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) projected to the primary motor cortex (M1) within the same cortical hemisphere at postnatal day (PD) 2 but did not show any callosal projection. This unilateral projection pattern persisted into adulthood. Our microarray analysis identified the gene encoding a β subunit of voltage-gated potassium channel (Kcnab1) as being expressed in L6b/SP. Double labeling with retrograde tracing and in situ hybridization demonstrated that Kcnab1 was expressed in the unilaterally-projecting neurons in L6b/SP. Embryonic expression was specifically detected in the SP as early as embryonic day (E) 14.5, shortly after the emergence of subplate. Double immunostaining experiments revealed different degrees of co-expression of the protein product Kvβ1 with L6b/SP markers Ctgf (88%), Cplx3 (79%), and Nurr1 (58%), suggesting molecular subdivision of unilaterally-projecting L6b/SP neurons. In addition to expression in L6b/SP, scattered expression of Kcnab1 was observed during postnatal stages without layer specificity. Among splicing variants with three alternative first exons, the variant 1.1 explained all the cortical expression mentioned in this study. Together, our data suggest that L6b/SP neurons have corticocortical projections and Kcnab1 expression defines a subpopulation of L6b/SP neurons with a unilateral inter-areal projection.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Glutamine Transporter Slc38a1 Regulates GABAergic Neurotransmission and Synaptic Plasticity</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;GABA signaling sustains fundamental brain functions, from nervous system development to the synchronization of population activity and synaptic plasticity. Despite these pivotal features, molecular determinants underscoring the rapid and cell-autonomous replenishment of the vesicular neurotransmitter GABA and its impact on synaptic plasticity remain elusive. Here, we show that genetic disruption of the glutamine transporter Slc38a1 in mice hampers GABA synthesis, modifies synaptic vesicle morphology in GABAergic presynapses and impairs critical period plasticity. We demonstrate that Slc38a1-mediated glutamine transport regulates vesicular GABA content, induces high-frequency membrane oscillations and shapes cortical processing and plasticity. Taken together, this work shows that Slc38a1 is not merely a transporter accumulating glutamine for metabolic purposes, but a key component regulating several neuronal functions.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sensitive Period for Cognitive Repurposing of Human Visual Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Studies of sensory loss are a model for understanding the functional flexibility of human cortex. In congenital blindness, subsets of visual cortex are recruited during higher-cognitive tasks, such as language and math tasks. Is such dramatic functional repurposing possible throughout the lifespan or restricted to sensitive periods in development? We compared visual cortex function in individuals who lost their vision as adults (after age 17) to congenitally blind and sighted blindfolded adults. Participants took part in resting-state and task-based fMRI scans during which they solved math equations of varying difficulty and judged the meanings of sentences. Blindness at any age caused “visual” cortices to synchronize with specific frontoparietal networks at rest. However, in task-based data, visual cortices showed regional specialization for math and language and load-dependent activity only in congenital blindness. Thus, despite the presence of long-range functional connectivity, cognitive repurposing of human cortex is limited by sensitive periods.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Functional Parcellation of Human Brain Precuneus Using Density-Based Clustering</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz086</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz086/5482328?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The human precuneus is involved in many high-level cognitive functions, which strongly suggests the existence of biologically meaningful subdivisions. However, the functional parcellation of the precuneus needs much to be investigated. In this study, we developed an eigen clustering (EIC) approach for the parcellation using precuneus–cortical functional connectivity from fMRI data of the Human Connectome Project. The EIC approach is robust to noise and can automatically determine the cluster number. It is consistently demonstrated that the human precuneus can be subdivided into six symmetrical and connected parcels. The anterior and posterior precuneus participate in sensorimotor and visual functions, respectively. The central precuneus with four subregions indicates a media role in the interaction of the default mode, dorsal attention, and frontoparietal control networks. The EIC-based functional parcellation is free of the spatial distance constraint and is more functionally coherent than parcellation using typical clustering algorithms. The precuneus subregions had high accordance with cortical morphology and revealed good functional segregation and integration characteristics in functional task-evoked activations. This study may shed new light on the human precuneus function at a delicate level and offer an alternative scheme for human brain parcellation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Differential Contribution of Cortical Thickness, Surface Area, and Gyrification to Fluid and Crystallized Intelligence</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Human intelligence can be broadly subdivided into fluid (g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;) and crystallized (g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;) intelligence, each tapping into distinct cognitive abilities. Although neuroanatomical correlates of intelligence have been previously studied, differential contribution of cortical morphologies to g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; and g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; has not been fully delineated. Here, we tried to disentangle the contribution of cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and cortical gyrification to g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; and g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; in a large sample of healthy young subjects (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 740, Human Connectome Project) with high-resolution MRIs, followed by replication in a separate data set with distinct cognitive measures indexing g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; and g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;. We found that while gyrification in distributed cortical regions had positive association with both g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; and g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;, surface area and thickness showed more regional associations. Specifically, higher performance in g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; was associated with cortical expansion in regions related to working memory, attention, and visuo-spatial processing, while g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; was associated with thinner cortex as well as higher cortical surface area in language-related networks. We discuss the results in a framework where “horizontal” cortical expansion enables higher resource allocation, computational capacity, and functional specificity relevant to g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; and g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;, while lower cortical thickness possibly reflects cortical pruning facilitating “vertical” intracolumnar efficiency in knowledge-based tasks relevant mostly to g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Socioeconomic status (SES) is a multidimensional construct that includes not only measures of material wealth, but also education, social prestige, and neighborhood quality. Socioeconomic correlates between wealth and cognitive functions have been well established in behavioral studies. However, functional and structural brain correlates of SES remain unclear. Here, we sought to uncover the most likely neural regions to be affected by low SES, specifically associated with age. Using effect size–seed-based d Mapping, we compiled studies that examined individuals with low SES and performed functional magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry meta-analyses. The results revealed that as from early to late age, individuals exposed to low SES are less likely to have sustained executive network activity yet a greater likelihood to enhanced activity within reward-related regions. A similar activity was shown for gray matter volume across early to older age. These findings provide the first quantitative integration of neuroimaging results pertaining to the neural basis of SES.

	<description>During development, neural crest (NC) cells are early precursors of several lineages including melanocytes. Along their differentiation from multipotent cells to mature melanocytes, NC cells will go through successive steps which require either proliferative or motile capacities. For example, they will undergo Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in order the separate from the neural tube and migrate to their final location in the epidermis (Larribere &amp;amp; Utikal, 2013; Skrypek, Goossens, De Smedt, Vandamme, &amp;amp; Berx, 2017). The differentiated melanocytes are the cells of origin of melanoma tumors which progress through several stages such as radial growth phase, vertical growth phase, metastasis formation, and often resistance to current therapies. Interestingly, depending on the stage of the disease, melanoma tumor cells share phenotypes with NC cells (proliferative, motile, EMT). These phenotypes are tightly controlled by specific signaling pathways and transcription factors which tend to be reactivated during the onset of melanoma. In this review, we summarize first the main transcription factors which control these common phenotypes. Then, we focus on the existing strategies used to generate human neural crests. Finally we discuss how identification and regulation of neural crest-associated genes provide an additional approach to improving current melanoma targeted therapies.</description>

	<description>In most task and resting state fMRI studies, a group consensus is often sought, where individual variability is considered a nuisance. None the less, biological variability is an important factor that cannot be ignored and is gaining more attention in the field. One recent development is the individual identification based on static functional connectome. While the original work was based on the static connectome, subsequent efforts using recurrent neural networks (RNN) demonstrated that the inclusion of temporal features greatly improved identification accuracy. Given that convolutional RNN (ConvRNN) seamlessly integrates spatial and temporal features, the present work applied ConvRNN for individual identification with resting state fMRI data. Our result demonstrates ConvRNN achieving a higher identification accuracy than conventional RNN, likely due to better extraction of local features between neighboring ROIs. Furthermore, given that each convolutional output assembles in-place features, they provide a natural way for us to visualize the informative spatial pattern and temporal information, opening up a promising new avenue for analyzing fMRI data.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Marked Increases in Resting-State MEG Gamma-Band Activity in Combat-Related Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Combat-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a leading cause of sustained impairments in military service members and veterans. Recent animal studies show that GABA-ergic parvalbumin-positive interneurons are susceptible to brain injury, with damage causing abnormal increases in spontaneous gamma-band (30–80 Hz) activity. We investigated spontaneous gamma activity in individuals with mTBI using high-resolution resting-state magnetoencephalography source imaging. Participants included 25 symptomatic individuals with chronic combat-related blast mTBI and 35 healthy controls with similar combat experiences. Compared with controls, gamma activity was markedly elevated in mTBI participants throughout frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices, whereas gamma activity was reduced in ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Across groups, greater gamma activity correlated with poorer performances on tests of executive functioning and visuospatial processing. Many neurocognitive associations, however, were partly driven by the higher incidence of mTBI participants with both higher gamma activity and poorer cognition, suggesting that expansive upregulation of gamma has negative repercussions for cognition particularly in mTBI. This is the first human study to demonstrate abnormal resting-state gamma activity in mTBI. These novel findings suggest the possibility that abnormal gamma activities may be a proxy for GABA-ergic interneuron dysfunction and a promising neuroimaging marker of insidious mild head injuries.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Intensity Matters: High-intensity Interval Exercise Enhances Motor Cortex Plasticity More Than Moderate Exercise</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;A single bout of cardiovascular exercise can enhance plasticity in human cortex; however, the intensity required for optimal enhancement is debated. We investigated the effect of exercise intensity on motor cortex synaptic plasticity, using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Twenty healthy adults (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 35.10 ± 13.25 years) completed three sessions. Measures of cortico-motor excitability (CME) and inhibition were obtained before and after a 20-min bout of either high-intensity interval exercise, moderate-intensity continuous exercise, or rest, and again after intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS). Results showed that high-intensity interval exercise enhanced iTBS plasticity more than rest, evidenced by increased CME and intracortical facilitation, and reduced intracortical inhibition. In comparison, the effect of moderate-intensity exercise was intermediate between high-intensity exercise and rest. Importantly, analysis of each participant’s plasticity response profile indicated that high-intensity exercise increased the likelihood of a facilitatory response to iTBS. We also established that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val&lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt;Met polymorphism attenuated plasticity responses following high-intensity exercise. These findings suggest that high-intensity interval exercise should be considered not only when planning exercise interventions designed to enhance neuroplasticity, but also to maximize the therapeutic potential of non-invasive brain stimulation. Additionally, genetic profiling may enhance efficacy of exercise interventions for brain health.&lt;/span&gt;</description>
