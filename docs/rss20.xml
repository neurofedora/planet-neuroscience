	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multitasking optimization is a recently introduced paradigm, focused on the
simultaneous solving of multiple optimization problem instances (tasks). The
goal of multitasking environments is to dynamically exploit existing
complementarities and synergies among tasks, helping each other through the
transfer of genetic material. More concretely, Evolutionary Multitasking (EM)
regards to the resolution of multitasking scenarios using concepts inherited
from Evolutionary Computation. EM approaches such as the well-known
Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA) are lately gaining a notable
research momentum when facing with multiple optimization problems. This work is
focused on the application of the recently proposed Multifactorial Cellular
Genetic Algorithm (MFCGA) to the well-known Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem
(CVRP). In overall, 11 different multitasking setups have been built using 12
datasets. The contribution of this research is twofold. On the one hand, it is
the first application of the MFCGA to the Vehicle Routing Problem family of
problems. On the other hand, equally interesting is the second contribution,
which is focused on the quantitative analysis of the positive genetic
transferability among the problem instances. To do that, we provide an
empirical demonstration of the synergies arisen between the different
optimization tasks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The increasing interest in understanding the behavior of the biological
neural networks, and the increasing utilization of artificial neural networks
in different fields and scales, both require a thorough understanding of how
neuromorphic computing works. On the one side, the need to program those
artificial neuron-like elements, and, on the other side, the necessity for a
large number of such elements to cooperate, communicate and compute during
tasks, need to be scrutinized to determine how efficiently conventional
computing can assist in implementing such systems. Some electronic components
bear a surprising resemblance to some biological structures. However, combining
them with components that work using different principles can result in systems
with very poor efficacy. The paper discusses how the conventional principles,
components and thinking about computing limit mimicking the biological systems.
We describe what changes will be necessary in the computing paradigms to get
closer to the marvelously efficient operation of biological neural networks.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Low-Rank Nonlinear Decoding of $\mu$-ECoG from the Primary Auditory Cortex. (arXiv:2005.05053v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper considers the problem of neural decoding from parallel neural
measurements systems such as micro-electrocorticography ($\mu$-ECoG). In
systems with large numbers of array elements at very high sampling rates, the
dimension of the raw measurement data may be large. Learning neural decoders
for this high-dimensional data can be challenging, particularly when the number
of training samples is limited. To address this challenge, this work presents a
novel neural network decoder with a low-rank structure in the first hidden
layer. The low-rank constraints dramatically reduce the number of parameters in
the decoder while still enabling a rich class of nonlinear decoder maps. The
low-rank decoder is illustrated on $\mu$-ECoG data from the primary auditory
cortex (A1) of awake rats. This decoding problem is particularly challenging
due to the complexity of neural responses in the auditory cortex and the
presence of confounding signals in awake animals. It is shown that the proposed
low-rank decoder significantly outperforms models using standard dimensionality
reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA).

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With the wide adoption of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) by
cognitive neuroscience researchers, large volumes of brain imaging data have
been accumulated in recent years. Aggregating these data to derive scientific
insights often faces the challenge that fMRI data are high dimensional,
heterogeneous across people, and noisy. These challenges demand the development
of computational tools that are tailored both for the neuroscience questions
and for the properties of the data. We review a few recently developed
algorithms in various domains of fMRI research: fMRI in naturalistic tasks,
analyzing full-brain functional connectivity, pattern classification, inferring
representational similarity and modeling structured residuals. These algorithms
all solve the challenges in fMRI by resorting to the same solution: they start
from making clear statements of assumptions about neural data and existing
domain knowledge, incorporating those assumptions and domain knowledge into
probabilistic graphical models, and using those models to estimate properties
of interest or latent structures in the data. Such approaches can avoid
erroneous findings, reduce the impact of noise, better utilize known properties
of the data, and aggregate data across groups of subjects. With these
successful cases, we advocate wider adoption of explicit model construction in
cognitive neuroscience. Although we focus on fMRI, the principle illustrated
here is generally applicable to brain data of other modalities.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional neuron models use analog values for information representation
and computation, while all-or-nothing spikes are employed in the spiking ones.
With a more brain-like processing paradigm, spiking neurons are more promising
for improvements on efficiency and computational capability. They extend the
computation of traditional neurons with an additional dimension of time carried
by all-or-nothing spikes. Could one benefit from both the accuracy of analog
values and the time-processing capability of spikes? In this paper, we
introduce a concept of augmented spikes to carry complementary information with
spike coefficients in addition to spike latencies. New augmented spiking neuron
model and synaptic learning rules are proposed to process and learn patterns of
augmented spikes. We provide systematic insight into the properties and
characteristics of our methods, including classification of augmented spike
patterns, learning capacity, construction of causality, feature detection,
robustness and applicability to practical tasks such as acoustic and visual
pattern recognition. The remarkable results highlight the effectiveness and
potential merits of our methods. Importantly, our augmented approaches are
versatile and can be easily generalized to other spike-based systems,
contributing to a potential development for them including neuromorphic
computing.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Fuzzy Mutation Embedded Hybrids of Gravitational Search and Particle Swarm Optimization Methods for Engineering Design Problems. (arXiv:2005.04599v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04599</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04599</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
are nature-inspired, swarm-based optimization algorithms respectively. Though
they have been widely used for single-objective optimization since their
inception, they suffer from premature convergence. Even though the hybrids of
GSA and PSO perform much better, the problem remains. Hence, to solve this
issue we have proposed a fuzzy mutation model for two hybrid versions of PSO
and GSA - Gravitational Particle Swarm (GPS) and PSOGSA. The developed
algorithms are called Mutation based GPS (MGPS) and Mutation based PSOGSA
(MPSOGSA). The mutation operator is based on a fuzzy model where the
probability of mutation has been calculated based on the closeness of particle
to population centroid and improvement in the particle value. We have evaluated
these two new algorithms on 23 benchmark functions of three categories
(unimodal, multi-modal and multi-modal with fixed dimension). The experimental
outcome shows that our proposed model outperforms their corresponding
ancestors, MGPS outperforms GPS 13 out of 23 times (56.52%) and MPSOGSA
outperforms PSOGSA 17 times out of 23 (73.91 %). We have also compared our
results against those of recent optimization algorithms such as Sine Cosine
Algorithm (SCA), Opposition-Based SCA, and Volleyball Premier League Algorithm
(VPL). In addition, we have applied our proposed algorithms on some classic
engineering design problems and the outcomes are satisfactory. The related
codes of the proposed algorithms can be found in this link:

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A Hybrid Swarm and Gravitation based feature selection algorithm for Handwritten Indic Script Classification problem. (arXiv:2005.04596v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In any multi-script environment, handwritten script classification is of
paramount importance before the document images are fed to their respective
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engines. Over the years, this complex
pattern classification problem has been solved by researchers proposing various
feature vectors mostly having large dimension, thereby increasing the
computation complexity of the whole classification model. Feature Selection
(FS) can serve as an intermediate step to reduce the size of the feature
vectors by restricting them only to the essential and relevant features. In our
paper, we have addressed this issue by introducing a new FS algorithm, called
Hybrid Swarm and Gravitation based FS (HSGFS). This algorithm is made to run on
3 feature vectors introduced in the literature recently - Distance-Hough
Transform (DHT), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Modified log-Gabor
(MLG) filter Transform. Three state-of-the-art classifiers namely, Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)
are used for the handwritten script classification. Handwritten datasets,
prepared at block, text-line and word level, consisting of officially
recognized 12 Indic scripts are used for the evaluation of our method. An
average improvement in the range of 2-5 % is achieved in the classification
accuracies by utilizing only about 75-80 % of the original feature vectors on
all three datasets. The proposed methodology also shows better performance when
compared to some popularly used FS models.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Classification accuracy provided by a machine learning model depends a lot on
the feature set used in the learning process. Feature Selection (FS) is an
important and challenging pre-processing technique which helps to identify only
the relevant features from a dataset thereby reducing the feature dimension as
well as improving the classification accuracy at the same time. The binary
version of Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a popular FS technique which
is inspired from the foraging behavior of humpback whales. In this paper, an
embedded version of WOA called Embedded Chaotic Whale Survival Algorithm
(ECWSA) has been proposed which uses its wrapper process to achieve high
classification accuracy and a filter approach to further refine the selected
subset with low computation cost. Chaos has been introduced in the ECWSA to
guide selection of the type of movement followed by the whales while searching
for prey. A fitness-dependent death mechanism has also been introduced in the
system of whales which is inspired from the real-life scenario in which whales
die if they are unable to catch their prey. The proposed method has been
evaluated on 18 well-known UCI datasets and compared with its predecessors as
well as some other popular FS methods.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial behavioral agents are often evaluated based on their consistent
behaviors and performance to take sequential actions in an environment to
maximize some notion of cumulative reward. However, human decision making in
real life usually involves different strategies and behavioral trajectories
that lead to the same empirical outcome. Motivated by clinical literature of a
wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders, we propose here a more
general and flexible parametric framework for sequential decision making that
involves a two-stream reward processing mechanism. We demonstrated that this
framework is flexible and unified enough to incorporate a family of problems
spanning Multi-armed bandits (MAB), contextual bandits (CB) and reinforcement
learning (RL), which decompose the sequential decision making process in
different levels. Inspired by the known reward processing abnormalities of many
mental disorders, our clinically-inspired agents demonstrated interesting
behavioral trajectories and comparable performance on simulated tasks with
particular reward distributions, a real-world dataset capturing human
decision-making in gambling tasks, and the PacMan game across different reward
stationarities in a lifelong learning setting.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning augmented by the representational power of deep neural
networks, has shown promising results on high-dimensional problems, such as
game playing and robotic control. However, the sequential nature of these
problems poses a fundamental challenge for computational efficiency. Recently,
alternative approaches such as evolutionary strategies and deep neuroevolution
demonstrated competitive results with faster training time on distributed CPU
cores. Here, we report record training times (running at about 1 million frames
per second) for Atari 2600 games using deep neuroevolution implemented on
distributed FPGAs. Combined hardware implementation of the game console, image
pre-processing and the neural network in an optimized pipeline, multiplied with
the system level parallelism enabled the acceleration. These results are the
first application demonstration on the IBM Neural Computer, which is a custom
designed system that consists of 432 Xilinx FPGAs interconnected in a 3D mesh
network topology. In addition to high performance, experiments also showed
improvement in accuracy for all games compared to the CPU-implementation of the
same algorithm.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Navigation and mobility are some of the major problems faced by visually
impaired people in their daily lives. Advances in computer vision led to the
proposal of some navigation systems. However, most of them require expensive
and/or heavy hardware. In this paper we propose the use of convolutional neural
networks (CNN), transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning (SSL) to build
a framework aimed at the visually impaired aid. It has low computational costs
and, therefore, may be implemented on current smartphones, without relying on
any additional equipment. The smartphone camera can be used to automatically
take pictures of the path ahead. Then, they will be immediately classified,
providing almost instantaneous feedback to the user. We also propose a dataset
to train the classifiers, including indoor and outdoor situations with
different types of light, floor, and obstacles. Many different CNN
architectures are evaluated as feature extractors and classifiers, by
fine-tuning weights pre-trained on a much larger dataset. The graph-based SSL
method, known as particle competition and cooperation, is also used for
classification, allowing feedback from the user to be incorporated without
retraining the underlying network. 92\% and 80\% classification accuracy is
achieved in the proposed dataset in the best supervised and SSL scenarios,
respectively.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04347</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we use graphics processing units(GPU) to accelerate sparse and
arbitrary structured neural networks. Sparse networks have nodes in the network
that are not fully connected with nodes in preceding and following layers, and
arbitrary structure neural networks have different number of nodes in each
layers. Sparse Neural networks with arbitrary structures are generally created
in the processes like neural network pruning and evolutionary machine learning
strategies. We show that we can gain significant speedup for full activation of
such neural networks using graphical processing units. We do a prepossessing
step to determine dependency groups for all the nodes in a network, and use
that information to guide the progression of activation in the neural network.
Then we compute activation for each nodes in its own separate thread in the
GPU, which allows for massive parallelization. We use CUDA framework to
implement our approach and compare the results of sequential and GPU
implementations. Our results show that the activation of sparse neural networks
lends very well to GPU acceleration and can help speed up machine learning
strategies which generate such networks or other processes that have similar
structure.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tactile sensing is an essential modality for smart robots as it enables them
to interact flexibly with physical objects in their environment. Recent
advancements in electronic skins have led to the development of data-driven
machine learning methods that exploit this important sensory modality. However,
current datasets used to train such algorithms are limited to standard
synchronous tactile sensors. There is a dearth of neuromorphic event-based
tactile datasets, principally due to the scarcity of large-scale event-based
tactile sensors. Having such datasets is crucial for the development and
evaluation of new algorithms that process spatio-temporal event-based data. For
example, evaluating spiking neural networks on conventional frame-based
datasets is considered sub-optimal. Here, we debut a novel neuromorphic Spiking
Tactile MNIST (ST-MNIST) dataset, which comprises handwritten digits obtained
by human participants writing on a neuromorphic tactile sensor array. We also
describe an initial effort to evaluate our ST-MNIST dataset using existing
artificial and spiking neural network models. The classification accuracies
provided herein can serve as performance benchmarks for future work. We
anticipate that our ST-MNIST dataset will be of interest and useful to the
neuromorphic and robotics research communities.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many real-world optimisation problems involve dynamic and stochastic
components. While problems with multiple interacting components are omnipresent
in inherently dynamic domains like supply-chain optimisation and logistics,
most research on dynamic problems focuses on single-component problems. With
this article, we define a number of scenarios based on the Travelling Thief
Problem to enable research on the effect of dynamic changes to sub-components.
Our investigations of 72 scenarios and seven algorithms show that -- depending
on the instance, the magnitude of the change, and the algorithms in the
portfolio -- it is preferable to either restart the optimisation from scratch
or to continue with the previously valid solutions.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: The $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ Genetic Algorithm for Permutations. (arXiv:2004.08664v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08664</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ genetic algorithm is a bright example of an
evolutionary algorithm which was developed based on the insights from
theoretical findings. This algorithm uses crossover, and it was shown to
asymptotically outperform all mutation-based evolutionary algorithms even on
simple problems like OneMax. Subsequently it was studied on a number of other
problems, but all of these were pseudo-Boolean.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aim at improving this situation by proposing an adaptation of the
$(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ genetic algorithm to permutation-based problems. Such
an adaptation is required, because permutations are noticeably different from
bit strings in some key aspects, such as the number of possible mutations and
their mutual dependence. We also present the first runtime analysis of this
algorithm on a permutation-based problem called Ham whose properties resemble
those of OneMax. On this problem, where the simple mutation-based algorithms
have the running time of $\Theta(n^2 \log n)$ for problem size $n$, the
$(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ genetic algorithm finds the optimum in $O(n^2)$ fitness
queries. We augment this analysis with experiments, which show that this
algorithm is also fast in practice.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In 1982 John Hopfield published a neural network model for memory retrieval,
a model that became a cornerstone in theoretical neuroscience. A key ingredient
of the Hopfield model was the use of a network dynamics that is governed by a
Lyapunov function. In a recent paper, Krotov and Hopfield showed how a Lyapunov
function governs a biological plausible learning rule for the neural networks'
connectivity. By doing so, they bring an intriguing approach to classification
tasks, and show the relevance of the broader framework across decades in the
field.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The need for more transparency of the decision-making processes in artificial
neural networks steadily increases driven by their applications in safety
critical and ethically challenging domains such as autonomous driving or
medical diagnostics. We address today's lack of transparency of neural networks
and shed light on the roles of single neurons and groups of neurons within the
network fulfilling a learned task. Inspired by research in the field of
neuroscience, we characterize the learned representations by activation
patterns and network ablations, revealing functional neuron populations that a)
act jointly in response to specific stimuli or b) have similar impact on the
network's performance after being ablated. We find that neither a neuron's
magnitude or selectivity of activation, nor its impact on network performance
are sufficient stand-alone indicators for its importance for the overall task.
We argue that such indicators are essential for future advances in transfer
learning and modern neuroscience.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, increasing works have proposed to drive evolutionary algorithms
using machine learning models. Usually, the performance of such model based
evolutionary algorithms is highly dependent on the training qualities of the
adopted models. Since it usually requires a certain amount of data (i.e. the
candidate solutions generated by the algorithms) for model training, the
performance deteriorates rapidly with the increase of the problem scales, due
to the curse of dimensionality. To address this issue, we propose a
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm driven by the generative adversarial
networks (GANs). At each generation of the proposed algorithm, the parent
solutions are first classified into real and fake samples to train the GANs;
then the offspring solutions are sampled by the trained GANs. Thanks to the
powerful generative ability of the GANs, our proposed algorithm is capable of
generating promising offspring solutions in high-dimensional decision space
with limited training data. The proposed algorithm is tested on 10 benchmark
problems with up to 200 decision variables. Experimental results on these test
problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Segmentation of lesioned brain anatomy with deep volumetric neural networks and multiple spatial priors achieves human-level performance. (arXiv:1905.10010v4 [eess.IV] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Conventional automated segmentation of MRI of the brain and head
distinguishes different tissues based on image intensities and prior tissue
probability maps (TPM). This works well for normal head anatomies, but fails in
the presence of unexpected lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks leverage
instead spatial patterns and can learn to segment lesions, but have thus far
not leveraged prior probabilities. Here we add to a three-dimensional
convolutional network spatial priors with a TPM, morphological priors with
conditional random fields, and context with a wider field-of-view at lower
resolution. We train and test these networks on images of 43 stroke patients
and 4 healthy individuals which have been manually segmented. The analysis
demonstrates the benefits of leveraging the three sources of prior information.
We also provide an out-of-sample validation and clinical application of the
approach on an additional 47 patients with disorders of consciousness.
Importantly, we demonstrate that the new architecture, which we call MultiPrior
network, surpaces the performance of expert human segmenters. We make the code
and trained networks freely available.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Copy mechanism and tailored training for character-based data-to-text generation. (arXiv:1904.11838v4 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, many different methods have been focusing on using
deep recurrent neural networks for natural language generation. The most widely
used sequence-to-sequence neural methods are word-based: as such, they need a
pre-processing step called delexicalization (conversely, relexicalization) to
deal with uncommon or unknown words. These forms of processing, however, give
rise to models that depend on the vocabulary used and are not completely
neural.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we present an end-to-end sequence-to-sequence model with
attention mechanism which reads and generates at a character level, no longer
requiring delexicalization, tokenization, nor even lowercasing. Moreover, since
characters constitute the common &quot;building blocks&quot; of every text, it also
allows a more general approach to text generation, enabling the possibility to
exploit transfer learning for training. These skills are obtained thanks to two
major features: (i) the possibility to alternate between the standard
generation mechanism and a copy one, which allows to directly copy input facts
to produce outputs, and (ii) the use of an original training pipeline that
further improves the quality of the generated texts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also introduce a new dataset called E2E+, designed to highlight the
copying capabilities of character-based models, that is a modified version of
the well-known E2E dataset used in the E2E Challenge. We tested our model
according to five broadly accepted metrics (including the widely used BLEU),
showing that it yields competitive performance with respect to both
character-based and word-based approaches.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Caf\'e Wall illusion is one of a class of tilt illusions where lines that
are parallel appear to be tilted. We demonstrate that a simple Differences of
Gaussian model provides an explanatory mechanism for the illusory tilt
perceived in a family of Caf\'e Wall illusion generalizes to the dashed
versions of Caf\'e Wall. Our explanation models the visual mechanisms in low
level stages and the lateral inhibition of simple cells that can reveal tilt
cues in Geometrical distortion illusions such as Tile illusions particularly
Caf\'e Wall illusions. For this, we simulate the activations of the
retinal/cortical simple cells in responses to these patterns based on a
Classical Receptive Field (CRF) model (referred to as Vis-CRF) to explain tilt
effects in these illusions. Previously, it was assumed that all these visual
experiences of tilt arise from the orientation selectivity properties described
for more complex cortical cells. An estimation of an overall tilt angle
perceived in these illusions is based on the integration of the local tilts
detected by simple cells which is presumed to be a key mechanism utilized by
the complex cells to create our final perception of tilt.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neuronal paradigm of studying the brain has left us with limitations in
both our understanding of how neurons process information to achieve biological
intelligence and how such knowledge may be translated into artificial
intelligence and its most brain-derived branch, neuromorphic computing.
Overturning our fundamental assumptions of how the brain works, the recent
exploration of astrocytes is revealing that these long-neglected brain cells
dynamically regulate learning by interacting with neuronal activity at the
synaptic level. Following recent experimental evidence, we designed an
associative, Hopfield-type, neuronal-astrocytic network and analyzed the
dynamics of the interaction between neurons and astrocytes. We show that
astrocytes were sufficient to trigger transitions between learned memories in
the neuronal component of the network. Further, we mathematically derived the
timing of the transitions that was governed by the dynamics of the
calcium-dependent slow-currents in the astrocytic processes. Overall, we
provide a brain-morphic mechanism for sequence learning that is inspired by,
and aligns with, recent experimental findings. To evaluate our model, we
emulated astrocytic atrophy and showed that memory recall becomes significantly
impaired after a critical point of affected astrocytes was reached. This
brain-inspired and brain-validated approach supports our ongoing efforts to
incorporate non-neuronal computing elements in neuromorphic information
processing.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Pre-exposure to Lower-Level Noise Mitigates Cochlear Synaptic Loss Induced by High-Level Noise</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00025</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00025</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The auditory sensory organs appear to be less damaged by exposure to high-level noise that is presented after exposure to non-traumatizing low-level noise. This phenomenon is known as the toughening or conditioning effect. Functionally, it is manifested by a reduced threshold shift, and morphologically by a reduced hair cell loss. However, it remains unclear whether prior exposure to toughening noise can mitigate the synaptic loss induced by exposure to damaging noise. Since the cochlear afferent synapse between the inner hair cells and primary auditory neurons has been identified as a novel site involved in noise-induced cochlear damage, we were interested in assessing whether this synapse can be toughened. In the present study, the synaptic loss was induced by a damaging noise exposure (106 dB SPL) and compared across Guinea pigs who had and had not been previously exposed to a toughening noise (85 dB SPL). Results revealed that the toughening noise heavily reduced the synaptic loss observed 1 day after exposure to the damaging noise. Although it was significant, the protective effect of the toughening noise on permanent synaptic loss was much smaller. Compared with cases in the control group without noise exposure, coding deficits were seen in both toughened groups, as reflected in the compound action potential (CAP) by signals with amplitude modulation. In general, the pre-exposure to the toughening noise resulted in a significantly reduced synaptic loss by the high-level noise. However, this morphological protection was not accompanied by a robust functional benefit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Modified in situ Hybridization Chain Reaction Using Short Hairpin DNAs</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00075</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The visualization of multiple gene expressions in well-preserved tissues is crucial for the elucidation of physiological and pathological processes. In situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR) is a method to visualize specific mRNAs in diverse organisms by applying a HCR that is an isothermal enzyme-free nucleotide polymerization method using hairpin DNAs. Although in situ HCR is a versatile method, this method is not widely used by researchers because of their higher cost than conventional in situ hybridization (ISH). Here, we redesigned hairpin DNAs so that their lengths were half the length of commonly used hairpin DNAs. We also optimized the conjugated fluorophores and linkers. Modified in situ HCR showed sufficient fluorescent signals to detect various mRNAs such as Penk, Oxtr, Vglut2, Drd1, Drd2, and Moxd1 in mouse neural tissues with a high signal-to-noise ratio. The sensitivity of modified in situ HCR in detecting the Oxtr mRNA was better than that of fluorescent ISH using tyramide signal amplification. Notably, the modified in situ HCR does not require proteinase K treatment so that it enables the preservation of morphological structures and antigenicity. The modified in situ HCR simultaneously detected the distributions of c-Fos immunoreactivity and Vglut2 mRNA, and detected multiple mRNAs with a high signal-noise ratio at subcellular resolution in mouse brains. These results suggest that the modified in situ HCR using short hairpin DNAs is cost-effective and useful for the visualization of multiple mRNAs and proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: α-Synuclein Negatively Regulates Nurr1 Expression Through NF-κB-Related Mechanism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00064</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00064</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The nuclear receptor-related 1 protein (Nurr1) is critical for the development and survival of midbrain dopamine neurons that are predominantly affected and progressively degenerated in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The expression level of Nurr1 has been proposed to be modulated by α-synuclein (α-SYN), an important pathological hallmark of PD. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of α-SYN-Nurr1 interaction are still rarely explored. In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of α-SYN on the transcription level of Nurr1. Our results showed that overexpression of α-SYN (WT or A53T) reduced Nurr1 and its downstream gene expressions. α-SYN neither affected the mRNA stability nor bound with the promoter of Nurr1, but modulated the transcription activity of Nurr1 promoter region ranging from −605 bp to −418 bp, which contains the binding site of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). Moreover, overexpression of α-SYN (WT or A53T) down-regulated NF-κB expression level, thereby inhibiting the transcription factor activity of NF-κB and decreasing the binding quantity of NF-κB with Nurr1 promoter. These findings may give us new insights to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the α-SYN-regulated Nurr1 function, which may fascinate the investigation of dopamine neuron degeneration in PD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00024</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The purpose of this study was to explore the question of the minimal amount of instructional time needed to still be effective by assessing the efficacy at mid-intervention of an early fundamental movement skill (FMS) intervention for preschoolers with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Fourteen preschoolers participated in this randomized controlled trial daily over 10 weeks (10 h total at mid-intervention). A two-factor mixed MANOVA tested the significance of group*time interactions for two dependent variables: object control and locomotor raw scores on the Test of Gross Motor Development—III.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Group*time interactions approached significance with large effect sizes on the vector of both dependent variables and in a univariate fashion on object control scores, but not locomotor scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These findings hold relevance for physical educators working with young children with ASD, indicating that 10 h of FMS instruction, at least in this form, is not adequate to improve FMS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Deep Brain Stimulation of the Medial Septal Nucleus Induces Expression of a Virally Delivered Reporter Gene in Dentate Gyrus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00463</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Mechanisms of deep brain stimulation (DBS) remain controversial, and spatiotemporal control of brain-wide circuits remains elusive. Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have emerged as vehicles for spatiotemporal expression of exogenous transgenes in several tissues, including specific nuclei in the brain. Coupling DBS with viral vectors to modulate exogenous transgene expression remains unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;This study examines whether DBS of the medial septal nucleus (MSN) can regulate gene expression of AAV-transduced neurons in a brain region anatomically remote from the stimulation target: the hippocampal dentate gyrus.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Rats underwent unilateral hippocampal injection of an AAV vector with c-Fos promoter-driven expression of TdTomato (TdT), followed by MSN electrode implantation. Rodents received no stimulation, 7.7 Hz (theta), or 130 Hz (gamma) DBS for 1 h one week after surgery. In a repeat stimulation experiment, rodents received either no stimulation, or two 1 h MSN DBS over 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;No significant differences in hippocampal TdT expression between controls and acute MSN DBS were found. With repeat DBS we found c-Fos protein expression was induced and we could detect increased TdT with either gamma or theta stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that viral vector-mediated gene expression can be regulated spatially and temporally using DBS. Control of gene expression by DBS warrants further investigation into stimulation-responsive promoters for clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Closed-Loop Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation for Real-Time Non-invasive Neuromodulation in vivo</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00445</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00445</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The closed-loop brain stimulation technique plays a key role in neural network information processing and therapies of neurological diseases. Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is an established neuromodulation method for the neural oscillation in animals or human. All available TUS systems provide brain stimulation in an open-loop pattern. In this study, we developed a closed-loop transcranial ultrasound stimulation (CLTUS) system for real-time non-invasive neuromodulation in vivo. We used the CLTUS system to modulate the neural activities of the hippocampus of a wild-type mouse based on the phase of the theta rhythm recorded at the ultrasound-targeted location. In addition, we modulated the hippocampus of a temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) mouse. The ultrasound stimulation increased the absolute power and reduced the relative power of the theta rhythm, which were independent of the specific phase of the theta rhythm. Compared with those of a sham stimulation, the latency of epileptic seizures was significantly increased, while the epileptic seizure duration was significantly decreased under the CLTUS. The above results indicate that the CLTUS can be used to not only modulate the neural oscillation through the theta-phase-specific manipulation of the hippocampus but also effectively inhibit the seizure of a TLE mouse in time. CLTUS has large application potentials for the understanding of the causal relationship of neural circuits as well as for timely, effective, and non-invasive therapies of neurological diseases such as epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Neurorestoration Approach by Biomaterials in Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00431</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke (IS) is the leading cause of disability in the western world, assuming a high socio-economic cost. One of the most used strategies in the last decade has been biomaterials, which have been initially used with a structural support function. They have been perfected, different compounds have been combined, and they have been used together with cell therapy or controlled release chemical compounds. This double function has driven them as potential candidates for the chronic treatment of IS. In fact, the most developed are in different phases of clinical trial. In this review, we will show the ischemic scenario and address the most important criteria to achieve a successful neuroreparation from the point of view of biomaterials. The spontaneous processes that are activated and how to enhance them is one of the keys that contribute to the success of the therapeutic approach. In addition, the different routes of administration and how they affect the design of biomaterials are analyzed. Future perspectives show where this broad scientific field is heading, which advances every day with the help of technology and advanced therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Temperature Measurements in the Vicinity of Human Intracranial EEG Electrodes Exposed to Body-Coil RF for MRI at 1.5T</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00429</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The application of intracranial electroencephalography (icEEG) recording during functional magnetic resonance imaging (icEEG-fMRI) has allowed the study of the hemodynamic correlates of epileptic activity and of the neurophysiological basis of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal. However, the applicability of this technique is affected by data quality issues such as signal drop out in the vicinity of the implanted electrodes. In our center we have limited the technique to a quadrature head transmit and receive RF coil following the results of a safety evaluation. The purpose of this study is to gather further safety-related evidence for performing icEEG-fMRI using a body RF-transmit coil, to allow the greater flexibility afforded by the use of modern, high-density receive arrays, and therefore parallel imaging with benefits such as reduced signal drop-out and distortion artifact. Specifically, we performed a set of empirical temperature measurements on a 1.5T Siemens Avanto MRI scanner with the body RF-transmit coil in a range of electrode and connector cable configurations. The observed RF-induced heating during a high-SAR sequence was maximum in the immediate vicinity of a depth electrode located along the scanner’s central axis (range: 0.2–2.4°C) and below 0.5°C at the other electrodes. Also for the high-SAR sequence, we observed excessive RF-related heating in connection cable configurations that deviate from our recommended setup. For the low-SAR sequence, the maximum observed temperature increase across all configurations was 0.3°C. This provides good evidence to allow simultaneous icEEG-fMRI to be performed utilizing the body transmit coil on the 1.5T Siemens Avanto MRI scanner at our center with acceptable additional risk by following a well-defined protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A Novel Individual Metabolic Brain Network for 18F-FDG PET Imaging</title>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Metabolic brain network analysis based on graph theory using FDG PET imaging is potentially useful for investigating brain activity alternation due to metabolism changes in different stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Most studies on metabolic network construction have been based on group data. Here a novel approach in building an individual metabolic network was proposed to investigate individual metabolic network abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;First, a weighting matrix was calculated based on the interregional effect size difference of mean uptake between a single subject and average normal controls (NCs). Then the weighting matrix for a single subject was multiplied by a group-based connectivity matrix from an NC cohort. To study the performance of the proposed individual metabolic network, inter- and intra-hemispheric connectivity patterns in the groups of NC, sMCI (stable mild cognitive impairment), pMCI (progressive mild cognitive impairment), and AD using the proposed individual metabolic network were constructed and compared with those from the group-based results. The network parameters of global efficiency and clustering coefficient and the network density score (NDS) in the default-mode network (DMN) of generated individual metabolic networks were estimated and compared among the disease groups in AD.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our results show that the intra- and inter-hemispheric connectivity patterns estimated from our individual metabolic network are similar to those from the group-based method. In particular, the key patterns of occipital-parietal and occipital-temporal inter-regional connectivity deficits detected in the groupwise network study for differentiating different disease groups in AD were also found in the individual network. A reduction trend was observed for network parameters of global efficiency and clustering coefficient, and also for the NDS from NC, sMCI, pMCI, and AD. There was no significant difference between NC and sMCI for all network parameters.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We proposed a novel method in constructing the individual metabolic network using a single-subject FDG PET image and a group-based NC connectivity matrix. The result has shown the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed individual metabolic network in differentiating disease groups in AD. Future studies should include investigation of inter-individual variability and the correlation of individual network features to disease severities and clinical performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Importance of the Habenula for Avoidance Learning Including Contextual Cues in the Human Brain: A Preliminary fMRI Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00165</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00165</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human habenula studies are gradually advancing, primarily through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis of passive (Pavlovian) conditioning tasks as well as probabilistic reinforcement learning tasks. However, no studies have particularly targeted aversive prediction errors, despite the essential importance for the habenula in the field. Complicated learned strategies including contextual contents are involved in making aversive prediction errors during the learning process. Therefore, we examined habenula activation during a contextual learning task. We performed fMRI on a group of 19 healthy controls. We assessed the manually traced habenula during negative outcomes during the contextual learning task. The Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II), the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) were also administered. The left and right habenula were activated during aversive outcomes and the activation was associated with aversive prediction errors. There was also a positive correlation between TCI reward dependence scores and habenula activation. Furthermore, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analyses demonstrated the left and right habenula to the left and right hippocampus connections during the presentation of contextual stimuli. These findings serve to highlight the neural mechanisms that may be relevant to understanding the broader relationship between the habenula and learning processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Remote, Automated, and MRI-Compatible Administration of Interoceptive Inspiratory Resistive Loading</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Research on how humans perceive sensory inputs from their bodies (“interoception”) has been rapidly gaining momentum, with interest across a host of disciplines from physiology through to psychiatry. However, studying interoceptive processes is not without significant challenges, and many methods utilized to access internal states have been largely devoted to capturing and relating naturally occurring variations in interoceptive signals (such as heartbeats) to measures of how the brain processes these signals. An alternative procedure involves the controlled perturbation of specific interoceptive axes. This is challenging because it requires non-invasive interventions that can be repeated many times within a subject and that are potent but safe. Here we present an effective methodology for instigating these perturbations within the breathing domain. We describe a custom-built circuitry that is capable of delivering inspiratory resistive loads automatically and precisely. Importantly, our approach is compatible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environments, allowing for the administration of complicated experimental designs in neuroimaging as increasingly required within developing fields such as computational psychiatry/psychosomatics. We describe the experimental setup for both the control and monitoring of the inspiratory resistive loads, and demonstrate its possible utilities within different study designs. This methodology represents an important step forward from the previously utilized, manually controlled resistive loading setups, which present significant experimental burdens with prolonged and/or complicated sequences of breathing stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Systems of coupled dynamical units (e.g., oscillators or neurons) are known to exhibit complex, emergent behaviors that may be simplified through coarse-graining: a process in which one discovers coarse variables and derives equations for their evolution. Such coarse-graining procedures often require extensive experience and/or a deep understanding of the system dynamics. In this paper we present a systematic, data-driven approach to discovering “bespoke” coarse variables based on manifold learning algorithms. We illustrate this methodology with the classic Kuramoto phase oscillator model, and demonstrate how our manifold learning technique can successfully identify a coarse variable that is one-to-one with the established Kuramoto order parameter. We then introduce an extension of our coarse-graining methodology which enables us to learn evolution equations for the discovered coarse variables via an artificial neural network architecture templated on numerical time integrators (initial value solvers). This approach allows us to learn accurate approximations of time derivatives of state variables from sparse flow data, and hence discover useful approximate differential equation descriptions of their dynamic behavior. We demonstrate this capability by learning ODEs that agree with the known analytical expression for the Kuramoto order parameter dynamics at the continuum limit. We then show how this approach can also be used to learn the dynamics of coarse variables discovered through our manifold learning methodology. In both of these examples, we compare the results of our neural network based method to typical finite differences complemented with geometric harmonics. Finally, we present a series of computational examples illustrating how a variation of our manifold learning methodology can be used to discover sets of “effective” parameters, reduced parameter combinations, for multi-parameter models with complex coupling. We conclude with a discussion of possible extensions of this approach, including the possibility of obtaining data-driven effective partial differential equations for coarse-grained neuronal network behavior, as illustrated by the synchronization dynamics of Hodgkin–Huxley type neurons with a Chung-Lu network. Thus, we build an integrated suite of tools for obtaining data-driven coarse variables, data-driven effective parameters, and data-driven coarse-grained equations from detailed observations of networks of oscillators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently DCNN (Deep Convolutional Neural Network) has been advocated as a general and promising modeling approach for neural object representation in primate inferotemporal cortex. In this work, we show that some inherent non-uniqueness problem exists in the DCNN-based modeling of image object representations. This non-uniqueness phenomenon reveals to some extent the theoretical limitation of this general modeling approach, and invites due attention to be taken in practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dopamine Modulates Excitatory Synaptic Transmission by Activating Presynaptic D1-like Dopamine Receptors in the RA Projection Neurons of Zebra Finches</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Songbirds are useful vertebrate study models for vocal learning and memory. The robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) receives synaptic inputs from both the posterior and anterior pathways of the song control system in songbirds. Hence, RA plays an important role in the control of singing. RA receives dopaminergic (DArgic) inputs that increase the excitability of RA projection neurons (PNs). However, the effects of DA on excitatory synaptic transmission are yet to be deciphered. In this study, the effects of DA on the excitatory synaptic transmission of the PNs in the RA of adult male zebra finches were investigated using a whole-cell patch-clamp recording. We observed that DA decreased the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). The effects of DA were mimicked by the D1-like DA receptor (D1R) agonist, SKF-38393, but not the D2-like DA receptor (D2R) agonist, Quinpirole. Also, the effects of DA were blocked by D1R antagonist, SCH-23390, but not the D2R antagonist, Sulpiride. These results demonstrate that DA modulates excitatory synaptic transmission by acting on D1R in the RA of adult male zebra finches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Cytoplasmic TDP43 Binds microRNAs: New Disease Targets in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00117</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, fatal, and incurable neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies suggest that dysregulation of gene expression by microRNAs (miRNAs) may play an important role in ALS pathogenesis. The reversible nature of this dysregulation makes miRNAs attractive pharmacological targets and a potential therapeutic avenue. Under physiological conditions, miRNA biogenesis, which begins in the nucleus and includes further maturation in the cytoplasm, involves trans-activation response element DNA/RNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP43). However, TDP43 mutations or stress trigger TDP43 mislocalization and inclusion formation, a hallmark of most ALS cases, that may lead to aberrant protein/miRNA interactions in the cytoplasm. Herein, we demonstrated that TDP43 exhibits differential binding affinity for select miRNAs, which prompted us to profile miRNAs that preferentially bind cytoplasmic TDP43. Using cellular models expressing TDP43 variants and miRNA profiling analyses, we identified differential levels of 65 cytoplasmic TDP43-associated miRNAs. Of these, approximately 30% exhibited levels that differed by more than 3-fold in the cytoplasmic TDP43 models relative to our control model. The hits included both novel miRNAs and miRNAs previously associated with ALS that potentially regulate several predicted genes and pathways that may be important for pathogenesis. Accordingly, these findings highlight specific miRNAs that may shed light on relevant disease pathways and could represent potential biomarkers and reversible treatment targets for ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Juvenile Social Isolation Enhances the Activity of Inhibitory Neuronal Circuits in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;During brain development, the design of primary neural networks is primarily determined by environmental stimuli after their formation. In particular, the juvenile period is critical, during which neuronal circuits that consist of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons are remodeled by experience. Social isolation during the juvenile period profoundly affects brain development and contributes to the development of psychiatric disorders. We previously reported that 2 weeks of social isolation after weaning reduced excitatory synaptic inputs and intrinsic excitability in a subtype of layer 5 pyramidal cells, which we defined as prominent h-current (PH) cells, in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in mice. However, it remains unclear how juvenile social isolation affects inhibitory neuronal circuits that consist of pyramidal cells and interneurons. We found that 2 weeks of social isolation after weaning increased inhibitory synaptic inputs exclusively onto PH cells with a concomitant deterioration of action potential properties. Although social isolation did not alter the inhibitory synaptic release mechanisms or the number of inhibitory functional synapses on PH cells, we found that it increased the intrinsic excitability of fast-spiking (FS) interneurons with less excitatory synaptic inputs and more h-current. Our findings indicate that juvenile social isolation enhances the activity of inhibitory neuronal circuits in the mPFC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Emerging Roles of Activity-Dependent Alternative Splicing in Homeostatic Plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00104</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00104</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Homeostatic plasticity refers to the ability of neuronal networks to stabilize their activity in the face of external perturbations. Most forms of homeostatic plasticity ultimately depend on changes in the expression or activity of ion channels and synaptic proteins, which may occur at the gene, transcript, or protein level. The most extensively investigated homeostatic mechanisms entail adaptations in protein function or localization following activity-dependent posttranslational modifications. Numerous studies have also highlighted how homeostatic plasticity can be achieved by adjusting local protein translation at synapses or transcription of specific genes in the nucleus. In comparison, little attention has been devoted to whether and how alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNAs underlies some forms of homeostatic plasticity. AS not only expands proteome diversity but also contributes to the spatiotemporal dynamics of mRNA transcripts. Prominent in the brain where it can be regulated by neuronal activity, it is a flexible process, tightly controlled by a multitude of factors. Given its extensive use and versatility in optimizing the function of ion channels and synaptic proteins, we argue that AS is ideally suited to achieve homeostatic control of neuronal output. We support this thesis by reviewing emerging evidence linking AS to various forms of homeostatic plasticity: homeostatic intrinsic plasticity, synaptic scaling, and presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. Further, we highlight the relevance of this connection for brain pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Blocking the LncRNA MALAT1/miR-224-5p/NLRP3 Axis Inhibits the Hippocampal Inflammatory Response in T2DM With OSA</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that diabetes can cause cognitive dysfunction, and cognitive dysfunction in patients with diabetes combined with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is more severe. LncRNAs are known to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with OSA. This study aimed to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of the lncRNA MALAT1/miR-224-5p/NLRP3 axis in T2DM with OSA. qRT-PCR was used to quantify the expression of MALAT1, miR-224-5p, and NLRP3 in brain tissues. NLRP3 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescent labeling. The interaction involving MALAT1, miR-224-5p, and NLRP3 was evaluated by transfection. Western blotting was utilized to evaluate the expression levels of the pathway-related proteins NLRP3, caspase 1, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) both in vitro and in vivo. qRT-PCR was used to assess the mRNA expression levels of NLRP3, caspase 1, TNF-α and IL-1β both in vitro and in vivo. In brain tissues of T2DM with OSA, MALAT1 and NLRP3 were overexpressed, while miR-224-5p was downregulated, which was consistent with subsequent cell experiments. We screened the miRNAs that could bind to MALAT1 and NLRP3 by the StarBase database and the TargetScanMouse7.2 website. Our research showed that among these miRNAs, the level of miR-224-5p was most significantly negatively correlated with the levels of MALAT1 and NLRP3. Also, a firefly luciferase assay showed that miR-224-5p, which is a target of MALAT1, directly reduced the expression of the downstream protein NLRP3. Overexpression of miR-224-5p significantly inhibited the expression levels of NLRP3, caspase 1, TNF-α and IL-1β in vitro. MALAT1 promoted NLRP3 expression by acting as a competing endogenous RNA and sponging miR-224-5p. MiR-224-5p reduces microglial inflammation activation through the regulation of NLRP3 expression, which ultimately affected the NLRP3/IL-1β pathway in the hippocampus. This suggests that miR-224-5p may serve as a potential target for T2DM and OSA therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Exploration of the Molecular Mechanism for Lipoprotein Lipase Expression Variations in SH-SY5Y Cells Exposed to Different Doses of Amyloid-Beta Protein</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00132</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00132</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Progressive accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in the brain is a characteristic pathological change in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We previously found the expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) was increased in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to low-dose Aβ and decreased in cells with high-dose Aβ exposure, but the molecular mechanism is still unclear. Based on previous studies, the opposite regulation of histone deacetylase2 (HDAC2) and HDAC3 on LPL expression probably explain the above molecular mechanism, in which microRNA-29a and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) may be involved. This study further revealed the mechanism of HDAC2 and HDAC3 on conversely regulating LPL expression. The results showed that HDAC2 down-regulated microRNA-29a by decreasing histone acetylation (Ace-H3K9) level in its promoter region, subsequently increasing LPL expression directly or through PPARγ/LPL pathway; HDAC3 decreased LPL expression through inhibiting Ace-H3K9 levels in LPL and PPARγ promoter regions and up-regulating microRNA-29a. This study also found that with increasing concentrations of Aβ in cells, HDAC2 and HDAC3 expression were gradually increased, and Ace-H3K9 levels in LPL and PPARγ promoter region regulated by HDAC3 were decreased correspondingly, while Ace-H3K9 levels in microRNA-29a promoter region modulated by HDAC2 were not decreased gradually but presented a U-shaped trend. These may lead to the results that a U-shaped alteration in microRNA-29a expression, subsequently leading to an inverse U-shaped alteration in PPARγ or LPL expression. In conclusion, HDAC2 and HDAC3 at least partly mediate LPL expression variations in different concentrations of Aβ exposed SH-SY5Y cells, in which microRNA-29a and PPARγ are involved, and the histone acetylation level in microRNA-29a promoter region plays a key role.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Differences in Cerebral Structure Associated With Depressive Symptoms in the Elderly With Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00107</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00107</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by global deterioration in multiple cognitive domains. In addition to cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms are common issues that trouble AD patients. The neuroanatomical basis of depressive symptoms in AD patients has yet to be elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Twenty AD patients and 22 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited for the present study. Depressive symptoms in AD patients and HCs were assessed according to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Anatomical structural differences were assessed between AD patients and HCs using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and surface-based morphometry (SBM). Correlation analyses were conducted to investigate relationships between depressive symptoms and structural altered regions. Multiple pattern analysis using linear support vector machine (SVM) was performed in another independent cohort, which was collected from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data and contained 20 AD patients and 20 HCs, to distinguish AD patients from HCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared with HCs, AD patients exhibited global cerebral atrophy in gray matter volume (GMV) and cortical thickness, including frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, and insular lobes. In addition, insular GMV was negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. Moreover, SVM-based classification achieved an accuracy of 77.5%, a sensitivity of 70%, and a specificity of 85% by leave-one-out cross-validation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: GMV of the insula displayed atrophy among AD patients, which is associated with depressive symptoms. Our observations provide a potential neural substrate for analysis to examine the co-occurrence of AD with depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Maintenance of connective tissue integrity is fundamental to sustain function, requiring protein turnover to repair damaged tissue. However, connective tissue proteome dynamics remain largely undefined, as do differences in turnover rates of individual proteins in the collagen and glycoprotein phases of connective tissue extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we investigate proteome dynamics in the collagen and glycoprotein phases of connective tissues by exploiting the spatially distinct fascicular (collagen-rich) and interfascicular (glycoprotein-rich) ECM phases of tendon. Using isotope labelling, mass spectrometry and bioinformatics, we calculate turnover rates of individual proteins within rat Achilles tendon and its ECM phases. Our results demonstrate complex proteome dynamics in tendon, with ~1000 fold differences in protein turnover rates, and overall faster protein turnover within the glycoprotein-rich interfascicular matrix compared to the collagen-rich fascicular matrix. These data provide insights into the complexity of proteome dynamics in tendon, likely required to maintain tissue homeostasis.</description>

	<description>The cognitive abilities of biological organisms only make sense in the context of their environment. Here, we study longhorn crazy ant collective navigation skills within the context of a semi-natural, randomized environment. Mapping this biological setting into the 'Ant-in-a-Labyrinth' framework which studies physical transport through disordered media allows us to formulate precise links between the statistics of environmental challenges and the ants' collective navigation abilities. We show that, in this environment, the ants use their numbers to collectively extend their sensing range. Although this extension is moderate, it nevertheless allows for extremely fast traversal times that overshadow known physical solutions to the 'Ant-in-a-Labyrinth' problem. To explain this large payoff, we use percolation theory and prove that whenever the labyrinth is solvable, a logarithmically small sensing range suffices for extreme speedup. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential advantages of group living and collective cognition in increasing a species' habitable range.</description>

	<description>Neuronal degeneration in the zebrafish retina stimulates Müller glia (MG) to proliferate and generate multipotent progenitors for retinal repair. Controlling this proliferation is critical to successful regeneration. Previous studies reported that retinal injury stimulates pSmad3 signaling in injury-responsive MG. Contrary to these findings, we report pSmad3 expression is restricted to quiescent MG and suppressed in injury-responsive MG. Our data indicates that Tgfb3 is the ligand responsible for regulating pSmad3 expression. Remarkably, although overexpression of either Tgfb1b or Tgfb3 can stimulate pSmad3 expression in the injured retina, only Tgfb3 inhibits injury-dependent MG proliferation; suggesting the involvement of a non-canonical Tgfb signaling pathway. Furthermore, inhibition of Alk5, PP2A or Notch signaling rescues MG proliferation in Tgfb3 overexpressing zebrafish. Finally, we report that this Tgfb3 signaling pathway is active in zebrafish MG, but not those in mice, which may contribute to the different regenerative capabilities of MG from fish and mammals.</description>

	<description>The 'building-block' model of inositol trisphosphate (IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)-mediated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; liberation posits that cell-wide cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals arise through coordinated activation of localized Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; puffs generated by stationary clusters of IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rs). Here, we revise this hypothesis, applying fluctuation analysis to resolve Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals otherwise obscured during large Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations. We find the rising phase of global Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals is punctuated by a flurry of puffs, which terminate before the peak by a mechanism involving partial ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; depletion. The continuing rise in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and persistence of global signals even when puffs are absent, reveal a second mode of spatiotemporally diffuse Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling. Puffs make only small, transient contributions to global Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals, which are sustained by diffuse release of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; through a functionally distinct process. These two modes of IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; liberation have important implications for downstream signaling, imparting spatial and kinetic specificity to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent effector functions and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport.</description>

	<description>&lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; blood cells, called hemocytes, are classified into plasmatocytes, crystal cells, and lamellocytes based on the expression of a few marker genes and cell morphologies, which are inadequate to classify the complete hemocyte repertoire. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map hemocytes across different inflammatory conditions in larvae. We resolved plasmatocytes into different states based on the expression of genes involved in cell cycle, antimicrobial response, and metabolism together with the identification of intermediate states. Further, we discovered rare subsets within crystal cells and lamellocytes that express fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligand &lt;i&gt;branchless&lt;/i&gt; and receptor &lt;i&gt;breathless&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. We demonstrate that these FGF components are required for mediating effective immune responses against parasitoid wasp eggs, highlighting a novel role for FGF signaling in inter-hemocyte crosstalk. Our scRNA-seq analysis reveals the diversity of hemocytes and provides a rich resource of gene expression profiles for a systems-level understanding of their functions.</description>

	<description>Metabolic pathways and inflammatory processes are under circadian regulation. While rhythmic immune cell recruitment is known to impact infection outcomes, whether the circadian clock modulates immunometabolism remains unclear. We find the molecular clock Bmal1 is induced by inflammatory stimulants, including Ifn-g/lipopolysaccharide (M1) and tumor-conditioned medium, to maintain mitochondrial metabolism under these metabolically stressed conditions in mouse macrophages. Upon M1 stimulation, myeloid-specific &lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt; knockout (M-BKO) renders macrophages unable to sustain mitochondrial function, enhancing succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-mediated mitochondrial ROS production and Hif-1a-dependent metabolic reprogramming and inflammatory damage. In tumor-associated macrophages, the aberrant Hif-1a activation and metabolic dysregulation by M-BKO contribute to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Consequently, M-BKO increases melanoma tumor burden, while administrating an SDH inhibitor dimethyl malonate suppresses tumor growth. Therefore, Bmal1 functions as a metabolic checkpoint integrating macrophage mitochondrial metabolism, redox homeostasis and effector functions. This Bmal1-Hif-1a regulatory loop may provide therapeutic opportunities for inflammatory diseases and immunotherapy.</description>

	<description>Loop extrusion by structural maintenance of chromosomes complexes (SMCs) has been proposed as a mechanism to organize chromatin in interphase and metaphase. However, the requirements for chromatin organization in these cell cycle phases are different, and it is unknown whether loop extrusion dynamics and the complexes that extrude DNA also differ. Here, we used &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; egg extracts to reconstitute and image loop extrusion of single DNA molecules during the cell cycle. We show that loops form in both metaphase and interphase, but with distinct dynamic properties. Condensin extrudes DNA loops non-symmetrically in metaphase, whereas cohesin extrudes loops symmetrically in interphase. Our data show that loop extrusion is a general mechanism underlying DNA organization, with dynamic and structural properties that are biochemically regulated during the cell cycle.</description>

	<description>Alveolar formation increases the surface area for gas-exchange and is key to the physiological function of the lung. Alveolar epithelial cells, myofibroblasts and endothelial cells undergo coordinated morphogenesis to generate epithelial folds (secondary septa) to form alveoli. A mechanistic understanding of alveologenesis remains incomplete. We found that the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway is required in alveolar epithelial cells and myofibroblasts for alveologenesis in mammals. Our studies uncovered a &lt;i&gt;Wnt5a–Ror2–Vangl2&lt;/i&gt; cascade that endows cellular properties and novel mechanisms of alveologenesis. This includes PDGF secretion from alveolar type I and type II cells, cell shape changes of type I cells and migration of myofibroblasts. All these cellular properties are conferred by changes in the cytoskeleton and represent a new facet of PCP function. These results extend our current model of PCP signaling from polarizing a field of epithelial cells to conferring new properties at subcellular levels to regulate collective cell behavior.</description>

	<description>Mammalian articular cartilage is an avascular tissue with poor capacity for spontaneous repair. Here, we show that embryonic development of cartilage in the skate (&lt;i&gt;Leucoraja erinacea&lt;/i&gt;) mirrors that of mammals, with developing chondrocytes co-expressing genes encoding the transcription factors Sox5, Sox6 and Sox9. However, in skate, transcriptional features of developing cartilage persist into adulthood, both in peripheral chondrocytes and in cells of the fibrous perichondrium that ensheaths the skeleton. Using pulse-chase label retention experiments and multiplexed in situ hybridization, we identify a population of cycling &lt;i&gt;Sox5/6/9&lt;/i&gt;+ perichondral progenitor cells that generate new cartilage during adult growth, and we show that persistence of chondrogenesis in adult skates correlates with ability to spontaneously repair cartilage injuries. Skates therefore offer a unique model for adult chondrogenesis and cartilage repair and may serve as inspiration for novel cell-based therapies for skeletal pathologies, such as osteoarthritis.</description>

	<title>eLife: Intelligent classification of platelet aggregates by agonist type</title>

	<description>Platelets are anucleate cells in blood whose principal function is to stop bleeding by forming aggregates for hemostatic reactions. In addition to their participation in physiological hemostasis, platelet aggregates are also involved in pathological thrombosis and play an important role in inflammation, atherosclerosis, and cancer metastasis. The aggregation of platelets is elicited by various agonists, but these platelet aggregates have long been considered indistinguishable and impossible to classify. Here we present an intelligent method for classifying them by agonist type. It is based on a convolutional neural network trained by high-throughput imaging flow cytometry of blood cells to identify and differentiate subtle yet appreciable morphological features of platelet aggregates activated by different types of agonists. The method is a powerful tool for studying the underlying mechanism of platelet aggregation and is expected to open a window on an entirely new class of clinical diagnostics, pharmacometrics, and therapeutics.</description>

	<description>Antimalarial drug resistance has historically arisen through convergent &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; mutations in &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; parasite populations in Southeast Asia and South America. For the past decade in Southeast Asia, artemisinins, the core component of first-line antimalarial therapies, have experienced delayed parasite clearance associated with several &lt;i&gt;pfk13&lt;/i&gt; mutations, primarily C580Y. We report that mutant &lt;i&gt;pfk13&lt;/i&gt; has emerged independently in Guyana, with genome analysis indicating an evolutionary origin distinct from Southeast Asia. &lt;i&gt;Pfk13&lt;/i&gt; C580Y parasites were observed in 1.6% (14/854) of samples collected in Guyana in 2016–2017. Introducing &lt;i&gt;pfk13&lt;/i&gt; C580Y or R539T mutations by gene editing into local parasites conferred high levels of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; artemisinin resistance. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; growth competition assays revealed a fitness cost associated with these &lt;i&gt;pfk13&lt;/i&gt; variants, potentially explaining why these resistance alleles have not increased in frequency more quickly in South America. These data place local malaria control efforts at risk in the Guiana Shield.</description>

The microbiome is a new frontier for building predictors of human phenotypes. However, machine learning in the microbiome is fraught with issues of reproducibility, driven in large part by the wide range of analytic models and metagenomic data types available. We aimed to build robust metagenomic predictors of host phenotype by comparing prediction performances and biological interpretation across 8 machine learning methods and 4 different types of metagenomic data. Using 1,570 samples from 300 infants, we fit 7,865 models for 6 host phenotypes. We demonstrate the dependence of accuracy on algorithm choice and feature definition in microbiome data and propose a framework for building microbiome-derived indicators of host phenotype. We additionally identify biological features predictive of age, sex, breastfeeding status, historical antibiotic usage, country of origin, and delivery type.

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Calibration of individual-based models to epidemiological data: A systematic review</title>

Individual-based models (IBMs) informing public health policy should be calibrated to data and provide estimates of uncertainty. Two main components of model-calibration methods are the parameter-search strategy and the goodness-of-fit (GOF) measure; many options exist for each of these. This review provides an overview of calibration methods used in IBMs modelling infectious disease spread. We identified articles on PubMed employing simulation-based methods to calibrate IBMs informing public health policy in HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria epidemiology published between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2018. Articles were included if models stored individual-specific information, and calibration involved comparing model output to population-level targets. We extracted information on parameter-search strategies, GOF measures, and model validation. The PubMed search identified 653 candidate articles, of which 84 met the review criteria. Of the included articles, 40 (48%) combined a quantitative GOF measure with an algorithmic parameter-search strategy–either an optimisation algorithm (14/40) or a sampling algorithm (26/40). These 40 articles varied widely in their choices of parameter-search strategies and GOF measures. For the remaining 44 (52%) articles, the parameter-search strategy could either not be identified (32/44) or was described as an informal, non-reproducible method (12/44). Of these 44 articles, the majority (25/44) were unclear about the GOF measure used; of the rest, only five quantitatively evaluated GOF. Only a minority of the included articles, 14 (17%) provided a rationale for their choice of model-calibration method. Model validation was reported in 31 (37%) articles. Reporting on calibration methods is far from optimal in epidemiological modelling studies of HIV, malaria and TB transmission dynamics. The adoption of better documented, algorithmic calibration methods could improve both reproducibility and the quality of inference in model-based epidemiology. There is a need for research comparing the performance of calibration methods to inform decisions about the parameter-search strategies and GOF measures.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/M4Jh9Js-NLQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Standard multiscale entropy reflects neural dynamics at mismatched temporal scales: What’s signal irregularity got to do with it?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007885</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Julian Q. Kosciessa, Niels A. Kloosterman, Douglas D. Garrett&lt;/p&gt;

Multiscale Entropy (MSE) is used to characterize the temporal irregularity of neural time series patterns. Due to its’ presumed sensitivity to non-linear signal characteristics, MSE is typically considered a complementary measure of brain dynamics to signal variance and spectral power. However, the divergence between these measures is often unclear in application. Furthermore, it is commonly assumed (yet sparingly verified) that entropy estimated at specific time scales reflects signal irregularity at those precise time scales of brain function. We argue that such assumptions are not tenable. Using simulated and empirical electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 47 younger and 52 older adults, we indicate strong and previously underappreciated associations between MSE and spectral power, and highlight how these links preclude traditional interpretations of MSE time scales. Specifically, we show that the typical definition of temporal patterns via “similarity bounds” biases coarse MSE scales–that are thought to reflect slow dynamics–by high-frequency dynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate that entropy at fine time scales–presumed to indicate fast dynamics–is highly sensitive to broadband spectral power, a measure dominated by low-frequency contributions. Jointly, these issues produce counterintuitive reflections of frequency-specific content on MSE time scales. We emphasize the resulting inferential problems in a conceptual replication of cross-sectional age differences at rest, in which scale-specific entropy age effects could be explained by spectral power differences at mismatched temporal scales. Furthermore, we demonstrate how such problems may be alleviated, resulting in the indication of scale-specific age differences in rhythmic irregularity. By controlling for narrowband contributions, we indicate that spontaneous alpha rhythms during eyes open rest transiently reduce broadband signal irregularity. Finally, we recommend best practices that may better permit a valid estimation and interpretation of neural signal irregularity at time scales of interest.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Gzt1qa0Qd-8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The hopes of precision medicine rely on our capacity to measure various high-throughput genomic information of a patient and to integrate them for personalized diagnosis and adapted treatment. Reaching these ambitious objectives will require the development of efficient tools for the detection of molecular defects at the individual level. Here, we propose a novel method, PenDA, to perform Personalized Differential Analysis at the scale of a single sample. PenDA is based on the local ordering of gene expressions within individual cases and infers the deregulation status of genes in a sample of interest compared to a reference dataset. Based on realistic simulations of RNA-seq data of tumors, we showed that PenDA outcompetes existing approaches with very high specificity and sensitivity and is robust to normalization effects. Applying the method to lung cancer cohorts, we observed that deregulated genes in tumors exhibit a cancer-type-specific commitment towards up- or down-regulation. Based on the individual information of deregulation given by PenDA, we were able to define two new molecular histologies for lung adenocarcinoma cancers strongly correlated to survival. In particular, we identified 37 biomarkers whose up-regulation lead to bad prognosis and that we validated on two independent cohorts. PenDA provides a robust, generic tool to extract personalized deregulation patterns that can then be used for the discovery of therapeutic targets and for personalized diagnosis. An open-access, user-friendly R package is available at https://github.com/bcm-uga/penda.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JD2Xxse9oQ8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Scale free topology as an effective feedback system</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexander Rivkind, Hallel Schreier, Naama Brenner, Omri Barak&lt;/p&gt;

Biological networks are often heterogeneous in their connectivity pattern, with degree distributions featuring a heavy tail of highly connected hubs. The implications of this heterogeneity on dynamical properties are a topic of much interest. Here we show that interpreting topology as a feedback circuit can provide novel insights on dynamics. Based on the observation that in finite networks a small number of hubs have a disproportionate effect on the entire system, we construct an approximation by lumping these nodes into a single effective hub, which acts as a feedback loop with the rest of the nodes. We use this approximation to study dynamics of networks with scale-free degree distributions, focusing on their probability of convergence to fixed points. We find that the approximation preserves convergence statistics over a wide range of settings. Our mapping provides a parametrization of scale free topology which is predictive at the ensemble level and also retains properties of individual realizations. Specifically, outgoing hubs have an organizing role that can drive the network to convergence, in analogy to suppression of chaos by an external drive. In contrast, incoming hubs have no such property, resulting in a marked difference between the behavior of networks with outgoing vs. incoming scale free degree distribution. Combining feedback analysis with mean field theory predicts a transition between convergent and divergent dynamics which is corroborated by numerical simulations. Furthermore, they highlight the effect of a handful of outlying hubs, rather than of the connectivity distribution law as a whole, on network dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KxHqjuTd_Lk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Cellular transplantation is in clinical testing for a number of central nervous system disorders, including spinal cord injury (SCI). One challenge is acute transplanted cell death. To prevent this death, there is a need to both establish when the death occurs and develop approaches to mitigate its effects. Here, using luciferase (luc) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing Schwann cell (SC) transplants in the contused thoracic rat spinal cord 7 d postinjury, we establish via &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; bioluminescent (IVIS) imaging and stereology that cell death occurs prior to 2–3 d postimplantation. We then test an alternative approach to the current paradigm of enhancing transplant survival by including multiple factors along with the cells. To stimulate multiple cellular adaptive pathways concurrently, we activate the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) transcriptional pathway. Retroviral expression of VP16-HIF-1α in SCs increased HIF-α by 5.9-fold and its target genes implicated in oxygen transport and delivery (VEGF, 2.2-fold) and cellular metabolism (enolase, 1.7-fold). In cell death assays &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, HIF-1α protected cells from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced oxidative damage. It also provided some protection against camptothecin-induced DNA damage, but not thapsigargin-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress or tunicamycin-induced unfolded protein response. Following transplantation, VP16-HIF-1α increased SC survival by 34.3%. The increase in cell survival was detectable by stereology, but not by &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; luciferase or &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; GFP IVIS imaging. The results support the hypothesis that activating adaptive cellular pathways enhances transplant survival and identifies an alternative pro-survival approach that, with optimization, could be amenable to clinical translation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;A software tool for synchronization of video with signals would be of broad general use to behavioral neuroscientists. A new program, called &lt;i&gt;neurotic&lt;/i&gt; (NEUROscience Tool for Interactive Characterization), allows users to review and annotate signal data synchronized with video, performs simple initial analyses including signal filtering and spike detection, is easy to use, and supports a variety of file formats. The program also facilitates collaborations by using a portable specification for loading and processing data and retrieving data files from online sources. Two examples are shown in which the software is used to explore experimental datasets with extracellular nerve or muscle recordings and simultaneous video of behavior. The configuration specification for controlling how data are located, loaded, processed, and plotted is also summarized. Algorithms for spike detection and burst detection are demonstrated. This new program could be used in many applications in which behavior and signals need to be analyzed together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Humans have a large capacity of recognition memory (Dudai, 1997), a fundamental property of higher-order brain functions such as abstraction and generalization (Vogt and Magnussen, 2007). Familiarity is the first step towards recognition memory. We have previously demonstrated using unsupervised neural network simulations that familiarity detection of complex patterns emerges in generic cortical microcircuits with bidirectional synaptic plasticity. It is therefore meaningful to conduct similar experiments on biological neuronal networks to validate these results. Studies of learning and memory in dissociated rodent neuronal cultures remain inconclusive to date. Synchronized network bursts (SNBs) that occur spontaneously and periodically have been speculated to be an intervening factor. By optogenetically stimulating cultured cortical networks with random dot movies (RDMs), we were able to reduce the occurrence of SNBs, after which an ability for familiarity detection emerged: previously seen patterns elicited higher firing rates than novel ones. Differences in firing rate were distributed over the entire network, suggesting that familiarity detection is a system level property. We also studied the change in SNB patterns following familiarity encoding. Support vector machine (SVM) classification results indicate that SNBs may be facilitating memory consolidation of the learned pattern. In addition, using a novel network connectivity probing method, we were able to trace the change in synaptic efficacy induced by familiarity encoding, providing insights on the long-term impact of having SNBs in the cultures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many aspects of the geometry of loss functions in deep learning remain
mysterious. In this paper, we work toward a better understanding of the
geometry of the loss function $L$ of overparameterized feedforward neural
networks. In this setting, we identify several components of the critical locus
of $L$ and study their geometric properties. For networks of depth $\ell \geq
4$, we identify a locus of critical points we call the star locus $S$. Within
$S$ we identify a positive-dimensional sublocus $C$ with the property that for
$p \in C$, $p$ is a degenerate critical point, and no existing theoretical
result guarantees that gradient descent will not converge to $p$. For very wide
networks, we build on earlier work and show that all critical points of $L$ are
degenerate, and give lower bounds on the number of zero eigenvalues of the
Hessian at each critical point. For networks that are both deep and very wide,
we compare the growth rates of the zero eigenspaces of the Hessian at all the
different families of critical points that we identify. The results in this
paper provide a starting point to a more quantitative understanding of the
properties of various components of the critical locus of $L$.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Training neural networks for neuromorphic deployment is non-trivial. There
have been a variety of approaches proposed to adapt back-propagation or
back-propagation-like algorithms appropriate for training. Considering that
these networks often have very different performance characteristics than
traditional neural networks, it is often unclear how to set either the network
topology or the hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance. In this work,
we introduce a Bayesian approach for optimizing the hyperparameters of an
algorithm for training binary communication networks that can be deployed to
neuromorphic hardware. We show that by optimizing the hyperparameters on this
algorithm for each dataset, we can achieve improvements in accuracy over the
previous state-of-the-art for this algorithm on each dataset (by up to 15
percent). This jump in performance continues to emphasize the potential when
converting traditional neural networks to binary communication applicable to
neuromorphic hardware.

shown to be capable of online unsupervised clustering. Because it is an online
method, it is readily amenable to streaming realtime applications and is
capable of dynamically adjusting to macro-level input changes. All operations,
both training and inference, are localized and efficient. The paradigm is
implemented as a cognitive column that incorporates five key elements: 1)
temporal coding, 2) an excitatory neuron model for inference, 3)
winner-take-all inhibition, 4) a column architecture that combines excitation
and inhibition, 5) localized training via spike timing de-pendent plasticity
(STDP). These elements are described and discussed, and a prototype column is
given. The prototype column is simulated with a semi-synthetic benchmark and is
shown to have performance characteristics on par with classic k-means.
Simulations reveal the inner operation and capabilities of the column with
emphasis on excitatory neuron response functions and STDP implementations.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically inspired alternative algorithm
to backpropagation (BP) for training neural networks. It applies to RNNs fed by
a static input x that settle to a steady state, such as Hopfield networks. EP
is similar to BP in that in the second phase of training, an error signal
propagates backwards in the layers of the network, but contrary to BP, the
learning rule of EP is spatially local. Nonetheless, EP suffers from two major
limitations. On the one hand, due to its formulation in terms of real-time
dynamics, EP entails long simulation times, which limits its applicability to
practical tasks. On the other hand, the biological plausibility of EP is
limited by the fact that its learning rule is not local in time: the synapse
update is performed after the dynamics of the second phase have converged and
requires information of the first phase that is no longer available physically.
Our work addresses these two issues and aims at widening the spectrum of EP
from standard machine learning models to more bio-realistic neural networks.
First, we propose a discrete-time formulation of EP which enables to simplify
equations, speed up training and extend EP to CNNs. Our CNN model achieves the
best performance ever reported on MNIST with EP. Using the same discrete-time
formulation, we introduce Continual Equilibrium Propagation (C-EP): the weights
of the network are adjusted continually in the second phase of training using
local information in space and time. We show that in the limit of slow changes
of synaptic strengths and small nudging, C-EP is equivalent to BPTT (Theorem
1). We numerically demonstrate Theorem 1 and C-EP training on MNIST and
generalize it to the bio-realistic situation of a neural network with
asymmetric connections between neurons.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a learning algorithm that bridges Machine
Learning and Neuroscience, by computing gradients closely matching those of
Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), but with a learning rule local in space.
Given an input $x$ and associated target $y$, EP proceeds in two phases: in the
first phase neurons evolve freely towards a first steady state; in the second
phase output neurons are nudged towards $y$ until they reach a second steady
state. However, in existing implementations of EP, the learning rule is not
local in time: the weight update is performed after the dynamics of the second
phase have converged and requires information of the first phase that is no
longer available physically. In this work, we propose a version of EP named
Continual Equilibrium Propagation (C-EP) where neuron and synapse dynamics
occur simultaneously throughout the second phase, so that the weight update
becomes local in time. Such a learning rule local both in space and time opens
the possibility of an extremely energy efficient hardware implementation of EP.
We prove theoretically that, provided the learning rates are sufficiently
small, at each time step of the second phase the dynamics of neurons and
synapses follow the gradients of the loss given by BPTT (Theorem 1). We
demonstrate training with C-EP on MNIST and generalize C-EP to neural networks
where neurons are connected by asymmetric connections. We show through
experiments that the more the network updates follows the gradients of BPTT,
the best it performs in terms of training. These results bring EP a step closer
to biology by better complying with hardware constraints while maintaining its
intimate link with backpropagation.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have two key deficiencies, their dependence on
high precision computing and their inability to perform sequential learning,
that is, when a DNN is trained on a first task and the same DNN is trained on
the next task it forgets the first task. This phenomenon of forgetting previous
tasks is also referred to as catastrophic forgetting. On the other hand a
mammalian brain outperforms DNNs in terms of energy efficiency and the ability
to learn sequentially without catastrophically forgetting. Here, we use
bio-inspired Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP)in the feature extraction
layers of the network with instantaneous neurons to extract meaningful
features. In the classification sections of the network we use a modified
synaptic intelligence that we refer to as cost per synapse metric as a
regularizer to immunize the network against catastrophic forgetting in a
Single-Incremental-Task scenario (SIT). In this study, we use MNIST handwritten
digits dataset that was divided into five sub-tasks.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Time Efficiency in Optimization with a Bayesian-Evolutionary Algorithm. (arXiv:2005.04166v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Not all generate-and-test search algorithms are created equal. Bayesian
Optimization (BO) invests a lot of computation time to generate the candidate
solution that best balances the predicted value and the uncertainty given all
previous data, taking increasingly more time as the number of evaluations
performed grows. Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) on the other hand rely on search
heuristics that typically do not depend on all previous data and can be done in
constant time. Both the BO and EA community typically assess their performance
as a function of the number of evaluations. However, this is unfair once we
start to compare the efficiency of these classes of algorithms, as the overhead
times to generate candidate solutions are significantly different. We suggest
to measure the efficiency of generate-and-test search algorithms as the
expected gain in the objective value per unit of computation time spent. We
observe that the preference of an algorithm to be used can change after a
number of function evaluations. We therefore propose a new algorithm, a
combination of Bayesian optimization and an Evolutionary Algorithm, BEA for
short, that starts with BO, then transfers knowledge to an EA, and subsequently
runs the EA. We compare the BEA with BO and the EA. The results show that BEA
outperforms both BO and the EA in terms of time efficiency, and ultimately
leads to better performance on well-known benchmark objective functions with
many local optima. Moreover, we test the three algorithms on nine test cases of
robot learning problems and here again we find that BEA outperforms the other
algorithms.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Systems Biology: Diurnal Patterns of Gene Expression in the Dorsal Vagal Complex and the Central Nucleus of the Amygdala – Non-rhythm-generating Brain Regions</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00375</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Genes that establish the circadian clock have differential expression with respect to solar time in central and peripheral tissues. Here, we find circadian-time-induced differential expression in a large number of genes not associated with circadian rhythms in two brain regions lacking overt circadian function: the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). These regions primarily engage in autonomic, homeostatic, and emotional regulation. However, we find striking diurnal shifts in gene expression in these regions of male Sprague Dawley rats with no obvious patterns that could be attributed to function or region. These findings have implications for the design of gene expression studies as well as for the potential effects of xenobiotics on these regions that regulate autonomic and emotional states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Screening of healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 highlights the role of asymptomatic carriage in COVID-19 transmission</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58728</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58728</link>
	<description>Significant differences exist in the availability of healthcare worker (HCW) SARS-CoV-2 testing between countries, and existing programmes focus on screening symptomatic rather than asymptomatic staff. Over a 3-week period (April 2020), 1,032 asymptomatic HCWs were screened for SARS-CoV-2 in a large UK teaching hospital. Symptomatic staff and symptomatic household contacts were additionally tested. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect viral RNA from a throat+nose self-swab. 3% of HCWs in the &lt;i&gt;asymptomatic screening group&lt;/i&gt; tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 17/30 (57%) were truly asymptomatic/pauci-symptomatic. 12/30 (40%) had experienced symptoms compatible with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) &amp;gt;7 days prior to testing, most self-isolating, returning well. Clusters of HCW infection were discovered on two independent wards. Viral genome sequencing showed that the majority of HCWs had the dominant lineage B∙1. Our data demonstrates the utility of comprehensive screening of HCWs with minimal or no symptoms. This approach will be critical for protecting patients and hospital staff.</description>

	<description>How circuit wiring is specified is a key question in developmental neurobiology. Previously, using the Drosophila motor system as a model, we found the classic temporal transcription factor, Hunchback acts in NB7-1 neuronal stem cells to control how many NB7-1 neuronal progeny form functional synapses on dorsal muscles (Meng et al., 2019). However, it is unknown to what extent control of motor neuron-to-muscle synaptic partnerships is a general feature of temporal transcription factors. Here, we perform additional temporal transcription factor manipulations—prolonging expression of Hunchback in NB3-1, as well as precociously expressing Pdm and Castor in NB7-1. We use confocal microscopy, calcium imaging, and electrophysiology to show that in every manipulation there are permanent alterations in neuromuscular synaptic partnerships. Our data show temporal transcription factors, as a group of molecules, are potent determinants of synaptic partner choice and therefore ultimately control circuit membership.</description>

	<description>Endosomes and lysosomes harbor Rab5 and Rab7 on their surface as key proteins involved in their identity, biogenesis, and fusion. Rab activation requires a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which is Mon1-Ccz1 for Rab7. During endosome maturation, Rab5 is replaced by Rab7, though the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the molecular determinants for Rab conversion &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and reconstitute Rab7 activation with yeast and metazoan proteins. We show (i) that Mon1-Ccz1 is an effector of Rab5, (ii) that membrane-bound Rab5 is the key factor to directly promote Mon1-Ccz1 dependent Rab7 activation and Rab7-dependent membrane fusion, and (iii) that this process is regulated in yeast by the casein kinase Yck3, which phosphorylates Mon1 and blocks Rab5 binding. Our study thus uncovers the minimal feed-forward machinery of the endosomal Rab cascade and a novel regulatory mechanism controlling this pathway.</description>

	<title>eLife: Loss of Ena/VASP interferes with lamellipodium architecture, motility and integrin-dependent adhesion</title>

	<description>Cell migration entails networks and bundles of actin filaments termed lamellipodia and microspikes or filopodia, respectively, as well as focal adhesions, all of which recruit Ena/VASP family members hitherto thought to antagonize efficient cell motility. However, we find these proteins to act as positive regulators of migration in different murine cell lines. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of Ena/VASP proteins reduced lamellipodial actin assembly and perturbed lamellipodial architecture, as evidenced by changed network geometry as well as reduction of filament length and number that was accompanied by abnormal Arp2/3 complex and heterodimeric capping protein accumulation. Loss of Ena/VASP function also abolished the formation of microspikes normally embedded in lamellipodia, but not of filopodia capable of emanating without lamellipodia. Ena/VASP-deficiency also impaired integrin-mediated adhesion accompanied by reduced traction forces exerted through these structures. Our data thus uncover novel Ena/VASP functions of these actin polymerases that are fully consistent with their promotion of cell migration.</description>

	<description>Vesicle fusion is mediated by assembly of SNARE proteins between opposing membranes. While previous work suggested an active role of SNARE transmembrane domains (TMDs) in promoting membrane merger (Dhara et al., 2016), the underlying mechanism remained elusive. Here, we show that naturally-occurring v-SNARE TMD variants differentially regulate fusion pore dynamics in mouse chromaffin cells, indicating TMD flexibility as a mechanistic determinant that facilitates transmitter release from differentially-sized vesicles. Membrane curvature-promoting phospholipids like lysophosphatidylcholine or oleic acid profoundly alter pore expansion and fully rescue the decelerated fusion kinetics of TMD-rigidifying VAMP2 mutants. Thus, v-SNARE TMDs and phospholipids cooperate in supporting membrane curvature at the fusion pore neck. Oppositely, slowing of pore kinetics by the SNARE-regulator complexin-2 withstands the curvature-driven speeding of fusion, indicating that pore evolution is tightly coupled to progressive SNARE complex formation. Collectively, TMD-mediated support of membrane curvature and SNARE force-generated membrane bending promote fusion pore formation and expansion.</description>

	<description>Proximity biotinylation based on &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; BirA enzymes like BioID (BirA*) and TurboID is a key technology for identifying proteins interacting with a target protein in a cell or organism. However, there have been some improvements in the enzymes for that purpose. Here, we demonstrate a novel BirA enzyme, AirID (ancestral BirA for proximity-dependent biotin identification), which was designed &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; using an ancestral enzyme reconstruction algorithm and metagenome data. AirID-fusion proteins like AirID-p53 or AirID-IκBα indicated biotinylation of MDM2 or RelA, respectively, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in cells, respectively. AirID-CRBN showed the pomalidomide-dependent biotinylation of IKZF1 and SALL4 &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. AirID-IκBα biotinylated the endogenous CUL4 and RBX1 in the CRL4&lt;sup&gt;CRBN&lt;/sup&gt; complex based on the streptavidin pull-down assay. LC-MS/MS analysis of cells stably expressing AirID-IκBα showed top-level biotinylation of RelA proteins. These results indicate that AirID is a novel enzyme for analysing protein–protein interactions.</description>

	<description>Weight loss and anorexia are common symptoms in cancer patients that occur prior to initiation of cancer therapy. Inflammation in the brain is a driver of these symptoms, yet cellular sources of neuroinflammation during malignancy are unknown. In a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we observed early and robust myeloid cell infiltration into the brain. Infiltrating immune cells were predominately neutrophils, which accumulated at a unique central nervous system entry portal called the velum interpositum, where they expressed CCR2. Pharmacologic CCR2 blockade and genetic deletion of &lt;i&gt;Ccr2&lt;/i&gt; both resulted in significantly decreased brain-infiltrating myeloid cells as well as attenuated cachexia during PDAC. Lastly, intracerebroventricular blockade of the purinergic receptor P2RX7 during PDAC abolished immune cell recruitment to the brain and attenuated anorexia. Our data demonstrate a novel function for the CCR2/CCL2 axis in recruiting neutrophils to the brain, which drives anorexia and muscle catabolism.</description>

	<description>During dynamic instability, self-assembling microtubules (MTs) stochastically alternate between phases of growth and shrinkage. This process is driven by the presence of two distinct states of MT subunits, GTP- and GDP-bound tubulin dimers, that have different structural properties. Here, we use a combination of analysis and computer simulations to study the mechanical and kinetic regulation of dynamic instability in three-dimensional (3D) self-assembling MTs. Our model quantifies how the 3D structure and kinetics of the distinct states of tubulin dimers determine the mechanical stability of MTs. We further show that dynamic instability is influenced by the presence of quenched disorder in the state of the tubulin subunit as reflected in the fraction of non-hydrolysed tubulin. Our results connect the 3D geometry, kinetics and statistical mechanics of these tubular assemblies within a single framework, and may be applicable to other self-assembled systems where these same processes are at play.</description>

	<description>Herpesviruses acquire their membrane envelopes in the cytoplasm of infected cells via a molecular mechanism that remains unclear. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 proteins pUL7 and pUL51 form a complex required for efficient virus envelopment. We show that interaction between homologues of pUL7 and pUL51 is conserved across human herpesviruses, as is their association with &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-Golgi membranes. We characterized the HSV-1 pUL7:pUL51 complex by solution scattering and chemical crosslinking, revealing a 1:2 complex that can form higher-order oligomers in solution, and we solved the crystal structure of the core pUL7:pUL51 heterodimer. While pUL7 adopts a previously-unseen compact fold, the helix-turn-helix conformation of pUL51 resembles the cellular endosomal complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III component CHMP4B and pUL51 forms ESCRT-III–like filaments, suggesting a direct role for pUL51 in promoting membrane scission during virus assembly. Our results provide a structural framework for understanding the role of the conserved pUL7:pUL51 complex in herpesvirus assembly.</description>

	<description>Chytrids are early-diverging fungi that share features with animals that have been lost in most other fungi. They hold promise as a system to study fungal and animal evolution, but we lack genetic tools for hypothesis testing. Here, we generated transgenic lines of the chytrid &lt;i&gt;Spizellomyces punctatus&lt;/i&gt;, and used fluorescence microscopy to explore chytrid cell biology and development during its life cycle. We show that the chytrid undergoes multiple rounds of synchronous nuclear division, followed by cellularization, to create and release many daughter ‘zoospores’. The zoospores, akin to animal cells, crawl using actin-mediated cell migration. After forming a cell wall, polymerized actin reorganizes into fungal-like cortical patches and cables that extend into hyphal-like structures. Actin perinuclear shells form each cell cycle and polygonal territories emerge during cellularization. This work makes &lt;i&gt;Spizellomyces&lt;/i&gt; a genetically tractable model for comparative cell biology and understanding the evolution of fungi and early eukaryotes.</description>

	<description>Neutrophils are important innate immune cells that tackle invading pathogens with different effector mechanisms. They acquire this antimicrobial potential during their maturation in the bone marrow, where they differentiate from hematopoietic stem cells in a process called granulopoiesis. Mature neutrophils are terminally differentiated and short-lived with a high turnover rate. Here, we show a critical role for linker histone H1 on the differentiation and function of neutrophils using a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen in the human cell line PLB-985. We systematically disrupted expression of somatic H1 subtypes to show that individual H1 subtypes affect PLB-985 maturation in opposite ways. Loss of H1.2 and H1.4 induced an eosinophil-like transcriptional program, thereby negatively regulating the differentiation into the neutrophil lineage. Importantly, H1 subtypes also affect neutrophil differentiation and the eosinophil-directed bias of murine bone marrow stem cells, demonstrating an unexpected subtype-specific role for H1 in granulopoiesis.</description>

In a recent article, Cowan et al. provided evidence for this functional difference and gradient, which is also associated with sleep spindles.</description>

	<description>Exercise has been shown to benefit brain structure and function, particularly in aging populations. However, the mechanisms by which exercise exerts its effects, especially in humans, are not fully understood. This review argues that one reason for this knowledge gap is that exercise likely operates through multiple levels of mechanisms. Furthermore, the mechanisms of exercise may vary depending on factors such as age and health state. We discuss the state of evidence at each of three levels of analysis (molecular/cellular, brain structure/function, and mental states and higher-order behaviors) and highlight consistencies across these levels, inconsistencies within them, and knowledge gaps.</description>

	<description>The mammalian cerebrum performs high level sensory, motor control and cognitive functions through highly specialized cortical networks and subcortical nuclei. Recent surveys of mouse and human brains with single cell transcriptomics and high-throughput imaging technologies have uncovered hundreds of neuronal cell types and a variety of non-neuronal cell types distributed in different brain regions, but the cell-type-specific transcriptional regulatory programs responsible for the unique identity and function of each brain cell type have yet to be elucidated. Here, we probe the accessible chromatin in &amp;gt;800,000 individual nuclei from 45 regions spanning the adult mouse isocortex, olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cerebral nuclei, and use the resulting data to define 491,818 candidate cis regulatory DNA elements in 160 distinct sub-types. We link a significant fraction of them to putative target genes expressed in diverse cerebral cell types and uncover transcriptional regulators involved in a broad spectrum of molecular and cellular pathways in different neuronal and glial cell populations. Our results provide a foundation for comprehensive analysis of gene regulatory programs of the mammalian brain and assist in the interpretation of non-coding risk variants associated with various neurological disease and traits in humans. To facilitate the dissemination of information, we have set up a web portal (http://catlas.org/mousebrain).</description>

	<description>Alterations in mitochondrial fission may contribute to the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimers disease (AD). However, we understand very little about the normal functions of fission, or how fission disruption may interact with AD-associated proteins to modulate pathogenesis. Here we show that loss of the central mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related 1 (Drp1) in CA1 and other forebrain neurons markedly worsens the learning and memory of mice expressing mutant human amyloid-precursor protein (hAPP) in neurons. In cultured neurons, Drp1KO and hAPP converge to produce mitochondrial Ca2+ (mitoCa2+) overload, despite decreasing mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) and cytosolic Ca2+. This mitoCa2+ overload occurs independently of ATP levels. These findings reveal a potential mechanism by which mitochondrial fission protects against hAPP-driven pathology.</description>

	<description>Heterogeneity of Purkinje cells (PCs) that are arranged into discrete longitudinal stripes in the cerebellar cortex is related to the timing of PC generation. To understand the cerebellar compartmental organization, we mapped the PC birthdate (or differentiation timing) in the entire cerebellar cortex. We used the birthdate-tagging system of neurog2-CreER (G2A) mice hybridized with the AldocV strain which clarifies the zebrin (aldolase C) longitudinal striped pattern. The pattern of the birthdate-dependent PC distribution was arranged consistently into longitudinally-oriented stripes throughout almost all lobules except for the nodulus, paraflocculus and flocculus, in which distinct stripes were observed. Boundaries of the PC birthdate stripes were found either in the middle or coincided with that of the zebrin stripes. PCs in each birthdate stripe were born in various periods between embryonic day (E) 10.0 and E 13.5. In the vermis, PCs were chronologically distributed from lateral to medial stripes. In the paravermis, PCs of early birthdates were distributed in the long lateral zebrin-positive stripe (stripe 4+//5+) and the medially neighboring narrow zebrin-negative substripe (3d-//e2-), while PCs of late birthdates were distributed in the rest of all paravermal areas. In the hemisphere, PCs of early and late birthdates were intermingled in the majority of areas. The results indicate that the birthdate of a PC is a partial determinant for the zebrin compartment in which it is located. However, the correlation between the PC birthdate and the zebrin compartmentalization is not simple, and distinct among the vermis, paravermis, hemisphere, nodulus, and flocculus.</description>

	<description>Efficient task performance requires co-ordination of internal cognitive processes by implementing control policies adapted to the dynamic structure of task demands. The cognitive and neural basis of control policy implementation remains poorly characterized, in part because it is typically confounded with implementing new stimulus-response rules. To disambiguate these processes, we asked participants to perform multiple novel variants of a working memory control task. Each variant had a unique, novel sequential trial structure, but all shared common stimulus-response rules, enabling us to test control policy implementation separate from rule learning. Behaviorally, we found evidence for two adaptive processes tied to control policy implementation. One process was reflected in slower responses on the first trial with a novel sequential trial structure, followed by rapid speeding on subsequent trials. A second process was reflected in the diminishing size of the first trial cost as participants accommodated different variants of the task over many blocks. Using fMRI, we observed that the striatum and a cingulo-opercular cortical network increased activity to the first trial, tracking the fast adjustment. This pattern of activity dissociated these regions from a fronto-parietal network including dorsolateral PFC, inferior frontal junction, inferior parietal sulcus, and rostrolateral PFC, which showed a slower decline in activity across trials, mirroring findings in rule implementation studies, but in the absence of rule implementation demands. Our results reveal two adaptive processes underlying the implementation of efficient, generalizable control policies, and suggest a broader account of the role of a cortico-striatal network in control policy implementation.</description>

	<description>Fetal brain MRI has become an important tool for in utero assessment of brain development and disorders. However, quantitative analysis of fetal brain MRI remains difficult, partially due to the limited tools for automated preprocessing and the lack of normative brain templates. In this paper, we proposed an automated pipeline for fetal brain extraction, super-resolution reconstruction, and fetal brain atlasing to quantitatively map in utero fetal brain development during mid-to-late gestation in a Chinese population. First, we designed a U-net convolutional neural network for automated fetal brain extraction, which achieved an average accuracy of 97%. We then generated a developing fetal brain atlas, using an iterative linear and nonlinear registration approach. Based on the 4D spatiotemporal atlas, we quantified the morphological development of the fetal brain between 23-36 weeks of gestation. The proposed pipeline enabled the fully-automated volumetric reconstruction for clinically available fetal brain MRI data, and the 4D fetal brain atlas provided normative templates for quantitative analysis of potential fetal brain abnormalities, especially in the Chinese population.</description>

	<description>Anatomical brain templates are commonly used as references in neurological MRI studies, for bringing data into a common space for group level statistics and coordinate reporting. Having a group representative template increases the accuracy of alignment, improves statistics and decreases distortions (as well as potential biases) in final coordinate reports. Given the inherent variability in brain morphology across age and geography, it is important to have templates that are as representative as possible for both age and population. In this study, we developed and validated a new set of T1w Indian brain templates (IBT) from a large number of subjects (total n=466) across different Indian states and acquired at multiple 3T MRI sites. A new tool in AFNI, make_template_dask.py, which uses the Dask python parallelization library, was created to efficiently make a template from a group of subjects. A total of five age-specific categories of IBTs [ages 6-11 yrs (C1), 12-18 yrs (C2), 19-25 yrs (C3), 26-40 yrs (C4), and 41-60 yrs (C5)], as well as maximum probability map (MPM) atlases for each template were generated; for each age group's template-atlas pair, there is both a population-average and a typical version. Validation experiments on an independent Indian structural and functional MRI dataset show the appropriateness of IBTs for spatial normalization of Indian brains. The results indicate significant structural differences when comparing the IBTs and MNI template, with these differences being maximal along the Anterior-Posterior and Inferior-Superior axes, but minimal Left-Right. For each age group, the MPM brain atlases provide reasonably good representation of the native-space volumes in the IBT space, except in a few regions with high inter-subject variability as indicated by high mean deformation value. These findings provide evidence to support the use of age and population-specific templates in human brain mapping studies. These templates, with corresponding atlases and tools, are publicly available on the NIMHANS and AFNI websites.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Leucine rich repeat transmembrane (LRRTM) proteins are synaptic adhesion molecules with roles in synapse formation and signaling. LRRTM4 was found to reside at rod bipolar cell (BC) dendritic tips, where it colocalized with the transduction channel protein, TRPM1. LRRTM4 was not detected at dendritic tips of ON‐cone BCs. Following somatic knockout of LRRTM4 in BCs by subretinal injection and electroporation of CRISPR/Cas9, LRRTM4 was abolished or reduced in the dendritic tips of transfected cells. Knockout cells had a normal complement of TRPM1 at their dendritic tips, while GPR179 accumulation was partially reduced. In experiments with heterologously expressed protein, the extracellular domain of LRRTM4 was found to engage in heparan‐sulfate dependent binding with pikachurin. These results implicate LRRTM4 in the GPR179‐pikachurin‐dystroglycan transsynaptic complex at rod synapses.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leucine rich repeat transmembrane (LRRTM) proteins are synaptic adhesion molecules with roles in synapse formation and signaling. LRRTM4 transcripts were previously shown to be enriched in rod bipolar cells (BCs), secondary neurons of the retina that form synapses with rod photoreceptors. Using two different antibodies, LRRTM4 was found to reside primarily at rod BC dendritic tips, where it colocalized with the transduction channel protein, TRPM1. LRRTM4 was not detected at dendritic tips of ON‐cone BCs. Following somatic knockout of LRRTM4 in BCs by subretinal injection and electroporation of CRISPR/Cas9, LRRTM4 was abolished or reduced in the dendritic tips of transfected cells. Knockout cells had a normal complement of TRPM1 at their dendritic tips, while GPR179 accumulation was partially reduced. In experiments with heterologously expressed protein, the extracellular domain of LRRTM4 was found to engage in heparan‐sulfate dependent binding with pikachurin. These results implicate LRRTM4 in the GPR179‐pikachurin‐dystroglycan transsynaptic complex at rod synapses.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Changes in the actin cytoskeleton are a primary mechanism mediating the morphological and functional plasticity that underlies learning and memory. The synaptic RhoGEFs Kalirin and Trio have emerged as central regulators of actin dynamics at the synapse. The increased attention surrounding Kalirin and Trio stems from the growing evidence for their roles in the etiology of a wide range of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we discuss recent findings revealing the unique and diverse functions of these paralog proteins in neurodevelopment, excitatory synaptic transmission, and plasticity.</description>

	<description>Pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a prefrontal region involved in processing the affective components of pain, display hyperexcitability in chronic neuropathic conditions and their silencing abolishes hyperalgesia in rodents. We show here that dopamine, through D1-like receptor signaling, inhibits layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of mouse ACC. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels control the firing activity of these pyramidal neurons. Through Gs-coupled D1-like receptors, dopamine induces the opening of HCN channels at physiological membrane potentials, driving a significant decrease in input resistance and excitability. Systemic L-DOPA rescues HCN channel activity, pyramidal excitability in ACC as well as sensory phenotype in neuropathic mice while microinjection of a selective D1-like agonist in ACC induces relief of ongoing pain in neuropathic animals. We conclude that decreased dopaminergic inhibition in ACC plays a critical role in an abnormal top-down modulation leading to neuropathic pain.</description>

	<description>Adult cognitive neuroscience has guided the study of human brain development by identifying regions associated with cognitive functions at maturity. The activity, connectivity, and structure of a region can be compared across ages to characterize the developmental trajectory of the corresponding function. However, observed developmental differences may not only reflect the maturation of the function but also its organization across the brain. That is, a function may be mature in children but supported by different brain regions and thus underestimated by focusing on adult regions. To test these possibilities, we investigated the presence, maturity, and localization of adult functions in children using probabilistic shared response modeling, a machine learning approach for functional alignment. After learning a lower-dimensional feature space from fMRI activity as adults watched a movie, we translated these shared features into the anatomical brain space of children 3--12 years old. To evaluate functional maturity, we correlated this reconstructed activity with the children's actual fMRI activity as they watched the same movie. We found reliable correlations throughout cortex, even in the youngest children. The strength of the correlation in the precuneus, inferior frontal gyrus, and lateral occipital cortex increased over development and predicted chronological age. These age-related changes were driven by three types of developmental trajectories across distinct features of adult function: emergence from absence to presence, consistency in anatomical expression, and reorganization from one anatomical region to another. This data-driven approach to studying brain-wide function during naturalistic perception provides an abstract description of cognitive development throughout childhood.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Somatostatin receptor subtypes 1 and 4 redundantly regulate neprilysin, the major amyloid beta-degrading enzyme, in brain</title>

	<description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains are characterized by increased levels of the pathogenic amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, which accumulates into extracellular plaques. Finding a way to lower Abeta levels is fundamental for the prevention and treatment of AD. Neprilysin is the major Abeta-degrading enzyme which is regulated by the neuropeptide somatostatin. Here we used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to identify the subtype specificity of the five somatostatin receptors (SSTs) expressed in the brain, involved in the regulation of neprilysin. Using a battery of Sst double knockout (dKO) mice we show that neprilysin is regulated by SST1 and SST4 in a redundant manner. Sst1 and Sst4 dKO mice exhibit a specific decrease of presynaptic neprilysin in the Lacunosum molecular layer. Moreover, a genetic deficiency of Sst1 and Sst4 in amyloid beta precursor protein (App) knock-in mice, an AD mouse model, aggravates the Abeta pathology in the hippocampus. As a first proof of concept towards an Abeta-lowering strategy involving neprilysin, we demonstrate that treatment with an agonist selective for SST1 and SST4 ameliorates the Abeta pathology and improves cognition in the App knock-in AD mouse model.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Kappa-opioid receptor stimulation in the nucleus accumbens shell: Differential effects across the rostro-caudal axis on dopamine transmission and affective behavior</title>

	<description>Neural activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell has long been implicated in the regulation of negative and positive affect. Classically, the dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system in the NAc was believed to promote dysphoric behaviors, while dopamine release was viewed as interacting with reinforcing stimuli, and KOR-activation was known to inhibit dopamine release. Recently, however, both the KOR and dopamine systems have been shown to have differential effects across the rostro-caudal axis of the NAc shell on hedonic responses. Whether or not this is due to interactions between KORs and dopamine, and if it extends to other affective behaviors, remains to be determined. In this study, we examined in rats the relationship between the KOR and dopamine systems in both the rostral and caudal NAc shell using ex vivo fast scan cyclic voltammetry and the impact of KOR activation on affective behaviors using various assays. We found that activation of KORs in the caudal NAc shell resulted in greater dopamine inhibition, and stimulated novelty-induced rearing behavior and anxiety-like and avoidance behaviors while reducing locomotor activity. In contrast, activation of KORs in the rostral NAc shell resulted in less dopamine inhibition and actually reduced anxiety-like and avoidance behaviors. These results demonstrate that there is heterogeneity across the rostro-caudal axis of the NAc shell in the effects of KOR stimulation on affective behavior and they suggest that this might be due to differences in KOR control over dopamine inhibition.</description>

	<description>For patients who have lost sensory function due to a neurological injury such as spinal cord injury (SCI), stroke, or amputation, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) may provide a mechanism for restoring somatic sensations via an intuitive, non-visual pathway. We have previously shown that rats can learn to discriminate time-varying patterns of epidural SCS. Here we ran additional experiments in rats and conducted a new study in rhesus monkeys trained to discriminate patterns of epidural dorsal thoracic SCS. Based on these results, we constructed psychometric curves describing the relationship between different SCS parameters and the animal's ability to detect the presence of SCS and/or changes in its characteristics. We found that the stimulus detection threshold decreased with higher frequency, longer pulse-width, and increasing duration of SCS. Moreover, we found that monkeys were able to discriminate spatiotemporal patterns (i.e. variations in frequency and location) of SCS delivered through multiple electrodes. Additionally, the analysis of rat data showed that discrimination of SCS-induced sensations obeyed Weber's law of just noticeable differences. These findings suggest that by varying SCS intensity, temporal pattern and location different tactile and/or proprioceptive sensations can be evoked. As such, we posit that SCS can be used to provide intuitive sensory feedback in neuroprosthetic devices.</description>

	<description>Circadian rhythms are commonly disrupted in individuals with depression and/or anxiety disorders. Animal studies indicate that circadian rhythm disruption can cause increased depressive and anxiety-like behavior, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Currently, there is conflicting evidence as to whether the master pacemaker in the brain, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), plays a key role in regulating psychiatric-related behavior. To investigate the role of the SCN in regulating depressive and anxiety-like behavior in mice, we directly manipulated the neural activity of the SCN using two chronic optogenetic stimulation paradigms. Repeated stimulation of the SCN late in the active phase (circadian time 21, CT21) shortened the period and dampened the amplitude of homecage activity rhythms. Repeated stimulation of the SCN at unpredictable times during the dark phase dampened, fragmented and reduced the stability of homecage activity rhythms. In both SCN optogenetic stimulation paradigms, dampened homecage activity rhythms (decreased amplitude) was associated with increased measures of anxiety-like behavior, but not in control mice. Increased fragmentation and decreased day-to-day stability of homecage activity also correlated with increased anxiety-like behavior. Unexpectedly the change in period of homecage activity rhythms was not directly associated with any psychiatric-related behavior. Furthermore, we did not observe consistent correlations between homecage activity amplitude and depressive-like behavior in stimulated mice. Taken together, these results indicate that SCN-mediated dampening of rhythms is directly correlated with increased anxiety-like, but not depressive-like behavior in mice. This work is an important step in understanding how specific SCN neural activity disruptions affect mood and anxiety-related behavior.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Causal inference explains the stimulus-level relationship between the McGurk Effect and auditory speech perception</title>

	<description>The McGurk effect is widely used as a measure of multisensory integration during speech perception. Two observations have raised questions about the relationship between the effect and everyday speech perception. First, there is high variability in the strength of the McGurk effect across different stimuli and observers. Second, there is low correlation across observers between perception of the McGurk effect and measures of everyday speech perception, such as the ability to understand noisy audiovisual speech. Using the framework of the causal inference of multisensory speech (CIMS) model, we explored the relationship between the McGurk effect, syllable perception, and sentence perception in seven experiments with a total of 296 different participants. Perceptual reports revealed a relationship between the efficacy of different McGurk stimuli created from the same talker and perception of the auditory component of the McGurk stimuli presented in isolation, either with or without added noise. The CIMS model explained this high stimulus-level correlation using the principles of noisy sensory encoding followed by optimal cue combination within a representational space that was identical for McGurk and everyday speech. In other experiments, CIMS successfully modeled low observer-level correlation between McGurk and everyday speech. Variability in noisy speech perception was modeled using individual differences in noisy sensory encoding, while variability in McGurk perception involved additional differences in causal inference. Participants with all combinations of high and low sensory encoding noise and high and low causal inference disparity thresholds were identified. Perception of the McGurk effect and everyday speech can be explained by a common theoretical framework that includes causal inference.</description>

	<description>Understanding how the structural connectivity of a network constrains the dynamics it is able to support is a very active and open area of research. We simulated the plausible dynamics resulting from the known C. elegans connectome using a recent model and theoretical analysis that computes the dynamics of neurobiological networks by focusing on how local interactions among connected neurons give rise to the global dynamics in an emergent way, independent of the biophysical or molecular details of the cells themselves. We studied the dynamics which resulted from stimulating a chemosensory neuron (ASEL) in a known feeding circuit, both in isolation and embedded in the full connectome. We show that contralateral motor neuron activations in ventral (VB) and dorsal (DB) classes of motor neurons emerged from the simulations, which are qualitatively similar to rhythmic motor neuron firing pattern associated with locomotion of the worm. One interpretation of these results is that there is an inherent - and we propose - purposeful structural wiring to the C. elegans connectome that has evolved to serve specific behavioral functions. To study network signaling pathways responsible for the dynamics we developed an analytic framework that constructs Temporal Sequences (TSeq), time- ordered walks of signals on graphs. We found that only 5% of TSeq are preserved between the isolated feeding network relative to its embedded counterpart. The remaining 95% of signaling pathways computed in the isolated network are not present in the embedded network. This suggests a cautionary note for computational studies of isolated neurobiological circuits and networks.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Competitive state of actions during planning predicts sequence execution accuracy.</title>

	<description>Humans can learn and retrieve novel skilled movement sequences from memory, yet the content and structure of sequence planning are not well understood. Previous computational and neurophysiological work suggests that actions in a sequence are planned as parallel graded activations and selected for output through competition (competitive queuing; CQ). However, the relevance of CQ during planning to sequence fluency and accuracy, as opposed to sequence timing, is unclear. To resolve this question, we assessed the competitive state of constituent actions behaviourally during sequence preparation. In three separate multi-session experiments, 55 healthy participants were trained to retrieve and produce 4-finger sequences with particular timing from long-term memory. In addition to sequence production, we evaluated reaction time (RT) and error rate increase to constituent action probes at several points during the preparation period. Our results demonstrate that longer preparation time produces a steeper CQ activation and selection gradient between adjacent sequence elements, whilst no effect was found for sequence speed or temporal structure. Further, participants with a steeper CQ gradient tended to produce correct sequences faster and with a higher temporal accuracy. In a computational model, we hypothesize that the CQ gradient during planning is driven by the width of acquired positional tuning of each sequential item, independently of timing. Our results suggest that competitive activation during sequence planning is established gradually during sequence planning and predicts sequence fluency and accuracy, rather than the speed or temporal structure of the motor sequence.</description>

	<description>Olfactory impairments, including deficits in odor detection, discrimination, recognition, and changes in odor hedonics are reported in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Rodent models of AD display deficits in odor learning, detection, and discrimination - recapitulating the clinical condition. However, the impact of familial AD genetic mutations on odor hedonics is unknown. We tested 2-, 4-, and 6-months old 5XFAD (Tg6799) mice in the five-port odor multiple-choice task designed to assay a variety of odor-guided behaviors, including odor preferences/hedonics. We found that 5XFAD mice investigated odors longer than controls, an effect that was driven by 6-months old mice. Interestingly, this effect was carried by females in the 5XFAD group, who investigated odors longer than age-matched males. Upon examining behavior directed towards individual odors to test for aberrant odor preferences, we uncovered that 5XFAD females at several ages displayed heightened preferences towards some of the odors, indicating aberrant hedonics. We observed no impairments in the ability to engage in the task in 5XFAD mice. Taken together, 5XFAD mice, particularly 5XFAD females, display prolonged odor investigation behavior and enhanced preferences to certain odors. The data provide insight into hedonic alterations which may occur in AD mouse models, and how these are influenced by biological sex.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Using EEG Microstates to Examine Post-Encoding Quiet Rest and Subsequent Word-Pair Memory</title>

	<description>Evidence suggests that the brain preferentially consolidates memories during &quot;offline&quot; periods, in which an individual is not performing a task and their attention is otherwise undirected, including spans of quiet, resting wakefulness. Moreover, research has demonstrated that factors such as the initial encoding strength of information influence which memories receive the greatest benefit. Recent studies have begun to investigate these periods of post-learning quiet rest using EEG microstate analysis to observe the electrical dynamics of the brain during these stretches of memory consolidation, specifically finding an increase in the amount of the canonical microstate D during a post-encoding rest period. Here, we implement an exploratory analysis to probe the activity of EEG microstates during post-encoding sessions of quiet rest in order to scrutinize the impact of learning on microstate dynamics and to further understand the role these microstates play in the consolidation of memories. In two different studies, we examined a combined 74 subjects (55 female) as they completed a word-pair memory task designed to use repetition and presentation-time to vary the initial encoding strength of the word-pair memories. In both studies, we were able to replicate previous research in which there was a significant increase (both p's &amp;lt; .05) in the amount of microstate D (often associated with the dorsal attention network) during post-encoding rest. This change was accompanied, in both studies, by a significant decrease (both p's &amp;lt; .05) in the amount of microstate C (often associated with the default mode network). We also found preliminary evidence indicating a positive relationship between the amount of microstate D and improved memory for weakly encoded memories, which merits further exploration.</description>

	<description>Experimental studies in neuroscience are producing data at a rapidly increasing rate, providing exciting opportunities and formidable challenges to existing theoretical and modeling approaches. To turn massive datasets into predictive quantitative frameworks, the field needs software solutions for systematic integration of data into realistic, multiscale models. Here we describe the Brain Modeling ToolKit (BMTK), a software suite for building models and performing simulations at multiple levels of resolution, from biophysically detailed multi-compartmental, to point-neuron, to population-statistical approaches. Leveraging the SONATA file format and existing software such as NEURON, NEST, and others, BMTK offers consistent user experience across multiple levels of resolution. It permits highly sophisticated simulations to be set up with little coding required, thus lowering entry barriers to new users. We illustrate successful applications of BMTK to large-scale simulations of a cortical area. BMTK is an open-source package provided as a resource supporting modeling-based discovery in the community.</description>

	<description>Stimulus identification commonly improves with repetition over long delays (repetition priming), whereas neural activity commonly decreases (repetition suppression). Multiple models have been proposed to explain this brain-behavior relationship, predicting alterations in functional and/or effective connectivity (Synchrony and Predictive Coding models), in the latency of neural responses (Facilitation model), and in the relative similarity of neural representations (Sharpening model). Here, we test these predictions with fMRI during overt and covert naming of repeated and novel objects. While we find partial support for predictions of the Facilitation and Sharpening models in the left fusiform gyrus and left frontal cortex, the strongest support was observed for the Synchrony model, with increased coupling between right temporoparietal and anterior cingulate cortex for repeated objects that correlated with priming magnitude across participants. Despite overlap with regions showing repetition suppression, increased coupling and repetition suppression varied independently, establishing that they follow from distinct mechanisms.</description>

	<description>The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study is an unprecedented longitudinal neuroimaging sample that tracks the brain development of over 10,000 9-10 year olds through adolescence(1). At the core of this study are the three tasks that are completed repeatedly within the fMRI scanner, one of which is the stop-signal task. Laudably, the materials and data from this study are being made openly available to the community. However, in analyzing the available experimental code and data for the stop-signal task, we identified a set of design issues that we believe significantly limit its value. These issues include but are not limited to: variable stimulus durations that violate basic assumptions of dominant stopping models, trials in which stimuli are incorrectly not presented, and degenerate stop-signal delays. We present eight issues, show their effect on the existing ABCD data, suggest prospective solutions to the study organizers including task changes for future data collection, and suggest retrospective solutions for data users who wish to make the most of the existing data.</description>

	<description>Pregnancy involves maternal brain adaptations, but little is known about how parity influences women's brain aging trajectories later in life. In this study, we replicated previous findings showing less apparent brain aging in women with a history of childbirths, and identified regional brain aging patterns linked to parity in 19,787 middle and older-aged women. Using novel applications of brain-age prediction methods, we found that a higher number of previous childbirths was linked to less apparent brain aging in striatal and limbic regions. The strongest effect was found in the accumbens - a key region in the mesolimbic reward system, which plays an important role in maternal behavior. While only prospective longitudinal studies would be conclusive, our findings indicate that subcortical brain modulations during pregnancy and postpartum may be traceable decades after childbirth.</description>

	<description>Recent advances in non-linear computational and dynamical modelling have opened up the possibility to parametrize dynamic neural mechanisms that drive complex behavior. Importantly, building models of neuronal processes is of key importance to fully understand disorders of the brain as it may provide a quantitative platform that is capable of binding multiple neurophysiological processes to phenotype pro-files. In this study, we apply a newly developed adaptive frequency-based model of whole-brain oscillations to resting-state fMRI data acquired from healthy controls and a cohort of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) subjects. As expected, we found that healthy control subjects differed from ADHD in terms of attractor dynamics. However, we also found a marked dichotomy in neural dynamics within the ADHD cohort. Next, we classified the ADHD subgroup according to the level of distance of each individual's empirical network from the two model-based simulated networks. Critically, the model was mirrored in the empirical behavior data with the two ADHD subgroups displaying distinct behavioral phenotypes related to emotional instability (i.e., depression and hypomanic personality traits). Finally, we investigated the applicability and feasibility of our whole-brain model in a therapeutic setting by conducting in silico excitatory stimulations to mimic clinical transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigms in ADHD. We tested the effect of stimulating any individual brain region on key network measures and its contribution in rectifying the brain dynamics to that of the healthy brain, separately for each ADHD subgroup. This showed that this was indeed possible for both subgroups. However, the current effect sizes were small suggesting that the stimulation protocol needs to be tailored at the individual level. These findings demonstrate the potential of this new modelling framework to unveil hidden neurophysiological profiles and establish tailored clinical interventions.</description>

	<description>The dentate gyrus presents the peculiarity to be formed after birth in rodents. Adolescence is a very sensitive period during which cognitive competences are programmed. We investigated and compared the role of dentate neurons born during adolescence or generated during adulthood. We demonstrated that the ontogenetic stage of dentate neurons in relation to when they are generated dictates their participation in memory processes</description>

	<description>Resting state electroencephalographic (EEG) recording could provide cost-effective means to aid in the detection of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). We examined how many electrodes are needed for classification of PD based on EEG, which electrode locations provide most value for classification, and whether data recorded eyes open or closed yield comparable results. We used a nested cross-validated classifier which included a budget-based search algorithm for selecting the optimal electrodes for classification. By iterating over variable budgets, we show that with eyes open recording, only 10 electrodes, localized over motor and occipital areas enable relatively accurate classification (AUC = .82) between PD patients (N=20) and age-matched healthy control participants (N=20). Classification accuracy only slightly increased when all 64 electrodes were included (AUC = .85). With the data recorded eyes closed, classification was not statistically significantly above chance even with full set of 64 electrodes (AUC = .55). These results show that classification based on small number of EEG electrodes is a promising tool for classifying PD, but measurement conditions and electrode locations can have a significant effect on classifier performance.</description>

	<description>The failure of all anti-amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) drugs has led to a debate about the central role of amyloid in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD). In order to resolve this issue, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of A{beta} biomarkers on SAD by measuring the dynamic changes in biomarkers and clinical profiles in the progression of SAD. We identified a clearer picture of the clinical and biomarker changes in the progression of SAD by aligning the clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD onset. We found that changes in hippocampal volume and FDG, rather than A{beta} biomarkers, were associated with the changes in clinical measures in the progression of SAD. In addition, cognitively normal people with elevated and with normal amyloid showed no significant differences in clinical measures, hippocampal volume, or FDG. This study reveals that A{beta} is not a useful biomarker for predicting the clinical progression of patients who develop SAD.</description>

	<description>Cognitive control enables goal-oriented adaptation to a fast-changing environment and has a slow developmental trajectory that spans into young adulthood. The specifics of this development are still poorly understood, as are the neurodevelopmental mechanisms that drive it. In a cross-sectional sample of participants 8-19 years old (n = 108), we used blind source separation of EEG data recorded in a Flanker task to derive electrophysiological measures of attention and the processing of cognitive conflict, including a frontal negative component corresponding to the N2 and a parietal positive component corresponding to the P3. Additionally, we examined multiple behavioral measures of interference control derived from the Flanker, Stroop, and Anti-saccade tasks. We found a positive association between age and the amplitude of the parietal positive component, while there was no relationship between age and the amplitude of the frontal negative component. A stronger frontal negative amplitude was, however, age-independently related to better performance on both Stroop and Anti-saccade measures of interference control. Finally, we examined post-conflict behavioral adjustment on the Flanker task. A Gratton effect was found with slower reaction times on current congruent and better accuracy on current incongruent trials when preceded by incongruent as opposed to congruent trials. The Gratton effect on accuracy was positively associated with age. Together, the findings suggest a multifaceted developmental pattern in neurocognitive mechanisms for conflict processing across adolescence, with a more protracted development of the parietal positive compared to the frontal negative component.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Perinatal IL-1-induced Inflammation Suppresses Tbr2+ Intermediate Progenitor Cell Proliferation in the Developing Hippocampus accompanied by Long-Term Behavioral Deficits</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.08.084129v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Meta-analyses have revealed associations between the incidence of maternal infections during pregnancy, premature birth, smaller brain volumes, and subsequent cognitive, motor and behavioral deficits as these children mature. Inflammation during pregnancy in rodents produces cognitive and behavioral deficits in the offspring that are similar to those reported in human studies. These deficits are accompanied by decreased neurogenesis and proliferation in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. As systemically administering interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}) to neonatal mice recapitulates many of the brain abnormalities seen in premature babies including developmental delays, the goal of this study was to determine whether IL-1-mediated neuroinflammation would affect hippocampal growth during development to produce cognitive and behavioral abnormalities. For these studies, 10 ng/g IL-1{beta} was administered twice daily to Swiss Webster mice during the first 5 days of life, which increased hippocampal levels of IL-1 and acutely reduced the proliferation of Tbr2+ neural progenitors in the DG. In vitro , both IL-1 and IL-1{beta} produced G1/S cell cycle arrest that resulted in reduced progenitor cell proliferation within the transit amplifying progenitor cell cohort. By contrast, IL-1{beta} treatment increased neural stem cell frequency. Upon terminating IL-1{beta} treatment, the progenitor cell pool regained its proliferative capacity. An earlier study that used this in vivo model of perinatal inflammation showed that mice that received IL-1{beta} as neonates displayed memory deficits which suggested abnormal hippocampal function. To evaluate whether other cognitive and behavioral traits associated with hippocampal function would also be altered, mice were tested in tasks designed to assess exploratory and anxiety behavior as well as working and spatial memory. Interestingly, mice that received IL-1{beta} as neonates showed signs of anxiety in several behavioral assays during adolescence that were also evident in adulthood. Additionally, these mice did not display working memory deficits in adulthood, but they did display deficits in long-term spatial memory. Altogether, these data support the view that perinatal inflammation negatively affects the developing hippocampus producing behavioral deficits that persist into adulthood. These data provide a new perspective into the origin of the cognitive and behavioral impairments observed in prematurely-born sick infants.</description>

	<description>Shortly after birth, the olfactory system provides to blind, deaf, non-whisking and motorically-limited rodents not only the main source of environmental inputs, but also the drive boosting the functional entrainment of limbic circuits. However, the cellular substrate of this early communication remains largely unknown. Here we combine in vivo and in vitro patch-clamp and extracellular recordings to reveal the contribution of mitral cell (MC) firing to the early patterns of network activity in the neonatal olfactory bulb (OB) and lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), the gatekeeper of limbic circuits. We show that MCs predominantly fire either in an irregular bursting or non-bursting pattern during discontinuous theta events in OB. However, the temporal spike-theta phase coupling is stronger for bursting MCs when compared to non-bursting cells. In line with the direct OB projections to LEC, both bursting and non-bursting firing augments during coordinated patterns of entorhinal activity, yet to a higher magnitude for bursting MCs. These cells are stronger temporally coupled to the discontinuous theta events in LEC. Thus, bursting MCs might drive the entrainment of OB-LEC network during neonatal development.</description>

	<description>The synaptic-tagging-and-capture (STC) hypothesis formulates that at each synapse the concurrence of a tag with protein synthesis yields the maintenance of changes induced by synaptic plasticity. This hypothesis provides a biological principle underlying the synaptic consolidation of memories that is not verified for recurrent neural circuits. We developed a theoretical model integrating the mechanisms underlying the STC hypothesis with calcium-based synaptic plasticity in a recurrent spiking neural network. In the model, calcium-based synaptic plasticity yields the formation of strongly interconnected cell assemblies encoding memories, followed by consolidation through the STC mechanisms. Furthermore, we find that the STC mechanisms have an up to now undiscovered effect on memories - with the passage of time they modify the storage of memories, such that after several hours memory recall is significantly improved. This kind of memory enhancement can provide a new principle for storing information in biological and artificial neural circuits.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Differential functional neural circuitry behind autism subtypes with marked imbalance between social-communicative and restricted repetitive behavior symptom domains</title>

	<description>Social-communication (SC) and restricted repetitive behaviors (RRB) are autism diagnostic symptom domains. SC and RRB severity can markedly differ within and between individuals and is underpinned by different neural circuitry and genetic mechanisms. Modeling SC-RRB balance could help identify how neural circuitry and genetic mechanisms map onto such phenotypic heterogeneity. Here we developed a phenotypic stratification model that makes highly accurate (96-98%) out-of-sample SC=RRB, SC&amp;gt;RRB, and RRB&amp;gt;SC subtype predictions. Applying this model to resting state fMRI data from the EU-AIMS LEAP dataset (n=509), we find replicable somatomotor-perisylvian hypoconnectivity in the SC&amp;gt;RRB subtype versus a typically-developing (TD) comparison group. In contrast, replicable motor-anterior salience hyperconnectivity is apparent in the SC=RRB subtype versus TD. Autism-associated genes affecting astrocytes, excitatory, and inhibitory neurons are highly expressed specifically within SC&amp;gt;RRB hypoconnected networks, but not SC=RRB hyperconnected networks. SC-RRB balance subtypes may indicate different paths individuals take from genome, neural circuitry, to the clinical phenotype.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A new glycogen storage disease caused by a dominant PYGM mutation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25771?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25771?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycogen storage diseases (GSD) are severe human disorders resulting from abnormal glucose metabolism, and all previously described GSDs segregate as autosomal recessive or X‐linked traits. Here we aimed to molecularly characterize the first family with a dominant GSD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe a dominant GSD family with 13 affected members presenting with adult‐onset muscle weakness, and we provide clinical, metabolic, histological, and ultrastructural data. We performed exome sequencing to uncover the causative gene, and functional experiments in the cell model and on recombinant proteins to investigate the pathogenic effect of the identified mutation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a heterozygous missense mutation in &lt;i&gt;PYGM&lt;/i&gt; segregating with the disease in the family. &lt;i&gt;PYGM&lt;/i&gt; codes for myophosphorylase, the enzyme catalyzing the initial step of glycogen breakdown. Enzymatic tests revealed that the &lt;i&gt;PYGM&lt;/i&gt; mutation impairs the AMP‐independent myophosphorylase activity, while the AMP‐dependent activity was preserved. Further functional investigations demonstrated an altered conformation and aggregation of mutant myophosphorylase, and the concurrent accumulation of the intermediate filament desmin in the myofibers of the patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this study describes the first example of a dominant glycogen storage disease in humans, and elucidates the underlying pathomechanisms by deciphering the sequence of events from the &lt;i&gt;PYGM&lt;/i&gt; mutation to the accumulation of glycogen in the muscle fibers.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Hippocampus: Differential propagation of ripples along the proximodistal and septotemporal axes of dorsal CA1 of rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23211?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23211?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functional connectivity of the hippocampus with its primary cortical input, the entorhinal cortex, is organized topographically. In area CA1 of the hippocampus, this leads to different functional gradients along the proximodistal and septotemporal axes of spatial/sensory responsivity and spatial resolution respectively. CA1 ripples, a network phenomenon, allow us to test whether the hippocampal neural network shows corresponding gradients in functional connectivity along the two axes. We studied the occurrence and propagation of ripples across the entire proximodistal axis along with a comparable spatial range of the septotemporal axis of dorsal CA1. We observed that ripples could occur at any location, and their amplitudes were independent of the tetrode location along the proximodistal and septotemporal axes. When a ripple was detected on a particular tetrode (“reference tetrode”), however, the probability of cooccurrence of ripples and ripple amplitude observed on the other tetrodes decreased as a function of distance from the reference tetrode. This reduction was greater along the proximodistal axis than the septotemporal axis. Furthermore, we found that ripples propagate primarily along the proximodistal axis. Thus, over a spatial scale of ∼1.5 mm, the network is anisotropic along the two axes, complementing the topographically organized cortico‐hippocampal connections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Light is one of the factors that can play a role in bacterial infiltration into leafy greens by keeping stomata open and providing photosynthetic products for microorganisms. We model chemotactic transport of bacteria within a leaf tissue in response to photosynthesis occurring within plant mesophyll. The model includes transport of carbon dioxide, oxygen, bicarbonate, sucrose/glucose, bacteria, and autoinducer-2 within the leaf tissue. Biological processes of carbon fixation in chloroplasts, and respiration in mitochondria of the plant cells, as well as motility, chemotaxis, nutrient consumption and communication in the bacterial community are considered. We show that presence of light is enough to boost bacterial chemotaxis through the stomatal opening and toward photosynthetic products within the leaf tissue. Bacterial chemotactic ability is a major player in infiltration, and plant stomatal defense in closing the stomata as a perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns is an effective way to inhibit the infiltration.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TYKo3FA9LpI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Autonomous emergence of connectivity assemblies via spike triplet interactions</title>

Non-random connectivity can emerge without structured external input driven by activity-dependent mechanisms of synaptic plasticity based on precise spiking patterns. Here we analyze the emergence of global structures in recurrent networks based on a triplet model of spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) which depends on the interactions of three precisely-timed spikes and can describe plasticity experiments with varying spike frequency better than the classical pair-based STDP rule. We derive synaptic changes arising from correlations up to third-order and describe them as the sum of structural motifs which determine how any spike in the network influences a given synaptic connection through possible connectivity paths. This motif expansion framework reveals novel structural motifs under the triplet STDP rule, which support the formation of bidirectional connections and ultimately the spontaneous emergence of global network structure in the form of self-connected groups of neurons, or assemblies. We propose that under triplet STDP assembly structure can emerge without the need for externally patterned inputs or assuming a symmetric pair-based STDP rule common in previous studies. The emergence of non-random network structure under triplet STDP occurs through internally-generated higher-order correlations, which are ubiquitous in natural stimuli and neuronal spiking activity, and important for coding. We further demonstrate how neuromodulatory mechanisms that modulate the shape of the triplet STDP rule or the synaptic transmission function differentially promote structural motifs underlying the emergence of assemblies, and quantify the differences using graph theoretic measures.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kXUhjNXvt2A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Aging But Not Age-Related Hearing Loss Dominates the Decrease of Parvalbumin Immunoreactivity in the Primary Auditory Cortex of Mice</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Alterations in inhibitory circuits of the primary auditory cortex (pAC) have been shown to be an aspect of aging and age-related hearing loss (AHL). Several studies reported a decline in parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactivity in aged rodent pAC of animals displaying AHL and conclude a relationship between reduced sensitivity and declined PV immunoreactivity. However, it remains elusive whether AHL or a general molecular aging is causative for decreased PV immunoreactivity. In this study, we aimed to disentangle the effects of AHL and general aging on PV immunoreactivity patterns in inhibitory interneurons of mouse pAC. We compared young and old animals of a mouse line with AHL (C57BL/6) and a mutant (C57B6.CAST-&lt;i&gt;Cdh23&lt;sup&gt;Ahl+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) that is not vulnerable to AHL according to their hearing status by measuring auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and by an immunohistochemical evaluation of the PV immunoreactivity patterns in two dimensions (rostro-caudal and layer) in the pAC. Although AHL could be confirmed by ABR measurements for the C57BL/6 mice, both aged strains showed a similar reduction of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; positive interneurons in both, number and density. The pattern of reduction across the rostro-caudal axis and across cortical layers was similar for both aged lines. Our results demonstrate that a reduced PV immunoreactivity is a sign of general, molecular aging and not related to AHL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Shunting Inhibition Improves Synchronization in Heterogeneous Inhibitory Interneuronal Networks with Type 1 Excitability Whereas Hyperpolarizing Inhibition Is Better for Type 2 Excitability</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;All-to-all homogeneous networks of inhibitory neurons synchronize completely under the right conditions; however, many modeling studies have shown that biological levels of heterogeneity disrupt synchrony. Our fundamental scientific question is &quot;how can neurons maintain partial synchrony in the presence of heterogeneity and noise?&quot; A particular subset of strongly interconnected interneurons, the PV+ fast-spiking (FS) basket neurons, are strongly implicated in  oscillations and in phase locking of nested  oscillations to theta. Their excitability type apparently varies between brain regions: in CA1 and the dentate gyrus they have type 1 excitability, meaning that they can fire arbitrarily slowly, whereas in the striatum and cortex they have type 2 excitability, meaning that there is a frequency thresh old below which they cannot sustain repetitive firing. We constrained the models to study the effect of excitability type (more precisely bifurcation type) in isolation from all other factors. We use sparsely connected, heterogeneous, noisy networks with synaptic delays to show that synchronization properties, namely the resistance to suppression and the strength of theta phase to  amplitude coupling, are strongly dependent on the pairing of excitability type with the type of inhibition. Shunting inhibition performs better for type 1 and hyperpolarizing inhibition for type 2.  Oscillations and their nesting within theta oscillations are thought to subserve cognitive functions like memory encoding and recall; therefore, it is important to understand the contribution of intrinsic properties to these rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Negative correlation between grey matter in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus in healthy aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23210?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurobiological changes that occur with aging include a reduction in function and volume of the hippocampus. These changes were associated with corresponding memory deficits in navigation tasks. However, navigation can involve different strategies that are dependent on the hippocampus and caudate nucleus. The proportion of people using hippocampus‐dependent spatial strategies decreases across the lifespan. As such, the decrease in spatial strategies, and corresponding increase in caudate nucleus‐dependent response strategies with age, may play a role in the observed neurobiological changes in the hippocampus. Furthermore, we previously showed a negative correlation between grey matter in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus/striatum in mice, young adults, and in individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. As such, we hypothesized that this negative relationship between the two structures would be present during normal aging. The aim of the current study was to investigate this gap in the literature by studying the relationship between grey matter in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus of the striatum, in relation to each other and to navigation strategies, during healthy aging. Healthy older adults (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 39) were tested on the Concurrent Spatial Discrimination Learning Task (CSDLT), a virtual radial task that dissociates between spatial and response strategies. A regression of strategies against structural MRIs showed for the first time in older adults that the response strategy was associated with higher amounts of grey matter in the caudate nucleus. As expected, the spatial strategy correlated with grey matter in the hippocampus, which was negatively correlated with grey matter in the caudate nucleus. Interestingly, a sex difference emerged showing that among older adult response learners, women have the least amount of grey matter in the hippocampus, which is a known risk for Alzheimer's disease. This difference was absent among spatial learners. These results are discussed in the context of the putative protective role of spatial memory against grey matter loss in the hippocampus, especially in women.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: SARS‐CoV‐2 and Multiple Sclerosis: Not all immune depleting DMTs are equal or bad</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25770?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A major concern during the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) pandemic&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is the use of immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) due to an increased risk of contracting SARS‐CoV‐2 and more severe disease. The Society of Italian Neurologists (SIN) and the Association of British Neurologists (ABN) MS and Neuroimmunology Advisory Group published guidance for the use of current disease modifying treatments (DMTs) in MS (Table 1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. However, taking into account, less conservative viewpoints&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the emerging knowledge of the biology of SARS‐CoV‐2, and in particular the role of the immune mechanisms contributing to the disease, we propose modification of these guidelines since it is not clear that immunosuppression is indeed detrimental in people with MS infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. We are thus proposing a more nuanced approach and that the categories of DMTs should be modified based on scientific principles and the biology of severe COVID‐19 (Table 2).&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Neuron: In press: Voltage-Gated Intrinsic Conductances Shape the Input-Output Relationship of Cortical Neurons in Behaving Primate V1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(20)30244-0?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(20)30244-0?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Li et al. used whole-cell recording to reveal a large and unexpected voltage-gated intrinsic conductance that dramatically alters the integrative properties of primate V1 neurons. Therefore, a standard computational model of sensory neurons that incorporates linear integration of synaptic inputs followed by a threshold nonlinearity requires revision.</description>

	<description>Rahman et al. report the high-resolution single-particle cryo-EM structure of a native muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from the Torpedo electric ray, in complex with α-bungarotoxin from the banded krait. The structure was obtained in a lipidic environment shown to support channel function and reveals a closed, hydrophobic ion channel gate.</description>

	<description>Fernandes et al. report causal connections between postingestive sucrose sensing and brain dopamine neuron activity in the ventral tegmental area that support food seeking. The authors further demonstrate that such behaviors and the associated neuron activity are mediated by the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Perspective on the Multiple Pathways to Changing Brain States</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00023</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00023</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this review article, we highlight several disparate ideas that are linked to changes in brain state (i.e., sleep to arousal, Down to Up, synchronized to de-synchronized). In any discussion of the brain state, we propose that the cortical pyramidal neuron has a central position. EEG recordings, which typically assess brain state, predominantly reflect the activity of cortical pyramidal neurons. This means that the dominant rhythmic activity that characterizes a particular brain state ultimately has to manifest globally across the pyramidal neuron population. During state transitions, it is the long-range connectivity of these neurons that broadcast the resultant changes in activity to many subcortical targets. Structures like the thalamus, brainstem/hypothalamic neuromodulatory systems, and respiratory systems can also strongly influence brain state, and for many decades we have been uncovering bidirectional pathways that link these structures to state changes in the cerebral cortex. More recently, movement and active behaviors have emerged as powerful drivers of state changes. Each of these systems involve different circuits distributed across the brain. Yet, for a system-wide change in brain state, there must be a collaboration between these circuits that reflects and perhaps triggers the transition between brain states. As we expand our understanding of how brain state changes, our current challenge is to understand how these diverse sets of circuits and pathways interact to produce the changes observed in cortical pyramidal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Up and Down States and Memory Consolidation Across Somatosensory, Entorhinal, and Hippocampal Cortices</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the course of a day, brain states fluctuate, from conscious awake information-acquiring states to sleep states, during which previously acquired information is further processed and stored as memories. One hypothesis is that memories are consolidated and stored during “offline” states such as sleep, a process thought to involve transfer of information from the hippocampus to other cortical areas. Up and Down states (UDS), patterns of activity that occur under anesthesia and sleep states, are likely to play a role in this process, although the nature of this role remains unclear. Here we review what is currently known about these mechanisms in three anatomically distinct but interconnected cortical areas: somatosensory cortex, entorhinal cortex, and the hippocampus. In doing so, we consider the role of this activity in the coordination of “replay” during sleep states, particularly during hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. We conclude that understanding the generation and propagation of UDS may provide key insights into the cortico-hippocampal dialogue linking archi- and neocortical areas during memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Progesterone and Allopregnanolone Rapidly Attenuate Estrogen-Associated Mechanical Allodynia in Rats with Persistent Temporomandibular Joint Inflammation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00026</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00026</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD) is associated with pain in the joint (temporomandibular joint, TMJ) and muscles involved in mastication. TMD pain dissipates following menopause but returns in some women undergoing estrogen replacement therapy. Progesterone has both anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive properties, while estrogen’s effects on nociception are variable and highly dependent on both natural hormone fluctuations and estrogen dosage during pharmacological treatments, with high doses increasing pain. Allopregnanolone, a progesterone metabolite and positive allosteric modulator of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor, also has antinociceptive properties. While progesterone and allopregnanolone are antinociceptive, their effect on estrogen-exacerbated TMD pain has not been determined. We hypothesized that removing the source of endogenous ovarian hormones would reduce inflammatory allodynia in the TMJ of rats and both progesterone and allopregnanolone would attenuate the estrogen-provoked return of allodynia. Baseline mechanical sensitivity was measured in female Sprague–Dawley rats (150–175 g) using the von Frey filament method followed by a unilateral injection of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) into the TMJ. Mechanical allodynia was confirmed 24 h later; then rats were ovariectomized or received sham surgery. Two weeks later, allodynia was reassessed and rats received one of the following subcutaneous hormone treatments over 5 days: a daily pharmacological dose of estradiol benzoate (E2; 50 μg/kg), daily E2 and pharmacological to sub-physiological doses of progesterone (P4; 16 mg/kg, 16 μg/kg, or 16 ng/kg), E2 daily and interrupted P4 given every other day, daily P4, or daily vehicle control. A separate group of animals received allopregnanolone (0.16 mg/kg) instead of P4. Allodynia was reassessed 1 h following injections. Here, we report that CFA-evoked mechanical allodynia was attenuated following ovariectomy and daily high E2 treatment triggered the return of allodynia, which was rapidly attenuated when P4 was also administered either daily or every other day. Allopregnanolone treatment, whether daily or every other day, also attenuated estrogen-exacerbated allodynia within 1 h of treatment, but only on the first treatment day. These data indicate that when gonadal hormone levels have diminished, treatment with a lower dose of progesterone may be effective at rapidly reducing the estrogen-evoked recurrence of inflammatory mechanical allodynia in the TMJ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Differential Proliferation and Maturation of Subcortical Astrocytes During Postnatal Development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00435</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes exhibit a region-dependent molecular and functional heterogeneity in the CNS. Although cortical astrocytes proliferate robustly during the first postnatal week and become proliferation quiescent, the temporal proliferation dynamics of astrocytes in subcortical regions during postnatal development remain essentially unknown. Whether subcortical astrocytes mature similarly to cortical astrocytes is also unexplored. In this current study, we examined proliferation of subcortical, especially hypothalamic, astrocytes during postnatal development using genetic labeling of astrocytes and pulse-chase EdU labeling of proliferating cells. While a lower number of proliferating astrocytes was found in the hypothalamus compared to cortex during the first postnatal week, astrocyte proliferation is much more active in hypothalamus than in cortex from P15 to P30 in both proliferating astrocyte density and percentage, indicating a persistent and distinct proliferation pattern of astrocytes in hypothalamus. This observation is further confirmed by Ki67 immunostaining with genetically or immunolabeled astrocytes in hypothalamus and cortex during P15–30. In addition, astrocytes in representative subcortical regions have a modest growth of their domain size and exhibit a significantly smaller domain size compared to cortical astrocytes at P30 when astrocytes have generally completed postnatal maturation. However, the expression of astrocyte-derived Sparc, an important synaptogenic inhibitor, is consistently higher in hypothalamic astrocytes than in cortical astrocytes throughout postnatal development. In summary, our study unveiled a distinct proliferation and maturation pattern of subcortical, especially hypothalamic, astrocytes during postnatal development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Toward Establishing Internal Validity for Correlated Gene Expression Measures in Imaging Genomics of Functional Networks: Why Distance Corrections and External Face Validity Alone Fall Short. Reply to “Distance Is Not Everything in Imaging Genomics of Functional Networks: Reply to a Commentary on Correlated Gene Expression Supports Synchronous Activity in Brain Networks”</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The primary claim of the Richiardi et al. (2015) Science article is that a measure of correlated gene expression, significant strength fraction (SSF), is related to resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) networks. However, there is still debate about this claim and whether spatial proximity, in the form of contiguous clusters, accounts entirely, or only partially, for SSF (Pantazatos and Li, 2017; Richiardi et al., 2017). Here, 13 distributed networks were simulated by combining 34 contiguous clusters randomly placed throughout cortex, with resulting edge distance distributions similar to rsfMRI networks. Cluster size was modulated (6–15 mm radius) to test its influence on SSF false positive rate (SSF-FPR) among the simulated “noise” networks. The contribution of rsfMRI networks on SSF-FPR was examined by comparing simulated networks whose clusters were sampled from: (1) all 1,777 cortical tissue samples, (2) all samples, but with non-rsfMRI cluster centers, and (3) only 1,276 non-rsfMRI samples. Results show that SSF-FPR is influenced only by cluster size (r &amp;gt; 0.9, p &amp;lt; 0.001), not by rsfMRI samples. Simulations using 14 mm radius clusters most resembled rsfMRI networks. When thresholding at p &amp;lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;–4&lt;/sup&gt;, the SSF-FPR was 0.47. Genes that maximize SF have high global spatial autocorrelation. In conclusion, SSF is unrelated to rsfMRI networks. The main conclusion of Richiardi et al. (2015) is based on a finding that is ∼50% likely to be a false positive, not &amp;lt;0.01% as originally reported in the article (Richiardi et al., 2015). We discuss why distance corrections alone and external face validity are insufficient to establish a trustworthy relationship between correlated gene expression measures and rsfMRI networks, and propose more rigorous approaches to preclude common pitfalls in related studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Attentional Processes in Children With Attentional Problems or Reading Difficulties as Revealed Using Brain Event-Related Potentials and Their Source Localization</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual attention-related processes include three functional sub-processes: alerting, orienting, and inhibition. We examined these sub-processes using reaction times, event-related potentials (ERPs), and their neuronal source activations during the Attention Network Test (ANT) in control children, attentional problems (AP) children, and reading difficulties (RD) children. During the ANT, electroencephalography was measured using 128 electrodes on three groups of Finnish sixth-graders aged 12–13 years (control = 77; AP = 15; RD = 23). Participants were asked to detect the direction of a middle target fish within a group of five fish. The target stimulus was either preceded by a cue (center, double, or spatial), or without a cue, to manipulate the alerting and orienting sub-processes of attention. The direction of the target fish was either congruent or incongruent in relation to the flanker fish, thereby manipulating the inhibition sub-processes of attention. Reaction time performance showed no differences between groups in alerting, orienting, and inhibition effects. The group differences in ERPs were only found at the source level. Neuronal source analysis in the AP children revealed a larger alerting effect (double-cued vs. non-cued target stimuli) than control and RD children in the left occipital lobe. Control children showed a smaller orienting effect (spatially cued vs. center-cued target stimuli) in the left occipital lobe than AP and RD children. No group differences were found for the neuronal sources related to the inhibition effect. The neuronal activity differences related to sub-processes of attention in the AP and RD groups suggest different underlying mechanisms for attentional and reading problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effect of External Force on Agency in Physical Human-Machine Interaction</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the advent of intelligent robotic tools for physically assisting humans, user experience, and intuitiveness in particular have become important features for control designs. However, existing works predominantly focus on performance-related measures for evaluating control systems as the subjective experience of a user by large cannot be directly observed. In this study, we therefore focus on agency-related interactions between control and embodiment in the context of physical human-machine interaction. By applying an intentional binding paradigm in a virtual, machine-assisted reaching task, we evaluate how the sense of agency of able-bodied humans is modulated by assistive force characteristics of a physically coupled device. In addition to measuring how assistive force profiles influence the sense of agency with intentional binding, we analyzed the sense of agency using a questionnaire. Remarkably, our participants reported to experience stronger agency when being appropriately assisted, although they contributed less to the control task. This is substantiated by the overall consistency of intentional binding results and the self-reported sense of agency. Our results confirm the fundamental feasibility of the sense of agency to objectively evaluate the quality of human-in-the-loop control for assistive technologies. While the underlying mechanisms causing the perceptual bias observed in the intentional binding paradigm are still to be understood, we believe that this study distinctly contributes to demonstrating how the sense of agency characterizes intuitiveness of assistance in physical human-machine interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Exponential Time Differencing Algorithm for Pulse-Coupled Hodgkin-Huxley Neural Networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The exponential time differencing (ETD) method allows using a large time step to efficiently evolve stiff systems such as Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neural networks. For pulse-coupled HH networks, the synaptic spike times cannot be predetermined and are convoluted with neuron's trajectory itself. This presents a challenging issue for the design of an efficient numerical simulation algorithm. The stiffness in the HH equations are quite different, for example, between the spike and non-spike regions. Here, we design a second-order adaptive exponential time differencing algorithm (AETD2) for the numerical evolution of HH neural networks. Compared with the regular second-order Runge-Kutta method (RK2), our AETD2 method can use time steps one order of magnitude larger and improve computational efficiency more than ten times while excellently capturing accurate traces of membrane potentials of HH neurons. This high accuracy and efficiency can be robustly obtained and do not depend on the dynamical regimes, connectivity structure or the network size.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: The Photoconvertible Fluorescent Probe, CaMPARI, Labels Active Neurons in Freely-Moving Intact Adult Fruit Flies</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Linking neural circuitry to behavior by mapping active neurons in vivo is a challenge. Both genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) and intermediate early genes (IEGs) have been used to pinpoint active neurons during a stimulus or behavior but have drawbacks such as limiting the movement of the organism, requiring a priori knowledge of the active region or having poor temporal resolution. Calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI) was engineered to overcome these spatial-temporal challenges. CaMPARI is a photoconvertible protein that only converts from green to red fluorescence in the presence of high calcium concentration and 405 nm light. This allows the experimenter to precisely mark active neurons within defined temporal windows. The photoconversion can then be quantified by taking the ratio of the red fluorescence to the green. CaMPARI promises the ability to trace active neurons during a specific stimulus; however, CaMPARI’s uses in adult Drosophila have been limited to photoconversion during fly immobilization. Here, we demonstrate a method that allows photoconversion of multiple freely-moving intact adult flies during a stimulus. Flies were placed in a dish with filter paper wet with acetic acid (pH = 2) or neutralized acetic acid (pH = 7) and exposed to photoconvertible light (60 mW) for 30 min (500 ms on, 200 ms off). Immediately following photoconversion, whole flies were fixed and imaged by confocal microscopy. The red:green ratio was quantified for the DC4 glomerulus, a bundle of neurons expressing Ir64a, an ionotropic receptor that senses acids in the Drosophila antennal lobe. Flies exposed to acetic acid showed 1.3-fold greater photoconversion than flies exposed to neutralized acetic acid. This finding was recapitulated using a more physiological stimulus of apple cider vinegar. These results indicate that CaMPARI can be used to label neurons in intact, freely-moving adult flies and will be useful for identifying the circuitry underlying complex behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Multimodal Analysis of STRADA Function in Brain Development</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;mTORopathies are a heterogeneous group of neurological disorders characterized by malformations of cortical development (MCD), enhanced cellular mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, and epilepsy that results from mutations in mTOR pathway regulatory genes. Homozygous mutations (del exon 9–13) in the pseudokinase STE20-related kinase adaptor alpha (STRAD-α; STRADA), an mTOR modulator, are associated with Pretzel Syndrome (PS), a neurodevelopmental disorder within the Old Order Mennonite Community characterized by megalencephaly, intellectual disability, and intractable epilepsy. To study the cellular mechanisms of STRADA loss, we generated CRISPR-edited Strada mouse N2a cells, a germline mouse Strada knockout (KO−/−) strain, and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from PS individuals harboring the STRADA founder mutation. Strada KO in vitro leads to enhanced mTOR signaling and iPSC-derived neurons from PS individuals exhibit enhanced cell size and mTOR signaling activation, as well as subtle alterations in electrical firing properties e.g., increased input resistance, a more depolarized resting membrane potential, and decreased threshold for action potential (AP) generation. Strada−/− mice exhibit high rates of perinatal mortality and out of more than 100 litters yielding both WT and heterozygous pups, only eight Strada−/− animals survived past P5. Strada−/− mice are hypotonic and tremulous. Histopathological examination (n = 5 mice) revealed normal gross brain organization and lamination but all had ventriculomegaly. Ectopic neurons were seen in all five Strada−/− brains within the subcortical white matter mirroring what is observed in human PS brain tissue. These distinct experimental platforms demonstrate that STRADA modulates mTOR signaling and is a key regulator of cell size, neuronal excitability, and cortical lamination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Human Brain Organoids to Decode Mechanisms of Microcephaly</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain organoids are stem cell-based self-assembling 3D structures that recapitulate early events of human brain development. Recent improvements with patient-specific 3D brain organoids have begun to elucidate unprecedented details of the defective mechanisms that cause neurodevelopmental disorders of congenital and acquired microcephaly. In particular, brain organoids derived from primary microcephaly patients have uncovered mechanisms that deregulate neural stem cell proliferation, maintenance, and differentiation. Not only did brain organoids reveal unknown aspects of neurogenesis but also have illuminated surprising roles of cellular structures of centrosomes and primary cilia in regulating neurogenesis during brain development. Here, we discuss how brain organoids have started contributing to decoding the complexities of microcephaly, which are unlikely to be identified in the existing non-human models. Finally, we discuss the yet unresolved questions and challenges that can be addressed with the use of brain organoids as in vitro models of neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Influence of Physical Activity and Epigenomics On Cognitive Function and Brain Health in Breast Cancer</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The risk of breast cancer increases with age, with the majority of women diagnosed with breast cancer being postmenopausal. It has been estimated that 25–75% of women with breast cancer experience changes in cognitive function (CF) related to disease and treatment, which compromises psychological well-being, decision making, ability to perform daily activities, and adherence to cancer therapy. Unfortunately, the mechanisms that underlie neurocognitive changes in women with breast cancer remain poorly understood, which in turn limits the development of effective treatments and prevention strategies. Exercise has great potential as a non-pharmaceutical intervention to mitigate the decline in CF in women with breast cancer. Evidence suggests that DNA methylation, an epigenetic mechanism for gene regulation, impacts CF and brain health (BH), that exercise influences DNA methylation, and that exercise impacts CF and BH. Although investigating DNA methylation has the potential to uncover the biologic foundations for understanding neurocognitive changes within the context of breast cancer and its treatment as well as the ability to understand how exercise mitigates these changes, there is a dearth of research on this topic. The purpose of this review article is to compile the research in these areas and to recommend potential areas of opportunity for investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affect a high proportion of the elderly population with an increasing prevalence. Sleep disturbances are frequent in those with MCI and AD. This review summarizes existing research on sleep disturbances and neuroinflammation in MCI and AD. Although strong evidence supports various pathways linking sleep and AD pathology, the temporal direction of this central relationship is not yet known. Improved understanding of sleep disturbance and neuroinflammation in MCI and AD may aid in the identification of targets for their prevention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Dynamic metabolic adaptation can promote species coexistence in competitive communities</title>

Microbes are capable of physiologically adapting to diverse environmental conditions by differentially varying the rates at which they uptake different nutrients. In particular, microbes can switch hierarchically between different energy sources, consuming first those that ensure the highest growth rate. Experimentally, this can result in bi-phasic growth curves called “diauxic shifts” that typically arise when microbes are grown in media containing several nutrients. Despite these observations are well-known in microbiology and molecular biology, the mathematical models generally used to describe the population dynamics of microbial communities do not account for dynamic metabolic adaptation, thus implicitly assuming that microbes cannot switch dynamically from one resource to another. Here, we introduce dynamic metabolic adaptation in the framework of consumer-resource models, which are commonly used to describe competitive microbial communities, allowing each species to temporally change its preferred energy source to maximize its own relative fitness. We show that dynamic metabolic adaptation enables the community to self-organize, allowing several species to coexist even in the presence of few resources, and to respond optimally to a time-dependent environment, thus showing that dynamic metabolic adaptation could be an important mechanism for maintaining high levels of diversity even in environments with few energy sources. We show that introducing dynamic metabolic strategies in consumer-resource models is necessary for reproducing experimental growth curves of the baker’s yeast &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; growing in the presence of two carbon sources. Even though diauxic shifts emerge naturally from the model when two resources are qualitatively very different, the model predicts that the existence of such shifts is not a prerequisite for species coexistence in competitive communities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XmDLglyfd1Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Randomly connected networks generate emergent selectivity and predict decoding properties of large populations of neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Audrey Sederberg, Ilya Nemenman&lt;/p&gt;

Modern recording methods enable sampling of thousands of neurons during the performance of behavioral tasks, raising the question of how recorded activity relates to theoretical models. In the context of decision making, functional connectivity between choice-selective cortical neurons was recently reported. The straightforward interpretation of these data suggests the existence of selective pools of inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Computationally investigating an alternative mechanism for these experimental observations, we find that a randomly connected network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons generates single-cell selectivity, patterns of pairwise correlations, and the same ability of excitatory and inhibitory populations to predict choice, as in experimental observations. Further, we predict that, for this task, there are no anatomically defined subpopulations of neurons representing choice, and that choice preference of a particular neuron changes with the details of the task. We suggest that distributed stimulus selectivity and functional organization in population codes could be emergent properties of randomly connected networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TXO2XX1UZlM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Single nucleotide polymorphisms affect RNA-protein interactions at a distance through modulation of RNA secondary structures</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Elan Shatoff, Ralf Bundschuh&lt;/p&gt;

Single nucleotide polymorphisms are widely associated with disease, but the ways in which they cause altered phenotypes are often unclear, especially when they appear in non-coding regions. One way in which non-coding polymorphisms could cause disease is by affecting crucial RNA-protein interactions. While it is clear that changing a protein binding motif will alter protein binding, it has been shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms can affect RNA secondary structure, and here we show that single nucleotide polymorphisms can affect RNA-protein interactions from outside binding motifs through altered RNA secondary structure. By using a modified version of the Vienna Package and PAR-CLIP data for HuR (ELAVL1) in humans we characterize the genome-wide effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms on HuR binding and show that they can have a many-fold effect on the affinity of HuR binding to RNA transcripts from tens of bases away. We also find some evidence that the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms on protein binding might be under selection, with the non-reference alleles tending to make it harder for a protein to bind.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7KPWm87FGE4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Ten Simple Rules for a successful remote postdoc</title>

Author summary: Postdocs are a critical transition for early-career researchers. This transient period, between finishing a PhD and finding a permanent position, is when early-career researchers develop independent research programs and establish collaborative relationships that can make a successful career. Traditionally, postdocs physically relocate—sometimes multiple times—for these short-term appointments, which creates challenges that can disproportionately affect members of traditionally underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). However, many research activities involving analytical and quantitative work do not require a physical presence in a lab and can be accomplished remotely. Other fields have embraced remote work, yet many academics have been hesitant to hire remote postdocs. In this article, we present advice to both principal investigators (PIs) and postdocs for successfully navigating a remote position. Using the combined experience of the authors (as either remote postdocs or employers of remote postdocs), we provide a road map to overcome the real (and perceived) obstacles associated with remote work. With planning, communication, and creativity, remote postdocs can be a fully functioning and productive member of a research lab. Further, our rules can be useful for research labs generally and can help foster a more flexible and inclusive environment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/y6RvQlKqVc8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The current academic culture facing women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields in the United States has sparked the formation of grassroots advocacy groups to empower female scientists in training. However, the impact of these initiatives often goes unmeasured and underappreciated. Our Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) organization serves postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and research technicians (trainees) at a private research institute for biological sciences. Here we propose the following guidelines for cultivating a successful women-in-STEM-focused group based upon survey results from our own scientific community as well as the experience of our WiSE group leaders. We hope these recommendations can provide guidance to advocacy groups at other research and academic organizations that wish to strengthen their efforts. Whereas our own group specifically focuses on the underrepresented state of women in science, we hope these guidelines may be adapted and applied to groups that advocate for any minority group within the greater scientific community (i.e., those of gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic background, sexual orientation, etc.).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AvXtUUFG44Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

With increasing demand for training in data science, extracurricular or “ad hoc” education efforts have emerged to help individuals acquire relevant skills and expertise. Although extracurricular efforts already exist for many computationally intensive disciplines, their support of data science education has significantly helped in coping with the speed of innovation in data science practice and formal curricula. While the proliferation of ad hoc efforts is an indication of their popularity, less has been documented about the needs that they are designed to meet, the limitations that they face, and practical suggestions for holding successful efforts. To holistically understand the role of different ad hoc formats for data science, we surveyed organizers of ad hoc data science education efforts to understand how organizers perceived the events to have gone—including areas of strength and areas requiring growth. We also gathered recommendations from these past events for future organizers. Our results suggest that the perceived benefits of ad hoc efforts go beyond developing technical skills and may provide continued benefit in conjunction with formal curricula, which warrants further investigation. As increasing numbers of researchers from computational fields with a history of complex data become involved with ad hoc efforts to share their skills, the lessons learned that we extract from the surveys will provide concrete suggestions for the practitioner-leaders interested in creating, improving, and sustaining future efforts.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FGHwcxZsHCE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Modeling cancer cells is essential to better understand the dynamic nature of brain tumors and glioma cells, including their invasion of normal brain. Our goal is to study how the morphology of the glioma cell influences the formation of patterns of collective behavior such as flocks (cells moving in the same direction) or streams (cells moving in opposite direction) referred to as &lt;i&gt;oncostream&lt;/i&gt;. We have observed experimentally that the presence of oncostreams correlates with tumor progression. We propose an original agent-based model that considers each cell as an ellipsoid. We show that stretching cells from round to ellipsoid increases stream formation. A systematic numerical investigation of the model was implemented in R 2. We deduce a phase diagram identifying key regimes for the dynamics (e.g. formation of flocks, streams, scattering). Moreover, we study the effect of cellular density and show that, in contrast to classical models of flocking, increasing cellular density reduces the formation of flocks. We observe similar patterns in R 3 with the noticeable difference that stream formation is more ubiquitous compared to flock formation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yjgIFp7h1B0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Path integration is thought to rely on vestibular and proprioceptive cues yet most studies in humans involve primarily visual input, providing limited insight into their respective contributions. We developed a paradigm involving walking in an omnidirectional treadmill in which participants were guided on two sides of a triangle and then found their back way to origin. In Experiment 1, we tested a range of different triangle types while keeping the distance of the unguided side constant to determine the influence of spatial geometry. Participants overshot the angle they needed to turn and undershot the distance they needed to walk, with no consistent effect of triangle type. In Experiment 2, we manipulated distance while keeping angle constant to determine how path integration operated over both shorter and longer distances. Participants underestimated the distance they needed to walk to the origin, with error increasing as a function of the walked distance. To attempt to account for our findings, we developed configural-based computational models involving vector addition, the second of which included terms for the influence of past trials on the current one. We compared against a previously developed configural model of human path integration, the Encoding-Error model. We found that the vector addition models captured the tendency of participants to under-encode guided sides of the triangles and an influence of past trials on current trials. Together, our findings expand our understanding of body-based contributions to human path integration, further suggesting the value of vector addition models in understanding these important components of human navigation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IlBS8UmnS-w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Identification of spinal afferent nerve endings in the colonic mucosa and submucosa that communicate directly with the spinal cord: The gut–brain axis&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4b559b07-b91b-4f8b-8f07-6ae815eed91d/cne24854-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinal afferent nerve endings in the submucosa of mouse distal colon that arise from a single nonpeptidergic spinal afferent neuron whose cell body originated in lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The nerve endings identified from this single sensory neuron were labeled after injection of neuronal tracer into DRG.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major sensory nerve pathway between the colon and central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) that underlies the gut–brain axis, is via spinal afferent neurons, with cell bodies in dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Our aim was to identify the sensory nerve endings in the colon that arise from single colorectal‐projecting DRG neurons. C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized and lumbosacral L6‐S1 DRG injected with dextran biotin. Mice recovered for 7 days. The whole colon was then removed and stained to visualize single axons and nerve endings immunoreactive to calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP). Single axons arising from DRG were identified in the distal colon and their morphological features and CGRP immunoreactivity characterized. After entering the colon, single axons ramified rostrally or caudally along many rows of myenteric ganglia with little circumferential displacement, giving off varicose endings in multiple ganglia. Nerve endings arising from two classes of colorectal‐projecting DRG neuron were identified. One class was peptidergic neurons that had nerve endings in circular muscle, myenteric ganglia, and submucosa. Another class of nonpeptidergic neurons innervated mucosal crypts, myenteric ganglia, and submucosa. Different morphological types of nerve endings which innervate different anatomical layers of colon can arise from the same axon and sensory neuron in DRG. These findings suggest single peptidergic and nonpeptidergic sensory neurons in DRG are potentially capable of detecting sensory stimuli from different anatomical layers of the colon, via different types of nerve endings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Heterogeneous vestibulocerebellar mossy fiber projections revealed by single axon reconstruction in the mouse</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Heterogeneous vestibulocerebellar mossy fiber projections revealed by single axon reconstruction in the mouse&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/037f13bd-372e-4ef4-9c91-df83b7190309/cne24853-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we report the morphology of single vestibulocerebellar axons originating from the medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) in mice. Three identified groups (red, blue, and green) of axons which projected differently to the vestibular nuclei and to the nodulus (X) and flocculus (Fl) indicated functionally distinct heterogeneous populations of vestibulocerebellar neurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant population of neurons in the vestibular nuclei projects to the cerebellum as mossy fibers (MFs) which are involved in the control and adaptation of posture, eye‐head movements, and autonomic function. However, little is known about their axonal projection patterns. We studied the morphology of single axons of medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons as well as those originating from primary afferents, by labeling with biotinylated dextran amine (BDA). MVN axons (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 35) were classified into three types based on their major predominant termination patterns. The Cbm‐type terminated only in the cerebellum (15 axons), whereas others terminated in the cerebellum and contralateral vestibular nuclei (cVN/Cbm‐type, 13 axons), or in the cerebellum and ipsilateral vestibular nuclei (iVN/Cbm‐type, 7 axons). Cbm‐ and cVN/Cbm‐types mostly projected to the nodulus and uvula without any clear relationship with longitudinal stripes in these lobules. They were often bilateral, and sometimes sent branches to the flocculus and to other vermal lobules. Also, the iVN/Cbm‐type projected mainly to the ipsilateral nodulus. Neurons of these types of axons showed different distribution within the MVN. The number of MF terminals of some vestibulocerebellar axons, iVN/Cbm‐type axons in particular, and primary afferent axons were much smaller than observed in previously studied MF axons originating from major precerebellar nuclei and the spinal cord. The results demonstrated that a heterogeneous population of MVN neurons provided divergent MF inputs to the cerebellum. The cVN/Cbm‐ and iVN/Cbm‐types indicate that some excitatory neuronal circuits within the vestibular nuclei supply their collaterals to the vestibulocerebellum as MFs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The astrocyte network in the ventral nerve cord neuropil of the Drosophila third‐instar larva</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The astrocyte network in the ventral nerve cord neuropil of the Drosophila third‐instar larva&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/911271db-26b1-4d82-b1ea-0b7891a52fff/cne24852-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have provided a detailed analysis of astrocyte morphology and territory in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; third‐instar ventral nerve cord where there already exists considerable understanding of the neuronal network. Astrocyte shape varies from globular to multi‐arbored; their arbors can extend across segments and into different neuronal domains. Our data are consistent with a model of a developmental growth process dominated by competitive or repulsive interactions between astrocytes, but should also include cell‐autonomous aspects, as well as use of structural features for growth. This study provides the foundation for a robust, functionally oriented connectome needed to understand neuron–glia interactions in this neuropil.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding neuronal function at the local and circuit level requires understanding astrocyte function. We have provided a detailed analysis of astrocyte morphology and territory in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; third‐instar ventral nerve cord where there already exists considerable understanding of the neuronal network. Astrocyte shape varies more than previously reported; many have bilaterally symmetrical partners, many have a high percentage of their arborization in adjacent segments, and many have branches that follow structural features. Taken together, our data are consistent with, but not fully explained by, a model of a developmental growth process dominated by competitive or repulsive interactions between astrocytes. Our data suggest that the model should also include cell‐autonomous aspects, as well as the use of structural features for growth. Variation in location of arborization territory for identified astrocytes was great enough that a standardized scheme of neuropil division among the six astrocytes that populate each hemi‐segment is not possible at the third instar. The arborizations of the astrocytes can extend across neuronal functional domains. The ventral astrocyte in particular, whose territory can extend well into the proprioceptive region of the neuropil, has no obvious branching pattern that correlates with domains of particular sensory modalities, suggesting that the astrocyte would respond to neuronal activity in any of the sensory modalities, perhaps integrating across them. This study sets the stage for future studies that will generate a robust, functionally oriented connectome that includes both partners in neuronal circuits—the neurons and the glial cells, providing the foundation necessary for studies to elucidate neuron–glia interactions in this neuropil.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Mild carotid stenosis creates gradual, progressive, lifelong brain, and eye damage: An experimental laboratory rat model</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Mild carotid stenosis creates gradual, progressive, lifelong brain, and eye damage: An experimental laboratory rat model&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9566fb6b-678c-41e2-b65f-24cf6fe2765f/cne24851-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mild occlusion affects behavior, brain, and eyes morphology. Diffusion‐tensor imaging revealed brain abnormalities in both groups, but only bilateral rats show effects in the optic nerve. Histology revealed for those areas changes in astrocytes, microglia, and number of apoptotic cells. Bilateral occlusion produced a severe damage to both eyes while in unilateral the damage was only in the occluded side.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans, carotid stenosis of 70% and above might be the cause of clinical symptoms such as transient ischemic attack and stroke. No clinical or animal studies have evaluated mild carotid occlusion, and few examined unilateral occlusion. Here, Westar rats underwent bilateral or unilateral carotid occlusion of 28–45%. Long‐term effects were evaluated 9–11 months later. We conducted cognitive evaluation using spatial learning in a water maze and exploration behavior in an open field. Morphology of the brain was examined by MRI using diffusion‐tensor imaging (DTI) and immunohistochemistry staining of the brain and eyes. Cognitive deficit was found in spatial memory and exploration behavior in both occluded groups. Brain and eyes histology presented severe damage in the bilateral group, compared to the unilateral one. DTI revealed an increase in mean diffusivity (MD) in the ventral thalamus and a decrease in fractional anisotropy in optic nerve and optic tract in bilateral rats, while unilateral rats showed only an increase in MD in the ventral pons. In those areas, a significant change in astrocytes, microglia, and number of apoptotic cells were found. Bilateral occlusion produced severe damage to both retinas, while unilateral occlusion produced damage mainly in the occluded side. We found that mild carotid stenosis, even in a unilateral occlusion, creates behavioral abnormalities presented by brain and eye histopathology. The results support our hypothesis that gradual formation of mild carotid stenosis along the life course leads to progressive damage that may create different degenerative diseases at a later age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Expression and distribution of trophoblast glycoprotein in the mouse retina</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Expression and distribution of trophoblast glycoprotein in the mouse retina&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/24d2bc5e-3809-408b-81b2-a71d1b01fa42/cne24850-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trophoblast glycoprotein (TPBG) is a leucine‐rich repeat glycoprotein with an intracellular PDZ‐binding motif that is localized to the dendrites and axon terminals of retinal rod bipolar cells and in the cell body and dendrites of an uncharacterized amacrine cell. Immunofluorescent labeling of TPBG in rod bipolar cells is significantly reduced in the TRPM1 knockout retina, yet total retinal TPBG is constant. This suggests that antibody access may be blocked in certain activity states, possibly by TPBG binding to a PDZ protein in a light‐ or phosphorylation‐dependent manner.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently identified the leucine‐rich repeat (LRR) adhesion protein, trophoblast glycoprotein (TPBG), as a novel PKCα‐dependent phosphoprotein in retinal rod bipolar cells (RBCs). Since TPBG has not been thoroughly examined in the retina, this study characterizes the localization and expression patterns of TPBG in the developing and adult mouse retina using two antibodies, one against the N‐terminal LRR domain and the other against the C‐terminal PDZ‐interacting motif. Both antibodies labeled RBC dendrites in the outer plexiform layer and axon terminals in the IPL, as well as a putative amacrine cell with their cell bodies in the inner nuclear layer (INL) and a dense layer in the middle of the inner plexiform layer (IPL). In live transfected HEK293 cells, TPBG was localized to the plasma membrane with the N‐terminal LRR domain facing the extracellular space. TPBG immunofluorescence in RBCs was strongly altered by the loss of TRPM1 in the adult retina, with significantly less dendritic and axon terminal labeling in TRPM1 knockout compared to wild type, despite no change in total TPBG detected by immunoblotting. During retinal development, TPBG expression increases dramatically just prior to eye opening with a time course closely correlated with that of TRPM1 expression. In the retina, LRR proteins have been implicated in the development and maintenance of functional bipolar cell synapses, and TPBG may play a similar role in RBCs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Reorganization of longitudinal compartments in the laterally protruding paraflocculus of the postnatal mouse cerebellum</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Reorganization of longitudinal compartments in the laterally protruding paraflocculus of the postnatal mouse cerebellum&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/75da3991-2bd1-4d49-ad7a-b00e4770c44c/cne24849-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paraflocculus (PFl), neighbored by the flocculus (Fl) and copula pyramidis (Cop), forms remarkable protrusion between postnatal Days 1 and 7 (P1, P7) in the mouse cerebellum. The paravermal compartment of &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+ Purkinje cells (arrowheads) migrate laterally to become accommodated within the laterally oriented striped compartmentalization in the bulb‐shaped paraflocculus.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paraflocculus and the neighboring smaller flocculus form a remarkable protrusion in the ventrolateral aspect of the mouse cerebellum, in which the longitudinal compartments are conspicuously oriented perpendicularly to the sagittal plane. The developmental process of such anatomical arrangements in these lobules has not been fully clarified. Here, we used the genetic tractability of &lt;i&gt;pcdh10‐lacZ&lt;/i&gt; knock‐in (OL‐KO), &lt;i&gt;IP&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;R1‐nls‐lacZ&lt;/i&gt; transgenic (1NM13) and Gpr26cre‐Ai9‐AldocV mice to track the development of compartments and examined local longitudinal orientation of Purkinje cells within the paraflocculus and flocculus. We observed a distinct &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;‐positive (&lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+) compartment in the flocculus, whereas the paraflocculus and other lobules had a continuous paravermal &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+ compartment, in the embryonic OL‐KO cerebellum. During the first postnatal week, the parafloccular &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+ compartment shifted laterally to the most lateral edge in the caudal part of the protruding paraflocculus. Although the most medial edge of the parafloccular &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+ compartment remained in the nonprotruding part of the paraflocculus, it was disrupted from the originally continuous &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+ compartment in the copula pyramidis. The local longitudinal orientation changed gradually along with the mediolateral extent of the copula pyramidis, almost becoming perpendicular to the sagittal plane in the laterally connected paraflocculus in the adult cerebellum. This rotational change in orientation was derived from the short U‐shaped embryonic cerebellum, in which the surfaces of the flocculus and paraflocculus were oriented laterally. These results indicated that the peculiar compartmental organization of the paraflocculus originates from the embryonic common hemispheric compartmental organization and shaped by the significant reorganization process in the first postnatal week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Spatial models of cell distribution in human lumbar dorsal root ganglia&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7f4667d4-6dde-4d84-adcc-b61710495e1a/cne24848-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are novel targets for neural interface technologies that treat neurological disorders, such as chronic pain and spinal cord injury. The three‐dimensional cellular anatomy of DRG are not well‐mapped, particularly in humans, limiting the effectiveness of neurotechnology. We developed a semi‐automated algorithm to quantify the three‐dimensional distribution of neural elements in histologically‐processed tissue. We applied this algorithm to sequential NF200‐stained histology slices obtained from human lumbar DRG and demonstrated that cell bodies typically congregate around the dorsal edge of the ganglia. These results are crucial to the development of safe and effective clinical neural interface technologies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which contain the somata of primary sensory neurons, have increasingly been considered as novel targets for clinical neural interfaces, both for neuroprosthetic and pain applications. Effective use of either neural recording or stimulation technologies requires an appropriate spatial position relative to the target neural element, whether axon or cell body. However, the internal three‐dimensional spatial organization of human DRG neural fibers and somata has not been quantitatively described. In this study, we analyzed 202 cross‐sectional images across the length of 31 human L4 and L5 DRG from 10 donors. We used a custom semi‐automated graphical user interface to identify the locations of neural elements in the images and normalize the output to a consistent spatial reference for direct comparison by spinal level. By applying a recursive partitioning algorithm, we found that the highest density of cell bodies at both spinal levels could be found in the inner 85% of DRG length, the outer‐most 25–30% radially, and the dorsal‐most 69–76%. While axonal density was fairly homogeneous across the DRG length, there was a distinct low density region in the outer 7–11% radially. These findings are consistent with previous qualitative reports of neural distribution in DRG. The quantitative measurements we provide will enable improved targeting of future neural interface technologies and DRG‐focused pharmaceutical therapies, and provide a rigorous anatomical description of the bridge between the central and peripheral nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Ablation of spinal cord estrogen receptor α‐expressing interneurons reduces chemically induced modalities of pain and itch</title>

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estrogens underlie, at least in part, the greater pain sensitivity and chronic pain prevalence that women experience compared to men. Previous studies revealed populations of estrogen receptor‐expressing neurons in primary afferents and in superficial dorsal horn neurons, but there is limited information as to the contribution of these neurons to the generation of acute and chronic pain. Here we molecularly characterized neurons in the mouse superficial spinal cord dorsal horn that express estrogen receptor α (ERα) and explored the behavioral consequences of their ablation. The great majority of spinal ERα‐positive neurons are excitatory interneurons and many co‐express the neuropeptide, substance P. After viral, caspase‐mediated ablation of spinal ERα‐expressing cells, we did not observe changes in acute mechanical or heat pain processing, but recorded significant changes in the response to chemically‐evoked persistent pain behavior as well as pruritogen‐evoked itch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estrogens are presumed to underlie, at least in part, the greater pain sensitivity and chronic pain prevalence that women experience compared to men. Although previous studies revealed populations of estrogen receptor‐expressing neurons in primary afferents and in superficial dorsal horn neurons, there is little to no information as to the contribution of these neurons to the generation of acute and chronic pain. Here we molecularly characterized neurons in the mouse superficial spinal cord dorsal horn that express estrogen receptor α (ERα) and explored the behavioral consequences of their ablation. We found that spinal ERα‐positive neurons are largely excitatory interneurons and many coexpress substance P, a marker for a discrete subset of nociceptive, excitatory interneurons. After viral, caspase‐mediated ablation of spinal ERα‐expressing cells, we observed a significant decrease in the first phase of the formalin test, but in male mice only. ERα‐expressing neuron‐ablation also reduced pruritogen‐induced scratching in both male and female mice. There were no ablation‐related changes in mechanical or heat withdrawal thresholds or in capsaicin‐induced nocifensive behavior. In chronic pain models, we found no change in Complete Freund's adjuvant‐induced thermal or mechanical hypersensitivity, or in partial sciatic nerve injury‐induced mechanical allodynia. We conclude that ERα labels a subpopulation of excitatory interneurons that are specifically involved in chemically evoked persistent pain and pruritogen‐induced itch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Antibodies to the RNA binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 contribute to neuronal cell loss in an animal model of multiple sclerosis&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e1ebeb42-0341-416e-9652-453bc8908692/cne24845-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, in contrast to healthy controls make autoantibodies to the RNA binding protein heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1). Using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS, injections of anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies lead to increased neurodegeneration as shown by a loss of neuronal cell bodies in the ventral spinal cord (graph). We demonstrate that anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies localized within and surrounding neuronal cell bodies of the ventral spinal cord. In these areas we demonstrate that neurons display increased hnRNP A1 mislocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, increased stress granule formation while also expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Additionally, anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies were localized to CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; immune cells leading to an increase in iNOS in the surrounding tissue and subsequent neurodegeneration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurodegeneration, including loss of neurons and axons, is a feature of progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). The mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration are mostly unknown. Research implicates autoimmunity to nonmyelin self‐antigens as important contributors to disease pathogenesis. Data from our lab implicate autoimmunity to the RNA binding protein (RBP) heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) as a possible mechanism of neurodegeneration in MS. MS patients make antibodies to hnRNP A1, which have been shown to lead to neuronal dysfunction in vitro. Using an animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we show here that injection of anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies, in contrast to control antibodies, resulted in worsened disease and increased neurodegeneration. We found a reduction of NeuN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neuronal cell bodies in areas of the ventral gray matter of the spinal cord where anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies localized. Neurons displayed increased levels of hnRNP A1 nucleocytoplasmic mislocalization and stress granule formation, both markers of neuronal injury. Anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies were found to surround neuronal cell bodies and interact with CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; immune cells via Fc receptors. Additionally, anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies were found within neuronal cell bodies including those of the ventral spinocerebellar tract (VSCT), a tract previously shown to undergo neurodegeneration in anti‐hnRNP A1 antibody injected EAE mice. Finally, both immune cells and neurons showed increased levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase, another indicator of cell damage. These findings suggest that autoimmunity to RBPs, such as hnRNP A1, play a role in neurodegeneration in EAE with important implications for the pathogenesis of MS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Candidates for photic entrainment pathways to the circadian clock via optic lobe neuropils in the Madeira cockroach</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Candidates for photic entrainment pathways to the circadian clock via optic lobe neuropils in the Madeira cockroach&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ebf9b454-6a80-484a-9ced-5a9659241f56/cne24844-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the nocturnal Madeira cockroach, parallel photic entrainment pathways from the compound eye to the circadian clock in the accessory medulla (AME) control circadian rest‐activity rhythms. We hypothesize that UV light promotes sleep via activation of ipsilateral pigment‐dispersing factor‐releasing morning clock cells (aPDFMEs/pPDFMEs) mediated via interneurons (CRZ MNe) between medulla layers 2 and 4. In contrast, green light directly activates contralateral PDF evening clock cells in the lamina, promoting activity at night. In addition, rest‐activity rhythms may be entrained via extraocular photoreceptors terminating in the accessory laminae (ALA).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compound eye of cockroaches is obligatory for entrainment of the Madeira cockroach's circadian clock, but the cellular nature of its entrainment pathways is enigmatic. Employing multiple‐label immunocytochemistry, histochemistry, and backfills, we searched for photic entrainment pathways to the accessory medulla (AME), the circadian clock of the Madeira cockroach. We wanted to know whether photoreceptor terminals could directly contact pigment‐dispersing factor‐immunoreactive (PDF‐ir) circadian pacemaker neurons with somata in the lamina (PDFLAs) or somata next to the AME (PDFMEs). Short green‐sensitive photoreceptor neurons of the compound eye terminated in lamina layers LA1 and LA2, adjacent to PDFLAs and PDFMEs that branched in LA3. Long UV‐sensitive compound eye photoreceptor neurons terminated in medulla layer ME2 without direct contact to ipsilateral PDFMEs that arborized in ME4. Multiple neuropeptide‐ir interneurons branched in ME4, connecting the AME to ME2. Before, extraocular photoreceptors of the lamina organ were suggested to send terminals to accessory laminae. There, they overlapped with PDFLAs that mostly colocalized PDF, FMRFamide, and 5‐HT immunoreactivities, and with terminals of ipsi‐ and contralateral PDFMEs. We hypothesize that during the day cholinergic activation of the largest PDFME via lamina organ photoreceptors maintains PDF release orchestrating phases of sleep–wake cycles. As ipsilateral PDFMEs express excitatory and contralateral PDFMEs inhibitory PDF autoreceptors, diurnal PDF release keeps both PDF‐dependent clock circuits in antiphase. Future experiments will test whether ipsilateral PDFMEs are sleep‐promoting morning cells, while contralateral PDFMEs are activity‐promoting evening cells, maintaining stable antiphase via the largest PDFME entrained by extraocular photoreceptors of the lamina organ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Hippocampal shape is associated with memory deficits in temporal lobe epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25762?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25762?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive problems, especially disturbances in episodic memory, and hippocampal sclerosis are common in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) but little is known about the relationship of hippocampal morphology with memory. We aimed to relate hippocampal surface‐shape patterns to verbal and visual learning.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analysed hippocampal surface shapes on high‐resolution MRI images and the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery in 145 unilateral refractory TLE patients undergoing epilepsy surgery, a validation set of 55 unilateral refractory TLE patients and 39 age‐ and sex‐matched healthy volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both left (LTLE) and right (RTLE) TLE patients had lower verbal (LTLE 44 ± 11; RTLE 45 ± 10) and visual learning (LTLE 34 ± 8; RTLE 30 ± 8) scores than healthy controls (verbal 58 ± 8; visual 39 ± 6; p&amp;lt;0.001). Verbal learning was more impaired the greater the atrophy of the left superolateral hippocampal head. In contrast, visual memory was worse with greater bilateral inferiomedial hippocampal atrophy. Postsurgical verbal memory decline was more common in LTLE than in RTLE (reliable change index in LTLE 27% vs. RTLE 7%, p=0.006), whereas there were no differences in postsurgical visual memory decline between those groups. Preoperative atrophy of the left hippocampal tail predicted postsurgical verbal memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory deficits in TLE are associated with specific morphological alterations of the hippocampus, which could help stratify TLE patients into those at high vs. low risk of presurgical or postsurgical memory deficits. This knowledge could improve planning and prognosis of selective epilepsy surgery and neuropsychological counselling in TLE.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Genetically Elevated LDL Associates with Lower Risk of Intracerebral Hemorrhage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25740?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25740?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observational studies point to an inverse correlation between low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but it remains unclear whether this association is causal. We tested the hypothesis that genetically elevated LDL is associated with reduced risk of ICH.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We constructed one polygenic risk score (PRS) per lipid trait (total cholesterol, LDL, high‐density lipoprotein [HDL], and triglycerides) using independent genomewide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for each trait. We used data from 316,428 individuals enrolled in the UK Biobank to estimate the effect of each PRS on its corresponding trait, and data from 1,286 ICH cases and 1,261 matched controls to estimate the effect of each PRS on ICH risk. We used these estimates to conduct Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 410, 339, 393, and 317 lipid‐related SNPs for total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides, respectively. All four PRSs were strongly associated with their corresponding trait (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 1.00 × 10&lt;sup&gt;‐100&lt;/sup&gt;). While one SD increase in the PRSs for total cholesterol (odds ratio [OR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.85–0.99; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03) and LDL cholesterol (OR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.81–0.95; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002) were inversely associated with ICH risk, no significant associations were found for HDL and triglycerides (both &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). MR analyses indicated that 1mmol/L (38.67mg/dL) increase of genetically instrumented total and LDL cholesterol were associated with 23% (OR = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.65–0.98; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03) and 41% lower risks of ICH (OR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.42–0.82; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetically elevated LDL levels were associated with lower risk of ICH, providing support for a potential causal role of LDL cholesterol in ICH. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Systems Biology: Differential Expression of Plasma Exo-miRNA in Neurodegenerative Diseases by Next-Generation Sequencing</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a wide variety of pathological conditions caused by a loss of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and are severely debilitating. Exosome contains bio-signatures of great diagnostic and therapeutic value. There is proof that exosomal proteins can be biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). MicroRNAs in exosome has potential to be an important source of biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report exosomal microRNA performance of human plasma in neurodegenerative diseases by small RNA sequencing. A wide range of altered exo-miRNA expression levels were detected in both AD and PD patients. Down-regulated miRNAs in AD samples were enriched in ECM-receptor interaction pathway and both up-/down-regulated miRNAs in PD samples were enriched in fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. Compared to the control, 8 miRNAs were found to be significantly elevated/declined in AD and PD samples, of which 4 miRNAs were newly identified. Additionally, two exosome isolating methods were compared and the reproducibility of plasma exo-miRNA expression was confirmed, suggesting the feasibility of large-scale clinical application of this method. This study revealed exo-miRNA expression levels in neurodegenerative diseases, proposed new biomarkers and their potential functional pathway for AD and PD, confirmed the reproductivity of exo-miRNA profiles by using a different exosome isolating method, and compared the results with plasma miRNA expression. Therefore, this study also provides a precedent for identifying exosomal biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases in plasma by high-throughput sequencing and it could extend the therapeutic repertoire of exosomal biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Oxidative Stress-Induced Axon Fragmentation Is a Consequence of Reduced Axonal Transport in Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia SPAST Patient Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00401</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00401</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of inherited disorders characterized by progressive spasticity and paralysis of the lower limbs. Autosomal dominant mutations in SPAST gene account for ∼40% of adult-onset patients. We have previously shown that SPAST patient cells have reduced organelle transport and are therefore more sensitive to oxidative stress. To test whether these effects are present in neuronal cells, we first generated 11 induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines from fibroblasts of three healthy controls and three HSP patients with different SPAST mutations. These cells were differentiated into FOXG1-positive forebrain neurons and then evaluated for multiple aspects of axonal transport and fragmentation. Patient neurons exhibited reduced levels of SPAST encoded spastin, as well as a range of axonal deficits, including reduced levels of stabilized microtubules, lower peroxisome transport speed as a consequence of reduced microtubule-dependent transport, reduced number of peroxisomes, and higher density of axon swellings. Patient axons fragmented significantly more than controls following hydrogen peroxide exposure, suggesting for the first time that the SPAST patient axons are more sensitive than controls to the deleterious effects of oxidative stress. Treatment of patient neurons with tubulin-binding drugs epothilone D and noscapine rescued axon peroxisome transport and protected them against axon fragmentation induced by oxidative stress, showing that SPAST patient axons are vulnerable to oxidative stress-induced degeneration as a consequence of reduced axonal transport.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Sensory- and Action-Oriented Embodiment of Neurally-Interfaced Robotic Hand Prostheses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00389</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Embodiment is the percept that something not originally belonging to the self becomes part of the body. Feeling embodiment for a prosthesis may counteract amputees’ altered image of the body and increase prosthesis acceptability. Prosthesis embodiment has been studied longitudinally in an amputee receiving feedback through intraneural and perineural multichannel electrodes implanted in her stump. Three factors—invasive (vs non-invasive) stimulation, training, and anthropomorphism—have been tested through two multisensory integration tasks: visuo-tactile integration (VTI) and crossing-hand effect in temporal order judgment (TOJ), the former more sensible to an extension of a safe margin around the body and the latter to action-oriented remapping. Results from the amputee participant were compared with the ones from healthy controls. Testing the participant with intraneural stimulation produced an extension of peripersonal space, a sign of prosthesis embodiment. One-month training extended the peripersonal space selectively on the side wearing the prostheses. More and less-anthropomorphic prostheses benefited of intraneural feedback and extended the peripersonal space. However, the worsening of TOJ performance following arm crossing was present only wearing the more trained, despite less anthropomorphic, prosthesis, suggesting that training was critical for our participant to achieve operative tool-like embodiment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: EEG Functional Connectivity Underlying Emotional Valance and Arousal Using Minimum Spanning Trees</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00355</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00355</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, traditional methods such as power spectrum and amplitude analysis have been used to research the emotional electroencephalogram (EEG). The brain network method is also used in emotional EEG research, which can better reflect the activity of brains. A minimum spanning tree (MST) represents the key information flow in the weighted brain network, and it provides a sensitive method to capture subtle information in network organization while effectively avoiding the shortcomings of traditional brain networks. The DEAP dataset provides electroencephalogram (EEG) data for four categories of emotions: high arousal and high valence (HAHV), high arousal and low valence (HALV), low arousal and high valence (LAHV), and low arousal and low valence (LALV). Phase lag index (PLI) weighted matrices were calculated in five frequency bands. On this basis, the minimum spanning trees were constructed. At the same valence level in the gamma (γ) band, HAHV and HALV showed significant higher mean PLI (MPLI), maximum degree (Degree&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) and leaf fraction and significant lower diameter and eccentricity than LAHV and LALV. At the same arousal level in the γ band, HALV showed significant higher MPLI, Degree&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and leaf fraction and significant lower diameter and eccentricity than HAHV. These results indicate that the low-arousal showed more line-shaped configurations than the high-arousal. Additionally, in the high-arousal condition, a shift toward more star-shaped trees from high-valence to low-valence supports the trend toward randomness of the brain network with negative emotions and that the brain is more activated when faced with negative emotions. From a brain network perspective, this phenomenon provides a theoretical basis for negative bias.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Resting State EEG in Exercise Intervention Studies: A Systematic Review of Effects and Methods</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00155</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00155</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Exercise has been shown to alter brain plasticity and is explored as a therapeutic intervention in a wide variety of neurological diseases. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers an inexpensive method of studying brain electrocortical activity shortly after exercise and thus offers a way of exploring the influence of exercise on the brain. We conducted a systematic review to summarize the current body of evidence regarding methods of EEG analysis and the reported effects of exercise interventions on EEG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE were searched for studies investigating resting state EEG in exercise intervention studies carried out in participants &amp;gt;17 years of age and with no history of epilepsy. Further, studies solely investigating event-related potentials as an outcome measure were excluded. Relevant data were extracted, and a risk-of-bias assessment was carried out using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A qualitative synthesis of results was carried out. A protocol for the systematic review was uploaded to https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ (ID: CRD42019134570) and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) statement was followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Out of 1,993 records screened, 54 studies were included in a final qualitative synthesis with a total of 1,445 participants. Our synthesis showed that studies were mainly carried out using frequency analysis as an analytical method. Generally, findings across studies were inconsistent and few were adjusted for multiple comparisons. Studies were mainly of low quality and usually carried out in small populations, lowering the significance of results reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Changes in the EEG as a result of an exercise intervention are elusive and difficult to replicate. Future studies should provide biologically sound hypotheses underlying assumptions, include larger populations and use standardized EEG methods to increase replicability. EEG remains an interesting methodology to examine the effects of exercise on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Functional neurological disorders are characterized by neurological symptoms that have no identifiable pathology and little is known about their underlying pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;To analyze motor cortex excitability and intracortical inhibitory and excitatory circuits’ imbalance in patients with flaccid functional weakness.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one consecutive patients with acute onset of flaccid functional weakness were recruited. Single and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols were used to analyze resting motor thresholds (RMT) and intracortical inhibitory (short interval intracortical inhibition – SICI) and excitatory (intracortical facilitation – ICF) circuits’ imbalance between the affected and non-affected motor cortices.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We observed a significant increase in RMT and SICI in the affected motor cortex (p &amp;lt; 0.001), but not for ICF, compared to the contralateral unaffected side.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study extends current knowledge of functional weakness, arguing for a specific central nervous system abnormality which may be involved in the symptoms’ pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Plasticity of Persistent Activity and Its Constraints</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00015</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stimulus information is maintained in working memory by action potentials that persist after the stimulus is no longer physically present. The prefrontal cortex is a critical brain area that maintains such persistent activity due to an intrinsic network with unique synaptic connectivity, NMDA receptors, and interneuron types. Persistent activity can be highly plastic depending on task demands but it also appears in naïve subjects, not trained or required to perform a task at all. Here, we review what aspects of persistent activity remain constant and what factors can modify it, focusing primarily on neurophysiological results from non-human primate studies. Changes in persistent activity are constrained by anatomical location, with more ventral and more anterior prefrontal areas exhibiting the greatest capacity for plasticity, as opposed to posterior and dorsal areas, which change relatively little with training. Learning to perform a cognitive task for the first time, further practicing the task, and switching between learned tasks can modify persistent activity. The ability of the prefrontal cortex to generate persistent activity also depends on age, with changes noted between adolescence, adulthood, and old age. Mean firing rates, variability and correlation of persistent discharges, but also time-varying firing rate dynamics are altered by these factors. Plastic changes in the strength of intrinsic network connections can be revealed by the analysis of synchronous spiking between neurons. These results are essential for understanding how the prefrontal cortex mediates working memory and intelligent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Genome-Wide Screen of the Hippocampus in Aged Rats Identifies Mitochondria, Metabolism and Aging Processes Implicated in Sevoflurane Anesthesia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00122</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown multiple mechanisms and pathophysiological changes after anesthesia, and genome-wide studies have been implemented in the studies of brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the genome-wide gene expression patterns and modulation networks after general anesthesia remains to be elucidated. Therefore, whole transcriptome microarray analysis was used to explore the coding gene expression patterns in the hippocampus of aged rats after sevoflurane anesthesia. Six hundred and thirty one upregulated and 183 downregulated genes were screened out, then 44 enriched terms of biological process, 16 of molecular function and 18 of the cellular components were identified by Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG analysis. Among them, oxidative stress, metabolism, aging, and neurodegeneration were the most enriched biological processes and changed functions. Thus, involved genes of these processes were selected for qPCR verification and a good consistency was confirmed. The potential signaling pathways were further constructed including mitochondrion and oxidative stress-related Hifs-Prkcd-Akt-Nfe2l2-Sod1 signaling, multiple metabolism signaling (Scd2, Scap-Hmgcs2, Aldh18a1-Glul and Igf1r), as well as aging and neurodegeneration related signaling (Spidr-Ercc4-Cdkn1a-Pmaip1 and Map1lc3b). These results provide potential therapeutic gene targets for brain function modulation and memory formation process after inhaled anesthesia in the elderly, which could be valuable for preventing postoperative brain disorders and diseases, such as perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND), from the genetic level in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Gender Differences in Neurodegeneration, Neuroinflammation and Na+-Ca2+ Exchangers in the Female A53T Transgenic Mouse Model of Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00118</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Twelve-month-old male mice expressing the human A53T variant of α-synuclein (A53T) develop dopamine neuron degeneration, neuroinflammation, and motor deficits, along with dysfunctions of the mitochondrial Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; exchanger (NCX) isoforms 1 (NCX1) and 3 (NCX3) in the nigrostriatal system. Since gender is thought to play a role in the etiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD), we characterized neurochemical and behavioral alterations in 12-month-old female A53T transgenic mice. We investigated the presence of dopaminergic degeneration, astrogliosis and microgliosis using immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (IBA-1) in both the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and striatum. In the same regions, we also evaluated the co-localization of NCX1 in cells positive for IBA-1 and the co-localization of NCX3 in TH-positive neurons and fibers. Furthermore, in both male and female mice, we performed motor (beam walking and pole tests) and memory [novel object recognition (NOR) and spontaneous alternation] tasks, together with tests to evaluate peripheral deficits (olfactory and stool collection tests). Female A53T transgenic mice displayed degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons, but neither microgliosis nor astrogliosis in the SNc and striatum. Moreover, female A53T transgenic mice displayed co-localization between NCX1 and IBA-1 positive cells in the striatum but not SNc, whereas NCX3 did not co-localize with either TH-positive terminals or neuronal bodies in the nigrostriatal system. Furthermore, female A53T transgenic mice showed increased crossing time in the beam walking test, but no impairments in the pole or memory tests, and in tests that evaluated peripheral deficits, whereas male A53T transgenic mice displayed motor, memory and peripheral deficits. Immunohistochemical and behavioral results obtained here in the female mice differ from those previously observed in males, and suggest a dissimilar influence of NCX1 and NCX3 on dopaminergic function in female and male A53T transgenic mice, strengthening the validity of these mice as a model for studying the etiological factors of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Related Changes in Pain Perception Are Associated With Altered Functional Connectivity During Resting State</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging affects pain experience and brain functioning. However, how aging leads to changes in pain perception and brain functional connectivity has not yet been completely understood. To investigate resting-state and pain perception changes in old and young participants, this study employed region of interest (ROI) to ROI resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis of imaging data by using regions implicated in sensory and affective dimensions of pain, descending pain modulation, and the default-mode networks (DMNs). Thirty-seven older (66.86 ± 4.04 years; 16 males) and 38 younger healthy participants (20.74 ± 4.15 years; 19 males) underwent 10 min’ eyes-closed resting-state scanning. We examined the relationship between rsFC parameters with pressure pain thresholds. Older participants showed higher pain thresholds than younger. Regarding rsFC, older adults displayed increased connectivity of pain-related sensory brain regions in comparison to younger participants: increased rsFC between bilateral primary somatosensory area (SI) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and between SI(L) and secondary somatosensory area (SII)-(R) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). Moreover, decreased connectivity in the older compared to the younger group was found among descending pain modulatory regions: between the amygdala(R) and bilateral insula(R), thalamus(R), ACC, and amygdala(L); between the amygdala(L) and insula(R) and bilateral thalamus; between ACC and bilateral insula, and between periaqueductal gray (PAG) and bilateral thalamus. Regarding the DMN, the posterior parietal cortex and lateral parietal (LP; R) were more strongly connected in the older group than in the younger group. Correlational analyses also showed that SI(L)-SII(R) rsFC was positively associated with pressure pain thresholds in older participants. In conclusion, these findings suggest a compensatory mechanism for the sensory changes that typically accompanies aging. Furthermore, older participants showed reduced functional connectivity between key nodes of the descending pain inhibitory pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a hereditary cerebral small vessel disease caused by mutations in NOTCH3, is characterized by recurrent stroke without vascular risk factors, mood disturbances, and dementia. MRI imaging shows cerebral white matter (WM) hyperintensity, particularly in the external capsule and temporal pole. Missense mutations related to a cysteine residue in the 34 EGFr on the NOTCH3 extracellular domain (N3ECD) are a typical mutation of CADASIL. On the other hand, atypical mutations including cysteine sparing mutation, null mutation, homozygous mutation, and other associate genes are also reported. From the viewpoint of gain of function apart from Notch signaling or loss of function of Notch signaling, we review the research article about CADASIL and summarized the pathogenesis of small vessel, stroke, and dementia in this disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Structural changes in pre and postsynaptic neurons that accompany synapse formation often temporally and spatially overlap. Thus, it has been difficult to resolve which processes drive patterned connectivity. To overcome this, we use the laminated outer murine retina. We identify the serine/threonine kinase LKB1 as a key driver of synapse layer emergence. The absence of LKB1 in the retina caused a marked mislocalization and delay in synapse layer formation. In parallel, LKB1 modulated postsynaptic horizontal cell refinement and presynaptic photoreceptor axon growth. Mislocalized horizontal cell processes contacted aberrant cone axons in LKB1 mutants. These defects coincided with altered synapse protein organization, and horizontal cell neurites were misdirected to ectopic synapse protein regions. Together, these data suggest that LKB1 instructs the timing and location of connectivity in the outer retina via coordinate regulation of pre and postsynaptic neuron structure and the localization of synapse-associated proteins.</description>

	<title>eLife: Essential function of the alveolin network in the subpellicular microtubules and conoid assembly in Toxoplasma gondii</title>

	<description>The coccidian subgroup of Apicomplexa possesses an apical complex harboring a conoid, made of unique tubulin polymer fibers. This enigmatic organelle extrudes in extracellular invasive parasites and is associated to the apical polar ring (APR). The APR serves as microtubule-organizing center for the 22 subpellicular microtubules (SPMTs) that are linked to a patchwork of flattened vesicles, via an intricate network composed of alveolins. Here, we capitalize on ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) to localize the &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; Apical Cap protein 9 (AC9) and its partner AC10, identified by BioID, to the alveolin network and intercalated between the SPMTs. Parasites conditionally depleted in AC9 or AC10 replicate normally but are defective in microneme secretion and fail to invade and egress from infected cells. Electron microscopy revealed that the mature parasite mutants are conoidless, while U-ExM highlighted the disorganization of the SPMTs which likely results in the catastrophic loss of APR and conoid.</description>

	<title>eLife: Temporal integration of auxin information for the regulation of patterning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.55832</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55832</link>
	<description>Positional information is essential for coordinating the development of multicellular organisms. In plants, positional information provided by the hormone auxin regulates rhythmic organ production at the shoot apex, but the spatio-temporal dynamics of auxin gradients is unknown. We used quantitative imaging to demonstrate that auxin carries high-definition graded information not only in space but also in time. We show that, during organogenesis, temporal patterns of auxin arise from rhythmic centrifugal waves of high auxin travelling through the tissue faster than growth. We further demonstrate that temporal integration of auxin concentration is required to trigger the auxin-dependent transcription associated with organogenesis. This provides a mechanism to temporally differentiate sites of organ initiation and exemplifies how spatio-temporal positional information can be used to create rhythmicity.</description>

	<title>eLife: Auditory cortical alpha/beta desynchronization prioritizes the representation of memory items during a retention period</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.55508</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55508</link>
	<description>To-be-memorized information in working-memory could be protected against distracting influences by processes of functional inhibition or prioritization. Modulations of oscillations in the alpha to beta range in task-relevant sensory regions have been suggested to play an important role for both mechanisms. We adapted a Sternberg task variant to the auditory modality, with a strong or a weak distracting sound presented at a predictable time during the retention period. Using a time-generalized decoding approach relatively decreased strength of memorized information was found prior to strong distractors, paralleled by decreased pre-distractor alpha / beta power in the left superior temporal gyrus (lSTG). Over the entire group, reduced beta power in lSTG was associated with relatively increased strength of memorized information. The extent of alpha power modulations within participants was negatively correlated strength of memorized information. Overall our results are compatible with a prioritization account, however point to nuanced differences between alpha and beta oscillations.</description>

	<title>eLife: Spen links RNA-mediated endogenous retrovirus silencing and X chromosome inactivation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.54508</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54508</link>
	<description>The Xist lncRNA mediates X chromosome inactivation (XCI)&lt;sup&gt;1,2&lt;/sup&gt;. Here we show that Spen, an Xist-binding repressor protein essential for XCI&lt;sup&gt;3-9&lt;/sup&gt;, binds to ancient retroviral RNA, performing a surveillance role to recruit chromatin silencing machinery to these parasitic loci. Spen inactivation activates a subset of endogenous retroviral (ERV) elements in mouse embryonic stem cells, with gain of chromatin accessibility, active histone modifications, and ERV RNA transcription. Spen binds directly to ERV RNAs that show structural similarity to the A-repeat of Xist, a region critical for Xist-mediated gene silencing&lt;sup&gt;10-11&lt;/sup&gt;. ERV RNA and Xist A-repeat bind the RRM domains of Spen in a competitive manner. Insertion of an ERV into an A-repeat deficient Xist rescues binding of Xist RNA to Spen and results in strictly local gene silencing in cis. These results suggest that Xist may coopt transposable element RNA-protein interactions to repurpose powerful antiviral chromatin silencing machinery for sex chromosome dosage compensation.</description>

	<title>eLife: Recurrent circuit dynamics underlie persistent activity in the macaque frontoparietal network</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.52460</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/52460</link>
	<description>During delayed oculomotor response tasks, neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) and the frontal eye fields (FEF) exhibit persistent activity that reflects the active maintenance of behaviorally relevant information. Despite many computational models of the mechanisms of persistent activity, there is a lack of circuit-level data from the primate to inform the theories. To fill this gap, we simultaneously recorded ensembles of neurons in both LIP and FEF while macaques performed a memory-guided saccade task. A population encoding model revealed strong and symmetric long-timescale recurrent excitation between LIP and FEF. Unexpectedly, LIP exhibited stronger local functional connectivity than FEF, and many neurons in LIP had longer network and intrinsic timescales. The differences in connectivity could be explained by the strength of recurrent dynamics in attractor networks. These findings reveal reciprocal multi-area circuit dynamics in the frontoparietal network during persistent activity and lay the groundwork for quantitative comparisons to theoretical models.</description>

	<title>eLife: Quantifying antibiotic impact on within-patient dynamics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.49206</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49206</link>
	<description>Antibiotic-induced perturbation of the human gut flora is expected to play an important role in mediating the relationship between antibiotic use and the population prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, but little is known about how antibiotics affect within-host resistance dynamics. Here we develop a data-driven model of the within-host dynamics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt;. We use bla&lt;sub&gt;CTX-M&lt;/sub&gt; (the most widespread ESBL gene family) and 16S rRNA (a proxy for bacterial load) abundance data from 833 rectal swabs from 133 ESBL-positive patients followed up in a prospective cohort study in three European hospitals. We find that cefuroxime and ceftriaxone are associated with increased bla&lt;sub&gt;CTX-M&lt;/sub&gt; abundance during treatment (21% and 10% daily increase, respectively), while treatment with meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and oral ciprofloxacin is associated with decreased bla&lt;sub&gt;CTX-M&lt;/sub&gt; (8% daily decrease for all). The model predicts that typical antibiotic exposures can have substantial long-term effects on bla&lt;sub&gt;CTX-M&lt;/sub&gt; carriage duration.</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Genuine cross-frequency coupling networks in human resting-state electrophysiological recordings</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Felix Siebenhühner, Sheng H. Wang, Gabriele Arnulfo, Anna Lampinen, Lino Nobili, J. Matias Palva, Satu Palva&lt;/p&gt;

Phase synchronization of neuronal oscillations in specific frequency bands coordinates anatomically distributed neuronal processing and communication. Typically, oscillations and synchronization take place concurrently in many distinct frequencies, which serve separate computational roles in cognitive functions. While within-frequency phase synchronization has been studied extensively, less is known about the mechanisms that govern neuronal processing distributed across frequencies and brain regions. Such integration of processing between frequencies could be achieved via cross-frequency coupling (CFC), either by phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) or by &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-cross–frequency phase synchrony (CFS). So far, studies have mostly focused on local CFC in individual brain regions, whereas the presence and functional organization of CFC between brain areas have remained largely unknown. We posit that interareal CFC may be essential for large-scale coordination of neuronal activity and investigate here whether genuine CFC networks are present in human resting-state (RS) brain activity. To assess the functional organization of CFC networks, we identified brain-wide CFC networks at mesoscale resolution from stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) and at macroscale resolution from source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We developed a novel, to our knowledge, graph-theoretical method to distinguish genuine CFC from spurious CFC that may arise from nonsinusoidal signals ubiquitous in neuronal activity. We show that genuine interareal CFC is present in human RS activity in both SEEG and MEG data. Both CFS and PAC networks coupled theta and alpha oscillations with higher frequencies in large-scale networks connecting anterior and posterior brain regions. CFS and PAC networks had distinct spectral patterns and opposing distribution of low- and high-frequency network hubs, implying that they constitute distinct CFC mechanisms. The strength of CFS networks was also predictive of cognitive performance in a separate neuropsychological assessment. In conclusion, these results provide evidence for interareal CFS and PAC being 2 distinct mechanisms for coupling oscillations across frequencies in large-scale brain networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/iApG8yeSIYU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: In search of common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and subplate</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24922?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24922?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;In search of common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and subplate&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9d019221-95c1-430d-b14e-455e63f242d6/cne24922-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarities in gene expression patterns prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity, and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Almost all of the markers we examined that were expressed in the subplate/Layer 6b were also expressed in the claustral complex, but not all claustrum specific or enriched genes were expressed in subplate/Layer 6b, suggesting overall similarities, but also some differences. There are numerous similarities between the adult connectivity patters of Layer 6b and claustrum. In particular, both have extensive cortical connections. However, there are differences in the relative strength of their reciprocal connectivity with various other structures in the adult. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human claustrum, a major hub of widespread neocortical connections, is a thin, bilateral sheet of gray matter located between the insular cortex and the striatum. The subplate is a largely transient cortical structure that contains some of the earliest generated neurons of the cerebral cortex and has important developmental functions to establish intra‐ and extracortical connections. In human and macaque some subplate cells undergo regulated cell death, but some remain as interstitial white matter cells. In mouse and rat brains a compact layer is formed, Layer 6b, and it remains underneath the cortex, adjacent to the white matter. Whether Layer 6b in rodents is homologous to primate subplate or interstitial white matter cells is still debated. Gene expression patterns, such as those of &lt;i&gt;Nurr1/Nr4a2&lt;/i&gt;, have suggested that the rodent subplate and the persistent subplate cells in Layer 6b and the claustrum might have similar origins. Moreover, the birthdates of the claustrum and Layer 6b are similarly precocious in mice. These observations prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity, and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Nimodipine Reduces Dysfunction and Demyelination in Models of Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25749?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25749?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment of relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) has not advanced beyond steroid use, which reduces acute loss of function, but has little effect on residual disability. Acute loss of function in an MS model (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [EAE]) is partly due to central nervous system (CNS) hypoxia, and function can promptly improve upon breathing oxygen. Here, we investigate the cause of the hypoxia and whether it is due to a deficit in oxygen supply arising from impaired vascular perfusion. We also explore whether the CNS‐selective vasodilating agent, nimodipine, may provide a therapy to restore function, and protect from demyelination in 2 MS models.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of methods have been used to measure basic cardiovascular physiology, spinal oxygenation, mitochondrial function, and tissue perfusion in EAE.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report that the tissue hypoxia in EAE is associated with a profound hypoperfusion of the inflamed spinal cord. Treatment with nimodipine restores spinal oxygenation and can rapidly improve function. Nimodipine therapy also reduces demyelination in both EAE and a model of the early MS lesion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss of function in EAE, and demyelination in EAE, and the model of the early MS lesion, seem to be due, at least in part, to tissue hypoxia due to local spinal hypoperfusion. Therapy to improve blood flow not only protects neurological function but also reduces demyelination. We conclude that nimodipine could be repurposed to offer substantial clinical benefit in MS.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Longitudinal Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis with the Brain‐Age Paradigm</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25746?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25746?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the natural course of multiple sclerosis (MS), the brain is exposed to aging as well as disease effects. Brain aging can be modeled statistically; the so‐called “brain‐age” paradigm. Here, we evaluated whether brain‐predicted age difference (brain‐PAD) was sensitive to the presence of MS, clinical progression, and future outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a longitudinal, multicenter sample of 3,565 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, in 1,204 patients with MS and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and 150 healthy controls (mean follow‐up time: patients 3.41 years, healthy controls 1.97 years), we measured “brain‐predicted age” using T1‐weighted MRI. We compared brain‐PAD among patients with MS and patients with CIS and healthy controls, and between disease subtypes. Relationships between brain‐PAD and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) were explored.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with MS had markedly higher brain‐PAD than healthy controls (mean brain‐PAD +10.3 years; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.5–12.1] versus 4.3 years; 95% CI = 2.1 to 6.4; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). The highest brain‐PADs were in secondary‐progressive MS (+13.3 years; 95% CI = 11.3–15.3). Brain‐PAD at study entry predicted time‐to‐disability progression (hazard ratio 1.02; 95% CI = 1.01–1.03; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001); although normalized brain volume was a stronger predictor. Greater annualized brain‐PAD increases were associated with greater annualized EDSS score (r = 0.26; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain‐age paradigm is sensitive to MS‐related atrophy and clinical progression. A higher brain‐PAD at baseline was associated with more rapid disability progression and the rate of change in brain‐PAD related to worsening disability. Potentially, “brain‐age” could be used as a prognostic biomarker in early‐stage MS, to track disease progression or stratify patients for clinical trial enrollment.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science and medicine aim to identify verifiable and replicable truths. However, the paths to such truths are frequently characterised by swinging pendulums of opposing perspectives. This is especially so in human neuroscience and the brain‐based clinical sciences, where the target of investigation is the most complex of all biological systems. This paper overviews a set of interrelated neuroscientific and clinical hypotheses, models, experiments and predictions with which I have been involved for the last two decades. Traversing visual neuroscience, consciousness science, genetics, chronobiology, and biological and clinical psychiatry, the work illustrates how developments in science and medicine can occur through a combination of synthesis, serendipity and experimentation. The paper also reflects on doing science with the inimitable John ‘Jack’ Pettigrew, and outlines how Pettigrew and I conceived, proposed, tested and developed two new scientific models — one on neural mechanisms of binocular rivalry, the other on the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. I also provide an update on various aspects of our models and data, and describe lessons learned from Pettigrew on how perspectives in science exhibit their own fluctuations, ironically like the very phenomena on which we worked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dorsal column nuclei complex (DCN‐complex) includes the dorsal column nuclei (DCN, referring to the gracile and cuneate nuclei collectively), external cuneate, X, and Z nuclei, and the median accessory nucleus. The DCN are organised by both somatotopy and modality, and have a diverse range of afferent inputs and projection targets. The functional organisation and connectivity of the DCN implicate them in a variety of sensorimotor functions, beyond their commonly accepted role in processing and transmitting somatosensory information to the thalamus, yet this is largely underappreciated in the literature. To consolidate insights into their sensorimotor functions, this review examines the morphology, organisation, and connectivity of the DCN and their associated nuclei. First, we briefly discuss the receptors, afferent fibres, and pathways involved in conveying tactile and proprioceptive information to the DCN. Next, we review the modality and somatotopic arrangements of the remaining constituents of the DCN‐complex. Finally, we examine and discuss the functional implications of the myriad of DCN‐complex projection targets throughout the diencephalon, midbrain, and hindbrain, in addition to their modulatory inputs from the cortex. The organisation and connectivity of the DCN‐complex suggest that these nuclei should be considered a complex integration and distribution hub for sensorimotor information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central complex (CX) in the insect brain is a higher order integration center that controls a number of behaviors, most prominently goal directed locomotion. The CX comprises the protocerebral bridge (PB), the upper division of the central body (CBU), the lower division of the central body (CBL), and the paired noduli (NO). Although spatial orientation has been extensively studied in honeybees at the behavioral level, most electrophysiological and anatomical analyses have been carried out in other insect species, leaving the morphology and physiology of neurons that constitute the CX in the honeybee mostly enigmatic. The goal of this study was to morphologically identify neuronal cell types of the CX in the honeybee &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt;. By performing iontophoretic dye injections into the CX, we traced 16 subtypes of neuron that connect a subdivision of the CX with other regions in the bee`s central brain, and eight subtypes that mainly interconnect different subdivisions of the CX. They establish extensive connections between the CX and the lateral complex, the superior protocerebrum and the posterior protocerebrum. Characterized neuron classes and subtypes are morphologically similar to those described in other insects, suggesting considerable conservation in the neural network relevant for orientation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The past decade has witnessed an explosion in applications for neural recording and stimulation in the treatment of clinical disorders. Neuromodulatory approaches are now a mainstay of care for essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease, and are expanding rapidly into a wide range of other neurological and psychiatric diseases. In parallel, advancements in endovascular approaches to cerebrovascular diseases have resulted in minimally invasive techniques that deliver devices to neural tissue in the central and peripheral nervous systems, with significantly improved safety and efficacy. In this review, we discuss the history of endovascular neural recording and stimulation, its current progress, and applications for neurological disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Deep Learning Provides Exceptional Accuracy to ECoG-Based Functional Language Mapping for Epilepsy Surgery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00409</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The success of surgical resection in epilepsy patients depends on preserving functionally critical brain regions, while removing pathological tissues. Being the gold standard, electro-cortical stimulation mapping (ESM) helps surgeons in localizing the function of eloquent cortex through electrical stimulation of electrodes placed directly on the cortical brain surface. Due to the potential hazards of ESM, including increased risk of provoked seizures, electrocorticography based functional mapping (ECoG-FM) was introduced as a safer alternative approach. However, ECoG-FM has a low success rate when compared to the ESM. In this study, we address this critical limitation by developing a new algorithm based on deep learning for ECoG-FM and thereby we achieve an accuracy comparable to ESM in identifying eloquent language cortex. In our experiments, with 11 epilepsy patients who underwent presurgical evaluation (through deep learning-based signal analysis on 637 electrodes), our proposed algorithm obtained an accuracy of 83.05% in identifying language regions, an exceptional 23% improvement with respect to the conventional ECoG-FM analysis (∼60%). Our findings have demonstrated, for the first time, that deep learning powered ECoG-FM can serve as a stand-alone modality and avoid likely hazards of the ESM in epilepsy surgery. Hence, reducing the potential for developing post-surgical morbidity in the language function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Harmonization of Brain Diffusion MRI: Concepts and Methods</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00396</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00396</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;MRI diffusion data suffers from significant inter- and intra-site variability, which hinders multi-site and/or longitudinal diffusion studies. This variability may arise from a range of factors, such as hardware, reconstruction algorithms and acquisition settings. To allow a reliable comparison and joint analysis of diffusion data across sites and over time, there is a clear need for robust data harmonization methods. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of diffusion data harmonization concepts and methods, and their limitations. Overall, the methods for the harmonization of multi-site diffusion images can be categorized in two main groups: diffusion parametric map harmonization (DPMH) and diffusion weighted image harmonization (DWIH). Whereas DPMH harmonizes the diffusion parametric maps (e.g., FA, MD, and MK), DWIH harmonizes the diffusion-weighted images. Defining a gold standard harmonization technique for dMRI data is still an ongoing challenge. Nevertheless, in this paper we provide two classification tools, namely a feature table and a flowchart, which aim to guide the readers in selecting an appropriate harmonization method for their study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Myriocin Effect on Tvrm4 Retina, an Autosomal Dominant Pattern of Retinitis Pigmentosa</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00372</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00372</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tvrm4 mice, a model of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP), carry a mutation of Rhodopsin gene that can be activated by brief exposure to very intense light. Here, we test the possibility of an anatomical, metabolic, and functional recovery by delivering to degenerating Tvrm4 animals, Myriocin, an inhibitor of ceramide de novo synthesis previously shown to effectively slow down retinal degeneration in rd10 mutants (Strettoi et al., 2010; Piano et al., 2013). Different routes and durations of Myriocin administration were attempted by using either single intravitreal (i.v.) or long-term, repeated intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections. The retinal function of treated and control animals was tested by ERG recordings. Retinas from ERG-recorded animals were studied histologically to reveal the extent of photoreceptor death. A correlation was observed between Myriocin administration, lowering of retinal ceramides, and preservation of ERG responses in i.v. injected cases. Noticeably, the i.p. treatment with Myriocin decreased the extension of the retinal-degenerating area, preserved the ERG response, and correlated with decreased levels of biochemical indicators of retinal oxidative damage. The results obtained in this study confirm the efficacy of Myriocin in slowing down retinal degeneration in genetic models of RP independently of the underlying mutation responsible for the disease, likely targeting ceramide-dependent, downstream pathways. Alleviation of retinal oxidative stress upon Myriocin treatment suggests that this molecule, or yet unidentified metabolites, act on cellular detoxification systems supporting cell survival. Altogether, the pharmacological approach chosen here meets the necessary pre-requisites for translation into human therapy to slow down RP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Analyzing Brain Connectivity in the Mutual Regulation of Emotion–Movement Using Bidirectional Granger Causality</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Body language and movement are important media of emotional expression. There is an interactive physiological relationship between emotion and movement. Thus, we hypothesize that the emotional cortex interacts with the motor cortex during the mutual regulation of emotion and movement. And this interaction can be revealed by brain connectivity analysis based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing. We proposed a brain connectivity analysis method: bidirectional long short-term memory Granger causality (bi-LSTM-GC). The theoretical basis of the proposed method was Granger causality estimation using a bidirectional LSTM recurrent neural network (RNN) for solving nonlinear parameters. Then, we compared the accuracy of the bi-LSTM-GC with other unidirectional connectivity methods. The results demonstrated that the information interaction existed among multiple brain regions (EEG 10-20 system) in the paradigm of emotion–movement regulation. The detected directional dependencies in EEG signals were mainly distributed from the frontal to the central region and from the prefrontal to the central–parietal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Historically, neuroscience principles have heavily influenced artificial intelligence (AI), for example the influence of the perceptron model, essentially a simple model of a biological neuron, on artificial neural networks. More recently, notable recent AI advances, for example the growing popularity of reinforcement learning, often appear more aligned with cognitive neuroscience or psychology, focusing on function at a relatively abstract level. At the same time, neuroscience stands poised to enter a new era of large-scale high-resolution data and appears more focused on underlying neural mechanisms or architectures that can, at times, seem rather removed from functional descriptions. While this might seem to foretell a new generation of AI approaches arising from a deeper exploration of neuroscience specifically for AI, the most direct path for achieving this is unclear. Here we discuss cultural differences between the two fields, including divergent priorities that should be considered when leveraging modern-day neuroscience for AI. For example, the two fields feed two very different applications that at times require potentially conflicting perspectives. We highlight small but significant cultural shifts that we feel would greatly facilitate increased synergy between the two fields.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Neuroprotective Effects of Diabetes Drugs for the Treatment of Neonatal Hypoxia-Ischemia Encephalopathy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The perinatal period represents a time of great vulnerability for the developing brain. A variety of injuries can result in death or devastating injury causing profound neurocognitive deficits. Hypoxic-ischemic neonatal encephalopathy (HIE) remains the leading cause of brain injury in term infants during the perinatal period with limited options available to aid in recovery. It can result in long-term devastating consequences with neurologic complications varying from mild behavioral deficits to severe seizure, intellectual disability, and/or cerebral palsy in the newborn. Despite medical advances, the only viable option is therapeutic hypothermia which is classified as the gold standard but is not used, or may not be as effective in preterm cases, infection-associated cases or low resource settings. Therefore, alternatives or adjunct therapies are urgently needed. Ongoing research continues to advance our understanding of the mechanisms contributing to perinatal brain injury and identify new targets and treatments. Drugs used for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have demonstrated neuroprotective properties and therapeutic efficacy from neurological sequelae following HIE insults in preclinical models, both alone, or in combination with induced hypothermia. In this short review, we have focused on recent findings on the use of diabetes drugs that provide a neuroprotective effect using in vitro and in vivo models of HIE that could be considered for clinical translation as a promising treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Effectiveness and Safety of Acupuncture for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00098</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00098</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The effects of acupuncture on Alzheimer's disease (AD) outcomes remain controversial. The aim of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Chinese BioMedical Literature Database, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Data were searched to identify relevant randomized controlled trials from inception to January 19, 2019. Data were extracted and evaluated by two authors independently. The data analysis was conducted using R (version 3.6.0) and RStudio (version 1.2.1335) software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Thirty trials involving 2,045 patients were included. Acupuncture plus drug therapy may have been more beneficial for general cognitive function in AD patients than drug therapy alone (short-term treatment: MD, mean difference = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.11, 2.77; p &amp;lt; 0.01; medium-term treatment: MD = 4.41, 95% CI: 1.83, 7.00; p &amp;lt; 0.01). People who received acupuncture plus drug therapy attained higher ADL (Activities of Daily Living) scores than patients who received drug therapy alone for medium-term treatment duration (MD = −2.14; 95% CI: −3.69, −0.59; p &amp;lt; 0.01). However, there is no statistically significant difference in subgroup effect on MMSE (Mini-mental Status Examination) and ADLs (p &amp;gt; 0.05) when comparing acupuncture treatment with drug therapy (such as Donepezil hydrochloride, Nimodipine, or Yizhijiannao), or acupuncture plus drug therapy (such as Donepezil hydrochloride, Dangguishaoyaosan, or Jiannaosan) with drug therapy alone. There was also no significant difference in general cognitive function, ADLs, or incidence of adverse events between acupuncture treatment and drug therapy (p &amp;gt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This review indicates that acupuncture plus drug therapy may have a more beneficial effect for AD patients than drug therapy alone on general cognitive function in the short and medium term and on ADLs in the medium term. Acupuncture alone may not have superior effects compared with drug therapy on global cognitive function, ADLs, and incidence of adverse events. Duration of treatment may not modify the effect of acupuncture in comparison with drug therapy. Additional large-scale and high-quality clinical trials are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Synapse loss is an insidious aspect of aging and neurodegenerative disease, typically preceding symptoms of cognitive or motor decline. Orr et al. define a conserved mechanism of homeostatic plasticity (Drosophila and mice) that sustains neural function during an early phase of neuromuscular degenerative disease, underscoring a model of “homeostatic neuroprotection.”</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Haplotype of the astrocytic water channel AQP4 is associated with slow wave energy regulation in human NREM sleep</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000623</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Sara Marie Ulv Larsen, Hans-Peter Landolt, Wolfgang Berger, Maiken Nedergaard, Gitte Moos Knudsen, Sebastian Camillo Holst&lt;/p&gt;

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow through the brain parenchyma is facilitated by the astrocytic water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4). Homeostatically regulated electroencephalographic (EEG) slow waves are a hallmark of deep non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and have been implicated in the regulation of parenchymal CSF flow and brain clearance. The human &lt;i&gt;AQP4&lt;/i&gt; gene harbors several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AQP4 expression, brain-water homeostasis, and neurodegenerative diseases. To date, their role in sleep-wake regulation is unknown. To investigate whether functional variants in &lt;i&gt;AQP4&lt;/i&gt; modulate human sleep, nocturnal EEG recordings and cognitive performance were investigated in 123 healthy participants genotyped for a common eight-SNP &lt;i&gt;AQP4&lt;/i&gt;-haplotype. We show that this &lt;i&gt;AQP4&lt;/i&gt;-haplotype is associated with distinct modulations of NREM slow wave energy, strongest in early sleep and mirrored by changes in sleepiness and reaction times during extended wakefulness. The study provides the first human evidence for a link between AQP4, deep NREM sleep, and cognitive consequences of prolonged wakefulness.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/l_UpAu5nDhA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Rhizobial nodulation competitiveness and effectiveness at N2 fixation are independent traits, making their measurement extremely time-consuming with low experimental throughput. To transform the experimental assessment of rhizobial competitiveness and effectiveness, we...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/-eSjlTsbTcM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Existing research shows that distrust of the police is widespread and consequential for public safety. However, there is a shortage of interventions that demonstrably reduce negative police interactions with the communities they serve. A training program in Chicago attempted to encourage 8,480 officers to adopt procedural justice policing strategies.

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Expression profiling of precuneus layer III cathepsin D‐immunopositive pyramidal neurons in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: Evidence for neuronal signaling vulnerability&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ad9c116f-ea25-4913-9132-463e541393e0/cne24929-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precuneus (PreC) layer III projection neurons, which contain lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D (CatD) are dysfunctional in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Expression profiling of PreC CatD‐ positive layer III neurons revealed significant dysregulation of a mosaic of genes in tissue from subjects with mild cognitive impairment and AD that was not previously appreciated in terms of their indication of systems‐wide signaling defects in a key hub of the default mode memory network.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precuneus (PreC; Brodmann area 7), a key hub within the default mode network (DMN) displays amyloid and tau‐containing neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology during the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PreC layer III projection neurons contain lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D (CatD), a marker of neurons vulnerable to NFT pathology. Here we applied single population laser capture microdissection coupled with custom‐designed microarray profiling to determine the genetic signature of PreC CatD‐positive‐layer III neurons accrued from postmortem tissue obtained from the Rush Religious Orders Study (RROS) cases with a premortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Expression profiling revealed significant differential expression of key transcripts in MCI and AD compared to NCI that underlie signaling defects, including dysregulation of genes within the endosomal‐lysosomal and autophagy pathways, cytoskeletal elements, AD‐related genes, ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, cholinergic enzymes and receptors, markers of monoamine neurotransmission as well as steroid‐related transcripts. Pervasive defects in both MCI and AD were found in select transcripts within these key gene ontology categories, underscoring the vulnerability of these corticocortical projection neurons during the onset and progression of dementia. Select PreC dysregulated genes detected via custom‐designed microarray analysis were validated using qPCR. In summary, expression profiling of PreC CatD ‐positive layer III neurons revealed significant dysregulation of a mosaic of genes in MCI and AD that were not previously appreciated in terms of their indication of systems‐wide signaling defects in a key hub of the DMN.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuropathic pain (NP) is caused by primary or secondary impairment of the peripheral or central nervous systems. Its etiology is complex and involves abnormal patterns of gene expression and pathway activation. Using bioinformatics analysis, we aimed to identify NP-associated changes in genes and pathways in L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in a rat model of NP induced by chronic compression of the DRG (CCD). Genome-wide transcriptional analyses were used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying NP. We screened differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 7 days after CCD in comparison with sham-operated controls. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting were used to confirm the presence of key DEGs. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)-pathway analysis of DEGs and global signal transduction network analysis of DEGs were also conducted. The CCD group developed clear mechanical and thermal allodynia in the ipsilateral hind paw compared with the sham group. This comparison identified 1,887 DEGs, with 1156 upregulated and 731 downregulated DEGs, and 123 DEG-enriched pathways. We identified the key candidate genes that might play a role in the development of NP, namely syndecan 1 (Sdc1), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit gamma (Pi3k), Janus kinase 2 (Jak2), jun proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit (Jun), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) by analyzing the global signal transduction network. RT-qPCR and western blot analysis confirmed the microarray results. The DEGs Sdc1, Pi3k, Jak2, Jun, and IL-6, and the cytokine signaling pathway, the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, the toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway may have decisive modulatory roles in both nerve regeneration and NP. These results provide deeper insight into the mechanism underlying NP and promising therapeutic targets for its treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Rbfox1 Is Expressed in the Mouse Brain in the Form of Multiple Transcript Variants and Contains Functional E Boxes in Its Alternative Promoters</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The RNA-binding protein RBFOX1 is an important regulator of neuron development and neuronal excitability. Rbfox1 is a dosage-sensitive gene and in both mice and humans, decreased expression of Rbfox1 has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. Alternative promoters drive expression of Rbfox1 transcript isoforms that encode an identical protein. The tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression of these isoforms, as well as the underlying regulatory mechanisms, are, however, unclear. Here, we set out to capture all of the Rbfox1 transcript isoforms and identify transcriptional mechanisms that regulate brain-specific Rbfox1 expression. Isoform sequencing identified multiple alternative Rbfox1 transcript variants in the mouse cerebral cortex, including transcripts with novel first exons, alternatively spliced exons and 3′-truncations. Quantitative RT-PCR determined the expression of the alternative first exons in the developing cerebral cortex and different subregions of the juvenile brain. Alternative first exons were found to be highly stage- and subregion specific in their expression patterns suggesting that they fulfill specific functions during cortex development and in different brain regions. Using reporter assays we found that the promoter regions of the two first exons E1B and E1C/E1C.1 contain several functional E-boxes. Together, we provide an extensive picture of Rbfox1 isoform expression. We further identified important regulatory mechanisms that drive neuron-specific Rbfox1 expression. Thus, our study forms the basis for further research into the mechanisms that ensure physiological Rbfox1 expression in the brain. It also helps to understand why, in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders deletion of individual RBFOX1 transcript isoforms could affect brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Delta-Opioid Receptor; a Target for the Treatment of Pain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00052</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, pain represents one of the most important societal burdens. Current treatments are, however, too often ineffective and/or accompanied by debilitating unwanted effects for patients dealing with chronic pain. Indeed, the prototypical opioid morphine, as many other strong analgesics, shows harmful unwanted effects including respiratory depression and constipation, and also produces tolerance, physical dependence, and addiction. The urgency to develop novel treatments against pain while minimizing adverse effects is therefore crucial. Over the years, the delta-opioid receptor (DOP) has emerged as a promising target for the development of new pain therapies. Indeed, targeting DOP to treat chronic pain represents a timely alternative to existing drugs, given the weak unwanted effects spectrum of DOP agonists. Here, we review the current knowledge supporting a role for DOP and its agonists for the treatment of pain. More specifically, we will focus on the cellular and subcellular localization of DOP in the nervous system. We will also discuss in further detail the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in controlling the cellular trafficking of DOP, known to differ significantly from most G protein-coupled receptors. This review article will allow a better understanding of how DOP represents a promising target to develop new treatments for pain management as well as where we stand as of our ability to control its cellular trafficking and cell surface expression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Functional and Molecular Analysis of Proprioceptive Sensory Neuron Excitability in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00036</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons located in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are crucial for transmitting peripheral sensations such as proprioception, touch, temperature, and nociception to the spinal cord before propagating these signals to higher brain structures. To date, difficulty in identifying modality-specific DRG neurons has limited our ability to study specific populations in detail. As the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) is a neurochemical marker for proprioceptive DRG cells we used a transgenic mouse line expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in PV positive DRGs, to study the functional and molecular properties of putative proprioceptive neurons. Immunolabeled DRGs showed a 100% overlap between GFP positive (GFP+) and PV positive cells, confirming the PVeGFP mouse accurately labeled PV neurons. Targeted patch-clamp recording from isolated GFP+ and GFP negative (GFP−) neurons showed the passive membrane properties of the two groups were similar, however, their active properties differed markedly. All GFP+ neurons fired a single spike in response to sustained current injection and their action potentials (APs) had faster rise times, lower thresholds and shorter half widths. A hyperpolarization-activated current (I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) was observed in all GFP+ neurons but was infrequently noted in the GFP− population (100% vs. 11%). For GFP+ neurons, I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; activation rates varied markedly, suggesting differences in the underlying hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCN) subunit expression responsible for the current kinetics. Furthermore, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) showed the HCN subunits 2, 1, and 4 mRNA (in that order) was more abundant in GFP+ neurons, while HCN 3 was more highly expressed in GFP− neurons. Likewise, immunolabeling confirmed HCN 1, 2, and 4 protein expression in GFP+ neurons. In summary, certain functional properties of GFP+ and GFP− cells differ markedly, providing evidence for modality-specific signaling between the two groups. However, the GFP+ DRG population demonstrates considerable internal heterogeneity when hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCN channel) properties and subunit expression are considered. We propose this heterogeneity reflects the existence of different peripheral receptors such as tendon organs, muscle spindles or mechanoreceptors in the putative proprioceptive neuron population.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Sensory Processing and Attention Profiles Among Children With Sensory Processing Disorders and Autism Spectrum Disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00022</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00022</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study explores the differences in the profile of relationships between sensory processing and attention abilities among children with sensory processing disorder (SPD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and typically developing (TD) children. The Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-Ch), a performance-based measure of attention, was administered to 69 children (TD: n = 24; SPD: n = 21; ASD: n = 24), ages 6–10 years. All participants’ parents completed the Short Sensory Profile (SSP), a standardized parent-report measure of sensory-related behaviors. Discriminant analyses using the TEA-Ch and the SSP domains revealed two classification functions; the first revealed that both clinical groups significantly differed from the TD group with greater sensory processing challenges in the categories of auditory filtering, under-responsive/seeks sensation, low energy/weak, and taste/smell sensitivity subscales of the SSP. The second function discriminated between the two clinical groups, indicating that children with ASD had significantly greater control and sustained attention deficits and less sensory issues than did children with SPD. Together, the two functions correctly classified 76.8% of the participants as to their group membership. The different profiles of sensory processing and attention abilities in children with SPD and ASD may provide guidance in identifying appropriate individualized therapeutic strategies for these children.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Non-stationary Group-Level Connectivity Analysis for Enhanced Interpretability of Oddball Tasks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00446</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00446</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural responses of oddball tasks can be used as a physiological biomarker to evaluate the brain potential of information processing under the assumption that the differential contribution of deviant stimuli can be assessed accurately. Nevertheless, the non-stationarity of neural activity causes the brain networks to fluctuate hugely in time, deteriorating the estimation of pairwise synergies. To deal with the time variability of neural responses, we have developed a piecewise multi-subject analysis that is applied over a set of time intervals within the stationary assumption holds. To segment the whole stimulus-locked epoch into multiple temporal windows, we experimented with two approaches for piecewise segmentation of EEG recordings: a fixed time-window, at which the estimates of FC measures fulfill a given confidence level, and variable time-window, which is segmented at the change points of the time-varying classifier performance. Employing the weighted Phase Lock Index as a functional connectivity metric, we have presented the validation in a real-world EEG data, proving the effectiveness of variable time segmentation for connectivity extraction when combined with a supervised thresholding approach. Consequently, we performed a piecewise group-level analysis of electroencephalographic data that deals with non-stationary functional connectivity measures, evaluating more carefully the contribution of a link node-set in discriminating between the labeled oddball responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Most Small Cerebral Cortical Veins Demonstrate Significant Flow Pulsatility: A Human Phase Contrast MRI Study at 7T</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00415</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Phase contrast MRI (pcMRI) has been used to investigate flow pulsatility in cerebral arteries, larger cerebral veins, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Such measurements of intracranial pulsatility and compliance are beginning to inform understanding of the pathophysiology of conditions including normal pressure hydrocephalus, multiple sclerosis, and dementias. We demonstrate the presence of flow pulsatility in small cerebral cortical veins, for the first time using pcMRI at 7 T, with the aim of improving our understanding of the hemodynamics of this little-studied vascular compartment. A method for establishing where venous flow is pulsatile is introduced, revealing significant pulsatility in 116 out of 146 veins, across eight healthy participants, assessed in parietal and frontal regions. Distributions of pulsatility index (PI) and pulse waveform delay were characterized, indicating a small, but statistically significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05), delay of 59 ± 41 ms in cortical veins with respect to the superior sagittal sinus, but no differences between veins draining different arterial supply territories. Measurements of pulsatility in smaller cortical veins, a hitherto unstudied compartment closer to the capillary bed, could lead to a better understanding of intracranial compliance and cerebrovascular (patho)physiology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Multi-Functionalized Self-Assembling Peptides as Reproducible 3D Cell Culture Systems Enabling Differentiation and Survival of Various Human Neural Stem Cell Lines</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural stem cells-based therapies have shown great potential for central nervous system regeneration, with three-dimensional (3D) culture systems representing a key technique for tissue engineering applications, as well as disease modeling and drug screenings. Self-assembling peptides (SAPs), providing biomimetic synthetic micro-environments regulating cellular functionality and tissue repair, constitute a suitable tool for the production of complex tissue-like structures in vitro. However, one of the most important drawbacks in 3D cultures, obtained via animal-derived substrates and serum-rich media, is the reproducibility and tunability of a standardized methodology capable to coax neural differentiation of different human cell lines. In this work we cultured four distinct human neural stem cell (hNSC) lines in 3D synthetic multifunctionalized hydrogel (named HYDROSAP) for up to 6 weeks. Three-dimensional cultures of differentiating hNSCs exhibited a progressive differentiation and maturation over time. All hNSCs-derived neurons in 3D culture system exhibited randomly organized entangled networks with increasing expression of GABAergic and glutamatergic phenotypes and presence of cholinergic ones. Oligodendrocytes formed insulating myelin sheaths positive for myelin basic protein (MBP). In summary, results demonstrated a successfully standardized and reproducible 3D cell culture system for hNSC differentiation and maturation in serum-free conditions useful for future therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Efficient Communication in Distributed Simulations of Spiking Neuronal Networks With Gap Junctions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00012</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Investigating the dynamics and function of large-scale spiking neuronal networks with realistic numbers of synapses is made possible today by state-of-the-art simulation code that scales to the largest contemporary supercomputers. However, simulations that involve electrical interactions, also called gap junctions, besides chemical synapses scale only poorly due to a communication scheme that collects global data on each compute node. In comparison to chemical synapses, gap junctions are far less abundant. To improve scalability we exploit this sparsity by integrating an existing framework for continuous interactions with a recently proposed directed communication scheme for spikes. Using a reference implementation in the NEST simulator we demonstrate excellent scalability of the integrated framework, accelerating large-scale simulations with gap junctions by more than an order of magnitude. This allows, for the first time, the efficient exploration of the interactions of chemical and electrical coupling in large-scale neuronal networks models with natural synapse density distributed across thousands of compute nodes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Three-Dimensional Explant Platform for Studies on Choroid Plexus Epithelium</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00108</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00108</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The choroid plexus (CP) plays a major role in controlling the entry of substances and immune cells into the brain as it forms the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) in the brain ventricles. Dysregulated immune cell trafficking through the epithelial cell (EC) layer of CP is central for the pathogenesis of infectious diseases in the brain and many neurodegenerative disorders. In vitro studies elucidating the function of the CP have so far been limited to the monolayer culture of CP ECs. To mimic immune cell migration across the CP barrier, a three-dimensional model would be advantageous. Here, we present an in vitro platform for studies of the immune cell trafficking based on CP explants/organoids. The explants were generated from fragments of mouse CPs in Matrigel, where the cells formed luminal spaces and could be maintained in culture for at least 8 weeks. We demonstrate expression of the major CP markers in the explants, including transthyretin and aquaporin 1 as well as ZO1 and ICAM-1, indicating a capacity for secretion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and presence of tight junctions. CP explants displayed CP-like cell polarization and formed an intact EC barrier. We also show that the expression of transthyretin, transferrin, occludin and other genes associated with various functions of CP was maintained in the explants at similar levels as in native CP. By using dendritic cells and neutrophils, we show that the migration activity of immune cells and their interactions with CP epithelium can be monitored by microscopy. Thereby, the three-dimensional CP explant model can be used to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating immune cell migration through CP epithelium and other functions of choroid EC. We propose this platform can potentially be used in the search for therapeutic targets and intervention strategies to improve control of (drug) substances and (immune) cell entry into the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Function of P2X4 Receptors Is Directly Modulated by a 1:1 Stoichiometric Interaction With 5-HT3A Receptors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00106</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00106</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Interacting receptors at the neuronal plasma membrane represent an additional regulatory mode for intracellular transduction pathways. P2X4 receptor triggers fast neurotransmission responses via a transient increase in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels. It has been proposed that the P2X4 receptor interacts with the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A receptor in hippocampal neurons, but their binding stoichiometry and the role of P2X4 receptor activation by ATP on this crosstalking system remains unknown. Via pull-down assays, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy measurements of the receptors colocalization and expression at the plasma membrane, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging, we have demonstrated that P2X4/5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A receptor complexes can interact with each other in a 1:1 stoichiometric manner that is preserved after ATP binding. Also, macromolecular docking followed by 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggested that the interaction energy of the P2X4 receptor with 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A receptor is similar at the holo and the apo state of the P2X4 receptor, and the interacting 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A receptor decreased the ATP binding energy of P2X4 receptor. Finally, the P2X4 receptor-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; mobilization is inhibited by the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A interacting receptor. Altogether, these findings provide novel molecular insights into the allosteric regulation of P2X4/5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A receptor complex in lipid bilayers of living cells via stoichiometric association, rather than accumulation or unspecific clustering of complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Disc1 Carrier Mice Exhibit Alterations in Neural pIGF-1Rβ and Related Kinase Expression</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00094</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mutation of the disc1 gene underlies a broad range of developmental neuropsychiatric defects, including schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. The pathophysiological phenotypes linked with disc1 mutation are due to the truncation of the DISC1 primary protein structure. This leads to a defective post-synaptic scaffolding and kinase—GSK3β and Erk1/2—signaling. As a result, synaptic function and maintenance are significantly impaired in the disc1 mutant brain. Among several other pathways, GSK3β and Erk1/2 are involved in insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1Rβ) kinase signaling. Although disc1 mutation alters these kinases, it is unclear if the mutation impacts IGF-1R expression and activity in the brain. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of active IGF-1Rβ (pIGF-1Rβ) is altered in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of disc1 mutant mice and vary with the dose of the mutation (homozygous and heterozygous). The expression of pIGF-1Rβ decreased significantly in 129S (hom, disc1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) brains. In contrast, 129S:B6 (het, disc1&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt;) brains were characterized by an increase in pIGF-1Rβ when compared with the C57BL/6 (disc1&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;) level. The decrease in pIGF-1Rβ level for the 129S brains was accompanied by the loss of Akt activity (S473 pAkt) and decreased Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β (increased basal GSK3β). Additionally, hippocampal and cortical pErk1/2 activity increased in the 129S hippocampus and cortex. Although 129S:B6 recorded alterations in pIGF-1Rβ-pAkt-GSK3β (like 129S), there was no observable change in pErk1/2 activity for the heterozygote (disc1&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt;) mutant. In addition to GSK3β inhibition, we conclude that pIGF-1R, pAkt, and pErk1/2 are potential targets in disc1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mutant brain. On the other hand, pIGF-1R and pAkt can be further explored in disc1&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Aging Reduces Estradiol Protection Against Neural but Not Metabolic Effects of Obesity in Female 3xTg-AD Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00113</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is increased by several risk factors, including midlife obesity, female sex, and the depletion of estrogens in women as a consequence of menopause. Conversely, estrogen-based hormone therapies have been linked with protection from age-related increases in adiposity and dementia risk, although treatment efficacy appears to be affected by the age of initiation. Potential interactions between obesity, AD, aging, and estrogen treatment are likely to have significant impact on optimizing the use of hormone therapies in postmenopausal women. In the current study, we compared how treatment with the primary estrogen, 17β-estradiol (E2), affects levels of AD-like neuropathology, behavioral impairment, and other neural and systemic effects of preexisting diet-induced obesity in female 3xTg-AD mice. Importantly, experiments were conducted at chronological ages associated with both the early and late stages of reproductive senescence. We observed that E2 treatment was generally associated with significantly improved metabolic outcomes, including reductions in body weight, adiposity, and leptin, across both age groups. Conversely, neural benefits of E2 in obese mice, including decreased β-amyloid burden, improved behavioral performance, and reduced microglial activation, were observed only in the early aging group. These results are consistent with the perspective that neural benefits of estrogen-based therapies require initiation of treatment during early rather than later phases of reproductive aging. Further, the discordance between E2 protection against systemic versus neural effects of obesity across age groups suggests that pathways other than general metabolic function, perhaps including reduced microglial activation, contribute to the mechanism(s) of the observed E2 actions. These findings reinforce the potential systemic and neural benefits of estrogen therapies against obesity, while also highlighting the critical role of aging as a mediator of estrogens’ protective actions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Role of the Hippocampus During Logical Reasoning and Belief Bias in Aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00111</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reasoning requires initial encoding of the semantic association between premises or assumptions, retrieval of these semantic associations from memory, and recombination of information to draw a logical conclusion. Currently-held beliefs can interfere with the content of the assumptions if not congruent and inhibited. This study aimed to investigate the role of the hippocampus and hippocampal networks during logical reasoning tasks in which the congruence between currently-held beliefs and assumptions varies. Participants of younger and older age completed a series of syllogistic reasoning tasks in which two premises and one conclusion were presented and they were required to decide if the conclusion logically followed the premises. The belief load of premises was manipulated to be either congruent or incongruent with currently-held beliefs. Our whole-brain results showed that older adults recruited the hippocampus during the premise integration stage more than their younger counterparts. Functional connectivity using a hippocampal seed revealed that older, but not younger, adults recruited a hippocampal network that included anterior cingulate and inferior frontal regions when premises were believable. Importantly, this network contributed to better performance in believable inferences, only in older adults group. Further analyses suggested that, in older adults group, the integrity of the left cingulum bundle was associated with the higher rejection of believable premises more than unbelievable ones. Using multimodal imaging, this study highlights the importance of the hippocampus during premise integration and supports compensatory role of the hippocampal network during a logical reasoning task among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Clinical Features and Experimental Models of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) refers to a group of disease conditions affecting the cerebral small vessels, which include the small arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and postcapillary venules in the brain. SVD is the primary cause of vascular cognitive impairment and gait disturbances in aged people. There are several types of SVD, though arteriolosclerosis, which is mainly associated with hypertension, aging, and diabetes mellitus, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) comprise most SVD cases. The pathology of arteriolosclerosis-induced SVD is characterized by fibrinoid necrosis and lipohyalinosis, while CAA-associated SVD is characterized by progressive deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) protein in the cerebral vessels. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used for examination of SVD lesions; typical lesions are characterized by white matter hyperintensity, lacunar infarcts, enlargement of perivascular spaces (EPVS), microbleeds, cortical superficial siderosis (cSS), and cortical microinfarcts. The microvascular changes that occur in the small vessels are difficult to identify clearly; however, these consequent image findings can represent the SVD. There are two main strategies for prevention and treatment of SVD, i.e., pharmacotherapy and lifestyle modification. In this review, we discuss clinical features of SVD, experimental models replicating SVD, and treatments to further understand the pathological and clinical features of SVD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Clustering Analysis of Aging Diseases and Chronic Habits With Multivariate Time Series Electrocardiogram and Medical Records</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00095</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;With recent technology, multivariate time-series electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has played an important role in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. However, discovering the association of wide range aging disease and chronic habit with ECG analysis still has room to be explored. This article mainly analyzes the possible relationship between common aging diseases or chorionic habits of medical record and ECG, such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension, or the habit of smoking.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In the research, we first conducted different ECG features, such as those of reduced binary pattern, waveform, and wavelet and then performed a k-means clustering analysis on the correlation between ECGs and the aforementioned diseases and habits, from which it is expected to find a firm association between them and the best characteristics that can be used for future research.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In summary, we discovered a weak and strong evidence between ECG and medical records. For strong evidence, most patients with diabetes are always assigned into a specified group no matter the number of classes in the k-means clustering, which means we can find their association between them. For weak evidence, smokers, obesity, and hypertension have less unique ECG feature vector, enabling clustering them into specific groups, so the ECGs might be used to identify smokers, obesity, and hypertension. It is also interesting that we found obesity and hypertension, which are thought to be related to cardiovascular system. However, they are not highly correlated in our clustering analysis, which might indirectly tell us that the impact of obesity and hypertension to our body is various. In addition, the clustering effect of waveform feature is better than the other two methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>In 1982, John Hopfield published a neural network model for memory retrieval, a model that became a cornerstone in theoretical neuroscience. In a recent paper, Krotov and Hopfield built on these early studies and showed how a network that incorporates a biologically plausible learning rule governed by a Lyapunov function can effectively perform classification tasks.</description>

	<description>McEachin et al. demonstrate that sense and antisense dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) present in c9ALS/FTD are also produced in the genetically similar hexanucleotide repeat expansion disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (SCA36). Poly(GP) DPRs do not aggregate in SCA36 patient tissue. Aggregate-prone, chimeric DPRs underlie divergent pathology in c9ALS/FTD and SCA36.</description>

	<description>Weinstock et al. show that lysosomal GALC is required autonomously by Schwann cells to prevent psychosine formation, demyelination, and subsequent axonal degeneration. Macrophages independently require GALC to serve in phagocytosis and myelin turnover. HSCT likely exerts its therapeutic benefit by restoring phagocyte function rather than cross-correcting myelin cells of GALC.</description>

	<description>c9FTD/ALS and SCA36 are distinct diseases associated with similar hexanucleotide repeat expansions: G4C2 versus TG3C2. Todd et al. show that expressing these repeats in mice is sufficient to recapitulate each disease. The pathology and selective neurodegeneration characteristic of each disorder are therefore due to pathomechanisms intrinsic to each repeat sequence.</description>

	<description>Distinct modes of neuronal migration are essential for mammalian corticogenesis. Nomura et al. identify unique patterns of neuronal migration in reptilian cortical development, depending on regulations of Wnt signaling strengths. The absence of multipolar-to-bipolar conversion in reptilian neurons suggests that locomotive migration is an evolutionary innovation that has provided the mammalian-specific neocortex.</description>

In contrast to the symmetries of translation in space, rotation in space, and translation in time, the known laws of physics are not universally invariant under transformation of scale. However, a special case exists in which the action is scale invariant if it satisfies the following two constraints: 1) it must depend upon a scale-free Lagrangian, and 2) the Lagrangian must change under scale in the same way as the inverse time, 1t. Our contribution lies in the derivation of a generalised Lagrangian, in the form of a power series expansion, that satisfies these constraints. This generalised Lagrangian furnishes a normal form for dynamic causal models–state space models based upon differential equations–that can be used to distinguish scale symmetry from scale freeness in empirical data. We establish face validity with an analysis of simulated data, in which we show how scale symmetry can be identified and how the associated conserved quantities can be estimated in neuronal time series.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YizQiAJ3cF0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Decoding the language of microbiomes using word-embedding techniques, and applications in inflammatory bowel disease</title>

Microbiomes are complex ecological systems that play crucial roles in understanding natural phenomena from human disease to climate change. Especially in human gut microbiome studies, where collecting clinical samples can be arduous, the number of taxa considered in any one study often exceeds the number of samples ten to one hundred-fold. This discrepancy decreases the power of studies to identify meaningful differences between samples, increases the likelihood of false positive results, and subsequently limits reproducibility. Despite the vast collections of microbiome data already available, biome-specific patterns of microbial structure are not currently leveraged to inform studies. Here, we derive microbiome-level properties by applying an embedding algorithm to quantify taxon co-occurrence patterns in over 18,000 samples from the American Gut Project (AGP) microbiome crowdsourcing effort. We then compare the predictive power of models trained using properties, normalized taxonomic count data, and another commonly used dimensionality reduction method, Principal Component Analysis in categorizing samples from individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and healthy controls. We show that predictive models trained using property data are the most accurate, robust, and generalizable, and that property-based models can be trained on one dataset and deployed on another with positive results. Furthermore, we find that properties correlate significantly with known metabolic pathways. Using these properties, we are able to extract known and new bacterial metabolic pathways associated with inflammatory bowel disease across two completely independent studies. By providing a set of pre-trained embeddings, we allow any V4 16S amplicon study to apply the publicly informed properties to increase the statistical power, reproducibility, and generalizability of analysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a2nNMPsolNE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We present a flexible, open source R package designed to obtain biological and epidemiological insights from serological datasets. Characterising past exposures for multi-strain pathogens poses a specific statistical challenge: observed antibody responses measured in serological assays depend on multiple unobserved prior infections that produce cross-reactive antibody responses. We provide a general modelling framework to jointly infer infection histories and describe immune responses generated by these infections using antibody titres against current and historical strains. We do this by linking latent infection dynamics with a mechanistic model of antibody kinetics that generates expected antibody titres over time. Our aim is to provide a flexible package to identify infection histories that can be applied to a range of pathogens. We present two case studies to illustrate how our model can infer key immunological parameters, such as antibody titre boosting, waning and cross-reaction, as well as latent epidemiological processes such as attack rates and age-stratified infection risk.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fu5dew9vVUk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

It is difficult to predict how antibodies will behave when mixed together, even after each has been independently characterized. Here, we present a statistical mechanical model for the activity of antibody mixtures that accounts for whether pairs of antibodies bind to distinct or overlapping epitopes. This model requires measuring &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; individual antibodies and their n ( n - 1 ) 2 pairwise interactions to predict the 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; potential combinations. We apply this model to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies and find that the activity of antibody mixtures can be predicted without positing synergy at the molecular level. In addition, we demonstrate how the model can be used in reverse, where straightforward experiments measuring the activity of antibody mixtures can be used to infer the molecular interactions between antibodies. Lastly, we generalize this model to analyze engineered multidomain antibodies, where components of different antibodies are tethered together to form novel amalgams, and characterize how well it predicts recently designed influenza antibodies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kbknkvVoGHw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew J. Bernoff, Michael Culshaw-Maurer, Rebecca A. Everett, Maryann E. Hohn, W. Christopher Strickland, Jasper Weinburd&lt;/p&gt;

Locusts are significant agricultural pests. Under favorable environmental conditions flightless juveniles may aggregate into coherent, aligned swarms referred to as hopper bands. These bands are often observed as a propagating wave having a dense front with rapidly decreasing density in the wake. A tantalizing and common observation is that these fronts slow and steepen in the presence of green vegetation. This suggests the collective motion of the band is mediated by resource consumption. Our goal is to model and quantify this effect. We focus on the Australian plague locust, for which excellent field and experimental data is available. Exploiting the alignment of locusts in hopper bands, we concentrate solely on the density variation perpendicular to the front. We develop two models in tandem; an agent-based model that tracks the position of individuals and a partial differential equation model that describes locust density. In both these models, locust are either stationary (and feeding) or moving. Resources decrease with feeding. The rate at which locusts transition between moving and stationary (and vice versa) is enhanced (diminished) by resource abundance. This effect proves essential to the formation, shape, and speed of locust hopper bands in our models. From the biological literature we estimate ranges for the ten input parameters of our models. Sobol sensitivity analysis yields insight into how the band’s collective characteristics vary with changes in the input parameters. By examining 4.4 million parameter combinations, we identify biologically consistent parameters that reproduce field observations. We thus demonstrate that resource-dependent behavior can explain the density distribution observed in locust hopper bands. This work suggests that feeding behaviors should be an intrinsic part of future modeling efforts.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Whep4EkEAXI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Copy number variants (CNVs) are the gain or loss of DNA segments in the genome that can vary in dosage and length. CNVs comprise a large proportion of variation in human genomes and impact health conditions. To detect rare CNV associations, kernel-based methods have been shown to be a powerful tool due to their flexibility in modeling the aggregate CNV effects, their ability to capture effects from different CNV features, and their accommodation of effect heterogeneity. To perform a kernel association test, a CNV locus needs to be defined so that locus-specific effects can be retained during aggregation. However, CNV loci are arbitrarily defined and different locus definitions can lead to different performance depending on the underlying effect patterns. In this work, we develop a new kernel-based test called CONCUR (i.e., copy number profile curve-based association test) that is free from a definition of locus and evaluates CNV-phenotype associations by comparing individuals’ copy number profiles across the genomic regions. CONCUR is built on the proposed concepts of “copy number profile curves” to describe the CNV profile of an individual, and the “common area under the curve (cAUC) kernel” to model the multi-feature CNV effects. The proposed method captures the effects of CNV dosage and length, accounts for the numerical nature of copy numbers, and accommodates between- and within-locus etiological heterogeneity without the need to define artificial CNV loci as required in current kernel methods. In a variety of simulation settings, CONCUR shows comparable or improved power over existing approaches. Real data analyses suggest that CONCUR is well powered to detect CNV effects in the Swedish Schizophrenia Study and the Taiwan Biobank.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rHLtXWDqKmY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Many proteins have the potential to aggregate into amyloid fibrils, protein polymers associated with a wide range of human disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. The thermodynamic stability of amyloid fibrils, in contrast to that of folded proteins, is not well understood: the balance between entropic and enthalpic terms, including the chain entropy and the hydrophobic effect, are poorly characterised. Using a combination of theory, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments, simulations of a coarse-grained protein model and meta-data analysis, we delineate the enthalpic and entropic contributions that dominate amyloid fibril elongation. Our prediction of a characteristic temperature-dependent enthalpic signature is confirmed by the performed calorimetric experiments and a meta-analysis over published data. From these results we are able to define the necessary conditions to observe cold denaturation of amyloid fibrils. Overall, we show that amyloid fibril elongation is associated with a negative heat capacity, the magnitude of which correlates closely with the hydrophobic surface area that is buried upon fibril formation, highlighting the importance of hydrophobicity for fibril stability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0cgiOtsbdUY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Robustness and parameter geography in post-translational modification systems</title>

Biological systems are acknowledged to be robust to perturbations but a rigorous understanding of this has been elusive. In a mathematical model, perturbations often exert their effect through parameters, so sizes and shapes of parametric regions offer an integrated global estimate of robustness. Here, we explore this “parameter geography” for bistability in post-translational modification (PTM) systems. We use the previously developed “linear framework” for timescale separation to describe the steady-states of a two-site PTM system as the solutions of two polynomial equations in two variables, with eight non-dimensional parameters. Importantly, this approach allows us to accommodate enzyme mechanisms of arbitrary complexity beyond the conventional Michaelis-Menten scheme, which unrealistically forbids product rebinding. We further use the numerical algebraic geometry tools Bertini, Paramotopy, and alphaCertified to statistically assess the solutions to these equations at ∼10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; parameter points in total. Subject to sampling limitations, we find no bistability when substrate amount is below a threshold relative to enzyme amounts. As substrate increases, the bistable region acquires 8-dimensional volume which increases in an apparently monotonic and sigmoidal manner towards saturation. The region remains connected but not convex, albeit with a high visibility ratio. Surprisingly, the saturating bistable region occupies a much smaller proportion of the sampling domain under mechanistic assumptions more realistic than the Michaelis-Menten scheme. We find that bistability is compromised by product rebinding and that unrealistic assumptions on enzyme mechanisms have obscured its parametric rarity. The apparent monotonic increase in volume of the bistable region remains perplexing because the region itself does not grow monotonically: parameter points can move back and forth between monostability and bistability. We suggest mathematical conjectures and questions arising from these findings.

Many scientific disciplines rely on computational methods for data analysis, model generation, and prediction. Implementing these methods is often accomplished by researchers with domain expertise but without formal training in software engineering or computer science. This arrangement has led to underappreciation of sustainability and maintainability of scientific software tools developed in academic environments. Some software tools have avoided this fate, including the scientific library Rosetta. We use this software and its community as a case study to show how modern software development can be accomplished successfully, irrespective of subject area. Rosetta is one of the largest software suites for macromolecular modeling, with 3.1 million lines of code and many state-of-the-art applications. Since the mid 1990s, the software has been developed collaboratively by the RosettaCommons, a community of academics from over 60 institutions worldwide with diverse backgrounds including chemistry, biology, physiology, physics, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. Developing this software suite has provided us with more than two decades of experience in how to effectively develop advanced scientific software in a global community with hundreds of contributors. Here we illustrate the functioning of this development community by addressing technical aspects (like version control, testing, and maintenance), community-building strategies, diversity efforts, software dissemination, and user support. We demonstrate how modern computational research can thrive in a distributed collaborative community. The practices described here are independent of subject area and can be readily adopted by other software development communities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-r4oTrychKM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Single-cell transcription analysis of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium vivax&lt;/i&gt; blood-stage parasites identifies stage- and species-specific profiles of expression</title>

&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium vivax&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt;, the parasites responsible for most human malaria worldwide, exhibit striking biological differences, which have important clinical consequences. Unfortunately, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vivax&lt;/i&gt;, unlike &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt;, cannot be cultivated continuously in vitro, which limits our understanding of its biology and, consequently, our ability to effectively control vivax malaria. Here, we describe single-cell gene expression profiles of 9,215 &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vivax&lt;/i&gt; parasites from bloodstream infections of &lt;i&gt;Aotus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Saimiri&lt;/i&gt; monkeys. Our results show that transcription of most &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vivax&lt;/i&gt; genes occurs during short periods of the intraerythrocytic cycle and that this pattern of gene expression is conserved in other &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; species. However, we also identify a strikingly high proportion of species-specific transcripts in late schizonts, possibly associated with the specificity of erythrocyte invasion. Our findings provide new and robust markers of blood-stage parasites, including some that are specific to the elusive &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vivax&lt;/i&gt; male gametocytes, and will be useful for analyzing gene expression data from laboratory and field samples.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ssSM_xr9rPU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Different Cortical Gyrification Patterns in Alzheimer's Disease and Impact on Memory Performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25741?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25741?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of cortical gyrification in Alzheimer's disease (AD) could help to further understanding of the changes undergone in the brain during neurodegeneration. Here, we aimed to study brain gyrification differences between healthy controls (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and AD patients, and explore how cerebral gyrification patterns were associated with memory and other cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We applied surface‐based morphometry techniques in 2 large, independent cross‐sectional samples, obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative project. Both samples, encompassing a total of 1,270 participants, were analyzed independently.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, we found that AD patients presented a more gyrificated entorhinal cortex than HC. Conversely, the insular cortex of AD patients was hypogyrificated. A decrease in the gyrification of the insular cortex was also found in older HC participants as compared with younger HC, which argues against the specificity of this finding in AD. However, an increased degree of folding of the insular cortex was specifically associated with better memory function and semantic fluency, only in AD patients. Overall, MCI patients presented an intermediate gyrification pattern. All these findings were consistently observed in the two samples.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marked atrophy of the medial temporal lobe observed in AD patients may explain the increased folding of the entorhinal cortex. We additionally speculate regarding alternative mechanisms that may also alter its folding. The association between increased gyrification of the insular cortex and memory function, specifically observed in AD, could be suggestive of compensatory mechanisms to overcome the loss of memory function.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Premortem Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Diagnoses in Professional Football</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25747?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25747?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American‐style football (ASF) has gained attention because of possible links between repetitive head injury and neurodegenerative diseases. Although postmortem pathologic changes consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) have been reported in ASF players, there are currently no established premortem diagnostic criteria for CTE. Nevertheless, presented with symptoms of cognitive impairment, clinicians treating former players may be inclined to suggest CTE without a thorough exploration of comorbid factors that demonstrate similar clinical phenotypes to putative CTE.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey of 3,913 former ASF players aged 24 to 89 was conducted for those who responded by March 2019.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being a postmortem diagnosis, 108 players (2.8%) self‐reported clinician‐diagnosed CTE. The percentage of players under age 60 years reporting a CTE diagnosis was 2.3% versus 3.7% in participants age 60 or older. Comorbidities in participants self‐reporting CTE were significantly more common, including sleep apnea, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, indicators of past or current depression, hypertension, prescription pain medication use, heart conditions, and low testosterone when compared to non‐CTE respondents. Patterns of reporting for obesity, hypertension, heart conditions, or hypercholesterolemia differed between older and younger participants. Cognitive impairment symptoms were significantly higher in participants self‐reporting CTE.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some former professional football players have been clinically diagnosed with CTE, a postmortem condition. Comorbidities that can affect cognition were associated with CTE diagnoses in both older and younger players. Although underlying neuropathology cannot be ruled out, treatable conditions should be explored in former athletes demonstrating CTE‐linked clinical phenotypes or symptoms as a means of improving cognitive health in these patients.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The sensory peripheral nervous system in the tail of a cephalochordate studied by serial blockface scanning electron microscopy</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The sensory peripheral nervous system in the tail of a cephalochordate studied by serial blockface scanning electron microscopy&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c13914cf-e635-492c-8e6b-656c3c3af830/cne24913-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephalochordates (amphioxus or lancelets) are basal in the phylum Chiordata and can exemplify the relatively simple developmental and anatomical starting conditions likely to have evolved into more complex vertebrate features. Here we use serial blockface scanning electron microscopy to reconstruct the sensory peripheral nervous system in the tail of a lancelet. The nerves (glial cell/neurite complexes) branch within the dermis and then exit to the epidermis to associate with the perikarya of two kinds of ciliated sensory neurons. The results indicate that cephalochordate neuroglia have an intramedullary origin. Moreover, we suggest that the peripheral nerves in the dermis are, at least in part, comparable to Rohon‐Beard cells of vertebrates, whereas, in contrast, the placode‐ and neural crest‐derived peripheral neurons of vertebrates are evolutionary novelties that appear to have supplanted the epidermal sensory receptors of cephalochordates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serial blockface scanning electron microscopy (SBSEM) is used to describe the sensory peripheral nervous system (PNS) in the tail of a cephalochordate, &lt;i&gt;Asymmetron lucayanum&lt;/i&gt;. The reconstructed region extends from the tail tip to the origin of the most posterior peripheral nerves from the dorsal nerve cord. As peripheral nerves ramify within the dermis, all the nuclei along their course belong to glial cells. Invaginations in the glial cell cytoplasm house the neurites, an association reminiscent of the nonmyelinated Schwann cells of vertebrates. Peripheral nerves pass from the dermis to the epidermis via small fenestrae in the sub‐epidermal collagen fibril layer; most nerves exit abruptly, but a few run obliquely within the collagen fibril layer for many micrometers before exiting. Within the epidermis, each nerve begins ramifying repeatedly, but the branches are too small to be followed to their tips with SBSEM at low magnification (previous studies on other cephalochordates indicate that the branches end freely or in association with epidermal sensory cells). In &lt;i&gt;Asymmetron&lt;/i&gt;, two morphological kinds of sensory cells are scattered in the epidermis, usually singly, but sometimes in pairs, evidently the recent progeny of a single precursor cell. The discussion considers the evolution of the sensory PNS in the phylum Chordata. In cephalochordates, Retzius bipolar neurons with intramedullary perikarya likely correspond to the Rohon‐Beard cells of vertebrates. However, extramedullary neurons originating from ventral epidermis in cephalochordates (and presumably in ancestral chordates) contrast with vertebrate sensory neurons, which arise from placodes and neural crest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Mapping mesoscale cortical connectivity in monkey sensorimotor cortex with optical imaging and microstimulation</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Mapping mesoscale cortical connectivity in monkey sensorimotor cortex with optical imaging and microstimulation&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/be792518-6c4e-471a-b15d-6b3cbe31eb1d/cne24918-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining intracortical electrical microstimulation (ICMS) with intrinsic optical imaging, we find that focal ICMS at single digit locations in monkey cortex (Areas 3a, 3b, 1, 2, and M1) reveals known anatomical connections. This novel method of studying cortical connections is in vivo, rapid, targeted, and mesoscale.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To map in vivo cortical circuitry at the mesoscale, we applied a novel approach to map interareal functional connectivity. Electrical intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in conjunction with optical imaging of intrinsic signals (OIS) was used map functional connections in somatosensory cortical areas in anesthetized squirrel monkeys. ICMS produced activations that were focal and that displayed responses which were stimulation intensity dependent. ICMS in supragranular layers of Brodmann Areas 3b, 1, 2, 3a, and M1 evoked interareal activation patterns that were topographically appropriate and appeared consistent with known anatomical connectivity. Specifically, ICMS revealed Area 3b connections with Area 1; Area 1 connections with Areas 2 and 3a; Area 2 connections with Areas 1, 3a, and M1; Area 3a connections with Areas M1, 1, and 2; and M1 connections with Areas 3a, 1, and 2. These somatosensory connectivity patterns were reminiscent of feedforward patterns observed anatomically, although feedback contributions are also likely present. Further consistent with anatomical connectivity, intra‐areal and intra‐areal patterns of activation were patchy with patch sizes of 200–300 μm. In summary, ICMS with OIS is a novel approach for mapping interareal and intra‐areal connections in vivo. Comparisons with feedforward and feedback anatomical connectivity are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Gut Microbiome-Modified Polyphenolic Compounds Inhibit α-Synuclein Seeding and Spreading in α-Synucleinopathies</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Misfolding, aggregation and deposition of α-synuclein (α-syn) are major pathologic characteristics of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and the related synucleinopathy, multiple system atrophy (MSA). The spread of α-syn pathology across brain regions is thought to play a key role in the onset and progression of clinical phenotypes. Thus, there is increasing interest in developing strategies that target and attenuate α-syn aggregation and spread. Recent studies of brain-penetrating polyphenolic acids, namely, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (3-HBA), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-diHBA), and 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid (3-HPPA) that are derived from gut microbiota metabolism of dietary polyphenols, show in vitro ability to effectively modulate α-syn misfolding, oligomerization, and mediate aggregated α-syn neurotoxicity. Here we investigate whether 3-HBA, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA), 3,4-diHBA, or 3-HPPA interfere with α-syn spreading in a cell-based system. Using HEK293 cells overexpressing α-syn-A53T-CFP/YFP, we assessed α-syn seeding activity using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to detect and quantify α-syn aggregation. We demonstrated that 3-HPPA, 3,4-diHBA, 3-HBA, and 4-HBA significantly attenuated intracellular α-syn seeding aggregation. To determine whether our compounds could inhibit brain-derived seeding activity, we utilized insoluble α-syn extracted from post-mortem MSA or PD brain specimens. We found that 3-HPPA effectively attenuated MSA-induced aggregation of monomer into high molecular weight aggregates capable of inducing intracellular aggregation. Outcomes from our studies suggest interactions between gut microbiome and certain dietary factors may form the basis for effective therapies that modulate pathologic α-syn propagation. Collectively, our findings provide the basis for future developments of probiotic, prebiotic, or synbiotic approaches for modulating the onset and/or progression of α-synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Perceptual rivalry across animal species&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6be12f2c-add7-41b2-a269-4736b4974451/cne24939-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review in memoriam of Jack Pettigrew provides an overview of research into the phenomenon of perceptual rivalry, across a wide variety of species including insects, fish, reptiles and primates. Perceptual rivalry is characterized by spontaneous alternations in perceptual state in response to ambiguous or conflicting sensory input. We highlight several interesting commonalities across species and use a comparative approach to better understand how the brain suppresses opposing sensory signals and generates alternations in perceptual dominance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review in memoriam of Jack Pettigrew provides an overview of past and current research into the phenomenon of multistable perception across multiple animal species. Multistable perception is characterized by two or more perceptual interpretations spontaneously alternating, or rivalling, when animals are exposed to stimuli with inherent sensory ambiguity. There is a wide array of ambiguous stimuli across sensory modalities, ranging from the configural changes observed in simple line drawings, such as the famous Necker cube, to the alternating perception of entire visual scenes that can be instigated by interocular conflict. The latter phenomenon, called binocular rivalry, in particular caught the attention of the late Jack Pettigrew, who combined his interest in the neuronal basis of perception with a unique comparative biological approach that considered ambiguous sensation as a fundamental problem of sensory systems that has shaped the brain throughout evolution. Here, we examine the research findings on visual perceptual alternation and suppression in a wide variety of species including insects, fish, reptiles and primates. We highlight several interesting commonalities across species and behavioral indicators of perceptual alternation. In addition, we show how the comparative approach provides new avenues for understanding how the brain suppresses opposing sensory signals and generates alternations in perceptual dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Projections between visual cortex and pulvinar in the rat</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24937?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Projections between visual cortex and pulvinar in the rat&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/63fa418d-063f-4151-bf9e-01eee447c44d/cne24937-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the geniculocortical pathway which interconnects only between the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex (V1), the pulvinar has long been known to interconnect with most if not all of visual cortex. Here we show that pulvinar interconnectivity is actually more dominant with higher visual cortex (V2) than with V1. Thus, the pulvinocortical pathway does not likely play as big a role in directly modulating V1 activity as previously thought.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extrageniculate visual pathway, which carries visual information from the retina through the superficial layers of the superior colliculus and the pulvinar, is poorly understood. The pulvinar is thought to modulate information flow between cortical areas, and has been implicated in cognitive tasks like directing visually guided actions. In order to better understand the underlying circuitry, we performed retrograde injections of modified rabies virus in the visual cortex and pulvinar of the Long‐Evans rat. We found a relatively small population of cells projecting to primary visual cortex (V1), compared to a much larger population projecting to higher visual cortex. Reciprocal corticothalamic projections showed a similar result, implying that pulvinar does not play as big a role in directly modulating rodent V1 activity as previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We comprehensively characterized 5‐HT‐immunoreactive (−ir) innervation throughout the brain of &lt;i&gt;Porichthys notatus&lt;/i&gt;, plainfin midshipman fish, including well‐delineated vocal and auditory nuclei. We report neuroanatomical heterogeneity in populations of the serotonergic raphe nuclei of the brainstem reticular formation, with three discrete subregions in the superior raphe, an intermediate 5‐HT‐ir cell cluster, and an extensive inferior raphe population. This comprehensive atlas offers new insights into the organization of 5‐HT nuclei in teleosts and provides neuroanatomical evidence for serotonin as a modulator of vocal‐acoustic circuitry and behavior in midshipman fish, consistent with findings in vocal tetrapods.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5‐HT) is a modulator of neural circuitry underlying motor patterning, homeostatic control, and social behavior. While previous studies have described 5‐HT distribution in various teleosts, serotonergic raphe subgroups in fish are not well defined and therefore remain problematic for cross‐species comparisons. Here we used the plainfin midshipman fish, &lt;i&gt;Porichthys notatus&lt;/i&gt;, a well‐studied model for investigating the neural and hormonal mechanisms of vertebrate vocal‐acoustic communication, to redefine raphe subgroups based on both stringent neuroanatomical landmarks as well as quantitative cell measurements. In addition, we comprehensively characterized 5‐HT‐immunoreactive (−ir) innervation throughout the brain, including well‐delineated vocal and auditory nuclei. We report neuroanatomical heterogeneity in populations of the serotonergic raphe nuclei of the brainstem reticular formation, with three discrete subregions in the superior raphe, an intermediate 5‐HT‐ir cell cluster, and an extensive inferior raphe population. 5‐HT‐ir neurons were also observed within the vocal motor nucleus, forming putative contacts on those cells. In addition, three major 5‐HT‐ir cell groups were identified in the hypothalamus and one group in the pretectum. Significant 5‐HT‐ir innervation was found in components of the vocal pattern generator and cranial motor nuclei. All vocal midbrain nuclei showed considerable 5‐HT‐ir innervation, as did thalamic and hindbrain auditory and lateral line areas and vocal‐acoustic integration sites in the preoptic area and ventral telencephalon. This comprehensive atlas offers new insights into the organization of 5‐HT nuclei in teleosts and provides neuroanatomical evidence for serotonin as a modulator of vocal‐acoustic circuitry and behavior in midshipman fish, consistent with findings in vocal tetrapods.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Inference on dengue epidemics with Bayesian regime switching models</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007839</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/01A53YC4CA4/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jue Tao Lim, Borame Sue Dickens, Sun Haoyang, Ng Lee Ching, Alex Richard Cook&lt;/p&gt;

Dengue, a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by the dengue viruses, is present in many parts of the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. All four serotypes of dengue viruses are endemic in Singapore, an equatorial city-state. Frequent outbreaks occur, sometimes leading to national epidemics. However, few studies have attempted to characterize breakpoints which precede large rises in dengue case counts. In this paper, Bayesian regime switching (BRS) models were employed to infer epidemic and endemic regimes of dengue transmissions, each containing regime specific autoregressive processes which drive the growth and decline of dengue cases, estimated using a custom built multi-move Gibbs sampling algorithm. Posterior predictive checks indicate that BRS replicates temporal trends in Dengue transmissions well and nowcast accuracy assessed using a post-hoc classification scheme showed that BRS classification accuracy is robust even under limited data with the AUC-ROC at 0.935. LASSO-based regression and bootstrapping was used to account for plausibly high dimensions of climatic factors affecting Dengue transmissions, which was then estimated using cross-validation to conduct statistical inference on long-run climatic effects on the estimated regimes. BRS estimates epidemic and endemic regimes of dengue in Singapore which are characterized by persistence across time, lasting an average of 20 weeks and 66 weeks respectively, with a low probability of transitioning away from their regimes. Climate analysis with LASSO indicates that long-run climatic effects up to 20 weeks ago do not differentiate epidemic and endemic regimes. Lastly, by fitting BRS to simulated disease data generated from a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model, mechanistic links between infectivity and regimes classified using BRS were provided. The model proposed could be applied to other localities and diseases under minimal data requirements where transmission counts over time are collected.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/01A53YC4CA4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Intrinsic and Extrinsic Mechanisms of Thalamic Pathology in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25743?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thalamic atrophy is among the earliest brain changes detected in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and the degree of thalamic atrophy is a strong predictor of disability progression. The causes of thalamic atrophy are not fully understood. Here, we investigate the contributions of thalamic demyelinated lesions, thalamic neuronal loss, and cerebral white matter (WM) lesions to thalamic volume.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used postmortem in situ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 95 subjects with MS to correlate thalamic lesion volumes with global MRI metrics. We histologically characterized thalamic demyelination patterns and compared neuronal loss and neuritic pathology in the thalami with the extremes of volume.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grossly apparent thalamic discolorations in cm‐thick brain slices were T2/fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense, T1‐hypointense, and appeared as perivascular demyelinated lesions with dystrophic neurons/axons. Subependymal demyelinated lesions with axonal loss and microglial/macrophage activation were also observed. The 12 subjects with the least thalamic volume had a 17.6% reduction of median neuronal density in the dorsomedial/ventrolateral and pulvinar nuclei compared with the 14 subjects with the greatest thalamic volume (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03). After correcting for age, disease duration, sex, and T2 lesion volume, the total (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.20), ovoid (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.31), or subependymal (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.44) MRI thalamic lesion volumes correlated with thalamic volume. Thalamic volume correlated with cerebral T2 lesion volume (Spearman’s rho = −0.65, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001 after correcting for age, disease duration, and sex).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest the degeneration of efferent/afferent thalamic projections and/or a neurodegenerative process as greater contributors to thalamic atrophy than thalamic demyelinating lesions. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This study describes the anatomy of a cell bridge (CB) variant consisting of the fusion of the mouse nodose ganglion (NG) and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG). This anastomosis was tubular‐shaped and significantly more prevalent in the ganglionic masses from males (38%) than females (21%). It contained a mixed of vagal afferents (blue, TH‐positive and Hand2‐ and isolectin B4‐negative; purple, TH‐ and Hand2‐negative and isolectin B4‐positive; grey, TH‐ and Hand2‐ and isolectin B4‐negative) and postganglionic sympathetic neurons (green,TH‐ and Hand2‐positive). The two populations of neurons abruptly replaced each other in the middle of the cell bridge. The practical implications of our observations are discussed with respect to studies of the mouse vagal afferents, an area of research of increasing popularity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While autonomic ganglia have been extensively studied in rats instead of mice, there is renewed interest in the anatomy of the mouse autonomic nervous system. This study examined the prevalence and anatomical features of a cell bridge linking two autonomic ganglia of the neck, namely, the nodose ganglion (NG) and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) in a cohort of C57BL/6J mice. We identified a cell bridge between the NG and the cranial pole of the SCG. This cell bridge was tubular‐shaped with an average length and width of 700 and 240 μm, respectively. The cell bridge was frequently unilateral and significantly more prevalent in the ganglionic masses from males (38%) than females (21%). On each of its extremities, it contained a mixed of vagal afferents and postganglionic sympathetic neurons. The two populations of neurons abruptly replaced each other in the middle of the cell bridge. We examined the mRNA expression for selected autonomic markers in samples of the NG with or without cell bridge. Our results indicated that the cell bridge was enriched in both markers of postganglionic sympathetic and vagal afferents neurons. Lastly, using FluoroGold microinjection into the NG, we found that the existence of a cell bridge may occasionally lead to the inadvertent contamination of the SCG. In summary, this study describes the anatomy of a cell bridge variant consisting of the fusion of the mouse NG and SCG. The practical implications of our observations are discussed with respect to studies of the mouse vagal afferents, an area of research of increasing popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>People organize and convey their thoughts according to narratives. However, neuroscientists are often reluctant to incorporate narrative stimuli into their experiments. We argue that narratives deserve wider adoption in human neuroscience because they tap into the brain’s native machinery for representing the world and provide rich variability for testing hypotheses.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Tracheal branching in ants is area-decreasing, violating a central assumption of network transport models</title>

The structure of tubular transport networks is thought to underlie much of biological regularity, from individuals to ecosystems. A core assumption of transport network models is either area-preserving or area-increasing branching, such that the summed cross-sectional area of all child branches is equal to or greater than the cross-sectional area of their respective parent branch. For insects, the most diverse group of animals, the assumption of area-preserving branching of tracheae is, however, based on measurements of a single individual and an assumption of gas exchange by diffusion. Here we show that ants exhibit neither area-preserving nor area-increasing branching in their abdominal tracheal systems. We find for 20 species of ants that the sum of child tracheal cross-sectional areas is typically less than that of the parent branch (area-decreasing). The radius, rather than the area, of the parent branch is conserved across the sum of child branches. Interpretation of the tracheal system as one optimized for the release of carbon dioxide, while readily catering to oxygen demand, explains the branching pattern. Our results, together with widespread demonstration that gas exchange in insects includes, and is often dominated by, convection, indicate that for generality, network transport models must include consideration of systems with different architectures.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VNpmP5-VtJc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cells in microbial colonies integrate information across multiple spatial and temporal scales while sensing environmental cues. A number of photosynthetic cyanobacteria respond in a directional manner to incident light, resulting in the phototaxis of individual cells. Colonies of such bacteria exhibit large-scale changes in morphology, arising from cell-cell interactions, during phototaxis. These interactions occur through type IV pili-mediated physical contacts between cells, as well as through the secretion of complex polysaccharides (‘slime’) that facilitates cell motion. Here, we describe a computational model for such collective behaviour in colonies of the cyanobacterium &lt;i&gt;Synechocystis&lt;/i&gt;. The model is designed to replicate observations from recent experiments on the emergent response of the colonies to varied light regimes. It predicts the complex colony morphologies that arise as a result. We ask if changes in colony morphology during phototaxis can be used to infer if cells integrate information from multiple light sources simultaneously, or respond to these light sources separately at each instant of time. We find that these two scenarios cannot be distinguished from the shapes of colonies alone. However, we show that tracking the trajectories of individual cyanobacteria provides a way of determining their mode of response. Our model allows us to address the emergent nature of this class of collective bacterial motion, linking individual cell response to the dynamics of colony shape.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KpgkhEb1cf0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Insight into the protein solubility driving forces with neural attention</title>

Protein solubility is a key aspect for many biotechnological, biomedical and industrial processes, such as the production of active proteins and antibodies. In addition, understanding the molecular determinants of the solubility of proteins may be crucial to shed light on the molecular mechanisms of diseases caused by aggregation processes such as amyloidosis. Here we present SKADE, a novel Neural Network protein solubility predictor and we show how it can provide novel insight into the protein solubility mechanisms, thanks to its neural attention architecture. First, we show that SKADE positively compares with state of the art tools while using just the protein sequence as input. Then, thanks to the neural attention mechanism, we use SKADE to investigate the patterns learned during training and we analyse its decision process. We use this peculiarity to show that, while the attention profiles do not correlate with obvious sequence aspects such as biophysical properties of the aminoacids, they suggest that N- and C-termini are the most relevant regions for solubility prediction and are predictive for complex emergent properties such as aggregation-prone regions involved in beta-amyloidosis and contact density. Moreover, SKADE is able to identify mutations that increase or decrease the overall solubility of the protein, allowing it to be used to perform large scale in-silico mutagenesis of proteins in order to maximize their solubility.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/deKSGXkO29A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Inferring a simple mechanism for alpha-blocking by fitting a neural population model to EEG spectra</title>

Alpha blocking, a phenomenon where the alpha rhythm is reduced by attention to a visual, auditory, tactile or cognitive stimulus, is one of the most prominent features of human electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Here we identify a simple physiological mechanism by which opening of the eyes causes attenuation of the alpha rhythm. We fit a neural population model to EEG spectra from 82 subjects, each showing a different degree of alpha blocking upon opening of their eyes. Though it has been notoriously difficult to estimate parameters by fitting such models, we show how, by regularizing the differences in parameter estimates between eyes-closed and eyes-open states, we can reduce the uncertainties in these differences without significantly compromising fit quality. From this emerges a parsimonious explanation for the spectral differences between states: Changes to just a single parameter, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ei&lt;/sub&gt;, corresponding to the strength of a tonic excitatory input to the inhibitory cortical population, are sufficient to explain the reduction in alpha rhythm upon opening of the eyes. We detect this by comparing the shift in each model parameter between eyes-closed and eyes-open states. Whereas changes in most parameters are weak or negligible and do not scale with the degree of alpha attenuation across subjects, the change in &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ei&lt;/sub&gt; increases monotonically with the degree of alpha blocking observed. These results indicate that opening of the eyes reduces alpha activity by increasing external input to the inhibitory cortical population.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o85Qi_mROIs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Extensive evidence links &lt;i&gt;Glutamate receptor&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ionotropic&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NMDA2B&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;GRIN2B&lt;/i&gt;), encoding the GluN2B/NR2B subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), with various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In addition, it remains unknown whether mutations in GluN2B, which starts to be expressed early in development, induces early pathophysiology that can be corrected by early treatments for long-lasting effects. We generated and characterized &lt;i&gt;Grin2b&lt;/i&gt;-mutant mice that carry a heterozygous, ASD-risk C456Y mutation (&lt;i&gt;Grin2b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/C456Y&lt;/sup&gt;). In &lt;i&gt;Grin2b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/C456Y&lt;/sup&gt; mice, GluN2B protein levels were strongly reduced in association with decreased hippocampal NMDAR currents and NMDAR-dependent long-term depression (LTD) but unaltered long-term potentiation, indicative of mutation-induced protein degradation and LTD sensitivity. Behaviorally, &lt;i&gt;Grin2b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/C456Y&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed normal social interaction but exhibited abnormal anxiolytic-like behavior. Importantly, early, but not late, treatment of young &lt;i&gt;Grin2b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/C456Y&lt;/sup&gt; mice with the NMDAR agonist D-cycloserine rescued NMDAR currents and LTD in juvenile mice and improved anxiolytic-like behavior in adult mice. Therefore, GluN2B-C456Y haploinsufficiency decreases GluN2B protein levels, NMDAR-dependent LTD, and anxiety-like behavior, and early activation of NMDAR function has long-lasting effects on adult mouse behavior.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/p73rXGnuhRM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Left Prefrontal Connectivity Links Subthalamic Stimulation with Depressive Symptoms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25734?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25734?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN‐DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) not only stimulates focal target structures but also affects distributed brain networks. The impact this network modulation has on non‐motor DBS effects is not well‐characterized. By focusing on the affective domain, we systematically investigate the impact of electrode placement and associated structural connectivity on changes in depressive symptoms following STN‐DBS, which have been reported to improve, worsen, or remain unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depressive symptoms before and after STN‐DBS surgery were documented in 116 patients with PD from 3 DBS centers (Berlin, Queensland, and Cologne). Based on individual electrode reconstructions, the volumes of tissue activated (VTAs) were estimated and combined with normative connectome data to identify structural connections passing through VTAs. Berlin and Queensland cohorts formed a training and cross‐validation dataset used to identify structural connectivity explaining change in depressive symptoms. The Cologne data served as the test‐set for which depressive symptom change was predicted.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structural connectivity was linked to depressive symptom change under STN‐DBS. An optimal connectivity map trained on the Berlin cohort could predict changes in depressive symptoms in Queensland patients and vice versa. Furthermore, the joint training‐set map predicted changes in depressive symptoms in the independent test‐set. Worsening of depressive symptoms was associated with left prefrontal connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibers connecting the electrode with left prefrontal areas were associated with worsening of depressive symptoms. Our results suggest that for the left STN‐DBS lead, placement impacting fibers to left prefrontal areas should be avoided to maximize improvement of depressive symptoms.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neurosurgical Intervention for Supratentorial Intracerebral Hemorrhage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25732?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25732?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of surgical treatment for supratentorial spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and whether it is modified by key baseline characteristics and timing remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials of surgical treatment of supratentorial spontaneous ICH aimed at clot removal. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases up to February 21, 2019. Primary outcome was good functional outcome at follow‐up; secondary outcomes were death and serious adverse events. We analyzed all types of surgery combined and minimally invasive approaches separately. We pooled risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals and assessed the modifying effect of age, Glasgow Coma Scale, hematoma volume, and timing of surgery with meta‐regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 21 studies with 4,145 patients; 4 (19%) were of the highest quality. Risk ratio of good functional outcome after any type of surgery was 1.40 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22–1.60, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; = 46%, 20 studies), and after minimally invasive surgery it was 1.47 (95% CI = 1.26–1.72, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; = 47%, 12 studies). For death, the risk ratio for any type of surgery was 0.77 (95% CI = 0.68–0.85, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; = 23%, 21 studies), and for minimally invasive surgery it was 0.68 (95% CI = 0.56–0.83, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; = 14%, 13 studies). Serious adverse events were reported infrequently. Surgery seemed more effective when performed sooner after symptom onset (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04, 12 studies). Age, Glasgow Coma Scale, and hematoma volume did not modify the effect of surgery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgical treatment of supratentorial spontaneous ICH may be beneficial, in particular with minimally invasive procedures and when performed soon after symptom onset. Further well‐designed randomized trials are needed to demonstrate whether (minimally invasive) surgery improves functional outcome after ICH and to determine the optimal time window of the treatment after symptom onset.

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed anatomical maps of individual organs and entire animals have served as invaluable entry points for ensuing dissection of their evolution, development, and function. The pharynx of the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; is a simple neuromuscular organ with a self‐contained, autonomously acting nervous system, composed of 20 neurons that fall into 14 anatomically distinct types. Using serial EM reconstruction, we re‐evaluate here the connectome of the pharyngeal nervous system, providing a novel and more detailed view of its structure and predicted function. Contrasting the previous classification of pharyngeal neurons into distinct inter‐ and motor neuron classes, we provide evidence that most pharyngeal neurons are also likely sensory neurons and most, if not all, pharyngeal neurons also classify as motor neurons. Together with the extensive cross‐connectivity among pharyngeal neurons, which is more widespread than previously realized, the sensory‐motor characteristics of most neurons define a shallow network architecture of the pharyngeal connectome. Network analysis reveals that the patterns of neuronal connections are organized into putative computational modules that reflect the known functional domains of the pharynx. Compared to the somatic nervous system, pharyngeal neurons both physically associate with a larger fraction of their neighbors and create synapses with a greater proportion of their neighbors. We speculate that the overall architecture of the pharyngeal nervous system may be reminiscent of the architecture of ancestral, primitive nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal hippocampal cultures are simple and valuable models for studying neuronal function. While embryonic cultures are widely used for different applications, mouse postnatal cultures are still challenging, lack reproducibility and/or exhibit inappropriate neuronal activity. Yet, postnatal cultures have major advantages such as allowing genotyping of pups before culture and reducing the number of experimental animals. Herein we describe a simple and fast protocol for culturing and genetically manipulating hippocampal neurons from P0 to P3 mice. This protocol provides reproducible cultures exhibiting a consistent neuronal development, normal excitatory over inhibitory neuronal ratio and a physiological neuronal activity. We also describe simple and efficient procedures for genetic manipulation of neurons using transfection reagent or lentiviral particles. Overall, this method provides a detailed and validated protocol allowing to explore cellular mechanisms and neuronal activity in postnatal hippocampal neurons in culture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Autaptic Cultures: Methods and Applications</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons typically form daisy chains of synaptic connections with other neurons, but they can also form synapses with themselves. Although such self-synapses, or autapses, are comparatively rare in vivo, they are surprisingly common in dissociated neuronal cultures. At first glance, autapses in culture seem like a mere curiosity. However, by providing a simple model system in which a single recording electrode gives simultaneous access to the pre- and postsynaptic compartments, autaptic cultures have proven to be invaluable in facilitating important and elegant experiments in the area of synaptic neuroscience. Here, I provide detailed protocols for preparing and recording from autaptic cultures (also called micro-island or microdot cultures). Variations on the basic procedure are presented, as well as practical tips for optimizing the outcomes. I also illustrate the utility of autaptic cultures by reviewing the types of experiments that have used them over the past three decades. These examples serve to highlight the power and elegance of this simple model system, and will hopefully inspire new experiments for the interrogation of synaptic function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Synaptic Plasticity on Motoneurons After Axotomy: A Necessary Change in Paradigm</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Motoneurons axotomized by peripheral nerve injuries experience profound changes in their synaptic inputs that are associated with a neuroinflammatory response that includes local microglia and astrocytes. This reaction is conserved across different types of motoneurons, injuries, and species, but also displays many unique features in each particular case. These reactions have been amply studied, but there is still a lack of knowledge on their functional significance and mechanisms. In this review article, we compiled data from many different fields to generate a comprehensive conceptual framework to best interpret past data and spawn new hypotheses and research. We propose that synaptic plasticity around axotomized motoneurons should be divided into two distinct processes. First, a rapid cell-autonomous, microglia-independent shedding of synapses from motoneuron cell bodies and proximal dendrites that is reversible after muscle reinnervation. Second, a slower mechanism that is microglia-dependent and permanently alters spinal cord circuitry by fully eliminating from the ventral horn the axon collaterals of peripherally injured and regenerating sensory Ia afferent proprioceptors. This removes this input from cell bodies and throughout the dendritic tree of axotomized motoneurons as well as from many other spinal neurons, thus reconfiguring ventral horn motor circuitries to function after regeneration without direct sensory feedback from muscle. This process is modulated by injury severity, suggesting a correlation with poor regeneration specificity due to sensory and motor axons targeting errors in the periphery that likely render Ia afferent connectivity in the ventral horn nonadaptive. In contrast, reversible synaptic changes on the cell bodies occur only while motoneurons are regenerating. This cell-autonomous process displays unique features according to motoneuron type and modulation by local microglia and astrocytes and generally results in a transient reduction of fast synaptic activity that is probably replaced by embryonic-like slow GABA depolarizations, proposed to relate to regenerative mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Biomarker development is currently a high priority in neurodevelopmental disorder research. For many types of biomarkers (particularly biomarkers of diagnosis), reliability over short periods is critically important. In the field of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), resting electroencephalography (EEG) power spectral densities (PSD) are well-studied for their potential as biomarkers. Classically, such data have been decomposed into pre-specified frequency bands (e.g., delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). Recent technical advances, such as the Fitting Oscillations and One-Over-F (FOOOF) algorithm, allow for targeted characterization of the features that naturally emerge within an EEG PSD, permitting a more detailed characterization of the frequency band-agnostic shape of each individual’s EEG PSD. Here, using two resting EEGs collected a median of 6 days apart from 22 children with ASD and 25 typically developing (TD) controls during the Feasibility Visit of the Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials, we estimate test-retest reliability based on the characterization of the PSD shape in two ways: (1) Using the FOOOF algorithm we estimate six parameters (offset, slope, number of peaks, and amplitude, center frequency and bandwidth of the largest alpha peak) that characterize the shape of the EEG PSD; and (2) using nonparametric functional data analyses, we decompose the shape of the EEG PSD into a reduced set of basis functions that characterize individual power spectrum shapes. We show that individuals exhibit idiosyncratic PSD signatures that are stable over recording sessions using both characterizations. Our data show that EEG activity from a brief 2-min recording provides an efficient window into characterizing brain activity at the single-subject level with desirable psychometric characteristics that persist across different analytical decomposition methods. This is a necessary step towards analytical validation of biomarkers based on the EEG PSD and provides insights into parameters of the PSD that offer short-term reliability (and thus promise as potential biomarkers of trait or diagnosis) vs. those that are more variable over the short term (and thus may index state or other rapidly dynamic measures of brain function). Future research should address the longer-term stability of the PSD, for purposes such as monitoring development or response to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Paired Trial Classification: A Novel Deep Learning Technique for MVPA</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many recent developments in machine learning have come from the field of “deep learning,” or the use of advanced neural network architectures and techniques. While these methods have produced state-of-the-art results and dominated research focus in many fields, such as image classification and natural language processing, they have not gained as much ground over standard multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) techniques in the classification of electroencephalography (EEG) or other human neuroscience datasets. The high dimensionality and large amounts of noise present in EEG data, coupled with the relatively low number of examples (trials) that can be reasonably obtained from a sample of human subjects, lead to difficulty training deep learning models. Even when a model successfully converges in training, significant overfitting can occur despite the presence of regularization techniques. To help alleviate these problems, we present a new method of “paired trial classification” that involves classifying pairs of EEG recordings as coming from the same class or different classes. This allows us to drastically increase the number of training examples, in a manner akin to but distinct from traditional data augmentation approaches, through the combinatorics of pairing trials. Moreover, paired trial classification still allows us to determine the true class of a novel example (trial) via a “dictionary” approach: compare the novel example to a group of known examples from each class, and determine the final class via summing the same/different decision values within each class. Since individual trials are noisy, this approach can be further improved by comparing a novel individual example with a “dictionary” in which each entry is an average of several examples (trials). Even further improvements can be realized in situations where multiple samples from a single unknown class can be averaged, thus permitting averaged signals to be compared with averaged signals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electric stimulators with precise and reliable outputs are an indispensable part of electrophysiological research. From single cells to deep brain or neuromuscular tissue, there are diverse targets for electrical stimulation. Even though commercial systems are available, we state the need for a low-cost, high precision, functional, and modular (hardware, firmware, and software) current stimulation system with the capacity to generate stable and complex waveforms for pre-clinical research. The system presented in this study is a USB controlled 4-channel modular current stimulator that can be expanded and generate biphasic arbitrary waveforms with 16-bit resolution, high temporal precision (μs), and passive charge balancing: the NES STiM (Neuro Electronic Systems Stimulator). We present a detailed description of the system’s structural design, the controlling software, reliability test, and the pre-clinical studies [deep brain stimulation (DBS) in hemi-PD rat model] in which it was utilized. The NES STiM has been tested with MacOS and Windows operating systems. Interfaces to MATLAB source codes are provided. The system is inexpensive, relatively easy to build and can be assembled quickly. We hope that the NES STiM will be used in a wide variety of neurological applications such as Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES), DBS and closed loop neurophysiological research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Human Breast Cancer Cells Demonstrate Electrical Excitability</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancers worldwide and yet, its pathophysiology is poorly understood. Single-cell electrophysiological studies have provided evidence that membrane depolarization is implicated in the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer. However, metastatic breast cancer cells are highly dynamic microscopic systems with complexities beyond a single-cell level. There is an urgent need for electrophysiological studies and technologies capable of decoding the intercellular signaling pathways and networks that control proliferation and metastasis, particularly at a population level. Hence, we present for the first time non-invasive in vitro electrical recordings of strongly metastatic MDA-MB-231 and weakly/non-metastatic MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. To accomplish this, we fabricated an ultra-low noise sensor that exploits large-area electrodes, of 2 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which maximizes the double-layer capacitance and concomitant detection sensitivity. We show that the current recorded after adherence of the cells is dominated by the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs), confirmed by application of the highly specific inhibitor, tetrodotoxin (TTX). The electrical activity of MDA-MB-231 cells surpasses that of the MCF-7 cells, suggesting a link between the cells’ bioelectricity and invasiveness. We also recorded an activity pattern with characteristics similar to that of Random Telegraph Signal (RTS) noise. RTS patterns were less frequent than the asynchronous VGSC signals. The RTS noise power spectral density showed a Lorentzian shape, which revealed the presence of a low-frequency signal across MDA-MB-231 cell populations with propagation speeds of the same order as those reported for intercellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; waves. Our recording platform paves the way for real-time investigations of the bioelectricity of cancer cells, their ionic/pharmacological properties and relationship to metastatic potential.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Serial Dopamine Transporter Imaging of Nigrostriatal Function in Parkinson’s Disease With Probable REM Sleep Behavior Disorder</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The current study aimed to confirm whether probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (pRBD) is associated with a specific pattern of striatal dopamine depletion in an international, multicenter, prospective cohort of patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Two hundred and seventy de novo, drug-naïve patients with PD underwent dopamine transporter (DAT) single photon emission computed tomography with &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I-FP-CIT at baseline and 1, 2, and 4 years after the initial scan. The diagnosis of pRBD was based on the 10-item RBD Screening Questionnaire. Striatal DAT binding levels and their rates of decline were compared between patients with pRBD and those without. At baseline, patients in the PD-pRBD+ group showed lower striatal DAT binding in the caudate (which was more pronounced in the less-affected hemisphere) and in the putamen. During the 4-year follow-up, patients in the PD-pRBD+ group consistently exhibited greater DAT loss than patients in the PD-pRBD− group with comparable disease duration in all four striatal subregions. These patients also exhibited a more rapid decrease in DAT binding in the caudate and a less prominent interhemispheric asymmetry in the putamen. The distinct pattern of striatal DAT depletion may contribute to a more malignant phenotype of PD associated with RBD, specifically faster progression of motor symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Correcting Task fMRI Signals for Variability in Baseline CBF Improves BOLD-Behavior Relationships: A Feasibility Study in an Aging Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00336</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) functional MRI is a complex neurovascular signal whose magnitude depends on baseline physiological factors such as cerebral blood flow (CBF). Because baseline CBF varies across the brain and is altered with aging, the interpretation of stand-alone aging-related BOLD changes can be misleading. The primary objective of this study was to develop a methodology that combines task fMRI and arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques to sensitize task-induced BOLD activity by covarying out the baseline physiology (i.e., CBF) in an aging model. We recruited 11 younger and 13 older healthy participants who underwent ASL and an overt language fMRI task (semantic category member generation). We measured in-scanner language performance to investigate the effect of BOLD sensitization on BOLD-behavior relationships. The results demonstrate that our correction approach is effective at enhancing the specificity and sensitivity of the BOLD signal in both groups. In addition, the correction strengthens the statistical association between task BOLD activity and behavioral performance. Although CBF has inherent age dependence, our results show that retaining the age factor within CBF aides in greater sensitization of task fMRI signals. From a cognitive standpoint, compared to young adults, the older participants showed a delayed domain-general language-related task activity possibly due to compromised vessel compliance. Further, assessment of functional evolution of corrected BOLD activity revealed biphasic BOLD dynamics in both groups where BOLD deactivation may reflect greater semantic demand or increased premium on domain general executive functioning in response to task difficulty. Although it was promising to note that the predictability of behavior using the proposed methodology outperforms other methodologies (i.e., no correction and normalization by division), and provides moderate stability and adequate power, further work with a larger cohort and other task designs is necessary to improve the stability of predicting associated behavior. In summary, we recommend correction of task fMRI signals by covarying out baseline CBF especially when comparing groups with different neurovascular properties. Given that ASL and BOLD fMRI are well established and widely employed techniques, our proposed multi-modal methodology can be readily implemented into data processing pipelines to obtain more accurate BOLD activation maps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
