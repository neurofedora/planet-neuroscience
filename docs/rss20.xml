	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Microglia Under the Spotlight: Activity and Complement-Dependent Engulfment of Synapses</title>

	<description>In 2012, Schaefer et al. revealed that microglia regulate the emergence of functional connectivity by engulfing and selectively eliminating synapses in the retinogeniculate system. This synaptic pruning mechanism, which is activity dependent and relies on the complement cascade, has helped define microglia as a central contributor to normal wiring and to brain disorders.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Synaptic Capture of Laterally Diffusing AMPA Receptors – An Idea That Stuck</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30084-5?rss=yes</guid>

	<description>By the early 2000s there was strong support for the idea that synaptic function and plasticity required AMPA glutamate receptor trafficking through constitutive and regulated internalization and exocytosis. In 2002, Borgdorff and Choquet demonstrated that AMPA receptors could also diffuse laterally in the membrane and become stabilized near synapses. Subsequent studies extended this work, establishing a fundamental role for lateral diffusion in synaptic function and plasticity.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Peptide-Mediated Neurotransmission Takes Center Stage</title>

	<description>Today, we understand peptide transmitters to be signaling molecules that modulate neural activity. However, in 1982 little was known about neuropeptides and their role in neural communication. The influential 1982 paper by Jan and Jan reported definitive evidence that a presynaptically released neuropeptide evokes postsynaptic responses in an identified cholinergic synapse, thereby fueling a new era in neuroscience.</description>

	<description>In 1992, Brose et al. showed that the synaptic vesicle (SV) protein p65/synaptotagmin (syt) 1 binds – in a mutually dependent manner – Ca2+ and anionic phospholipids, prompting the idea that it functions as a Ca2+ sensor for exocytosis. These findings now define two key aspects of excitation–secretion coupling.</description>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08658</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this study, and through an understanding of neuronal system communication,
A light was shed upon a novel model serves as an assistive technology for
locked-in people suffering from Motor neuronal disease. MND patients, who have
an intact minds, are able -till now- to make a mean of on-screen communication.
Work was done upon the potential of brain wave activity patterns to be detected
as electrical signals, classified and translated into commands following BCI
constructing paradigm. However, The interface constructed was for the first
time a device which can reconstruct this command physically. The intervention
is in a software is used to classify imagined right and left limb movement into
binary results, and then make use of the magnetic field produced by the
amplified pulses to reconstruct the activity into ferrofluid droplets movement-
these moved due rotation of a desk according to the data received. Objectives
of the project is to address the challenges of the inaccurate performance and
cost of user-training which are yet the main issues preventing BCI from being
upgraded into more immersive and effective technology. The design requirements
addressed were the communication speed of the droplet movement and the accuracy
of hitting fixed targets . Tests were performed based on software programs
accelerated changing motor imagery movement of left and right limbs. The tests
achieved an average speed of 0.469 cm/s and average accuracy of 81.6% for the
best volume from many were tried. A conclusion to be drawn was that the promise
of this other point of view on BCI systems to be more Brain-Real World Systems.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: CARE-rCortex: a Matlab toolbox for the analysis of CArdio-REspiratory-related activity in the Cortex. (arXiv:1805.08646v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08646</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08646</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Although cardio-respiratory (CR) system is generally controlled
by the autonomic nervous system, interactions between the cortex and these
primary functions are receiving an increasing research interest. New method: In
general, the timing of such internally paced events (e.g. heartbeats or
respiratory cycles) may display a large variability. For the analysis of such
CR event-related EEG potentials, a baseline must be correctly associated to
each cycle of detected events. The open-source toolbox CARE-rCortex provides an
easy-to-use interface to detect CR events, define baselines, and analyse in
time-frequency (TF) domain the EEG potentials. Results: CARE-rCortex provides
some practical tools for the detection and the manual validation of CR events.
These events allow to define baselines time-locked to a phase of respiratory or
heart cycles. A statistical test has also been integrated to highlight
significant points of the TF maps with respect to the baseline. We illustrate
the use of the toolbox with the analysis of two real cardio-respiratory
datasets. Comparison with existing methods: Compared to other open-source
toolboxes, CARE-rCortex allows to automatically detect CR events, to define and
check baselines for each detected event. Different baseline normalizations can
be used in the TF analysis of EEG epochs. Conclusions: The analysis of
CR-related EEG activities could provide valuable information about cognitive or
pathological brain states. CARE-rCortex provides an efficient and automatic
detection of CR events for a posterior analysis of event-related EEG
activities. CARE-rCortex runs in Matlab as a plug-in of the EEGLAB software,
and it is publicly available at https://github:com/FannyGrosselin/CARE-rCortex.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the complexity of biological neural networks like the human
brain is one of the scientific challenges of our century. The organization of
the brain can be described at different levels, ranging from small neural
networks to entire brain regions. Existing methods for the description of
functionally or effective connectivity are based on the analysis of relations
between the activities of different neural units by detecting correlations or
information flow. This is a crucial step in understanding neural disorders like
Alzheimers disease and their causative factors. To evaluate these estimation
methods, it is necessary to refer to a neural network with known connectivity,
which is typically unknown for natural biological neural networks. Therefore,
network simulations, also in silico, are available. In this work, the in silico
simulation of large scale neural networks is established and the influence of
different topologies on the generated patterns of neuronal signals is
investigated. The goal is to develop standard evaluation methods for
neurocomputational algorithms with a realistic large scale model to enable
benchmarking and comparability of different studies.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic community detection provides a coherent description of network
clusters over time, allowing one to track the growth and death of communities
as the network evolves. However, modularity maximization, a popular method for
performing multilayer community detection, requires the specification of an
appropriate null model as well as resolution and interlayer coupling
parameters. Importantly, the ability of the algorithm to accurately detect
community evolution is dependent on the choice of these parameters. In
functional temporal networks, where evolving communities reflect changing
functional relationships between network nodes, it is especially important that
the detected communities reflect any state changes of the system. Here, we
present analytical work suggesting that a uniform null model provides improved
sensitivity to the detection of small evolving communities in temporal
correlation networks. We then propose a method for increasing the sensitivity
of modularity maximization to state changes in nodal dynamics by modeling
self-identity links between layers based on the self-similarity of the network
nodes between layers. This method is more appropriate for functional temporal
networks from both a modeling and mathematical perspective, as it incorporates
the dynamic nature of network nodes. We motivate our method based on
applications in neuroscience where network nodes represent neurons and
functional edges represent similarity of firing patterns in time. Finally, we
show that in simulated data sets of neuronal spike trains, updating interlayer
links based on the firing properties of the neurons provides superior community
detection of evolving network structure when group of neurons change their
firing properties over time.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last several years, the use of machine learning (ML) in neuroscience
has been increasing exponentially. Here, we review ML's contributions, both
realized and potential, across several areas of systems neuroscience. We
describe four primary roles of ML within neuroscience: 1) creating solutions to
engineering problems, 2) identifying predictive variables, 3) setting
benchmarks for simple models of the brain, and 4) serving itself as a model for
the brain. The breadth and ease of its applicability suggests that machine
learning should be in the toolbox of most systems neuroscientists.

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Preterm birth is the greatest risk factor for lifelong neurocognitive deficits, globally. The effect of prematurity on early cortical network function has, however, remained poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel methodology that allows reliable assessment of functional connectivity in neonatal brain activity at millisecond and multisecond scales in terms of cortical phase and amplitude correlations, respectively. We measured scalp electroencephalography at term-equivalent age in infants exposed to very early prematurity as well as in healthy controls. We found that newborn cortical activity organizes into multiplex networks that differ significantly between vigilance states. As compared with healthy control infants, prematurity was found to cause frequency-specific patterns of dysconnectivity in cortical network, changes that were distinct for networks of phase and amplitude correlations. Neuroanatomically, the most prominent markers of prematurity were found in connections involving the frontal regions. Phase synchrony in frontally connected networks was correlated with newborn neurological performance, suggesting the first measure of cortical functional coupling that correlates with neurological performance in human infant.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Uncovering Neuronal Networks Defined by Consistent Between-Neuron Spike Timing from Neuronal Spike Recordings</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;It is widely assumed that distributed neuronal networks are fundamental to the functioning of the brain. Consistent spike timing between neurons is thought to be one of the key principles for the formation of these networks. This can involve synchronous spiking or spiking with time delays, forming spike sequences when the order of spiking is consistent. Finding networks defined by their sequence of time-shifted spikes, denoted here as spike timing networks, is a tremendous challenge. As neurons can participate in multiple spike sequences at multiple between-spike time delays, the possible complexity of networks is prohibitively large. We present a novel approach that is capable of (1) extracting spike timing networks regardless of their sequence complexity, and (2) that describes their spiking sequences with high temporal precision. We achieve this by decomposing frequency-transformed neuronal spiking into separate networks, characterizing each network’s spike sequence by a time delay per neuron, forming a spike sequence timeline. These networks provide a detailed template for an investigation of the experimental relevance of their spike sequences. Using simulated spike timing networks, we show network extraction is robust to spiking noise, spike timing jitter, and partial occurrences of the involved spike sequences. Using rat multineuron recordings, we demonstrate the approach is capable of revealing real spike timing networks with sub-millisecond temporal precision. By uncovering spike timing networks, the prevalence, structure, and function of complex spike sequences can be investigated in greater detail, allowing us to gain a better understanding of their role in neuronal functioning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: RNA from Trained Aplysia Can Induce an Epigenetic Engram for Long-Term Sensitization in Untrained Aplysia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The precise nature of the engram, the physical substrate of memory, remains uncertain. Here, it is reported that RNA extracted from the central nervous system of &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; given long-term sensitization (LTS) training induced sensitization when injected into untrained animals; furthermore, the RNA-induced sensitization, like training-induced sensitization, required DNA methylation. In cellular experiments, treatment with RNA extracted from trained animals was found to increase excitability in sensory neurons, but not in motor neurons, dissociated from naïve animals. Thus, the behavioral, and a subset of the cellular, modifications characteristic of a form of nonassociative long-term memory (LTM) in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; can be transferred by RNA. These results indicate that RNA is sufficient to generate an engram for LTS in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; and are consistent with the hypothesis that RNA-induced epigenetic changes underlie memory storage in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>The formation of identical twins from a single egg has fascinated developmental biologists for a very long time. Previous work had shown that Xenopus blastulae bisected along the dorsal–ventral (D-V) midline (i.e., the sagittal plane) could generate twins but at very low frequencies. Here, we have improved this method by...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/d_86g5hq2u0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: dSTIM and Ral/Exocyst Mediated Synaptic Release from Pupal Dopaminergic Neurons Sustains Drosophila Flight</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Manifestation of appropriate behaviour in adult animals requires developmental mechanisms that help in the formation of correctly wired neural circuits. Flight circuit development in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; requires Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) through the STIM/Orai pathway. SOCE-associated flight deficits in adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; derive extensively from regulation of gene expression in pupal neurons, and one such SOCE-regulated gene encodes the small GTPase &lt;i&gt;Ral&lt;/i&gt;. The cellular mechanism by which Ral helps in maturation of the flight circuit was not understood. Here, we show that knockdown of components of a Ral effector, the exocyst complex, in pupal neurons also leads to reduced flight bout durations, and this phenotype derives primarily from dopaminergic neurons. Importantly, synaptic release from pupal dopaminergic neurons is abrogated upon knockdown of either dSTIM, Ral or exocyst components. &lt;i&gt;Ral&lt;/i&gt; overexpression restores the diminished synaptic release of &lt;i&gt;dStim&lt;/i&gt; knockdown neurons as well as flight deficits associated with &lt;i&gt;dSTIM&lt;/i&gt; knockdown in dopaminergic neurons. These results identify Ral mediated vesicular release as an effector mechanism of neuronal SOCE in pupal dopaminergic neurons with functional consequences on flight behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Appropriate wiring of neuronal circuits during development is essential for adult behavior and cellular mechanisms such as calcium signaling orchestrate the pattern and strength of such neuronal connections to a significant extent. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, flight behavior impacts multiple aspects of life. Calcium, especially through the Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) pathway, regulates gene expression during flight circuit maturation. &lt;i&gt;Ral,&lt;/i&gt; encodes a small GTPase, and is one such SOCE-regulated gene required for &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; flight. In this paper, we show that SOCE-related loss of flight is determined to a significant extent by Ral and the exocyst complex driven synaptic vesicle release in pupal dopaminergic neurons. Thus, SOCE regulated release of dopamine ensures correct wiring of the flight circuit in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dynamic Interactions between Emotion Perception, Action Perception, and Action Preparation Areas for Reacting to Social Threat: A Combined cTBS-fMRI Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0408-17.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Expressions of emotion are powerful triggers for situation-appropriate responses by the observer. Of particular interest regarding the preparation of such adaptive actions are parietal and premotor cortices, given their connectivity with the amygdala (AMG), known to play a crucial role in processing of affective information and in motor response. We set out to disentangle the respective roles of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and ventral premotor cortex (PMv) in humans in the processing of emotional body expressions by assessing remote effects of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) in the action network and in AMG. Participants were presented with blocks of short videos showing either angry or neutral whole body actions. The experiment consisted of three fMRI sessions; two preceded by stimulation of either right IPL or PMv, and a third session assessed baseline activity. Interestingly, whereas at baseline the lAMG did not differentiate between neutral and angry body postures, a significant difference between these conditions emerged after stimulation of either rIPL or rPMv, with much larger responses to angry than neutral stimuli. In addition, effects of cTBS stimulation and emotion were also observed in two other action relevant areas, the supplementary motor area and the superior parietal cortex. Together, these results show how areas involved in action and emotion perception and in action preparation interact dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; When confronted with social threat, the brain must prepare situation-adaptive responses. Previous studies have shown that IPL and PMv are critically involved in social threat perception and that amygdala is triggered by emotional valence of the stimuli. So far, the causal relation between IPL, PMv and amygdala is not clear. By combining cTBS with fMRI, we show that stimulation of IPL and PMv induces significant differences between perception of angry versus neutral bodies in amygdala. Furthermore, stimulation of these areas led to significant interaction effects between the emotion presented and site stimulated in a number of remote parietal and motor areas. Our findings demonstrate involvement of IPL and PMv in emotion body processing, and interaction between these areas and with the amygdala during this process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Amygdala Corticofugal Input Shapes Mitral Cell Responses in the Accessory Olfactory Bulb</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Interconnections between the olfactory bulb and the amygdala are a major pathway for triggering strong behavioral responses to a variety of odorants. However, while this broad mapping has been established, the patterns of amygdala feedback connectivity and the influence on olfactory circuitry remain unknown. Here, using a combination of neuronal tracing approaches, we dissect the connectivity of a cortical amygdala (PmCo) feedback circuit innervating the mouse accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). Optogenetic activation of PmCo feedback mainly results in feed-forward mitral cell (MC) inhibition through direct excitation of GABAergic granule cells (GC). In addition, LED-driven activity of corticofugal afferents increases the gain of MC responses to olfactory nerve stimulation. Thus, through corticofugal pathways, the PmCo likely regulates primary olfactory and social odor processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Olfactory inputs are relayed directly through the amygdala to hypothalamic and limbic system nuclei regulating essential responses in the context of social behavior. However, it is not clear whether and how amygdala circuits participate in the earlier steps of olfactory processing at the level of the olfactory bulb. Unraveling the organization of this circuitry is critical to understand the function of amygdala circuits. Combining cre-dependent viral tracing with optogenetic-assisted patch clamp electrophysiology, the present work maps the synaptic connectivity and physiology of a cortical amygdala pathway innervating primary olfactory circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Cytoskeletal components, such as tubulins and actins, have the remarkable ability to organize themselves into filaments and networks to support specialized and compartmentalized functions. Alterations in cytoskeletal proteins have long been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on recent findings, primarily from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans that illustrate how different tubulin protein isotypes can play distinct roles in neuronal development and function. Additionally, we discuss studies revealing new regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and highlight recent technological advances in in vivo imaging and functional dissection of the neuronal cytoskeleton. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

The entorhinal–hippocampal system is central to such representations, which are severely compromised in some neurological diseases. In spite of much progress, a comprehensive, integrated view of spatial, temporal and other aspects of episodic representation remains elusive. Here, we review recent data on the role of cell-type specific entorhinal inputs which excite deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal cells by direct and indirect pathways. We discuss how an entorhinal dialogue with deep-superficial CA1 cells can multiplex neuronal activity along theta phases and how their reactivation may be segregated during sharp-wave ripples. Thus, deep and superficial CA1 sublayers provide substrate for general hippocampal function. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;159&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817302994-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

However, recent studies have revealed that some non-primate animal species have higher levels of dexterity than previously supposed, and in higher primates, various indirect non-CM descending pathways have been shown to participate in the control of dexterous movements. More recently, the CM pathway was shown to exist in rodents during early development, suggesting that rodents and primates diverged in their reliance on the CM pathway at some point in evolution, thus challenging the traditional view of the sequential development of hand control from rodents to primates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

How an animal efficiently switches between distinct behaviors is a fundamental question whose inquiry will provide insights into the mechanisms that are necessary for an organism's survival. Previous work aimed at identifying the neural systems responsible for defensive behaviors, such as freezing, has demonstrated critical interactions between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Indeed, this foundational research has provided an indispensable anatomical framework that investigators are now using to understand the physiological mechanisms of defined neural circuits within the prefrontal cortex that code for the rapid and flexible expression of defensive behaviors. Here we review recent findings demonstrating temporal and rate coding mechanisms of freezing behavior in the prefrontal cortex. We hypothesize that anatomical features, such as target structure and cortical layer, as well as the nature of the information to be coded, may be critical factors determining the coding scheme. Furthermore, detailed behavioral analyses may reveal subtypes of defensive behaviors that represent the principle factor governing coding selection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: August 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Tara E   Tracy, Li   Gan&lt;br /&gt; The accumulation of pathological tau in the brain is associated with neuronal deterioration and cognitive impairments in tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease. Tau, while primarily localized in the axons of healthy neurons, accumulates in the soma and dendrites of neurons under pathogenic conditions. Tau is found in both presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments of neurons in Alzheimer's disease. New research supports that soluble forms of tau trigger pathophysiology in the brain by altering properties of synaptic and neuronal function at the early stages of disease progression, before neurons die. Here we review the current understanding of how tau-mediated synaptic and neuronal dysfunction contributes to cognitive decline. Delineating the mechanisms by which pathogenic tau alters synapses, dendrites and axons will help lay the foundation for new strategies that can restore neuronal function in tauopathy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

This locomotor network generates the rhythmic output, coordinate left/right alternation, and permit communication across segments. Through evolution, more complex movement patterns have emerged, made possible by sub-specialization of neural populations within the spinal cord. Walking tetrapods use a similar basic circuitry, but have added layers of complexity for the coordination of intralimbic flexor and extensor muscles as well as interlimbic coordination between the body halves and fore/hindlimbs. Although the basics of these circuits are known there is a gap in our knowledge regarding how different speeds and gaits are coordinated. Analysing subpopulations among described neuronal populations may bring insight into how changes in locomotor output are orchestrated by a hard-wired network. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Although clinically different, they share similar molecular features: the accumulation of one or two proteins in abnormal conformations inside or outside neurons. Enhancing protein quality control systems could be a useful strategy to neutralize the abnormal proteins causing neurodegenerative diseases. This review emphasizes the subcellular location of protein deposits in neurodegenerative diseases and the need to tailor strategies aimed at boosting protein quality control systems to the affected subcellular compartment. Inhibition of a protein phosphatase terminating the unfolded protein response will be discussed as a strategy to protect from diseases associated with misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Here, we review the recent increase in our understanding of how synapse type-specific molecules differentially regulate the development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Moreover, several synapse subtype-specific molecules have been shown to control the targeting, formation or maturation of particular subtypes of excitatory synapses. Because inhibitory neurons are extremely diverse, a similar molecular diversity is likely to underlie the development of different inhibitory synapses making it a promising topic for future investigation in the field of the synapse development. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Recent findings from in vivo and in vitro models of motor neuron development have expanded our understanding of how transcription factors govern motor neuron identity and their individual regulatory mechanisms. With the advent of next generation sequencing approaches, researchers now have unprecedented access to the gene regulatory dynamics involved in motor neuron development and are uncovering new connections linking neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative disease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Here, we discuss recent work using personalized brain network models to study structure–function relationships in human brains. We describe the steps necessary to build such models and show how this computational approach can provide previously unobtainable information through the ability to perform virtual experiments. Finally, we present examples of how personalized brain network models can be used to gain insight into the effects of local stimulation and improve surgical outcomes in epilepsy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;93&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438818300059-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Recent discoveries have revealed surprising and complex roles of the small area CA2 in hippocampal function. Lesion studies have revealed that this region is required for social memory formation. Area CA2 is targeted by extra-hippocampal paraventricular inputs that release vasopressin and can act to enhance social memory performance. In vivo recordings have revealed nonconventional activity by neurons in this region that act to both initiate hippocampal sharp-wave ripple events as well as encode spatial information during immobility. Silencing of CA2 pyramidal neurons has revealed that this area also acts to control hippocampal network excitability during encoding, and this balance of excitation and inhibition is disrupted in disease. This review summarizes recent findings and attempts to integrate these results into pre-existing models. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity.

When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The segregation of image parts into foreground and background is an important
aspect of the neural computation of 3D scene perception. To achieve such
segregation, the brain needs information about border ownership; that is, the
belongingness of a contour to a specific surface represented in the image. This
article presents psychophysical data derived from 3D percepts of figure and
ground that were generated by presenting 2D images composed of spatially
disjoint shapes that pointed inward or outward relative to the continuous
boundaries that they induced along their collinear edges. The shapes in some
images had the same contrast (black or white) with respect to the background
gray. Other images included opposite contrasts along each induced continuous
boundary. Psychophysical results show that figure vs ground judgment
probabilities in response to these ambiguous displays are determined by the
orientation of contrasts only, not by their relative contrasts, despite the
fact that many border ownership cells in cortical area V2 respond to a
preferred relative contrast. The FACADE and 3D LAMINART models are used to
explain these data.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Power-law-shaped avalanche-size distributions are widely used to probe for
critical behavior in many different systems, particularly in neural networks.
The definition of avalanche is ambiguous. Usually, theoretical avalanches are
defined as the activity between a stimulus and the relaxation to an inactive
absorbing state. On the other hand, experimental neuronal avalanches are
defined by the activity between consecutive silent states. We claim that the
latter definition may be extended to some theoretical models to characterize
their power-law avalanches and critical behavior. We study a system in which
the separation of driving and relaxation time scales emerges from its
structure. We apply both definitions of avalanche to our model. Both yield
power-law-distributed avalanches that scale with system size in the critical
point as expected. Nevertheless, we find restricted power-law-distributed
avalanches outside of the critical region within the experimental procedure,
which is not expected by the standard theoretical definition. We remark that
these results are dependent on the model details.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Making an informed, correct and quick decision can be life-saving. It's
crucial for animals during an escape behaviour or for autonomous cars during
driving. The decision can be complex and may involve an assessment of the
amount of threats present and the nature of each threat. Thus, we should expect
early sensory processing to supply classification information fast and
accurately, even before relying the information to higher brain areas or more
complex system components downstream. Today, advanced convolution artificial
neural networks can successfully solve such tasks and are commonly used to
build complex decision making systems. However, in order to achieve excellent
performance on these tasks they require increasingly complex, &quot;very deep&quot; model
structure, which is costly in inference run-time, energy consumption and
training samples, only trainable on cloud-computing clusters. A single spiking
neuron has been shown to be able to solve many of these required tasks for
homogeneous Poisson input statistics, a commonly used model for spiking
activity in the neocortex; when modeled as leaky integrate and fire with
gradient decent learning algorithm it was shown to posses a wide variety of
complex computational capabilities. Here we improve its learning algorithm. We
also account for more natural stimulus generated inputs that deviate from this
homogeneous Poisson spiking. The improved gradient-based local learning rule
allows for significantly better and stable generalization and more efficient
performance. We finally apply our model to a problem of multiple instance
learning with counting where labels are only available for collections of
concepts. In this counting MNIST task the neuron exploits the improved
algorithm and succeeds while out performing the previously introduced single
neuron learning algorithm as well as conventional ConvNet architecture under
similar conditions.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07528</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;How is reliable physiological function maintained in cells despite
considerable variability in the values of key parameters of multiple
interacting processes that govern that function? Here we use the classic
Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of the squid giant axon action potential to propose
a possible approach to this problem. Although the full Hodgkin-Huxley model is
very sensitive to fluctuations that independently occur in its many parameters,
the outcome is in fact determined by simple combinations of these parameters
along two physiological dimensions: Structural and Kinetic (denoted $S$ and
$K$). Structural parameters describe the properties of the cell, including its
capacitance and the densities of its ion channels. Kinetic parameters are those
that describe the opening and closing of the voltage-dependent conductances.
The impacts of parametric fluctuations on the dynamics of the system, seemingly
complex in the high dimensional representation of the Hodgkin-Huxley model, are
tractable when examined within the $S-K$ plane. We demonstrate that slow
inactivation, a ubiquitous activity-dependent feature of ionic channels, is a
powerful local homeostatic control mechanism that stabilizes excitability amid
changes in structural and kinetic parameters.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While many neuroscience questions aim to understand the human brain, much
current knowledge has been gained using animal models, which replicate genetic,
structural, and connectivity aspects of the human brain. While voxel-based
analysis (VBA) of preclinical magnetic resonance images is widely-used, a
thorough examination of the statistical robustness, stability, and error rates
is hindered by high computational demands of processing large arrays, and the
many parameters involved. Thus, workflows are often based on intuition or
experience, while preclinical validation studies remain scarce. To increase
throughput and reproducibility of quantitative small animal brain studies, we
have developed a publicly shared, high throughput VBA pipeline in a
high-performance computing environment, called SAMBA. The increased
computational efficiency allowed large multidimensional arrays to be processed
in 1-3 days, a task that previously took ~1 month. To quantify the variability
and reliability of preclinical VBA in rodent models, we propose a validation
framework consisting of morphological phantoms, and four metrics. This
addresses several sources that impact VBA results, including registration and
template construction strategies. We have used this framework to inform the VBA
workflow parameters in a VBA study for a mouse model of epilepsy. We also
present initial efforts towards standardizing small animal neuroimaging data in
a similar fashion with human neuroimaging. We conclude that verifying the
accuracy of VBA merits attention, and should be the focus of a broader effort
within the community. The proposed framework promotes consistent quality
assurance of VBA in preclinical neuroimaging; facilitating the creation and
communication of robust results.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Patterns and perceptions of cannabis use with physical activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328732v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328732v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background and Aims: Past research has shown that cannabis use is common among adults in the U.S. In addition, physical activity (PA), such as exercise, is often a component of many American's daily routines. Anecdotal information suggests that a subset of individuals use cannabis in conjunction with PA, but the evidence base is lacking. The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency, methods of ingestion, strain types, and timing (before, during or after) of cannabis use in combination with PA. We also sought to better understand the types of PA that cannabis is being used with and reasons why individuals may use cannabis with PA. Methods and Results: A brief survey was developed and was administered online to community residents (N = 105) who reported use of cannabis with PA. Analysis of survey responses revealed that participants were using cannabis in combination with a wide range of physical activities. While cannabis use was reported before, during, and after PA, the majority of participants (92%) reported use of cannabis before PA. Most participants (77%) believed that the use of cannabis products with their PA had a positive effect on their performance. The strain of cannabis used with PA was dependent on timing of cannabis use before, during, or after PA. Although participants reported a range of reasons for using cannabis before, during, or after PA, pain management was the only reason reported across all time periods. Conclusions: Findings from this study suggest that there is a sub-community of physically active individuals using cannabis with their PA, many who believe that cannabis use has a positive effect on their performance.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: An amplitude code increases the efficiency of information transmission across a visual synapse</title>

	<description>Most neurons in the brain transmit information digitally using sequences of spikes that trigger release of synaptic vesicles of fixed size. The first stages of vision and hearing are distinct in operating with analogue signals, but it is unclear how these are recoded for synaptic transmission. By imaging the release of glutamate in live zebrafish, we demonstrate how ribbon synapses of retinal bipolar cells transmit analogue visual signals by changes in both the rate and amplitude of synaptic events. Higher contrasts released glutamate packets composed of more vesicles and coding by amplitude often continued after rate coding had saturated. Glutamate packets equivalent to five vesicles transmitted four times as many bits of information per vesicle compared to independent release events. By discretizing analogue signals into sequences of numbers ranging up to eleven, ribbon synapses increase the dynamic range, temporal precision and efficiency with which visual information is transmitted.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Roles of Different Spatial Frequency Channels in Real-World Visual Motion Perception</title>

	<description>Speed perception is an important task performed by our visual system in various daily life tasks. In various psychophysical tests, relationship between spatial frequency, temporal frequency, and speed has been examined in human subjects. The role of vision impairment in speed perception has also been previously examined. In this work, we examine the inter-relationship between speed, spatial frequency, low vision conditions, and the type of input motion stimuli in motion perception accuracy. For this purpose, we propose a computational model for speed perception and evaluate it in custom generated natural and stochastic sequences by simulating low-vision conditions (low pass filtering at different cutoff frequencies) as well as complementary vision conditions (high pass versions at the same cutoff frequencies). Our results show that low frequency components are critical for accurate speed perception, whereas high frequencies do not play any important role in speed estimation. Since perception of low frequencies may not be impaired in visual acuity loss, speed perception was not found to be impaired in low vision conditions compared to normal vision condition. We also report significant differences between natural and stochastic stimuli, notably an increase in speed estimation error when using stochastic stimuli compared to natural sequences, emphasizing the use of natural stimuli when performing future psychophysical studies for speed perception.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Robust and fast Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling of diffusion MRI microstructure models</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328427v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>In diffusion MRI analysis, advances in biophysical multi-compartment modeling have gained popularity over the conventional Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), because they possess greater specificity in relating the dMRI signal to underlying cellular microstructure. Biophysical multi-compartment models require parameter estimation, typically performed using either Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) or using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling. Whereas MLE provides only a point estimate of the fitted model parameters, MCMC recovers the entire posterior distribution of the model parameters given the data, providing additional information such as parameter uncertainty and correlations. MCMC sampling is currently not routinely applied in dMRI microstructure modeling because it requires adjustments and tuning specific to each model, particularly in the choice of proposal distributions, burn-in length, thinning and the number of samples to store. In addition, sampling often takes at least an order of magnitude more time than non-linear optimization. Here we investigate the performance of MCMC algorithm variations over multiple popular diffusion microstructure models to see whether a single well performing variation could be applied efficiently and robustly to many models. Using an efficient GPU-based implementation, we show that run times can be removed as a prohibitive constraint for sampling of diffusion multi-compartment models. Using this implementation, we investigated the effectiveness of different adaptive MCMC algorithms, burn-in, initialization and thinning. Finally we apply the theory of Effective Sample Size to diffusion multi-compartment models as a way of determining a relatively general target for the number of samples needed to characterize parameter distributions for different models and datasets. We conclude that robust and fast sampling is achieved in most diffusion microstructure models with the Adaptive Metropolis-Within-Gibbs (AMWG) algorithm initialized with an MLE point estimate, in which case 100 to 200 samples are sufficient as a burn-in and thinning is mostly unnecessary. As a relatively general target for the number of samples, we recommend a multivariate Effective Sample Size of 2200.</description>

	<description>The amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been extensively studied because of its relevance to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its membrane distribution and neuronal function remain unclear. Here, we generated an APP fusion protein with a pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein at its ectodomain and a pH-insensitive blue fluorescent protein at its cytosolic domain to measure surface and intracellular APP distributions and its cleavage events. This fusion protein, closely resembling endogenous APP, demonstrated a limited correlation between synaptic activities and APP trafficking at synapses and neurites. Inhibition of the three major secretases distinctly affected membrane APP distribution. Intriguingly, the surface APP was inversely correlated to membrane cholesterol, a phenomenon involving APP's cholesterol-binding motif. A point mutation within this motif not only increased surface APP but also caused synaptic swelling when membrane cholesterol was reduced. Our results reveal previously unappreciated relationships between APP trafficking and processing and between membrane APP and cholesterol homeostasis at synapses.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Does subjective sleep quality predict cognitive performance? - Evidence from three empirical studies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328369v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The role of sleep in cognitive performance has gained increasing attention in neuroscience and sleep research in the recent decades, however, the relationship between subjective sleep quality and cognitive performance has not yet been comprehensively characterized. In this paper, our aim was to test - across three studies - the relationship between subjective sleep quality and a wide range of cognitive functions in healthy young adults. Sleep quality was assessed by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Athens Insomnia Scale, and a sleep diary to capture general subjective sleep quality, and Groningen Sleep Quality Scale and a questionnaire about the night prior to testing to capture prior night's sleep quality. Within cognitive functions, we tested several sub-processes of procedural learning, short-term memory, working memory and executive functions (assessed by the Alternating Serial Reaction Time, Digit Span, Counting Span tasks, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, respectively). To test the amount of evidence either for associations or no associations between subject sleep quality and cognitive performance, we calculated Bayes Factors along with frequentist analyses. Finally, to further increase the reliability of our conclusions, we also conducted a mini-meta-analysis on the three individual studies included in our paper. Our results, unequivocally across all analyses, show that there is no association between subjective sleep quality and cognitive performance in the domain of procedural learning, short-term/working memory, and executive functions. Our paper can contribute to a deeper understanding of subjective sleep quality and its measures, and we discuss various factors which may affect whether or not associations can be observed between subjective sleep quality and cognitive performance.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: An intermittent hypercaloric diet alters gut microbiota, prefrontal cortical gene expression and social behaviours in rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328294v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328294v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Excessive consumption of high fat and high sugar (HFHS) diets are known to alter reward processing and aspects of behaviour, and change microbiota profiles. Studies in gnotobiotic mice also provide evidence that gut microorganisms influence social behaviour. To further investigate these interactions, the impact of intermittent access to a HFHS diet on social behaviour, gene expression and microbiota composition was examined. Rats were permitted intermittent daily access (2h / day) to a palatable HFHS diet for 28 days across the adolescent period. Social interaction, social memory and novel object recognition were assessed during this period. Following testing, RT-PCR was conducted on hippocampal and prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples. 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing was used for identification and relative quantification of bacterial taxa. Reduced social interaction behaviours, and impaired social memory and novel object recognition were observed in HFHS diet rats. Reduced levels of monoamine oxidase A (Maoa), catechol-O-methyltransferase (Comt) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) mRNA were observed in the PFC of HFHS diet rats. The relative abundance of a number of specific taxa differed significantly between the two diet groups, in particular, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminoccoceae bacteria, which also predicted social behaviours, novel object recognition performance and Maoa expression. This is the first study to show that limited daily access to HFHS diet alters social behaviour and cognition in rats. Furthermore, behavioural changes are associated with alterations to cortical gene expression of enzymes involved in monoamine synthesis and neuroplasticity, and microbiota profiles predicted diet-induced changes to behaviour and gene expression.</description>

	<description>Antimicrobial peptides act as a host defense mechanism and regulate the commensal microbiome. To obtain a comprehensive view of genes contributing to long-term memory we performed mRNA sequencing from single Drosophila heads following behavioral training that produces long-lasting memory. Surprisingly, we find that two immune peptides with antimicrobial activity, Diptericin B and Gram-Negative Bacteria Binding Protein like 3, regulate long-term but not short-term memory or instinctive behavior in Drosophila. The cellular requirement of these two peptides is distinct: head fat body for DptB, and neurons for GNBP-like3. That antimicrobial peptides influence memory provides a novel example of the emerging link between the immune and nervous systems and reveals that some immune peptides may have been repurposed in the nervous system.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328187v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) is central to the pathogenesis of many dementias, including Alzheimer's disease. Autosomal dominant mutations in MAPT cause inherited frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are unclear. Using human stem cell models of FTD due to MAPT mutations, we find that tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and mislocalises to neuronal cell bodies and dendrites in cortical neurons, recapitulating a key early event in FTD. Mislocalised tau in the cell body leads to abnormal microtubule dynamics in FTD-MAPT neurons that grossly deform the nuclear membrane, resulting in defective nucleocytoplasmic transport. Neurons in the post-mortem human FTD-MAPT cortex have a high incidence of nuclear deformation, indicating that tau-mediated nuclear membrane dysfunction is an important pathogenic process in FTD. Defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport in FTD point to important commonalities in the pathogenic mechanisms of both tau-mediated dementias and ALS-FTD due to TDP-43 and C9orf72 mutations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Impact of Reward on Attention in Schizophrenia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327692v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327692v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Traditionally, attention was thought to be directed by either top-down goals or bottom-up salience. Recent studies have shown that the reward history of a stimulus feature also acts as a powerful attentional cue. This is particularly relevant in schizophrenia, which is characterized by motivational and attentional deficits. Here, we examine the impact of reward on selective attention. Forty-eight people with schizophrenia (PSZ) and 34 non-psychiatric control subject (NCS) discriminated the location of a target dot appearing inside a left circle or right circle. The circles were different colors, one of which was associated with reward via pre-training. In the first 2 blocks, targets were equally likely to appear in the left or right circle. In the last 4 blocks, the target was 75% likely on one side, thus allowing us to separately examine how attention was impacted by reward (color) and probability (location). PSZ had slower overall reaction times (RTs) than NCS. Both groups showed robust effects of spatial probability and reward history, with faster RTs for the rewarded color and for the more probable location. These effects were similar in PSZ and NCS. Negative symptom severity correlated with overall RT slowing, but there were no correlations between symptoms and reward-associated biasing of attention. PSZ demonstrated RT slowing but normal reward history and spatial probability-driven RT facilitation. These results are conceptually similar to prior findings showing intact implicit reward effects on response bias, and suggest that implicit processing of reward and probability is intact in PSZ.</description>

	<description>Scale-invariant timing has been observed in a wide range of behavioral experiments. The firing properties of recently described time cells provide a possible neural substrate for scale-invariant behavior. Earlier neural circuit models do not produce scale-invariant neural sequences. In this paper we present a biologically detailed network model based on an earlier mathematical algorithm. The simulations incorporate exponentially decaying persistent firing maintained by the calcium-activated nonspecific (CAN) cationic current and a network structure given by the inverse Laplace transform to generate time cells with scale-invariant firing rates. This model provides the first biologically detailed neural circuit for generating scale-invariant time cells. The circuit that implements the inverse Laplace transform merely consists of off-center/on-surround receptive fields. Critically, rescaling temporal sequences can be accomplished simply via cortical gain control (changing the slope of the f-I curve).</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Supplemental vibrotactile feedback of real-time limb position enhances precision of goal-directed reaching</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327049v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We examined vibrotactile stimulation as a form of supplemental limb state feedback to enhance on-going control goal-directed movements. Subjects wore a two-dimensional vibrotactile display on their non-dominant arm while performing horizontal planar reaching movements with their dominant arm. The vibrotactile display provided feedback of hand position such that small hand displacements were more easily discriminable using vibrotactile feedback than with intrinsic proprioceptive feedback. When subjects relied solely on proprioceptive feedback to capture visuospatial targets, target capture performance was degraded by proprioceptive drift and an expansion of task space. By contrast, reach accuracy was enhanced immediately when subjects were provided vibrotactile feedback, and further improved over two days of training. Improvements reflected a resolution of proprioceptive drift which occurred only when vibrotactile feedback was active, demonstrating that the benefits of vibrotactile feedback are due in part to its integration into the ongoing control of movement. A partial resolution of task space expansion that persisted even when the vibrotactile feedback was inactive demonstrated that training with vibrotactile feedback also induced changes in movement planning. However, the benefits of vibrotactile feedback come at a cognitive cost. All subjects adopted a stereotyped, movement decomposition strategy wherein they attempted to capture targets by moving first along one axis of the vibrotactile display and then the other. For most subjects, this inefficient movement approach did not resolve over two bouts of training performed on separate days, suggesting that additional training is needed to fully integrate vibrotactile feedback into the planning and online control of goal-directed reaching.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Polymorphic sites preferentially avoid co-evolving residues in MHC class I proteins</title>

Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules are critical to adaptive immune defence mechanisms in vertebrate species and are encoded by highly polymorphic genes. Polymorphic sites are located close to the ligand-binding groove and entail MHC-I alleles with distinct binding specificities. Some efforts have been made to investigate the relationship between polymorphism and protein stability. However, less is known about the relationship between polymorphism and MHC-I co-evolutionary constraints. Using Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) we found that co-evolution analysis accurately pinpoints structural contacts, although the protein family is restricted to vertebrates and comprises less than five hundred species, and that the co-evolutionary signal is mainly driven by cross-species changes, and not intra-species polymorphism. Moreover, we show that polymorphic sites in human preferentially avoid co-evolving residues, as well as residues involved in protein stability. These results suggest that sites displaying high polymorphism may also have been selected during vertebrates’ evolution to avoid those under co-evolutionary constraints and thereby maximize their mutability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5R4fGWtz6gQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Implications for human odor sensing revealed from the statistics of odorant-receptor interactions</title>

Binding of odorants to olfactory receptors (ORs) elicits downstream chemical and neural signals, which are further processed to odor perception in the brain. Recently, Mainland and colleagues have measured more than 500 pairs of odorant-OR interaction by a high-throughput screening assay method, opening a new avenue to understanding the principles of human odor coding. Here, using a recently developed minimal model for OR activation kinetics, we characterize the statistics of OR activation by odorants in terms of three empirical parameters: the half-maximum effective concentration EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, the efficacy, and the basal activity. While the data size of odorants is still limited, the statistics offer meaningful information on the breadth and optimality of the tuning of human ORs to odorants, and allow us to relate the three parameters with the microscopic rate constants and binding affinities that define the OR activation kinetics. Despite the stochastic nature of the response expected at individual OR-odorant level, we assess that the confluence of signals in a neuron released from the multitude of ORs is effectively free of noise and deterministic with respect to changes in odorant concentration. Thus, setting a threshold to the fraction of activated OR copy number for neural spiking binarizes the electrophysiological signal of olfactory sensory neuron, thereby making an information theoretic approach a viable tool in studying the principles of odor perception.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bABG40KQDFw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In recent years, two-photon calcium imaging has become a standard tool to probe the function of neural circuits and to study computations in neuronal populations. However, the acquired signal is only an indirect measurement of neural activity due to the comparatively slow dynamics of fluorescent calcium indicators. Different algorithms for estimating spike rates from noisy calcium measurements have been proposed in the past, but it is an open question how far performance can be improved. Here, we report the results of the &lt;i&gt;spikefinder&lt;/i&gt; challenge, launched to catalyze the development of new spike rate inference algorithms through crowd-sourcing. We present ten of the submitted algorithms which show improved performance compared to previously evaluated methods. Interestingly, the top-performing algorithms are based on a wide range of principles from deep neural networks to generative models, yet provide highly correlated estimates of the neural activity. The competition shows that benchmark challenges can drive algorithmic developments in neuroscience.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a1WS4uygAIc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Systematic interrogation of diverse Omic data reveals interpretable, robust, and generalizable transcriptomic features of clinically successful therapeutic targets</title>

Target selection is the first and pivotal step in drug discovery. An incorrect choice may not manifest itself for many years after hundreds of millions of research dollars have been spent. We collected a set of 332 targets that succeeded or failed in phase III clinical trials, and explored whether Omic features describing the target genes could predict clinical success. We obtained features from the recently published comprehensive resource: Harmonizome. Nineteen features appeared to be significantly correlated with phase III clinical trial outcomes, but only 4 passed validation schemes that used bootstrapping or modified permutation tests to assess feature robustness and generalizability while accounting for target class selection bias. We also used classifiers to perform multivariate feature selection and found that classifiers with a single feature performed as well in cross-validation as classifiers with more features (AUROC = 0.57 and AUPR = 0.81). The two predominantly selected features were mean mRNA expression across tissues and standard deviation of expression across tissues, where successful targets tended to have lower mean expression and higher expression variance than failed targets. This finding supports the conventional wisdom that it is favorable for a target to be present in the tissue(s) affected by a disease and absent from other tissues. Overall, our results suggest that it is feasible to construct a model integrating interpretable target features to inform target selection. We anticipate deeper insights and better models in the future, as researchers can reuse the data we have provided to improve methods for handling sample biases and learn more informative features. Code, documentation, and data for this study have been deposited on GitHub at https://github.com/arouillard/omic-features-successful-targets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vNbdSy5pqZY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Action and perception are tightly coupled systems requiring coordination and synchronization over time. How the brain achieves synchronization is still a matter of debate, but recent experiments suggest that brain oscillations may play an important role in this process. Brain oscillations have been also proposed to be fundamental in determining time perception. Here, we had subjects perform an audio-visual temporal order judgment task to investigate the fine dynamics of temporal bias and sensitivity before and after the execution of voluntary hand movement (button-press). The reported order of the audio-visual sequence was rhythmically biased as a function of delay from hand action execution. Importantly, we found that it oscillated at a theta range frequency, starting about 500 ms before and persisting about 250 ms after the button-press, with consistent phase-locking across participants. Our results show that the perception of cross-sensory simultaneity oscillates rhythmically in synchrony with the programming phase of a voluntary action, demonstrating a link between action preparation and bias in temporal perceptual judgments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Judgments of the temporal order of a visual and auditory stimulus are not constant over time but fluctuate rhythmically in the theta range (around 7 Hz) in synchrony with the execution of a voluntary movement. Interestingly, these oscillations precede the action execution by about half a second, indicating active synchronization between temporal criterion and the intention to move. Overall, the results point to the presence of a single shared clock for perception and action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Moment-to-Moment Fluctuations in Neuronal Excitability Bias Subjective Perception Rather than Strategic Decision-Making</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Perceiving an external stimulus not only depends on the physical features of the stimulus, but also fundamentally on the current state of neuronal excitability, indexed by the power of ongoing alpha-band and beta-band oscillations (8–30 Hz). Recent studies suggest that heightened excitability does not improve perceptual acuity, but biases observers to report the presence of a stimulus regardless of its physical presence. It is unknown whether this bias is due to changes in observers’ subjective perceptual experience (perceptual bias) or their perception-independent decision-making strategy (decision bias). We tested these alternative interpretations in an EEG experiment in which male and female human participants performed two-interval forced choice (2IFC) detection and discrimination. According to signal detection theory, perceptual bias only affects 2IFC detection, but not discrimination, while interval decision bias should be task-independent. We found that correct detection was more likely when excitability before the stimulus-present interval exceeded that before the stimulus-absent interval (i.e. 8–17 Hz power was weaker before the stimulus-present interval), consistent with an effect of excitability on perceptual bias. By contrast, discrimination accuracy was unaffected by excitability fluctuations between intervals, ruling out an effect on interval decision bias. We conclude that the current state of neuronal excitability biases the perceptual experience itself, rather than the decision process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The current state of neuronal excitability, indexed by the power of ongoing low-frequency oscillations (8–30 Hz), has a strong influence on perception. However, the specific mechanism underlying this influence is a continuing subject of debate in neuroscience. Previous research showed that states of heightened excitability make observers report the presence of a sensory stimulus even when none is present. Heightened excitability may therefore indicate a state of strategic decision-making (i.e. observers prefer to report &quot;Yes, I saw the stimulus&quot;) or a state of amplified subjective perception (i.e. observers experience a stimulus even when none is present). Here, we tested these alternative interpretations and found evidence that fluctuations in neuronal excitability bias the perceptual experience itself, rather than the decision strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: RGS14 Restricts Plasticity in Hippocampal CA2 by Limiting Postsynaptic Calcium Signaling</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Pyramidal neurons in hippocampal area CA2 are distinct from neighboring CA1 in that they resist synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA3 Schaffer Collateral synapses. Regulator of G Protein Signaling 14 (RGS14) is a complex scaffolding protein enriched in CA2 dendritic spines that naturally blocks CA2 synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent learning, but the cellular mechanisms by which RGS14 gates LTP are largely unexplored. A previous study has attributed the lack of plasticity to higher rates of calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) buffering and extrusion in CA2 spines. Additionally, a recent proteomics study revealed that RGS14 interacts with two key Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated proteins in CA2 neurons: calcium/calmodulin, and CaMKII. Here, we investigate whether RGS14 regulates Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in its host CA2 neurons. We find the nascent LTP of CA2 synapses due to genetic knockout (KO) of RGS14 in mice requires Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent postsynaptic signaling through NMDA receptors, CaMK, and PKA, revealing similar mechanisms to those in CA1. We report RGS14 negatively regulates the long-term structural plasticity of dendritic spines of CA2 neurons. We further show that wild-type (WT) CA2 neurons display significantly attenuated spine Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients during structural plasticity induction compared with the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients from CA2 spines of RGS14 KO mice and CA1 controls. Finally, we demonstrate that acute overexpression of RGS14 is sufficient to block spine plasticity, and elevating extracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels restores plasticity to RGS14-expressing neurons. Together, these results demonstrate for the first time that RGS14 regulates plasticity in hippocampal area CA2 by restricting Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations in CA2 spines and downstream signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Recent studies of hippocampal area CA2 have provided strong evidence in support of a clear role for this apparently plasticity-resistant subregion of the hippocampus in social, spatial, and temporal aspects of memory. Regulator of G Protein Signaling 14 (RGS14) is a critical factor that inhibits synaptic plasticity in CA2, but the molecular mechanisms by which RGS14 limits LTP remained unknown. Here we provide new evidence that RGS14 restricts spine calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) in CA2 neurons and that key downstream Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated signaling pathways are required for CA2 plasticity in mice lacking RGS14. These results define a previously unrecognized role for RGS14 as a natural inhibitor of postsynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in hippocampal area CA2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Differences in Hearing Acuity among &quot;Normal-Hearing&quot; Young Adults Modulate the Neural Basis for Speech Comprehension</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0263-17.2018v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0263-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we investigate how subtle differences in hearing acuity affect the neural systems supporting speech processing in young adults. Auditory sentence comprehension requires perceiving a complex acoustic signal and performing linguistic operations to extract the correct meaning. We used fMRI to monitor human brain activity while adults aged 18–41 listened to spoken sentences. The sentences varied in their level of syntactic processing demands, containing either a subject-relative or object-relative center-embedded clause. All participants self-reported normal hearing, confirmed by audiometric testing, with some variation within a clinically normal range. We found that participants showed activity related to sentence processing in a left-lateralized frontotemporal network. Although accuracy was generally high, participants still made some errors, which were associated with increased activity in bilateral cingulo-opercular and frontoparietal attention networks. A whole-brain regression analysis revealed that activity in a right anterior middle frontal gyrus (aMFG) component of the frontoparietal attention network was related to individual differences in hearing acuity, such that listeners with poorer hearing showed greater recruitment of this region when successfully understanding a sentence. The activity in right aMFG’s for listeners with poor hearing did not differ as a function of sentence type, suggesting a general mechanism that is independent of linguistic processing demands. Our results suggest that even modest variations in hearing ability impact the systems supporting auditory speech comprehension, and that auditory sentence comprehension entails the coordination of a left perisylvian network that is sensitive to linguistic variation with an executive attention network that responds to acoustic challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Hearing loss is associated with increased cognitive demand during speech comprehension. Here we used fMRI to measure brain activity while healthy adults with self-reported normal hearing listened to spoken sentences. We found that regions of right frontal cortex, outside of the traditional perisylvian language network, are more active for listeners with poorer hearing as measured with pure-tone audiometry. These findings suggest executive attention varies with hearing ability, even in the absence of clinical hearing loss, during successful auditory sentence comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Midbrain dopamine neurons project to numerous targets throughout the brain to modulate various behaviors and brain states. Within this small population of neurons exists significant heterogeneity based on physiology, circuitry, and disease susceptibility. Recent studies have shown that dopamine neurons can be subdivided based on gene expression; however, the extent to which genetic markers represent functionally relevant dopaminergic subpopulations has not been fully explored. Here we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of mouse dopamine neurons and validated studies showing that &lt;i&gt;Neurod6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;/i&gt; are selective markers for dopaminergic subpopulations. Using a combination of multiplex fluorescent &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization, retrograde labeling, and electrophysiology in mice of both sexes, we defined the anatomy, projection targets, physiological properties, and disease vulnerability of dopamine neurons based on &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;/i&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;Neurod6&lt;/i&gt; expression. We find that the combinatorial expression of &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neurod6&lt;/i&gt; defines dopaminergic subpopulations with unique features. &lt;i&gt;Grp+/Neurod6&lt;/i&gt;+ dopamine neurons reside in the ventromedial VTA, send projections to the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens, and have non-canonical physiological properties. &lt;i&gt;Grp+/Neurod6-&lt;/i&gt; DA neurons are found in the VTA as well as in the ventromedial portion of the SNc where they project selectively to the dorsomedial striatum. &lt;i&gt;Grp-/Neurod6&lt;/i&gt;+ DA neurons represent a smaller VTA subpopulation, which is preferentially spared in a 6-OHDA model of Parkinson’s disease. Together our work provides detailed characterization of &lt;i&gt;Neurod6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;/i&gt; expression in the midbrain and generates new insights into how these markers define functionally relevant dopaminergic subpopulations with distinct projection patterns, physiology, and disease vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Recent single cell gene profiling studies have uncovered new subpopulations of midbrain dopamine neurons defined by their specific genetic signature. How these genetically-defined cell types map onto known dopaminergic circuits and functionally-defined cell types is unknown. This study elucidates the anatomy, circuitry, physiologic properties, and disease susceptibility of subpopulations of midbrain DA neurons defined by their expression of two genetic markers. This work not only advances our understanding of the dopaminergic system by providing new information about the properties of specific dopamine neuron subpopulations, it also demonstrates that unbiased genetic classification of neurons can reveal functionally relevant cell types.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Pre-conditioning nerve injuries activate a pro-regenerative program that enhances axon regeneration for most classes of sensory neurons. However, nociceptive sensory neurons and central nervous system neurons regenerate poorly. In hopes of identifying novel mechanisms that promote regeneration, we screened for drugs that mimicked the pre-conditioning response, and identified a nociceptive ligand that activates a pre-conditioning-like response to promote axon outgrowth. We show that activating the ion channel TRPV1 with capsaicin induces axon outgrowth of cultured DRG sensory neurons, and that this effect is blocked in TRPV1 knockout neurons. Regeneration only occurs in NF200-negative nociceptive neurons, consistent with a cell autonomous mechanism. Moreover, we identify a signaling pathway in which TRPV1 activation leads to calcium influx and PKA activation to induce a pre-conditioning-like response. Finally, capsaicin administration to the mouse sciatic nerve activates a similar pre-conditioning-like response and induces enhanced axonal outgrowth, indicating that this pathway can be induced &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These findings highlight the use of local ligands to induce regeneration, and suggest that it may be possible to target selective neuronal populations for repair, including cell types that often fail to regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; After injury or neurodegenerative disease, axons need to regenerate to restore function. Unfortunately, no current therapies achieve this goal. We performed a drug screen in adult sensory neurons to identify agents that effectively re-program neurons into a pro-growth state. We demonstrate that capsaicin, a TRPV1 agonist, activates a pro-axon growth program. This mechanism requires calcium influx and PKA activity, and leads to the activation of the pro-regenerative transcription factor CREB. Hence, activation of ion channels can promote axon regeneration, an exciting finding since many ion channels are druggable targets. Moreover, these findings suggest an approach for enhancing axon regeneration in selective populations of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Contribution of the Axon Initial Segment to Action Potentials Recorded Extracellularly</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Action potentials (APs) are electric phenomena that are recorded both intracellularly and extracellularly. APs are usually initiated in the short segment of the axon called the axon initial segment (AIS). It was recently proposed that at onset of an AP the soma and the AIS form a dipole. We study the extracellular signature (the extracellular action potential, EAP) generated by such a dipole. First, we demonstrate the formation of the dipole and its extracellular signature in detailed morphological models of a reconstructed pyramidal neuron. Then, we study the EAP waveform and its spatial dependence in models with axonal AP initiation and contrast it with the EAP obtained in models with somatic AP initiation. We show that in the models with axonal AP initiation the dipole forms between somatodendritic compartments and the AIS, and not between soma and dendrites as in the classical models. Soma-dendrites dipole is present only in models with somatic AP initiation. Our study has consequences for interpreting extracellular recordings of single-neuron activity and determining electrophysiological neuron types, but also for better understanding the origins of the high-frequency macroscopic extracellular potential recorded in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Signficance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Action potentials in most neurons initiate in the axon initial segment (AIS). However, the AIS is often neglected in computational studies. We studied the consequences of this initiation mechanism on the extracellular signatures of action potentials. We show that at the time of AP initiation AIS forms a dipole with the soma. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the extracellular action potential (EAP) generated by this dipole changes little with changing soma–AIS distance while the width of the EAP increases with the soma–AIS distance. This may help to monitor dynamic changes in the soma–AIS distance in experimental &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; recordings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

impact of binaural white noise on the performance of short-term visual and
working memory, the alpha - beta brain activity, attention - meditation,
through the use of two auditory stimuli with frequency ranges of (100 to 450hz)
and (100 to 750hz). This study was conducted in the city of Montes Claros, the
Republic of Brazil, where seven participants were evaluated (n = 7) with an
average age of 36.71, and two age groups (GP1) 21 to 30 and (GP2) 41 50, with
university studies. Within the experimental process, the short-term visual
memory tests were performed using the cognitive assessment battery CAB of
CogniFit, and the recording of brain activities through the use of monopolar
electroencephalogram and the eSense algorithms. With the results obtained and
through the use of statistical tests, we can infer that the binaural white
noise with oscillations of 100 to 750 Hz contributed to the performance of
visual work memory in the short term

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider the maximum entropy Markov chain inference approach to
characterize the collective statistics of neuronal spike trains, focusing on
the statistical properties of the inferred model. We review large deviations
techniques useful in this context to describe properties of accuracy and
convergence in terms of sampling size. We use these results to study the
statistical fluctuation of correlations, distinguishability and irreversibility
of maximum entropy Markov chains. We illustrate these applications using simple
examples where the large deviation rate function is explicitly obtained for
maximum entropy models of relevance in this field.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07061</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inferring directional couplings from the spike data of networks is desired in
various scientific fields such as neuroscience. Here, we apply a recently
proposed objective procedure to the spike data obtained from the
Hodgkin--Huxley type models and in vitro neuronal networks cultured in a
circular structure. As a result, we succeed in reconstructing synaptic
connections accurately from the evoked activity as well as the spontaneous one.
To obtain the results, we invent an analytic formula approximately implementing
a method of screening relevant couplings. This significantly reduces the
computational cost of the screening method employed in the proposed objective
procedure, making it possible to treat large-size systems as in this study.

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327601v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Language encoding models help explain language processing in the human brain by learning functions that predict brain responses from the language stimuli that elicited them. Current word embedding-based approaches treat each stimulus word independently and thus ignore the influence of context on language understanding. In this work, we instead build encoding models using rich contextual representations derived from an LSTM language model. Our models show a significant improvement in encoding performance relative to state-of-the-art embeddings in nearly every brain area. By varying the amount of context used in the models and providing the models with distorted context, we show that this improvement is due to a combination of better word embeddings learned by the LSTM language model and contextual information. We are also able to use our models to map context sensitivity across the cortex. These results suggest that LSTM language models learn high-level representations that are related to representations in the human brain.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Positive reward prediction errors strengthen incidental memory encoding</title>

	<description>The dopamine system is thought to provide a reward prediction error signal that facilitates reinforcement learning and reward-based choice in corticostriatal circuits. While it is believed that similar prediction error signals are also provided to temporal lobe memory systems, the impact of such signals on episodic memory encoding has not been fully characterized. Here we develop an incidental memory paradigm that allows us to 1) estimate the influence of reward prediction errors on the formation of episodic memories, 2) dissociate this influence from other factors such as surprise and uncertainty, 3) test the degree to which this influence depends on temporal correspondence between prediction error and memoranda presentation, and 4) determine the extent to which this influence is consolidation-dependent. We find that when choosing to gamble for potential rewards during a primary decision making task, people encode incidental memoranda more strongly even though they are not aware that their memory will be subsequently probed. Moreover, this strengthened encoding scales with the reward prediction error, and not overall reward, experienced selectively at the time of memoranda presentation (and not before or after). Finally, this strengthened encoding is identifiable within a few minutes and is not substantially enhanced after twenty-four hours, indicating that it is not consolidation-dependent. These results suggest a computationally and temporally specific role for putative dopaminergic reward prediction error signaling in memory formation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Electric field dependent effects of motor cortical TDCS</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327361v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327361v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) can modulate motor cortical excitability. However, its after-effects are highly variable between individuals. Individual cranial and brain anatomy may contribute to this variability by producing varying electric fields in each subject's brain. Here we show that these fields are related to excitability changes following anodal TDCS of the primary motor cortex (M1). We found in two experiments (N=28 and N=9) that the after-effects of TDCS were proportional to the individual electric field in M1, calculated using MRI-based models. Individuals with the lowest and highest local electric fields in M1 tended to produce opposite changes in excitability. Furthermore, the effect was field-direction dependent and non-linear with stimulation duration or other experimental parameters. The electric field component pointing into the brain was negatively proportional to the excitability changes following 1 mA 20 min TDCS of right M1 (N=28); the effect was opposite after 1 mA 10 min TDCS of left M1 (N=9). Our results demonstrate that a large part of variability in the after-effects of motor cortical TDCS is due to inter-individual differences in the electric fields. We anticipate that individualized electric field dosimetry could be used to control the neuroplastic effects of TDCS, which is increasingly being explored as a treatment for various neuropsychiatric diseases.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327304v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Sentence production requires rapid syntax generation and word retrieval. We investigated how healthy ageing affects these processes. In Experiment 1, syntactic priming significantly facilitated sentence production speed for both young and older adults. In Experiment 2, participants produced sentences with initial coordinate or simple phrases (e.g., the owl and the car move above the harp/the owl moves above the car and the harp); on half the trials, the second picture (car) was previewed. Without preview, both age groups were slower to initiate sentences with larger coordinate phrases, suggesting a similar planning scope. Young adults displayed speed benefits of preview both within and outside the initial phrase; however, older adults only displayed speed preview benefits within the initial phrase, and preview outside the initial phrase significantly increased error rates. Thus, syntactic planning scope appears unaffected by age, but there is age-related decline in the integration of lexical items into syntactic structures.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327288v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We study a self-organising neural network model of how visual representations in the primate dorsal visual pathway are transformed from an eye-centred to head-centred frame of reference. The model has previously been shown to robustly develop head-centred output neurons with a standard trace learning rule [1], but only under limited conditions. Specifically it fails when incorporating visual input neurons with monotonic gain modulation by eye-position. Since eye-centred neurons with monotonic gain modulation are so common in the dorsal visual pathway, it is an important challenge to show how efferent synaptic connections from these neurons may self-organise to produce head-centred responses in a subpopulation of postsynaptic neurons. We show for the first time how a variety of modified, yet still biologically plausible, versions of the standard trace learning rule enable the model to perform a coordinate transformation from eye-centred to head-centred reference frames when the visual input neurons have monotonic gain modulation by eye-position.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Assessing 42 inflammatory markers in 321 control subjects and 887 major depressive disorder cases: BMI and other confounders and overall predictive ability for current depression</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327239v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327239v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Inflammatory markers such as cytokines represent potential biomarkers for major depressive disorder (MDD). Many, generally small studies have examined the role of single markers and found significant associations. We assessed 42 inflammatory markers, namely cytokines, in the blood of 321 control subjects and 887 MDD cases. We tested whether individual inflammatory marker levels were significantly affected by MDD case/control status, current episode, or current depression severity, co-varying for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking, current antidepressant use, ethnicity, assay batch and study effects. We further used machine learning algorithms to investigate if we could use our data to blindly discriminate MDD patients, or those in a current episode. We found broad and powerful influences of confounding factors on log-protein levels. Notably, IL-6 levels were very strongly influenced by BMI (p = 1.37 x 10-43, variance explained = 18%), while Interleukin-16 was the most significant predictor of current depressive episode (p = 0.003, variance explained = 0.9%, q &amp;lt; 0.1). No single inflammatory marker predicted MDD case/control status when a subject was not in a depressed episode, nor did any predict depression severity. Machine learning results revealed that using inflammatory marker data with clinical confounder information significantly increased precision for differentiating MDD patients who were in an episode. To conclude, a wide panel of inflammatory markers alongside clinical information may aid in predicting the onset of symptoms, but no single inflammatory protein is likely to represent a clinically useful biomarker for MDD diagnosis or prognosis. We note that the potential influence of physical health related and population stratification related confounders on inflammatory biomarker studies in psychiatry is considerable.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Modelling the distribution of white matter hyperintensities due to ageing on MRI images using Bayesian inference</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327205v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327205v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>White matter hyperintensities (WMH), also known as white matter lesions, are localised white matter areas that appear hyperintense on MRI scans. WMH commonly occur in the ageing population, and are often associated with several factors such as cognitive disorders, cardiovascular risk factors, cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the fact that some links between lesion location and parametric factors such as age have already been established, the relationship between voxel-wise spatial distribution of lesions and these factors is not yet well understood. Hence, it would be of clinical importance to model the distribution of lesions at the population-level and quantitatively analyse the effect of various factors on the lesion distribution model. In this work we compare various methods, including our proposed method, to generate voxel-wise distributions of WMH within a population with respect to various factors. Our proposed Bayesian spline method models the spatio-temporal distribution of WMH with respect to a parametric factor of interest, in this case age, within a population. Our probabilistic model takes as input the lesion segmentation binary maps of subjects belonging to various age groups and provides a population-level parametric lesion probability map as output. We used a spline representation to ensure a degree of smoothness in space and the dimension associated with the parameter, and formulated our model using a Bayesian framework. We tested our algorithm output on simulated data and compared our results with those obtained using various existing methods with different levels of algorithmic and computational complexity. We then compared the better performing methods on a real dataset, consisting of 1000 subjects of the UK Biobank, divided in two groups based on hypertension diagnosis. Finally, we applied our method on a clinical dataset of patients with vascular disease. On simulated dataset, the results from our algorithm showed a mean square error (MSE) value of 7.27x10-5, which was lower than the MSE value reported in the literature, with the advantage of being robust and computationally efficient. In the UK Biobank data, we found that the lesion probabilities are higher for the hypertension group compared to the non-hypertension group and further verified this finding using a statistical t-test. Finally, when applying our method on patients with vascular disease, we observed that the overall probability of lesions is significantly higher in later age groups, which is in line with the current literature.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The fate of hippocampal synapses depends on the sequence of plasticity-inducing events</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/326942v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/326942v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The hippocampus is able to store information about salient external events for several weeks. Synaptic weight adjustments, expressed as long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission, are thought to be essential for the formation of episodic memories. Previous studies have shown that LTP and LTD respectively increase and decrease the lifetime of individual hippocampal synapses, suggesting that initially graded weight adjustments may be consolidated in the form of an altered connectivity matrix. However, during their lifetime, synapses may undergo multiple weight adjustments, and it is not known how sequential potentiation and depression events are integrated at individual synapses. Here we use optogenetic 5 Hz stimulation to induce LTP and 1 Hz stimulation to induce LTD at identified synapses. Synaptic potentiation was NMDA receptor-dependent and contingent on complex spike bursts in the postsynaptic neurons. Potentiated synapses typically persisted for the next 7 days whereas spines in their vicinity were destabilized, suggesting highly specific regulation of synaptic lifetime by a center-surround contrast mechanism. When successful, induction of LTD the day after LTP reversed the stabilizing effect of LTP. Vice versa, LTP induction overwrote the destabilizing effect of LTD. We conclude that multiple weight adjustments are not summed in a linear fashion, but the most recent plasticity event determines the lifetime of a Schaffer collateral synapse.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Atomic resolution mechanism of ligand binding to a solvent inaccessible cavity in T4 lysozyme</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jagannath Mondal, Navjeet Ahalawat, Subhendu Pandit, Lewis E. Kay, Pramodh Vallurupalli&lt;/p&gt;

Ligand binding sites in proteins are often localized to deeply buried cavities, inaccessible to bulk solvent. Yet, in many cases binding of cognate ligands occurs rapidly. An intriguing system is presented by the L99A cavity mutant of T4 Lysozyme (T4L L99A) that rapidly binds benzene (~10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). Although the protein has long served as a model system for protein thermodynamics and crystal structures of both free and benzene-bound T4L L99A are available, the kinetic pathways by which benzene reaches its solvent-inaccessible binding cavity remain elusive. The current work, using extensive molecular dynamics simulation, achieves this by capturing the complete process of spontaneous recognition of benzene by T4L L99A at atomistic resolution. A series of multi-microsecond unbiased molecular dynamics simulation trajectories unequivocally reveal how benzene, starting in bulk solvent, diffuses to the protein and spontaneously reaches the solvent inaccessible cavity of T4L L99A. The simulated and high-resolution X-ray derived bound structures are in excellent agreement. A robust four-state Markov model, developed using cumulative 60 μs trajectories, identifies and quantifies &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; ligand binding pathways with low activation barriers. Interestingly, none of these identified binding pathways required large conformational changes for ligand access to the buried cavity. Rather, these involve transient but crucial opening of a channel to the cavity via subtle displacements in the positions of key helices (helix4/helix6, helix7/helix9) leading to rapid binding. Free energy simulations further elucidate that these channel-opening events would have been unfavorable in wild type T4L. Taken together and via integrating with results from experiments, these simulations provide unprecedented mechanistic insights into the complete ligand recognition process in a buried cavity. By illustrating the power of subtle helix movements in opening up &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; pathways for ligand access, this work offers an alternate view of ligand recognition in a solvent-inaccessible cavity, contrary to the common perception of a &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; dominant pathway for ligand binding.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v22HP1dNVjw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: On the role of sparseness in the evolution of modularity in gene regulatory networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos Espinosa-Soto&lt;/p&gt;

Modularity is a widespread property in biological systems. It implies that interactions occur mainly within groups of system elements. A modular arrangement facilitates adjustment of one module without perturbing the rest of the system. Therefore, modularity of developmental mechanisms is a major factor for evolvability, the potential to produce beneficial variation from random genetic change. Understanding how modularity evolves in gene regulatory networks, that create the distinct gene activity patterns that characterize different parts of an organism, is key to developmental and evolutionary biology. One hypothesis for the evolution of modules suggests that interactions between some sets of genes become maladaptive when selection favours additional gene activity patterns. The removal of such interactions by selection would result in the formation of modules. A second hypothesis suggests that modularity evolves in response to sparseness, the scarcity of interactions within a system. Here I simulate the evolution of gene regulatory networks and analyse diverse experimentally sustained networks to study the relationship between sparseness and modularity. My results suggest that sparseness alone is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain modularity in gene regulatory networks. However, sparseness amplifies the effects of forms of selection that, like selection for additional gene activity patterns, already produce an increase in modularity. That evolution of new gene activity patterns is frequent across evolution also supports that it is a major factor in the evolution of modularity. That sparseness is widespread across gene regulatory networks indicates that it may have facilitated the evolution of modules in a wide variety of cases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Eh0FCzbR2R4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A biophysical model that captures molecular homeostatic control of ions at the perisynaptic cradle (PsC) is of fundamental importance for understanding the interplay between astroglial and neuronal compartments. In this paper, we develop a multi-compartmental mathematical model which proposes a novel mechanism whereby the flow of cations in thin processes is restricted due to negatively charged membrane lipids which result in the formation of deep potential wells near the dipole heads. These wells restrict the flow of cations to “hopping” between adjacent wells as they transverse the process, and this surface retention of cations will be shown to give rise to the formation of potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) microdomains at the PsC. We further propose that a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microdomain formed at the PsC, provides the driving force for the return of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to the extracellular space for uptake by the neurone, thereby preventing K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; undershoot. A slow decay of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was also observed in our simulation after a period of glutamate stimulation which is in strong agreement with experimental observations. The pathological implications of microdomain formation during neuronal excitation are also discussed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2aFUE1uepp4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Serotonin Selectively Increases Detectability of Motion Stimuli in the Electrosensory System</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Serotonergic innervation of sensory areas is found ubiquitously across the central nervous system of vertebrates. Here we used a system’s level approach to investigate the role of serotonin on processing motion stimuli in the electrosensory system of the weakly electric fish &lt;i&gt;Apteronotus albifrons&lt;/i&gt;. We found that exogenous serotonin application increased the firing activity of pyramidal neural responses to both looming and receding motion. Separating spikes belonging to bursts from those that were isolated revealed that this effect was primarily due to increased burst firing. Moreover, when investigating whether firing activity during stimulation could be discriminated from baseline (i.e., in the absence of stimulation), we found that serotonin increased stimulus discriminability only for some stimuli. This is because increased burst firing was most prominent for these. Further, the effects of serotonin were highly heterogeneous, with some neurons displaying large while others instead displaying minimal changes in responsiveness following serotonin application. Further analysis revealed that serotonin application had the greatest effect on neurons with low baseline firing rates and little to no effect on neurons with high baseline firing rates. Finally, the effects of serotonin on sensory neuron responses were largely independent of object velocity. Our results therefore reveal a novel function for the serotonergic system in selectively enhancing discriminability for motion stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Previous studies have suggested that the role of serotonin in the electrosensory system was to enhance perception of and neural responses to stimuli associated with same-sex conspecifics. However, these have focused on stationary stimuli. Here we focused on motion stimuli that are typically associated with a different behavioral context (e.g., prey capture). Although exogenous serotonin application increased burst firing to both looming and receding motion. Detectability was significantly enhanced only for receding motion that gave rise to a large excitatory response. We propose that serotonin selectively enhances neural responses to stimuli that elicit electrosensory feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Intrinsic Functional Connectivity Resembles Cortical Architecture at Various Levels of Isoflurane Anesthesia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy114</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy114/4999310?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical single neuron activity and local field potential patterns change at different depths of general anesthesia. Here, we investigate the associated network level changes of functional connectivity. We recorded ongoing electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity from temporo-parieto-occipital cortex of 6 ferrets at various levels of isoflurane/nitrous oxide anesthesia and determined functional connectivity by computing amplitude envelope correlations. Through hierarchical clustering, we derived typical connectivity patterns corresponding to light, intermediate and deep anesthesia. Generally, amplitude correlation strength increased strongly with depth of anesthesia across all cortical areas and frequency bands. This was accompanied, at the deepest level, by the emergence of burst-suppression activity in the ECoG signal and a change of the spectrum of the amplitude envelope. Normalization of functional connectivity to the distribution of correlation coefficients showed that the topographical patterns remained similar across depths of anesthesia, reflecting the functional association of the underlying cortical areas. Thus, while strength and temporal properties of amplitude co-modulation vary depending on the activity of local neural circuits, their network-level interaction pattern is presumably most strongly determined by the underlying structural connectivity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Correct Laminar Positioning in the Neocortex Influences Proper Dendritic and Synaptic Development</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The neocortex is a 6-layered laminated structure with a precise anatomical and functional organization ensuring proper function. Laminar positioning of cortical neurons, as determined by termination of neuronal migration, is a key determinant of their ability to assemble into functional circuits. However, the exact contribution of laminar placement to dendrite morphogenesis and synapse formation remains unclear. Here we manipulated the laminar position of cortical neurons by knocking down doublecortin (Dcx), a crucial effector of migration, and show that misplaced neurons fail to properly form dendrites, spines, and functional glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. We further show that knocking down Dcx in properly positioned neurons induces similar but milder defects, suggesting that the laminar misplacement is the primary cause of altered neuronal development. Thus, the specific laminar environment of their fated layers is crucial for the maturation of cortical neurons, and influences their functional integration into developing cortical circuits.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Prior Knowledge Guides Speech Segregation in Human Auditory Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Segregating concurrent sound streams is a computationally challenging task that requires integrating bottom-up acoustic cues (e.g. pitch) and top-down prior knowledge about sound streams. In a multi-talker environment, the brain can segregate different speakers in about 100 ms in auditory cortex. Here, we used magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings to investigate the temporal and spatial signature of how the brain utilizes prior knowledge to segregate 2 speech streams from the same speaker, which can hardly be separated based on bottom-up acoustic cues. In a primed condition, the participants know the target speech stream in advance while in an unprimed condition no such prior knowledge is available. Neural encoding of each speech stream is characterized by the MEG responses tracking the speech envelope. We demonstrate that an effect in bilateral superior temporal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus is much stronger in the primed condition than in the unprimed condition. Priming effects are observed at about 100 ms latency and last more than 600 ms. Interestingly, prior knowledge about the target stream facilitates speech segregation by mainly suppressing the neural tracking of the non-target speech stream. In sum, prior knowledge leads to reliable speech segregation in auditory cortex, even in the absence of reliable bottom-up speech segregation cue.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Firing-rate based network modeling of the dLGN circuit: Effects of cortical feedback on spatiotemporal response properties of relay cells</title>

Visually evoked signals in the retina pass through the dorsal geniculate nucleus (dLGN) on the way to the visual cortex. This is however not a simple feedforward flow of information: there is a significant feedback from cortical cells back to both relay cells and interneurons in the dLGN. Despite four decades of experimental and theoretical studies, the functional role of this feedback is still debated. Here we use a firing-rate model, the extended difference-of-Gaussians (eDOG) model, to explore cortical feedback effects on visual responses of dLGN relay cells. For this model the responses are found by direct evaluation of two- or three-dimensional integrals allowing for fast and comprehensive studies of putative effects of different candidate organizations of the cortical feedback. Our analysis identifies a special mixed configuration of excitatory and inhibitory cortical feedback which seems to best account for available experimental data. This configuration consists of (i) a slow (long-delay) and spatially widespread inhibitory feedback, combined with (ii) a fast (short-delayed) and spatially narrow excitatory feedback, where (iii) the excitatory/inhibitory ON-ON connections are accompanied respectively by inhibitory/excitatory OFF-ON connections, i.e. following a phase-reversed arrangement. The recent development of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic methods has provided new tools for more precise manipulation and investigation of the thalamocortical circuit, in particular for mice. Such data will expectedly allow the eDOG model to be better constrained by data from specific animal model systems than has been possible until now for cat. We have therefore made the Python tool pyLGN which allows for easy adaptation of the eDOG model to new situations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NEnghs1B4I8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Enzyme sequestration by the substrate: An analysis in the deterministic and stochastic domains</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Andreas Petrides, Glenn Vinnicombe&lt;/p&gt;

This paper is concerned with the potential multistability of protein concentrations in the cell. That is, situations where one, or a family of, proteins may sit at one of two or more different steady state concentrations in otherwise identical cells, and in spite of them being in the same environment. For models of multisite protein phosphorylation for example, in the presence of excess substrate, it has been shown that the achievable number of stable steady states can increase linearly with the number of phosphosites available. In this paper, we analyse the consequences of adding enzyme docking to these and similar models, with the resultant sequestration of phosphatase and kinase by the fully unphosphorylated and by the fully phosphorylated substrates respectively. In the large molecule numbers limit, where deterministic analysis is applicable, we prove that there are always values for these rates of sequestration which, when exceeded, limit the extent of multistability. For the models considered here, these numbers are much smaller than the affinity of the enzymes to the substrate when it is in a modifiable state. As substrate enzyme-sequestration is increased, we further prove that the number of steady states will inevitably be reduced to one. For smaller molecule numbers a stochastic analysis is more appropriate, where multistability in the large molecule numbers limit can manifest itself as multimodality of the probability distribution; the system spending periods of time in the vicinity of one mode before jumping to another. Here, we find that substrate enzyme sequestration can induce bimodality even in systems where only a single steady state can exist at large numbers. To facilitate this analysis, we develop a weakly chained diagonally dominant M-matrix formulation of the Chemical Master Equation, allowing greater insights in the way particular mechanisms, like enzyme sequestration, can shape probability distributions and therefore exhibit different behaviour across different regimes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2a3YD9EnPsk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Transducin {beta}-Subunit Can Interact with Multiple G Protein {gamma}-Subunits to Enable Light Detection by Rod Photoreceptors</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The heterotrimeric G protein transducin mediates visual signaling in vertebrate photoreceptor cells. Many aspects of transducin’s function were learned from knockout mice lacking its individual subunits. Of particular interest is the knockout of its rod-specific -subunit (G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). Two studies using independently generated mice documented that this knockout results in a considerable &amp;gt;60-fold reduction in light-sensitivity of affected rods, but provided different interpretations of how the remaining α-subunit (Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) mediates phototransduction without its cognate Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-subunit partner. One study found that the light-sensitivity reduction matched a corresponding reduction in Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; content in the light-sensing rod outer segments and proposed that Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; activation is supported by remaining Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; associating with other G subunit(s) naturally expressed in photoreceptors. In contrast, the second study reported the same light-sensitivity loss but a much lesser, only ~6-fold reduction of Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; and proposed that light responses of these rods do not require Gβ at all. To resolve this controversy and elucidate the mechanism driving visual signaling in G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knockout rods, we analyzed both mouse lines side-by-side. We first determined that outer segments of both mice have identical Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; content, which is reduced ~65-fold from the wild type level. We further demonstrated that the remaining Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is present in a complex with endogenous G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; subunits and that these complexes exist in wild type rods as well. Together, these results argue against the idea that Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; alone supports light responses of G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knockout rods and suggest that Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is not unique in its ability to mediate vertebrate phototransduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Phototransduction has been a valuable system for understanding the basic principles of G protein signaling. One question that has remained unanswered is whether the G protein α-subunit can support signaling without its cognate β partner complex. Previous studies investigating this question in photoreceptors of G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knockout mice came to mutually exclusive conclusions. We now resolve this controversy by showing that phototransduction in this knockout is supported by alternative β complexes rather than α-subunit alone. Most importantly, this study highlights functional interchangeability of different -subunits in the context of an intact &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper considers an electro-chemical based communication model for
intercellular communication in plants. Many plants, such as Mimosa pudica (the
&quot;sensitive plant&quot;), employ electrochemical signals known as action potentials
(APs) for communication purposes. In this paper we present a simple model for
action potential generation. We make use of the concepts from molecular
communication to explain the underlying process of information transfer in a
plant. Using the information-theoretic analysis, we compute the mutual
information between the input and output in this work. The key aim is to study
the variations in the information propagation speed for varying number of plant
cells for one simple case. Furthermore we study the impact of the AP signal on
the mutual information and information propagation speed. We aim to explore
further that how the growth rate in plants can impact the information transfer
rate and vice versa.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Near real-time forecasting for cholera decision making in Haiti after Hurricane Matthew</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Damiano Pasetto, Flavio Finger, Anton Camacho, Francesco Grandesso, Sandra Cohuet, Joseph C. Lemaitre, Andrew S. Azman, Francisco J. Luquero, Enrico Bertuzzo, Andrea Rinaldo&lt;/p&gt;

Computational models of cholera transmission can provide objective insights into the course of an ongoing epidemic and aid decision making on allocation of health care resources. However, models are typically designed, calibrated and interpreted &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we report the efforts of a team from academia, field research and humanitarian organizations to model in near real-time the Haitian cholera outbreak after Hurricane Matthew in October 2016, to assess risk and to quantitatively estimate the efficacy of a then ongoing vaccination campaign. A rainfall-driven, spatially-explicit meta-community model of cholera transmission was coupled to a data assimilation scheme for computing short-term projections of the epidemic in near real-time. The model was used to forecast cholera incidence for the months after the passage of the hurricane (October-December 2016) and to predict the impact of a planned oral cholera vaccination campaign. Our first projection, from October 29 to December 31, predicted the highest incidence in the departments of Grande Anse and Sud, accounting for about 45% of the total cases in Haiti. The projection included a second peak in cholera incidence in early December largely driven by heavy rainfall forecasts, confirming the urgency for rapid intervention. A second projection (from November 12 to December 31) used updated rainfall forecasts to estimate that 835 cases would be averted by vaccinations in Grande Anse (90% Prediction Interval [PI] 476-1284) and 995 in Sud (90% PI 508-2043). The experience gained by this modeling effort shows that state-of-the-art computational modeling and data-assimilation methods can produce informative near real-time projections of cholera incidence. Collaboration among modelers and field epidemiologists is indispensable to gain fast access to field data and to translate model results into operational recommendations for emergency management during an outbreak. Future efforts should thus draw together multi-disciplinary teams to ensure model outputs are appropriately based, interpreted and communicated.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rXysUXWSU_g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Altered Excitability and Local Connectivity of mPFC-PAG Neurons in a Mouse Model of Neuropathic Pain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a major role in both sensory and affective aspects of pain. There is extensive evidence that chronic pain produces functional changes within the mPFC. However, our understanding of local circuit changes to defined subpopulations of mPFC neurons in chronic pain models remains unclear. A major subpopulation of mPFC neurons project to the periaqueductal gray (PAG), which is a key midbrain structure involved in endogenous pain suppression and facilitation. Here, we used laser scanning photostimulation of caged glutamate to map cortical circuits of retrogradely labeled cortico-PAG (CP) neurons in layer 5 (L5) of mPFC in brain slices prepared from male mice having undergone chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. Whole-cell recordings revealed a significant reduction in excitability for L5 CP neurons contralateral to CCI in the prelimbic (PL), but not infralimbic (IL), region of mPFC. Circuit mapping showed that excitatory inputs to L5 CP neurons in both PL and IL arose primarily from layer 2/3 (L2/3) and were significantly reduced in CCI mice. Glutamate stimulation of L2/3 and L5 elicited inhibitory inputs to CP neurons in both PL and IL, but only L2/3 input was significantly reduced in CP neurons of CCI mice. We also observed significant reduction in excitability and L2/3 inhibitory input to CP neurons ipsilateral to CCI. These results demonstrating region and laminar specific changes to mPFC-PAG neurons suggest that a unilateral CCI bilaterally alters cortical circuits upstream of the endogenous analgesic network, which may contribute to persistence of chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Chronic pain is a significant unresolved medical problem that is refractory to traditional analgesics and can negatively affect emotional health. The role of central circuits in mediating the persistent nature of chronic pain remains unclear. Local circuits within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) process ascending pain inputs and can modulate endogenous analgesia via direct projections to the periaqueductal gray (PAG). However, the mechanisms by which chronic pain alters intracortical circuitry of mPFC-PAG neurons are unknown. Here, we report specific changes to local circuits of mPFC-PAG neurons in mice displaying chronic pain behavior after nerve injury. These findings provide evidence for a neural mechanism by which chronic pain disrupts the descending analgesic system via functional changes to cortical circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: mTORC1 Is Transiently Reactivated in Injured Nerves to Promote c-Jun Elevation and Schwann Cell Dedifferentiation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4811?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Schwann cells (SCs) are endowed with a remarkable plasticity. When peripheral nerves are injured, SCs dedifferentiate and acquire new functions to coordinate nerve repair as so-called repair SCs. Subsequently, SCs redifferentiate to remyelinate regenerated axons. Given the similarities between SC dedifferentiation/redifferentiation in injured nerves and in demyelinating neuropathies, elucidating the signals involved in SC plasticity after nerve injury has potentially wider implications. c-Jun has emerged as a key transcription factor regulating SC dedifferentiation and the acquisition of repair SC features. However, the upstream pathways that control c-Jun activity after nerve injury are largely unknown. We report that the mTORC1 pathway is transiently but robustly reactivated in dedifferentiating SCs. By inducible genetic deletion of the functionally crucial mTORC1-subunit Raptor in mouse SCs (including male and female animals), we found that mTORC1 reactivation is necessary for proper myelin clearance, SC dedifferentiation, and consequently remyelination, without major alterations in the inflammatory response. In the absence of mTORC1 signaling, c-Jun failed to be upregulated correctly. Accordingly, a c-Jun binding motif was found to be enriched in promoters of genes with reduced expression in injured mutants. Furthermore, using cultured SCs, we found that mTORC1 is involved in c-Jun regulation by promoting its translation, possibly via the eIF4F-subunit eIF4A. These results provide evidence that proper c-Jun elevation after nerve injury involves also mTORC1-dependent post-transcriptional regulation to ensure timely dedifferentiation of SCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A crucial evolutionary acquisition of vertebrates is the envelopment of axons in myelin sheaths produced by oligodendrocytes in the CNS and Schwann cells (SCs) in the PNS. When myelin is damaged, conduction of action potentials along axons slows down or is blocked, leading to debilitating diseases. Unlike oligodendrocytes, SCs have a high regenerative potential, granted by their remarkable plasticity. Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying SC plasticity may uncover new therapeutic targets in nerve regeneration and demyelinating diseases. Our work reveals that reactivation of the mTORC1 pathway in SCs is essential for efficient SC dedifferentiation after nerve injury. Accordingly, modulating this signaling pathway might be of therapeutic relevance in peripheral nerve injury and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Canonical TGF-{beta} Signaling Negatively Regulates Neuronal Morphogenesis through TGIF/Smad Complex-Mediated CRMP2 Suppression</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional neuronal connectivity requires proper neuronal morphogenesis and its dysregulation causes neurodevelopmental diseases. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family cytokines play pivotal roles in development, but little is known about their contribution to morphological development of neurons. Here we show that the Smad-dependent canonical signaling of TGF-β family cytokines negatively regulates neuronal morphogenesis during brain development. Mechanistically, activated Smads form a complex with transcriptional repressor TG-interacting factor (TGIF), and downregulate the expression of a neuronal polarity regulator, collapsin response mediator protein 2. We also demonstrate that TGF-β family signaling inhibits neurite elongation of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. Furthermore, the expression of TGF-β receptor 1, Smad4, or TGIF, which have mutations found in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, disrupted neuronal morphogenesis in both mouse (male and female) and human (female) neurons. Together, these findings suggest that the regulation of neuronal morphogenesis by an evolutionarily conserved function of TGF-β signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Canonical transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling plays a crucial role in multiple organ development, including brain, and mutations in components of the signaling pathway associated with several human developmental disorders. In this study, we found that Smads/TG-interacting factor-dependent canonical TGF-β signaling regulates neuronal morphogenesis through the suppression of collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2) expression during brain development, and that function of this signaling is evolutionarily conserved in the mammalian brain. Mutations in canonical TGF-β signaling factors identified in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders disrupt the morphological development of neurons. Thus, our results suggest that proper control of TGF-β/Smads/CRMP2 signaling pathways is critical for the precise execution of neuronal morphogenesis, whose impairment eventually results in neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Genetic Ablation of All Cerebellins Reveals Synapse Organizer Functions in Multiple Regions Throughout the Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4774?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4774?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebellins are synaptic organizer molecules that bind to presynaptic neurexins and postsynaptic receptors. They are well studied in the cerebellum, but three of the four cerebellins (Cbln1, Cbln2, and Cbln4) are also broadly expressed outside of the cerebellum, suggesting that they perform general functions throughout the brain. Here, we generated male and female constitutive single (KO), double KO (dKO), and triple KO (tKO) mice of Cbln1, Cbln2, and Cbln4. We found that all constitutive cerebellin-deficient mice were viable and fertile, suggesting that cerebellins are not essential for survival. Cbln1/2 dKO mice exhibited salience-induced seizures that were aggravated in Cbln1/2/4 tKO mice, suggesting that all cerebellins contribute to brain function. As described previously, Cbln1 KO mice displayed major motor impairments that were aggravated by additional KO of Cbln2. Strikingly, the Cbln1/2 dKO did not cause alterations in synapse density in the hippocampus of young adult (1- and 2-month-old) mice, but produced a selective ~50% decrease in hippocampal synapse density in the stratum lacunosum moleculare of the CA1 region and in the dentate gyrus of aging, 6-month-old mice. A similar decrease in excitatory synapse density was observed in the striatum and retrosplenial cortex. Behaviorally, the Cbln1 KO produced dramatic changes in motor behaviors that were partly aggravated by additional deletion of Cbln2 and/or Cbln4. Our results show that cerebellins are not essential for survival and do not contribute to initial synapse formation, but perform multiple functions throughout the brain; as a consequence, their ablation results in a delayed loss of synapses and in behavioral impairments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cerebellins (Cbln1-4) are &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-synaptic cell adhesion molecules. In the cerebellum, Cbln1 functions as a bidirectional organizer of parallel fiber–Purkinje cell synapses by binding to presynaptic neurexins and postsynaptic GluR2. Little is known about the function of cerebellins outside of the cerebellum; therefore, the present study used single, double, and triple constitutive KO mice of Cbln1, Cbln2, and Cbln4 to analyze the overall function of cerebellins. We show that cerebellins act as important synaptic organizers in specific subsets of neurons and likely contribute to many different brain functions. We also show that cerebellins are not initially required for synapse formation, but rather for specification and long-term synapse maintenance and demonstrate that all cerebellins, not just Cbln1, contribute to brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: NMDA Receptor Signaling Is Important for Neural Tube Formation and for Preventing Antiepileptic Drug-Induced Neural Tube Defects</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4762?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Failure of neural tube closure leads to neural tube defects (NTDs), which can have serious neurological consequences or be lethal. Use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during pregnancy increases the incidence of NTDs in offspring by unknown mechanisms. Here we show that during &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; neural tube formation, neural plate cells exhibit spontaneous calcium dynamics that are partially mediated by glutamate signaling. We demonstrate that NMDA receptors are important for the formation of the neural tube and that the loss of their function induces an increase in neural plate cell proliferation and impairs neural cell migration, which result in NTDs. We present evidence that the AED valproic acid perturbs glutamate signaling, leading to NTDs that are rescued with varied efficacy by preventing DNA synthesis, activating NMDA receptors, or recruiting the NMDA receptor target ERK1/2. These findings may prompt mechanistic identification of AEDs that do not interfere with neural tube formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neural tube defects are one of the most common birth defects. Clinical investigations have determined that the use of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy increases the incidence of these defects in the offspring by unknown mechanisms. This study discovers that glutamate signaling regulates neural plate cell proliferation and oriented migration and is necessary for neural tube formation. We demonstrate that the widely used antiepileptic drug valproic acid interferes with glutamate signaling and consequently induces neural tube defects, challenging the current hypotheses arguing that they are side effects of this antiepileptic drug that cause the increased incidence of these defects. Understanding the mechanisms of neurotransmitter signaling during neural tube formation may contribute to the identification and development of antiepileptic drugs that are safer during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Rapid Disinhibition by Adjustment of PV Intrinsic Excitability during Whisker Map Plasticity in Mouse S1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4749?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4749?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rapid plasticity of layer (L) 2/3 inhibitory circuits is an early step in sensory cortical map plasticity, but its cellular basis is unclear. We show that, in mice of either sex, 1 d whisker deprivation drives the rapid loss of L4-evoked feedforward inhibition and more modest loss of feedforward excitation in L2/3 pyramidal (PYR) cells, increasing the excitation-inhibition conductance ratio. Rapid disinhibition was due to reduced L4-evoked spiking by L2/3 parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, caused by reduced PV intrinsic excitability. This included elevated PV spike threshold, which is associated with an increase in low-threshold, voltage-activated delayed rectifier (presumed Kv1) and A-type potassium currents. Excitatory synaptic input and unitary inhibitory output of PV cells were unaffected. Functionally, the loss of feedforward inhibition and excitation was precisely coordinated in L2/3 PYR cells, so that peak feedforward synaptic depolarization remained stable. Thus, the rapid plasticity of PV intrinsic excitability offsets early weakening of excitatory circuits to homeostatically stabilize synaptic potentials in PYR cells of sensory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Inhibitory circuits in cerebral cortex are highly plastic, but the cellular mechanisms and functional importance of this plasticity are incompletely understood. We show that brief (1 d) sensory deprivation rapidly weakens parvalbumin (PV) inhibitory circuits by reducing the intrinsic excitability of PV neurons. This involved a rapid increase in voltage-gated potassium conductances that control near-threshold spiking excitability. Functionally, the loss of PV-mediated feedforward inhibition in L2/3 pyramidal cells was precisely balanced with the separate loss of feedforward excitation, resulting in a net homeostatic stabilization of synaptic potentials. Thus, rapid plasticity of PV intrinsic excitability implements network-level homeostasis to stabilize synaptic potentials in sensory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cortical Mechanisms of Prioritizing Selection for Rejection in Visual Search</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4738?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4738?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In visual search, the more one knows about a target, the faster one can find it. Surprisingly, target identification is also faster with knowledge about distractor-features. The latter is paradoxical, as it implies that to avoid the selection of an item, the item must somehow be selected to some degree. This conundrum has been termed the &quot;ignoring paradox&quot;, and, to date, little is known about how the brain resolves it. Here, in data from four experiments using neuromagnetic brain recordings in male and female humans, we provide evidence that this paradox is resolved by giving distracting information priority in cortical processing. This attentional priority to distractors manifests as an enhanced early neuromagnetic index, which occurs before target-related processing, and regardless of distractor predictability. It is most pronounced on trials for which a response rapidly occurred, and is followed by a suppression of the distracting information. These observations together suggest that in visual search items cannot be ignored without first being selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; How can we ignore distracting stimuli in our environment? To do this successfully, a logical hypothesis is that as few neural resources as possible should be devoted to distractor processing. Yet, to avoid devoting resources to a distractor, the brain must somehow mark what to avoid; this is a philosophical problem, which has been termed the &quot;ignoring paradox&quot; or &quot;white bear phenomenon&quot;. Here, we use MEG recordings to determine how the human brain resolves this paradox. Our data show that distractors are not only processed, they are given temporal priority, with the brain building a robust representation of the to-be-ignored items. Thus, successful suppression of distractors can only be achieved if distractors are first strongly neurally represented.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Representations of Sensorimotor Memory- and Digit Position-Based Load Force Adjustments Before the Onset of Dexterous Object Manipulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4724?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4724?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Anticipatory load forces for dexterous object manipulation in humans are modulated based on visual object property cues, sensorimotor memories of previous experiences with the object, and, when digit positioning varies from trial to trial, the integrating of this sensed variability with force modulation. Studies of the neural representations encoding these anticipatory mechanisms have not considered these mechanisms separately from each other or from feedback mechanisms emerging after lift onset. Here, representational similarity analyses of fMRI data were used to identify neural representations of sensorimotor memories and the sensing and integration of digit position. Cortical activity and movement kinematics were measured as 20 human subjects (11 women) minimized tilt of a symmetrically shaped object with a concealed asymmetric center of mass (CoM, left and right sided). This task required generating compensatory torques in opposite directions, which, without helpful visual CoM cues, relied primarily on sensorimotor memories of the same object and CoM. Digit position was constrained or unconstrained, the latter of which required modulating forces beyond what can be recalled from sensorimotor memories to compensate for digit position variability. Ventral premotor (PMv), somatosensory, and cerebellar lobule regions (CrusII, VIIIa) were sensitive to anticipatory behaviors that reflect sensorimotor memory content, as shown by larger voxel pattern differences for unmatched than matched CoM conditions. Cerebellar lobule I–IV, Broca area 44, and PMv showed greater voxel pattern differences for unconstrained than constrained grasping, which suggests their sensitivity to monitor the online coincidence of planned and actual digit positions and correct for a mismatch by force modulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To pick up a water glass without slipping, tipping, or spilling requires anticipatory planning of fingertip load forces before the lift commences. This anticipation relies on object visual properties (e.g., mass/mass distribution), sensorimotor memories built from previous experiences (especially when object properties cannot be inferred visually), and online sensing of where the digits are positioned. There is limited understanding of how the brain represents each of these anticipatory mechanisms. We used fMRI measures of regional brain patterns and digit position kinematics before lift onset of an object with nonsalient visual cues specifically to isolate sensorimotor memories and integration of sensed digit position with force modulation. In doing so, we localized neural representations encoding these anticipatory mechanisms for dexterous object manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Role of the Microglial Cx3cr1 Pathway in the Postnatal Maturation of Retinal Photoreceptors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4708?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are the resident immune cells of the CNS, and their response to infection, injury and disease is well documented. More recently, microglia have been shown to play a role in normal CNS development, with the fractalkine-Cx3cr1 signaling pathway of particular importance. This work describes the interaction between the light-sensitive photoreceptors and microglia during eye opening, a time of postnatal photoreceptor maturation. Genetic removal of Cx3cr1 (&lt;i&gt;Cx3cr1&lt;sup&gt;GFP/GFP&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) led to an early retinal dysfunction soon after eye opening [postnatal day 17 (P17)] and cone photoreceptor loss (P30 onward) in mice of either sex. This dysfunction occurred at a time when fractalkine expression was predominantly outer retinal, when there was an increased microglial presence near the photoreceptor layer and increased microglial–cone photoreceptor contacts. Photoreceptor maturation and outer segment elongation was coincident with increased opsin photopigment expression in wild-type retina, while this was aberrant in the &lt;i&gt;Cx3cr1&lt;sup&gt;GFP/GFP&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; retina and outer segment length was reduced. A beadchip array highlighted Cx3cr1 regulation of genes involved in the photoreceptor cilium, a key structure that is important for outer segment elongation. This was confirmed with quantitative PCR with specific cilium-related genes, &lt;i&gt;Rpgr&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rpgrip1&lt;/i&gt;, downregulated at eye opening (P14). While the overall cilium structure was unaffected, expression of Rpgr, Rpgrip1, and centrin were restricted to more proximal regions of the transitional zone. This study highlighted a novel role for microglia in postnatal neuronal development within the retina, with loss of fractalkine–Cx3cr1 signaling leading to an altered distribution of cilium proteins, failure of outer segment elongation and ultimately cone photoreceptor loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Microglia are involved in CNS development and disease. This work highlights the role of microglia in postnatal development of the light-detecting photoreceptor neurons within the mouse retina. Loss of the microglial Cx3cr1 signaling pathway resulted in specific alterations in the cilium, a key structure in photoreceptor outer segment elongation. The distribution of key components of the cilium transitional zone, Rpgr, Rpgrip1, and centrin, were altered in retinae lacking Cx3cr1 with reduced outer segment length and cone photoreceptor death observed at later postnatal ages. This work identifies a novel role for microglia in the postnatal maturation of retinal photoreceptors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distribution of Spinal Neuronal Networks Controlling Forward and Backward Locomotion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4695?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4695?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Higher vertebrates, including humans, are capable not only of forward (FW) locomotion but also of walking in other directions relative to the body axis [backward (BW), sideways, etc.]. Although the neural mechanisms responsible for controlling FW locomotion have been studied in considerable detail, the mechanisms controlling steps in other directions are mostly unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the distribution of spinal neuronal networks controlling FW and BW locomotion. First, we applied electrical epidural stimulation (ES) to different segments of the spinal cord from L2 to S2 to reveal zones triggering FW and BW locomotion in decerebrate cats of either sex. Second, to determine the location of spinal neurons activated during FW and BW locomotion, we used c-Fos immunostaining. We found that the neuronal networks responsible for FW locomotion were distributed broadly in the lumbosacral spinal cord and could be activated by ES of any segment from L3 to S2. By contrast, networks generating BW locomotion were activated by ES of a limited zone from the caudal part of L5 to the caudal part of L7. In the intermediate part of the gray matter within this zone, a significantly higher number of c-Fos-positive interneurons was revealed in BW-stepping cats compared with FW-stepping cats. We suggest that this region of the spinal cord contains the network that determines the BW direction of locomotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sequential and single steps in various directions relative to the body axis [forward (FW), backward (BW), sideways, etc.] are used during locomotion and to correct for perturbations, respectively. The mechanisms controlling step direction are unknown. In the present study, for the first time we compared the distributions of spinal neuronal networks controlling FW and BW locomotion. Using a marker to visualize active neurons, we demonstrated that in the intermediate part of the gray matter within L6 and L7 spinal segments, significantly more neurons were activated during BW locomotion than during FW locomotion. We suggest that the network determining the BW direction of stepping is located in this area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Striatal Direct and Indirect Pathway Output Structures Are Differentially Altered in Mouse Models of Huntington's Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The present study examined synaptic communication between direct and indirect output pathway striatal medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) and their target structures, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and the external globus pallidus (GPe) in two mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD). Cre recombination, optogenetics, and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were used to determine alterations in intrinsic and synaptic properties of SNr and GPe neurons from both male and female symptomatic R6/2 (&amp;gt;60 d) and presymptomatic (2 months) or symptomatic (10–12 months) YAC128 mice. Cell membrane capacitance was decreased, whereas input resistance was increased in SNr neurons from R6/2, but not YAC128 mice. The amplitude of GABAergic responses evoked by optogenetic stimulation of direct pathway terminals was reduced in SNr neurons of symptomatic mice of both models. A decrease in spontaneous GABA synaptic activity, in particular large-amplitude events, in SNr neurons also was observed. Passive membrane properties of GPe neurons were not different between R6/2 or YAC128 mice and their control littermates. Similarly, the amplitude of GABA responses evoked by activation of indirect pathway MSN terminals and the frequency of spontaneous GABA synaptic activity were similar in HD and control animals. In contrast, the decay time of the evoked GABA response was significantly longer in cells from HD mice. Interestingly, activation of indirect pathway MSNs within the striatum evoked larger-amplitude responses in direct pathway MSNs. Together, these results demonstrate differential alterations in responses evoked by direct and indirect pathway terminals in SNr and GPe leading to striatal output imbalance and motor dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Previous work on Huntington's disease (HD) focused on striatal medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) almost exclusively. Little is known about the effects that alterations in the striatum have on output structures of the direct and indirect pathways, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe), respectively. We combined electrophysiological and optogenetic methods to examine responses evoked by selective activation of terminals of direct and indirect pathway MSNs in SNr and GPe neurons in two mouse models of HD. We show a differential disruption of synaptic communication between the direct and indirect output pathways of the striatum with their target regions leading to an imbalance of striatal output, which will contribute to motor dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake is gated by the mitochondrial calcium uniplex, which is comprised of mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; pore-forming subunit of the complex, and its regulators. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx through MCU affects both mitochondrial function and movement in neurons, but its direct role in mitochondrial movement has not been explored. In this report, we show a link between MCU and Miro1, a membrane protein known to regulate mitochondrial movement. We find that MCU interacts with Miro1 through MCU's N-terminal domain, previously thought to be the mitochondrial targeting sequence. Our results show that the N-terminus of MCU has a transmembrane domain that traverses the outer mitochondrial membrane, which is dispensable for MCU localization into mitochondria. However, this domain is required for Miro1 interaction and is critical for Miro1 directed movement. Together, our findings reveal Miro1 as a new component of the MCU complex, and that MCU is an important regulator of mitochondrial transport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Mitochondrial calcium level is critical for mitochondrial metabolic activity and mitochondrial transport in neurons. While it has been established that calcium influx into mitochondria is modulated by mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex, how MCU regulates mitochondrial movement still remains unclear. Here, we discover that the N-terminus of MCU plays a different role than previously thought; it is not required for mitochondrial targeting but is essential for interaction with Miro1, an outer mitochondrial membrane protein important for mitochondrial movement. Furthermore, we show that MCU–Miro1 interaction is required to maintain mitochondrial transport. Our data identify that Miro1 is a novel component of the mitochondrial calcium uniplex and demonstrate that coupling between MCU and Miro1 as a novel mechanism modulating both mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake and mitochondrial transport.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The axon guidance cue receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) plays a critical role in the organization of mesocorticolimbic pathways in rodents. To investigate whether this occurs in humans, we measured (1) anatomical connectivity between the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) and forebrain targets, (2) striatal and cortical volumes, and (3) putatively associated traits and behaviors. To assess translatability, morphometric data were also collected in &lt;i&gt;Dcc&lt;/i&gt;-haploinsufficient mice. The human volunteers were 20 &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mutation carriers, 16 &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; relatives, and 20 &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; unrelated healthy volunteers (UHVs; 28 females). The mice were 11 &lt;i&gt;Dcc&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; and 16 wild-type C57BL/6J animals assessed during adolescence and adulthood. Compared with both control groups, the human &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; carriers exhibited the following: (1) reduced anatomical connectivity from the SN/VTA to the ventral striatum [&lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0005, &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;effect size&lt;/i&gt;) = 0.60; UHV: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0029, &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.48] and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (&lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0031, &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.53; UHV: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.034, &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.35); (2) lower novelty-seeking scores (&lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.034, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.82; UHV: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.019, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.84); and (3) reduced striatal volume (&lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0009, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 1.37; UHV: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0054, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.93). Striatal volumetric reductions were also present in &lt;i&gt;Dcc&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, and these were seen during adolescence (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0058, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 1.09) and adulthood (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 1.26). Together these findings provide the first evidence in humans that an axon guidance gene is involved in the formation of mesocorticolimbic circuitry and related behavioral traits, providing mechanisms through which &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt; mutations might affect susceptibility to diverse neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Opportunities to study the effects of axon guidance molecules on human brain development have been rare. Here, the identification of a large four-generational family that carries a mutation to the axon guidance molecule receptor gene, &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;, enabled us to demonstrate effects on mesocorticolimbic anatomical connectivity, striatal volumes, and personality traits. Reductions in striatal volumes were replicated in &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;-haploinsufficient mice. Together, these processes might influence mesocorticolimbic function and susceptibility to diverse neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: FLP-18 Functions through the G-Protein-Coupled Receptors NPR-1 and NPR-4 to Modulate Reversal Length in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4641?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Animal behavior is critically dependent on the activity of neuropeptides. Reversals, one of the most conspicuous behaviors in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, plays an important role in determining the navigation strategy of the animal. Our experiments on hermaphrodite &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; show the involvement of a neuropeptide FLP-18 in modulating reversal length in these hermaphrodites. We show that FLP-18 controls the reversal length by regulating the activity of AVA interneurons through the G-protein-coupled neuropeptide receptors, NPR-4 and NPR-1. We go on to show that the site of action of these receptors is the AVA interneuron for NPR-4 and the ASE sensory neurons for NPR-1. We further show that mutants in the neuropeptide, &lt;i&gt;flp-18&lt;/i&gt;, and its receptors show increased reversal lengths. Consistent with the behavioral data, calcium levels in the AVA neuron of freely reversing &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; were significantly higher and persisted for longer durations in &lt;i&gt;flp-18&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;npr-1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;npr-4&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;npr-1 npr-4&lt;/i&gt; genetic backgrounds compared with wild-type control animals. Finally, we show that increasing FLP-18 levels through genetic and physiological manipulations causes shorter reversal lengths. Together, our analysis suggests that the FLP-18/NPR-1/NPR-4 signaling is a pivotal point in the regulation of reversal length under varied genetic and environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we elucidate the circuit and molecular machinery required for normal reversal behavior in hermaphrodite &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. We delineate the circuit and the neuropeptide receptors required for maintaining reversal length in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Our work sheds light on the importance of a single neuropeptide, FLP-18, and how change in levels in this one peptide could allow the animal to change the length of its reversal, thereby modulating how the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; explores its environment. We also go on to show that FLP-18 functions to maintain reversal length through the neuropeptide receptors NPR-4 and NPR-1. Our study will allow for a better understanding of the complete repertoire of behaviors shown by freely moving animals as they explore their environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Learning-Dependent and -Independent Enhancement of Mitral/Tufted Cell Glomerular Odor Responses Following Olfactory Fear Conditioning in Awake Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4623?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/20/4623?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Associative fear learning produces fear toward the conditioned stimulus (CS) and often generalization, the expansion of fear from the CS to similar, unlearned stimuli. However, how fear learning affects early sensory processing of learned and unlearned stimuli in relation to behavioral fear responses to these stimuli remains unclear. We subjected male and female mice expressing the fluorescent calcium indicator GCaMP3 in olfactory bulb mitral and tufted cells to a classical olfactory fear conditioning paradigm. We then used awake, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; calcium imaging to quantify learning-induced changes in glomerular odor responses, which constitute the first site of olfactory processing in the brain. The results demonstrate that odor-shock pairing nonspecifically enhances glomerular odor representations in a learning-dependent manner and increases representational similarity between the CS and nonconditioned odors, potentially priming the system toward generalization of learned fear. Additionally, CS-specific glomerular enhancements remain even when associative learning is blocked, suggesting two separate mechanisms lead to enhanced glomerular responses following odor-shock pairings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In the olfactory bulb (OB), odors are uniquely coded in a spatial map that represents odor identity, making the OB a unique model system for investigating how learned fear alters sensory processing. Classical fear conditioning causes fear of the conditioned stimulus (CS) and of neutral stimuli, known as generalization. Combining fear conditioning with fluorescent calcium imaging of OB glomeruli, we found enhanced glomerular responses of the CS as well as neutral stimuli in awake mice, which mirrors fear generalization. We report that CS and neutral stimuli enhancements are, respectively, learning-independent and learning-dependent. Together, these results reveal distinct mechanisms leading to enhanced OB processing of fear-inducing stimuli and provide important implications for altered sensory processing in fear generalization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Semaphorin3A Signaling Is Dispensable for Motor Axon Reinnervation of the Adult Neuromuscular Junction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0155-17.2018?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a specialized synapse that is formed by motor axon innervation of skeletal muscle fibers. The maintenance of motor-muscle connectivity is critical for the preservation of muscle tone and generation of movement. Injury can induce a robust regenerative response in motor axons, but severe trauma or chronic denervation resulting from neurodegenerative disease typically leads to inefficient repair and poor functional recovery. The axon guidance molecule Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) has been implicated as a negative regulator of motor innervation. Upon binding to a plexinA-neuropilin1 (Npn1) receptor complex, Sema3A initiates a downstream signaling cascade that results in axonal repulsion. Here, we established a reproducible nerve crush model to quantify motor nerve regeneration. We then used that model to investigate the role of Sema3A signaling at the adult NMJ. In contrast to previous findings, we found that &lt;i&gt;Sema3A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Npn1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA decrease in response to denervation, suggesting that Sema3A-Npn1 signaling may regulate NMJ reinnervation. To directly test that hypothesis, we used inducible knockout models to ubiquitously delete Sema3A or Npn1 from adult mice. Despite demonstrating that we could achieve highly efficient gene deletion, disruption of Sema3A-Npn1 signaling did not affect the normal maintenance of the NMJ or disrupt motor axon reinnervation after a denervating injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a circuit synthesis methodology to emulate in hardware the
electrical behavior of a single bursting neuron. The method is neuromorphic in
that the basic circuit elements mimic how ion channels shape the circuit
conductance in specific voltage and temporal windows. As an input-output
approach, I-V curve shaping proves effective in enabling robust and accurate
control of the circuit behavior, suggesting a close analogy to the biophysical
mechanisms of neuromodulation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Task-dependent modulation of the visual sensory thalamus assists visual-speech recognition. (arXiv:1805.05682v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05682</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cerebral cortex modulates early sensory processing via feed-back
connections to sensory pathway nuclei. The functions of this top-down
modulation for human behavior are poorly understood. Here, we show that
top-down modulation of the visual sensory thalamus (the lateral geniculate
body, LGN) is involved in visual-speech recognition. In two independent
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, LGN response increased
when participants processed fast-varying features of articulatory movements
required for visual-speech recognition, as compared to temporally more stable
features required for face identification with the same stimulus material. The
LGN response during the visual-speech task correlated positively with the
visual-speech recognition scores across participants. In addition, the
task-dependent modulation was present for speech movements and did not occur
for control conditions involving non-speech biological movements. In
face-to-face communication, visual speech recognition is used to enhance or
even enable understanding what is said. Speech recognition is commonly
explained in frameworks focusing on cerebral cortex areas. Our findings suggest
that task-dependent modulation at subcortical sensory stages has an important
role for communication: Together with similar findings in the auditory modality
the findings imply that task-dependent modulation of the sensory thalami is a
general mechanism to optimize speech recognition.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to effectively control brain dynamics holds great promise for the
enhancement of cognitive function in humans, and the betterment of their
quality of life. Yet, successfully controlling dynamics in neural systems is
challenging, in part due to the immense complexity of the brain and the large
set of interactions that can drive any single change. While we have gained some
understanding of the control of single neurons, the control of large-scale
neural systems -- networks of multiply interacting components -- remains poorly
understood. Efforts to address this gap include the construction of tools for
the control of brain networks, mostly adapted from control and dynamical
systems theory. Informed by current opportunities for practical intervention,
these theoretical contributions provide models that draw from a wide array of
mathematical approaches. We present intriguing recent developments for
effective strategies of control in dynamic brain networks, and we also describe
potential mechanisms that underlie such processes. We review efforts in the
control of general neurophysiological processes with implications for brain
development and cognitive function, as well as the control of altered
neurophysiological processes in medical contexts such as anesthesia
administration, seizure suppression, and deep-brain stimulation for Parkinson's
disease. We conclude with a forward-looking discussion regarding how emerging
results from network control -- especially approaches that deal with nonlinear
dynamics or more realistic trajectories for control transitions -- could be
used to directly address pressing questions in neuroscience.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: CaMKII activation supports reward-based neural network optimization through Hamiltonian sampling. (arXiv:1606.00157v3 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00157</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00157</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic plasticity is implemented and controlled through over thousand
different types of molecules in the postsynaptic density and presynaptic
boutons that assume a staggering array of different states through
phosporylation and other mechanisms. One of the most prominent molecule in the
postsynaptic density is CaMKII, that is described in molecular biology as a
&quot;memory molecule&quot; that can integrate through auto-phosporylation Ca-influx
signals on a relatively large time scale of dozens of seconds. The functional
impact of this memory mechanism is largely unknown. We show that the
experimental data on the specific role of CaMKII activation in dopamine-gated
spine consolidation suggest a general functional role in speeding up
reward-guided search for network configurations that maximize reward
expectation. Our theoretical analysis shows that stochastic search could in
principle even attain optimal network configurations by emulating one of the
most well-known nonlinear optimization methods, simulated annealing. But this
optimization is usually impeded by slowness of stochastic search at a given
temperature. We propose that CaMKII contributes a momentum term that
substantially speeds up this search. In particular, it allows the network to
overcome saddle points of the fitness function. The resulting improved
stochastic policy search can be understood on a more abstract level as
Hamiltonian sampling, which is known to be one of the most efficient stochastic
search methods.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Term or Preterm Cesarean Section Delivery Does Not Lead to Long-term Detrimental Consequences in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy112</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy112/4996561?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Epidemiological studies have provided contradictory data on the deleterious sequels of cesarean section (C-section) delivery and their links with developmental brain disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorders. To gain better insight on these issues, we have now compared physiological, morphological, and behavioral parameters in vaginal, term, and preterm C-section delivered mice. We report that C-section delivery does not lead to long-term behavioral alterations though preterm C-section delivery modifies communicative behaviors in pups. Moreover, C-section delivery neither alters the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) developmental excitatory to inhibitory shift nor the frequency or amplitude of glutamatergic and GABAergic postsynaptic currents in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. However, these neurons present an underdeveloped dendritic arbor at birth in pups born by C-section delivery, but this difference disappears 1 day later suggesting an accelerated growth after birth. Therefore, C-section delivery, with prematurity as an aggravating factor, induces transient developmental delays but neither impacts the GABA developmental sequence nor leads to long-term consequences in mice. The deleterious sequels of C-section delivery described in epidemiological studies might be due to a perinatal insult that could be aggravated by C-section delivery.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Local Cortical Gyrification is Increased in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders, but Decreases Rapidly in Adolescents</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy111</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Extensive MRI evidence indicates early brain overgrowth in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Local gyrification may reflect the distribution and timing of aberrant cortical expansion in ASDs. We examined MRI data from (Study 1) 64 individuals with ASD and 64 typically developing (TD) controls (7–19 years), and from (Study 2) an independent sample from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 31/group). Local Gyrification Index (lGI), cortical thickness (CT), and surface area (SA) were measured. In Study 1, differences in lGI (ASD &amp;gt; TD) were found in left parietal and temporal and right frontal and temporal regions. lGI decreased bilaterally with age, but more steeply in ASD in left precentral, right lateral occipital, and middle frontal clusters. CT differed between groups in right perisylvian cortex (TD &amp;gt; ASD), but no differences were found for SA. Partial correlations between lGI and CT were generally negative, but associations were weaker in ASD in several clusters. Study 2 results were consistent, though less extensive. Altered gyrification may reflect unique information about the trajectory of cortical development in ASDs. While early overgrowth tends to be undetectable in later childhood in ASDs, findings may indicate that a trace of this developmental abnormality could remain in a disorder-specific pattern of gyrification.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Multiple Regions of a Cortical Network Commonly Encode the Meaning of Words in Multiple Grammatical Positions of Read Sentences</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy110</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy110/4996559?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Deciphering how sentence meaning is represented in the brain remains a major challenge to science. Semantically related neural activity has recently been shown to arise concurrently in distributed brain regions as successive words in a sentence are read. However, what semantic content is represented by different regions, what is common across them, and how this relates to words in different grammatical positions of sentences is weakly understood. To address these questions, we apply a semantic model of word meaning to interpret brain activation patterns elicited in sentence reading. The model is based on human ratings of 65 sensory/motor/emotional and cognitive features of experience with words (and their referents). Through a process of mapping functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging activation back into model space we test: which brain regions semantically encode content words in different grammatical positions (e.g., subject/verb/object); and what semantic features are encoded by different regions. In left temporal, inferior parietal, and inferior/superior frontal regions we detect the semantic encoding of words in all grammatical positions tested and reveal multiple common components of semantic representation. This suggests that sentence comprehension involves a common core representation of multiple words’ meaning being encoded in a network of regions distributed across the brain.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sex Differences in the Adult Human Brain: Evidence from 5216 UK Biobank Participants</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Sex differences in the human brain are of interest for many reasons: for example, there are sex differences in the observed prevalence of psychiatric disorders and in some psychological traits that brain differences might help to explain. We report the largest single-sample study of structural and functional sex differences in the human brain (2750 female, 2466 male participants; mean age 61.7 years, range 44–77 years). Males had higher raw volumes, raw surface areas, and white matter fractional anisotropy; females had higher raw cortical thickness and higher white matter tract complexity. There was considerable distributional overlap between the sexes. Subregional differences were not fully attributable to differences in total volume, total surface area, mean cortical thickness, or height. There was generally greater male variance across the raw structural measures. Functional connectome organization showed stronger connectivity for males in unimodal sensorimotor cortices, and stronger connectivity for females in the default mode network. This large-scale study provides a foundation for attempts to understand the causes and consequences of sex differences in adult brain structure and function.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The non-cell autonomous transfer of OTX2 homeoprotein transcription factor into juvenile mouse cerebral cortex regulates parvalbumin interneuron maturation and critical period timing. By analyzing gene expression in primary visual cortex of wild-type and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Otx2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;+/GFP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice at plastic and nonplastic ages, we identified several putative genes implicated in Otx2-dependent visual cortex plasticity for ocular dominance. Cortical OTX2 infusion in juvenile mice induced &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Gadd45b/g&lt;/span&gt; expression through direct regulation of transcription. Intriguingly, a reverse effect was found in the adult, where reducing cortical OTX2 resulted in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Gadd45b/g&lt;/span&gt; upregulation. Viral expression of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Gadd45b&lt;/span&gt; in adult visual cortex directly induced ocular dominance plasticity with concomitant changes in MeCP2 foci within parvalbumin interneurons and in methylation states of several plasticity gene promoters, suggesting epigenetic regulation. This interaction provides a molecular mechanism for OTX2 to trigger critical period plasticity yet suppress adult plasticity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: PICK1-Deficient Mice Exhibit Impaired Response to Cocaine and Dysregulated Dopamine Homeostasis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0422-17.2018v2?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Protein Interacting with C-Kinase 1 (PICK1) is a widely expressed scaffold protein known to interact via its PDZ domain with several membrane proteins including the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT), the primary target for cocaine’s reinforcing actions. Here, we establish the importance of PICK1 for behavioral effects observed after both acute and repeated administration of cocaine. In PICK1 knockout (KO) mice, the acute locomotor response to a single injection of cocaine was markedly attenuated. Moreover, in support of a role for PICK1 in neuroadaptive changes induced by cocaine, we observed diminished cocaine intake in a self-administration paradigm. Reduced behavioral effects of cocaine were not associated with decreased striatal DAT distribution and most likely not caused by the ~30% reduction in synaptosomal DA uptake observed in PICK1 KO mice. The PICK1 KO mice demonstrated preserved behavioral responses to DA receptor agonists supporting intact downstream DA receptor signaling. Unexpectedly, we found a prominent increase in striatal DA content and levels of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in PICK1 KO mice. Chronoamperometric recordings showed enhanced DA release in PICK1 KO mice, consistent with increased striatal DA pools. Viral-mediated knockdown of PICK1 in cultured dopaminergic neurons increased TH expression, supporting a direct cellular effect of PICK1. In summary, in addition to demonstrating a key role of PICK1 in mediating behavioral effects of cocaine, our data reveal a so far unappreciated role of PICK1 in DA homeostasis that possibly involves negative regulation of striatal TH levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Cocaine addiction is a major societal problem and better treatments are needed. We demonstrate here the importance of the PDZ-domain scaffold protein PICK1 for both the acute reinforcing effects of cocaine and the long-term behavioral changes seen on repeated cocaine exposure. Interestingly, our data suggest that these alterations are independent of PICK1 binding to the primary target of cocaine, DAT. Moreover, our study reveals a novel role of PICK1 in maintenance of DA homeostasis that involves negative regulation of the levels of striatal TH, the rate-limiting enzyme in DA synthesis. Summarized, these data provide an important framework for further exploring the role of PICK1 in addiction and as putative target for treatment of psychostimulant abuse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurofeedback is a form of brain training in which subjects are fed back
information about some measure of their brain activity which they are
instructed to modify in a way thought to be functionally advantageous. Over the
last twenty years, NF has been used to treat various neurological and
psychiatric conditions, and to improve cognitive function in various contexts.
However, despite its growing popularity, each of the main steps in NF comes
with its own set of often covert assumptions. Here we critically examine some
conceptual and methodological issues associated with the way general objectives
and neural targets of NF are defined, and review the neural mechanisms through
which NF may act, and the way its efficacy is gauged. The NF process is
characterised in terms of functional dynamics, and possible ways in which it
may be controlled are discussed. Finally, it is proposed that improving NF will
require better understanding of various fundamental aspects of brain dynamics
and a more precise definition of functional brain activity and brain-behaviour
relationships.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Automatic sleep staging is a challenging problem and state-of-the-art
algorithms have not yet reached satisfactory performance to be used instead of
manual scoring by a sleep technician. Much research has been done to find good
feature representations that extract the useful information to correctly
classify each epoch into the correct sleep stage. While many useful features
have been discovered, the amount of features have grown to an extent that a
feature reduction step is necessary in order to avoid the curse of
dimensionality. One reason for the need of such a large feature set is that
many features are good for discriminating only one of the sleep stages and are
less informative during other stages. This paper explores how a second feature
representation over a large set of pre-defined features can be learned using an
auto-encoder with a selective attention for the current sleep stage in the
training batch. This selective attention allows the model to learn feature
representations that focuses on the more relevant inputs without having to
perform any dimensionality reduction of the input data. The performance of the
proposed algorithm is evaluated on a large data set of polysomnography (PSG)
night recordings of patients with sleep-disordered breathing. The performance
of the auto-encoder with selective attention is compared with a regular
auto-encoder and previous works using a deep belief network (DBN).

	<description>Interplay between genetic and environmental factors during critical time windows can have effects that span from neurodevelopment to neurodegeneration. We present the concept of the ‘neuroexposome’, emphasizing the brain’s distinctive response to environmental exposure, and how current ‘omics’ sciences can inform on both disease pathogenesis and future public health policies.</description>

McGrouther, John Kelsoe, Nicholas Schork, Eli Stahl, Qian Zhu, Arjun Krishnan, Vicky Yao, Olga Troyanskaya, Seda Bilaloglu, Preeti Raghavan, Sarah Bergen, Anders Jureus, Mikael Landen, Bipolar Disorders Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium &lt;/p&gt;

A common goal in data-analysis is to sift through a large data-matrix and detect any significant submatrices (i.e., biclusters) that have a low numerical rank. We present a simple algorithm for tackling this biclustering problem. Our algorithm accumulates information about 2-by-2 submatrices (i.e., ‘loops’) within the data-matrix, and focuses on rows and columns of the data-matrix that participate in an abundance of low-rank loops. We demonstrate, through analysis and numerical-experiments, that this loop-counting method performs well in a variety of scenarios, outperforming simple spectral methods in many situations of interest. Another important feature of our method is that it can easily be modified to account for aspects of experimental design which commonly arise in practice. For example, our algorithm can be modified to correct for controls, categorical- and continuous-covariates, as well as sparsity within the data. We demonstrate these practical features with two examples; the first drawn from gene-expression analysis and the second drawn from a much larger genome-wide-association-study (GWAS).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MbY469xyEU0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: RNA from Trained Aplysia Can Induce an Epigenetic Engram for Long-Term Sensitization in Untrained Aplysia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0038-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0038-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The precise nature of the engram, the physical substrate of memory, remains uncertain. Here, it is reported that RNA extracted from the central nervous system of &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; given long-term sensitization training induced sensitization when injected into untrained animals; furthermore, the RNA-induced sensitization, like training-induced sensitization, required DNA methylation. In cellular experiments, treatment with RNA extracted from trained animals was found to increase excitability in sensory neurons, but not in motor neurons, dissociated from naïve animals. Thus, the behavioral, and a subset of the cellular, modifications characteristic of a form of nonassociative long-term memory in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; can be transferred by RNA. These results indicate that RNA is sufficient to generate an engram for long-term sensitization in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; and are consistent with the hypothesis that RNA-induced epigenetic changes underlie memory storage in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; It is generally accepted that long-term memory (LTM) is encoded as alterations in synaptic strength. An alternative model, however, proposes that LTM is encoded by epigenetic changes. Non-coding RNAs can mediate epigenetic modifications. Therefore, RNA from a trained animal might be capable of producing learning-like behavioral change in an untrained animal. Here, it is demonstrated that the memory for long-term sensitization in the marine mollusk &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; can be successfully transferred by injecting RNA from sensitized into naïve animals. Moreover, a specific cellular alteration that underlies sensitization in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;, sensory neuron hyperexcitability, can be reproduced by exposing sensory neurons &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to RNA from trained animals. The results provide support for a nonsynaptic, epigenetic model of memory storage in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: PICK1-Deficient Mice Exhibit Impaired Response to Cocaine and Dysregulated Dopamine Homeostasis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0422-17.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Protein Interacting with C-Kinase 1 (PICK1) is a widely expressed scaffold protein known to interact via its PDZ domain with several membrane proteins including the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT), the primary target for cocaine’s reinforcing actions. Here, we establish the importance of PICK1 for behavioral effects observed after both acute and repeated administration of cocaine. In PICK1 knockout (KO) mice, the acute locomotor response to a single injection of cocaine was markedly attenuated. Moreover, in support of a role for PICK1 in neuroadaptive changes induced by cocaine, we observed diminished cocaine intake in a self-administration paradigm. Reduced behavioral effects of cocaine were not associated with decreased striatal DAT distribution and most likely not caused by the ~30% reduction in synaptosomal DA uptake observed in PICK1 KO mice. The PICK1 KO mice demonstrated preserved behavioral responses to DA receptor agonists supporting intact downstream DA receptor signaling. Unexpectedly, we found a prominent increase in striatal DA content and levels of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in PICK1 KO mice. Chronoamperometric recordings showed enhanced DA release in PICK1 KO mice, consistent with increased striatal DA pools. Viral-mediated knockdown of PICK1 in cultured dopaminergic neurons increased TH expression, supporting a direct cellular effect of PICK1. In summary, in addition to demonstrating a key role of PICK1 in mediating behavioral effects of cocaine, our data reveal a so far unappreciated role of PICK1 in DA homeostasis that possibly involves negative regulation of striatal TH levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Cocaine addiction is a major societal problem and better treatments are needed. We demonstrate here the importance of the PDZ-domain scaffold protein PICK1 for both the acute reinforcing effects of cocaine and the long-term behavioral changes seen on repeated cocaine exposure. Interestingly, our data suggest that these alterations are independent of PICK1 binding to the primary target of cocaine, DAT. Moreover, our study reveals a novel role of PICK1 in maintenance of DA homeostasis that involves negative regulation of the levels of striatal TH, the rate-limiting enzyme in DA synthesis. Summarized, these data provide an important framework for further exploring the role of PICK1 in addiction and as putative target for treatment of psychostimulant abuse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Wang and colleagues present a new theory showing how learning to learn may arise from interactions between prefrontal cortex and the dopamine system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/GnT90UB6MjI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dbx1 Pre-Bötzinger Complex Interneurons Comprise the Core Inspiratory Oscillator for Breathing in Unanesthetized Adult Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0130-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The brainstem pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) generates inspiratory breathing rhythms, but which neurons comprise its rhythmogenic core? Dbx1-derived neurons may play the preeminent role in rhythm generation, an idea well founded at perinatal stages of development but incompletely evaluated in adulthood. We expressed archaerhodopsin or channelrhodopsin in Dbx1 preBötC neurons in intact adult mice to interrogate their function. Prolonged photoinhibition slowed down or stopped breathing, whereas prolonged photostimulation sped up breathing. Brief inspiratory-phase photoinhibition evoked the next breath earlier than expected, whereas brief expiratory-phase photoinhibition delayed the subsequent breath. Conversely, brief inspiratory-phase photostimulation increased inspiratory duration and delayed the subsequent breath, whereas brief expiratory-phase photostimulation evoked the next breath earlier than expected. Because they govern the frequency and precise timing of breaths in awake adult mice with sensorimotor feedback intact, Dbx1 preBötC neurons constitute an essential core component of the inspiratory oscillator, knowledge directly relevant to human health and physiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Breathing behavior depends on rhythmic movements. The underlying neural rhythm for inspiration may originate due to brainstem interneurons defined genetically by expression of the embryonic transcription factor Dbx1. Dbx1-derived neurons comprise the core oscillator microcircuit in perinatal mice, but they serve other functions too, and their inspiratory rhythmogenic role has not been conclusively tested in adults. Optogenetic photostimulation and photoinhibition of Dbx1-derived brainstem neurons in intact adult mice modulated breathing, either speeding it up, slowing it down to the point of apnea (no breathing), or perturbing its phase, which are functions consistent with the rhythm generator. These results establish the cellular point of origin for breathing rhythm, a key physiologic brain function in humans and all mammals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Inverted Encoding Models Assay Population-Level Stimulus Representations, Not Single-Unit Neural Tuning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0098-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Inverted encoding models (IEMs) are a powerful tool for reconstructing population-level stimulus representations from aggregate measurements of neural activity (e.g., fMRI or EEG). In a recent report, Liu et al., (2018) tested whether IEMs can provide information about the underlying tuning of &lt;i&gt;single units&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we argue that using stimulus reconstructions to infer properties of single neurons, such as neural tuning bandwidth, is an ill-posed problem with no unambiguous solution. Instead of interpreting results from these methods as evidence about single-unit tuning, we emphasize the utility of these methods for assaying &lt;i&gt;population-level&lt;/i&gt; stimulus representations. These can be compared across task conditions to better constrain theories of large-scale neural information processing across experimental manipulations, such as changing sensory input or attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: How stimulation frequency and intensity impact on the long-lasting effects of coordinated reset stimulation</title>

Several brain diseases are characterized by abnormally strong neuronal synchrony. Coordinated Reset (CR) stimulation was computationally designed to specifically counteract abnormal neuronal synchronization processes by desynchronization. In the presence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) this may lead to a decrease of synaptic excitatory weights and ultimately to an anti-kindling, i.e. unlearning of abnormal synaptic connectivity and abnormal neuronal synchrony. The long-lasting desynchronizing impact of CR stimulation has been verified in pre-clinical and clinical proof of concept studies. However, as yet it is unclear how to optimally choose the CR stimulation frequency, i.e. the repetition rate at which the CR stimuli are delivered. This work presents the first computational study on the dependence of the acute and long-term outcome on the CR stimulation frequency in neuronal networks with STDP. For this purpose, CR stimulation was applied with Rapidly Varying Sequences (RVS) as well as with Slowly Varying Sequences (SVS) in a wide range of stimulation frequencies and intensities. Our findings demonstrate that acute desynchronization, achieved during stimulation, does not necessarily lead to long-term desynchronization after cessation of stimulation. By comparing the long-term effects of the two different CR protocols, the RVS CR stimulation turned out to be more robust against variations of the stimulation frequency. However, SVS CR stimulation can obtain stronger anti-kindling effects. We revealed specific parameter ranges that are favorable for long-term desynchronization. For instance, RVS CR stimulation at weak intensities and with stimulation frequencies in the range of the neuronal firing rates turned out to be effective and robust, in particular, if no closed loop adaptation of stimulation parameters is (technically) available. From a clinical standpoint, this may be relevant in the context of both invasive as well as non-invasive CR stimulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rx9Yjw7JXhk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

To cooperatively carry large food items to the nest, individual ants conform their efforts and coordinate their motion. Throughout this expedition, collective motion is driven both by internal interactions between the carrying ants and a response to newly arrived informed ants that orient the cargo towards the nest. During the transport process, the carrying group must overcome obstacles that block their path to the nest. Here, we investigate the dynamics of cooperative transport, when the motion of the ants is frustrated by a linear obstacle that obstructs the motion of the cargo. The obstacle contains a narrow opening that serves as the only available passage to the nest, and through which single ants can pass but not with the cargo. We provide an analytical model for the ant-cargo system in the constrained environment that predicts a bi-stable dynamic behavior between an oscillatory mode of motion along the obstacle and a convergent mode of motion near the opening. Using both experiments and simulations, we show how for small cargo sizes, the system exhibits spontaneous transitions between these two modes of motion due to fluctuations in the applied force on the cargo. The bi-stability provides two possible problem solving strategies for overcoming the obstacle, either by attempting to pass through the opening, or take large excursions to circumvent the obstacle.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jPqnVrYLq7g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Porcupine: A visual pipeline tool for neuroimaging analysis</title>

The field of neuroimaging is rapidly adopting a more reproducible approach to data acquisition and analysis. Data structures and formats are being standardised and data analyses are getting more automated. However, as data analysis becomes more complicated, researchers often have to write longer analysis scripts, spanning different tools across multiple programming languages. This makes it more difficult to share or recreate code, reducing the reproducibility of the analysis. We present a tool, Porcupine, that constructs one’s analysis visually and automatically produces analysis code. The graphical representation improves understanding of the performed analysis, while retaining the flexibility of modifying the produced code manually to custom needs. Not only does Porcupine produce the analysis code, it also creates a shareable environment for running the code in the form of a Docker image. Together, this forms a reproducible way of constructing, visualising and sharing one’s analysis. Currently, Porcupine links to Nipype functionalities, which in turn accesses most standard neuroimaging analysis tools. Our goal is to release researchers from the constraints of specific implementation details, thereby freeing them to think about novel and creative ways to solve a given problem. Porcupine improves the overview researchers have of their processing pipelines, and facilitates both the development and communication of their work. This will reduce the threshold at which less expert users can generate reusable pipelines. With Porcupine, we bridge the gap between a conceptual and an implementational level of analysis and make it easier for researchers to create reproducible and shareable science. We provide a wide range of examples and documentation, as well as installer files for all platforms on our website: https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine. Porcupine is free, open source, and released under the GNU General Public License v3.0.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OPful2fUMb8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Retina is a paradigmatic system for studying sensory encoding: the transformation of light into spiking activity of ganglion cells. The inverse problem, where stimulus is reconstructed from spikes, has received less attention, especially for complex stimuli that should be reconstructed “pixel-by-pixel”. We recorded around a hundred neurons from a dense patch in a rat retina and decoded movies of multiple small randomly-moving discs. We constructed nonlinear (kernelized and neural network) decoders that improved significantly over linear results. An important contribution to this was the ability of nonlinear decoders to reliably separate between neural responses driven by locally fluctuating light signals, and responses at locally constant light driven by spontaneous-like activity. This improvement crucially depended on the precise, non-Poisson temporal structure of individual spike trains, which originated in the spike-history dependence of neural responses. We propose a general principle by which downstream circuitry could discriminate between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity based solely on higher-order statistical structure in the incoming spike trains.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0tROk9h9FSA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

BK virus (BKV) associated nephropathy affects 1–10% of kidney transplant recipients, leading to graft failure in about 50% of cases. Immune responses against different BKV antigens have been shown to have a prognostic value for disease development. Data currently suggest that the structural antigens and regulatory antigens of BKV might each trigger a different mode of action of the immune response. To study the influence of different modes of action of the cellular immune response on BKV clearance dynamics, we have analysed the kinetics of BKV plasma load and anti-BKV T cell response (Elispot) in six patients with BKV associated nephropathy using ODE modelling. The results show that only a small number of hypotheses on the mode of action are compatible with the empirical data. The hypothesis with the highest empirical support is that structural antigens trigger blocking of virus production from infected cells, whereas regulatory antigens trigger an acceleration of death of infected cells. These differential modes of action could be important for our understanding of BKV resolution, as according to the hypothesis, only regulatory antigens would trigger a fast and continuous clearance of the viral load. Other hypotheses showed a lower degree of empirical support, but could potentially explain the clearing mechanisms of individual patients. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of the dynamics, including the delay between immune response against structural versus regulatory antigens, and its relevance for BKV clearance. Our modelling approach is the first that studies the process of BKV clearance by bringing together viral and immune kinetics and can provide a framework for personalised hypotheses generation on the interrelations between cellular immunity and viral dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8poCgXZvMAQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Differential Deployment of Visual Attention During Interactive Approach and Avoidance Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy105</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy105/4994603?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The ability to coordinate approach and avoidance actions in dynamic environments represents the boundary between extinction and the continued survival of many animal species. It is therefore crucial that sensory systems allocate limited attentional resources to the most relevant information to facilitate planning and execution of appropriate actions. Prominent theories of how attention regulates visual processing focus on the distinction between behaviorally relevant and irrelevant visual inputs. To date, however, no study has directly compared the deployment of attention to visual inputs relevant for approach and avoidance behaviors, which naturally occur in dynamic, interactive environments. In two experiments, we combined electroencephalography, frequency tagging, and eye gaze measures to investigate whether the deployment of visual selective attention differs for items relevant for approach and avoidance actions. Participants maneuvered a cursor to approach and avoid contact with moving items in a continuous interactive task. The results indicated that while the approach and avoidance tasks recruited equivalent attentional resources overall, attentional biases were directed toward task-relevant items during approach, and away from task-relevant items during avoidance. We conclude that the deployment of visual attention is guided not only by relevance to a behavioral goal, but also by the nature of that goal.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Independent Early and Late Sensory Processes for Proprioceptive Integration When Planning a Step</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Somatosensory inputs to the cortex undergo an early and a later stage of processing which are characterized by an early and a late somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP). The early response is highly representative of the stimulus characteristics whereas the late response reflects a more integrative, task specific, stage of sensory processing. We hypothesized that the later processing stage is independent of the early processing stage. We tested the prediction that a reduction of the first volley of input to the cortex should not prevent the increase of the late SEP. Using the sensory interference phenomenon, we halved the amplitude of the early response to somatosensory input of the ankle joints (evoked by vibration) when participants either planned a step forward or remained still. Despite the initial cortical response to the vibration being massively decreased in both tasks, the late response was still enhanced during step planning. Source localization indicated the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) as the likely origin of the late response modulation. Overall these results support the dissociation between the processes underlying the early and late SEP. The later processing stage could involve both direct and indirect thalamic connections to PPC which bypass the postcentral somatosensory cortex.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

We developed new methods for parameter estimation-in-context and, with the help of 125 authors, built the AmP (Add-my-Pet) database of Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models, parameters and referenced underlying data for animals, where each species constitutes one database entry. The combination of DEB parameters covers all aspects of energetics throughout the full organism’s life cycle, from the start of embryo development to death by aging. The species-specific parameter values capture biodiversity and can now, for the first time, be compared between animals species. An important insight brought by the AmP project is the classification of animal energetics according to a family of related DEB models that is structured on the basis of the mode of metabolic acceleration, which links up with the development of larval stages. We discuss the evolution of metabolism in this context, among animals in general, and ray-finned fish, mollusks and crustaceans in particular. New DEBtool code for estimating DEB parameters from data has been written. AmPtool code for analyzing patterns in parameter values has also been created. A new web-interface supports multiple ways to visualize data, parameters, and implied properties from the entire collection as well as on an entry by entry basis. The DEB models proved to fit data well, the median relative error is only 0.07, for the 1035 animal species at 2018/03/12, including some extinct ones, from all large phyla and all chordate orders, spanning a range of body masses of 16 orders of magnitude. This study is a first step to include evolutionary aspects into parameter estimation, allowing to infer properties of species for which very little is known.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HxEjp5eCvBA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging is known as a major risk factor for the structure and function of the nervous system. There is urgent need to overcome such deleterious effects of age-related neurodegeneration. Here we show that peripheral nerves of 24-month-old aging C57BL/6 mice of either sex show similar pathological alterations as nerves from aging human individuals, whereas 12-month-old adult mice lack such alterations. Specifically, nerve fibers showed demyelination, remyelination and axonal lesion. Moreover, in the aging mice, neuromuscular junctions showed features typical for dying-back neuropathies, as revealed by a decline of presynaptic markers, associated with α-bungarotoxin-positive postsynapses. In line with these observations were reduced muscle strengths. These alterations were accompanied by elevated numbers of endoneurial macrophages, partially comprising the features of phagocytosing macrophages. Comparable profiles of macrophages could be identified in peripheral nerve biopsies of aging persons. To determine the pathological impact of macrophages in aging mice, we selectively targeted the cells by applying an orally administered CSF-1R specific kinase (c-FMS) inhibitor. The 6-month-lasting treatment started before development of degenerative changes at 18 months and reduced macrophage numbers in mice by ~70%, without side effects. Strikingly, nerve structure was ameliorated and muscle strength preserved. We show, for the first time, that age-related degenerative changes in peripheral nerves are driven by macrophages. These findings may pave the way for treating degeneration in the aging peripheral nervous system by targeting macrophages, leading to reduced weakness, improved mobility, and eventually increased quality of life in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Aging is a major risk factor for the structure and function of the nervous system. Here we show that peripheral nerves of 24-month-old aging mice show similar degenerative alterations as nerves from aging human individuals. Both in mice and humans, these alterations were accompanied by endoneurial macrophages. To determine the pathological impact of macrophages in aging mice, we selectively targeted the cells by blocking a cytokine receptor, essential for macrophage survival. The treatment strongly reduced macrophage numbers and substantially improved nerve structure and muscle strength. We show, for the first time, that age-related degenerative changes in peripheral nerves are driven by macrophages. These findings may be helpful for treatment weakness and reduced mobility in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In this issue of Cerebral Cortex, Cipriani et al. are following up on the recent report of Sorrels et al. to add novel immunohistological observations indicating that, unlike rodents, adult and aging humans do not acquire new neurons in the hippocampus. The common finding emerging from these 2 different, but almost simultaneous studies is highly significant because the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was, until recently, considered as the only structure in the human brain that may continue neurogenesis throughout the full life span.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: RIPK3/MLKL-Mediated Neuronal Necroptosis Modulates the M1/M2 Polarization of Microglia/Macrophages in the Ischemic Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy089</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cell death and subsequent inflammation are 2 key pathological changes occurring in cerebral ischemia. Active microglia/macrophages play a double-edged role depending on the balance of their M1/M2 phenotypes. Necrosis is the predominant type of cell death following ischemia. However, how necrotic cells modulate the M1/M2 polarization of microglia/macrophages remains poorly investigated. Here, we reported that ischemia induces a rapid RIPK3/MLKL-mediated neuron-dominated necroptosis, a type of programmed necrosis. Ablating RIPK3 or MLKL could switch the activation of microglia/macrophages from M1 to the M2 type in the ischemic cortex. Conditioned medium of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated wild-type (WT) neurons induced M1 polarization, while that of RIPK3&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; neurons favored M2 polarization. OGD treatment induces proinflammatory IL-18 and TNFα in WT but not in RIPK3&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, which in turn upregulate anti-inflammatory IL-4 and IL-10. Furthermore, the expression of Myd88—a common downstream adaptor of toll-like receptors—is significantly upregulated in the microglia/macrophages of ischemic WT but not of RIPK3&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; or MLKL&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; cortices. Antagonizing the function of Myd88 could phenocopy the effects of RIPK3/MLKL-knockout on the polarization of microglia/macrophages and was neuroprotective. Our data revealed a novel role of necroptotic neurons in modulating the M1/M2 balance of microglia/macrophages in the ischemic cortex, possibly through Myd88 signaling.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Cells respond to stressful conditions by coordinating a complex, multi-faceted response that spans many levels of physiology. Much of the response is coordinated by changes in protein phosphorylation. Although the regulators of transcriptome changes during stress are well characterized in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, the upstream regulatory network controlling protein phosphorylation is less well dissected. Here, we developed a computational approach to infer the signaling network that regulates phosphorylation changes in response to salt stress. We developed an approach to link predicted regulators to groups of likely co-regulated phospho-peptides responding to stress, thereby creating new edges in a background protein interaction network. We then use integer linear programming (ILP) to integrate wild type and mutant phospho-proteomic data and predict the network controlling stress-activated phospho-proteomic changes. The network we inferred predicted new regulatory connections between stress-activated and growth-regulating pathways and suggested mechanisms coordinating metabolism, cell-cycle progression, and growth during stress. We confirmed several network predictions with co-immunoprecipitations coupled with mass-spectrometry protein identification and mutant phospho-proteomic analysis. Results show that the cAMP-phosphodiesterase Pde2 physically interacts with many stress-regulated transcription factors targeted by PKA, and that reduced phosphorylation of those factors during stress requires the Rck2 kinase that we show physically interacts with Pde2. Together, our work shows how a high-quality computational network model can facilitate discovery of new pathway interactions during osmotic stress.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNFhadDEsvQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Insula Connections With the Parieto-Frontal Circuit for Generating Arm Actions in Humans and Macaque Monkeys</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy095</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy095/4993348?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;It has been recently found that the human dorso-central insular cortex contributes to the execution and recognition of the affective component of hand actions, most likely through modulation of the activity of the parieto-frontal circuits. While the anatomical connections between the hand representation of the insula and, the parietal and frontal regions controlling reaching/grasping actions is well assessed in the monkey, it is unknown the existence of a homolog circuit in humans. In the present study, we performed a multifiber tractography investigation to trace the tracts possibly connecting the insula to the parieto-frontal circuits by locating seeds in the parietal, premotor, and prefrontal nodes of the reaching/grasping network, in both humans and monkeys. Results showed that, in both species, the insula is connected with the cortical action execution/recognition circuit by similar white matter tracts, running in parallel to the third branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the anterior segment of the arcuate fasciculus.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Neural Cotransmission in Spinal Circuits Governing Locomotion</title>

	<description>Many neuronal circuits contain, or are influenced by, colocalized neurotransmitters, which are suggested to fine-tune circuit function. Much of our knowledge about cotransmission derives from studies in non-mammalian model systems, although a growing number of studies have provided insights into the physiological role of cotransmission in more complex mammalian circuits, including the spinal cord. Here we discuss the current picture of colocalized neurotransmitters in spinal circuits of non-mammalian and mammalian systems, as well as the progression towards understanding of their functional roles.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Paradoxical Decision-Making: A Framework for Understanding Cognition in Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30105-X?rss=yes</link>
	<description>People with Parkinson’s disease (PD) show impaired decision-making when sensory and memory information must be combined. This recently identified impairment results from an inability to accumulate the proper amount of information needed to make a decision and appears to be independent of dopamine tone and reinforcement learning mechanisms. Although considerable work focuses on PD and decisions involving risk and reward, in this Opinion article we propose that the emerging findings in perceptual decision-making highlight the multisystem nature of PD, and that unraveling the neuronal circuits underlying perceptual decision-making impairment may help in understanding other cognitive impairments in people with PD.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Neural Oscillations: Sustained Rhythms or Transient Burst-Events?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30103-6?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30103-6?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Frequency-specific patterns of neural activity are increasingly interpreted as transient bursts of isolated events rather than as rhythmically sustained oscillations. This has potentially far-reaching implications for theories of how such oscillations originate and how they shape neural computations. As this debate unfolds, we explore alternative interpretations and ask how best to distinguish between them.</description>

	<description>Pharmacological neuromodulation strategies have shown limited efficacy in treating memory deficits related to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Despite encouraging results from a few preclinical studies, clinical trials investigating open-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS) for AD have not been successful. Recent refinements in understanding the various phases of memory processes, animal studies investigating phase-specific modulation of hippocampal activity during memorization, and clinical studies using closed-loop DBS strategies to treat patients with movement disorders, all point to the need to investigate closed-loop fornical DBS strategies to better understand memory dynamics and potentially treat memory deficits in AD preclinical models.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Preferential Representation of Past Outcome Information and Future Choice Behavior by Putative Inhibitory Interneurons Rather Than Putative Pyramidal Neurons in the Primate Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy103</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy103/4990942?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays crucial roles in monitoring the outcome of a choice and adjusting a subsequent choice behavior based on the outcome information. In the present study, we investigated how different types of dACC neurons, that is, putative pyramidal neurons and putative inhibitory interneurons, contribute to these processes. We analyzed single-unit database obtained from the dACC in monkeys performing a reversal learning task. The monkey was required to adjust choice behavior from past outcome experiences. Depending on their action potential waveforms, the recorded neurons were classified into putative pyramidal neurons and putative inhibitory interneurons. We found that these neurons do not equally contribute to outcome monitoring and behavioral adjustment. Although both neuron types evenly responded to the current outcome, a larger proportion of putative inhibitory interneurons than putative pyramidal neurons stored the information about the past outcome. The putative inhibitory interneurons further represented choice-related signals more frequently, such as whether the monkey would shift the last choice to an alternative at the next choice opportunity. Our findings suggest that putative inhibitory interneurons, which are thought not to project to brain areas outside the dACC, preferentially transmit signals that would adjust choice behavior based on past outcome experiences.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Network-Based Asymmetry of the Human Auditory System</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Converging evidence from activation, connectivity, and stimulation studies suggests that auditory brain networks are lateralized. Here we show that these findings can be at least partly explained by the asymmetric network embedding of the primary auditory cortices. Using diffusion-weighted imaging in 3 independent datasets, we investigate the propensity for left and right auditory cortex to communicate with other brain areas by quantifying the centrality of the auditory network across a spectrum of communication mechanisms, from shortest path communication to diffusive spreading. Across all datasets, we find that the right auditory cortex is better integrated in the connectome, facilitating more efficient communication with other areas, with much of the asymmetry driven by differences in communication pathways to the opposite hemisphere. Critically, the primacy of the right auditory cortex emerges only when communication is conceptualized as a diffusive process, taking advantage of more than just the topologically shortest paths in the network. Altogether, these results highlight how the network configuration and embedding of a particular region may contribute to its functional lateralization.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Action Observation Areas Represent Intentions From Subtle Kinematic Features</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy098</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Mirror neurons have been proposed to underlie humans’ ability to understand others’ actions and intentions. Despite 2 decades of research, however, the exact computational and neuronal mechanisms implied in this ability remain unclear. In the current study, we investigated whether, in the absence of contextual cues, regions considered to be part of the human mirror neuron system represent intention from movement kinematics. A total of 21 participants observed reach-to-grasp movements, performed with either the intention to drink or to pour while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Multivoxel pattern analysis revealed successful decoding of intentions from distributed patterns of activity in a network of structures comprising the inferior parietal lobule, the superior parietal lobule, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the middle frontal gyrus. Consistent with the proposal that parietal regions play a key role in intention understanding, classifier weights were higher in the inferior parietal region. These results provide the first demonstration that putative mirror neuron regions represent subtle differences in movement kinematics to read the intention of an observed motor act.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Hippocampal Radial Glial Subtypes and Their Neurogenic Potential in Human Fetuses and Healthy and Alzheimer’s Disease Adults</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neuropathological conditions might affect adult granulogenesis in the adult human dentate gyrus. However, radial glial cells (RGCs) have not been well characterized during human development and aging. We have previously described progenitor and neuronal layer establishment in the hippocampal pyramidal layer and dentate gyrus from embryonic life until mid-gestation. Here, we describe RGC subtypes in the hippocampus from 13 gestational weeks (GW) to mid-gestation and characterize their evolution and the dynamics of neurogenesis from mid-gestation to adulthood in normal and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) subjects. In the pyramidal ventricular zone (VZ), RGC density declined with neurogenesis from mid-gestation until the perinatal period. In the dentate area, morphologic and antigenic differences among RGCs were observed from early ages of development to adulthood. Density and proliferative capacity of dentate RGCs as well as neurogenesis were strongly reduced during childhood until 5 years, few DCX&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells are seen in adults. The dentate gyrus of both control and AD individuals showed Nestin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and/or GFAPδ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells displaying different morphologies. In conclusion, pools of morphologically, antigenically, and topographically diverse neural progenitor cells are present in the human hippocampus from early developmental stages until adulthood, including in AD patients, while their neurogenic potential seems negligible in the adult.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>GGGGCC (G4C2) repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of ALS and FTD. An important issue is how repeat RNAs and their translation products, various dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins, cause neurodegeneration. Drosophila has been widely used to model G4C2 repeat RNA and DPR protein toxicity. Overexpression of disease molecules in flies has revealed important molecular insights. These have been validated and further explored in human neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), a disease-relevant model in which expanded G4C2 repeats are expressed in their native molecular context.</description>
