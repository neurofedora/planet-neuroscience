	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory processing is hard because the variables of interest are encoded in
spike trains in a relatively complex way. A major goal in sensory processing is
to understand how the brain extracts those variables. Here we revisit a common
encoding model in which variables are encoded linearly. Although there are
typically more variables than neurons, this problem is still solvable because
only a small number of variables appear at any one time (sparse prior).
However, previous solutions usually require all-to-all connectivity,
inconsistent with the sparse connectivity seen in the brain. Here we propose a
principled algorithm that provably reaches the MAP inference solution but using
sparse connectivity. Our algorithm is inspired by the mouse olfactory bulb, but
our approach is general enough to apply to other modalities; in addition, it
should be possible to extend it to nonlinear encoding models.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Musical NeuroPicks: a consumer-grade BCI for on-demand music streaming services. (arXiv:1709.01116v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We investigated the possibility of using a machine-learning scheme in
conjunction with commercial wearable EEG-devices for translating listener's
subjective experience of music into scores that can be used in popular
on-demand music streaming services. Our study resulted into two variants,
differing in terms of performance and execution time, and hence, subserving
distinct applications in online streaming music platforms. The first method,
NeuroPicks, is extremely accurate but slower. It is based on the
well-established neuroscientific concepts of brainwave frequency bands,
activation asymmetry index and cross frequency coupling (CFC). The second
method, NeuroPicksVQ, offers prompt predictions of lower credibility and relies
on a custom-built version of vector quantization procedure that facilitates a
novel parameterization of the music-modulated brainwaves. Beyond the feature
engineering step, both methods exploit the inherent efficiency of extreme
learning machines (ELMs) so as to translate, in a personalized fashion, the
derived patterns into a listener's score. NeuroPicks method may find
applications as an integral part of contemporary music recommendation systems,
while NeuroPicksVQ can control the selection of music tracks. Encouraging
experimental results, from a pragmatic use of the systems, are presented.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Brain Gene Expression Analysis: a MATLAB toolbox for the analysis of brain-wide gene-expression data. (arXiv:1211.6177v6 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.6177</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Allen Brain Atlas project (ABA) generated a genome-scale collection of
gene-expression profiles using in-situ hybridization. These profiles were
co-registered to the three-dimensional Allen Reference Atlas (ARA) of the adult
mouse brain. A set of more than 4,000 such volumetric data are available for
the full brain, at a resolution of 200 microns. These data are presented in a
voxel-by-gene matrix. The ARA comes with several systems of annotation,
hierarchical (40 cortical regions, 209 sub-cortical regions in the whole
brain), or non-hierarchical (12 regions in the left hemisphere, with refinement
into 94 regions, and cortical layers). The high-dimensional nature of this
dataset and the possible connection between anatomy and gene expression pose
challenges to data analysis. We developed the Brain Gene Expression Analysis
Toolbox, whose functionalities include: determination of marker genes for brain
regions, statistical analysis of brain-wide co-expression patterns, and the
computation of brain-wide correlation maps with cell-type specific microarray
data.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Estimating short-term synaptic plasticity from pre- and postsynaptic spiking</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005738</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Abed Ghanbari, Aleksey Malyshev, Maxim Volgushev, Ian H. Stevenson&lt;/p&gt;

Short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) critically affects the processing of information in neuronal circuits by reversibly changing the effective strength of connections between neurons on time scales from milliseconds to a few seconds. STP is traditionally studied using intracellular recordings of postsynaptic potentials or currents evoked by presynaptic spikes. However, STP also affects the statistics of postsynaptic spikes. Here we present two model-based approaches for estimating synaptic weights and short-term plasticity from pre- and postsynaptic spike observations alone. We extend a generalized linear model (GLM) that predicts postsynaptic spiking as a function of the observed pre- and postsynaptic spikes and allow the connection strength (coupling term in the GLM) to vary as a function of time based on the history of presynaptic spikes. Our first model assumes that STP follows a Tsodyks-Markram description of vesicle depletion and recovery. In a second model, we introduce a functional description of STP where we estimate the coupling term as a biophysically unrestrained function of the presynaptic inter-spike intervals. To validate the models, we test the accuracy of STP estimation using the spiking of pre- and postsynaptic neurons with known synaptic dynamics. We first test our models using the responses of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons to simulated presynaptic input with different types of STP, and then use simulated spike trains to examine the effects of spike-frequency adaptation, stochastic vesicle release, spike sorting errors, and common input. We find that, using only spike observations, both model-based methods can accurately reconstruct the time-varying synaptic weights of presynaptic inputs for different types of STP. Our models also capture the differences in postsynaptic spike responses to presynaptic spikes following short vs long inter-spike intervals, similar to results reported for thalamocortical connections. These models may thus be useful tools for characterizing short-term plasticity from multi-electrode spike recordings in vivo.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Bi9xTDVaR8E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: kWIP: The &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mer weighted inner product, a &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; estimator of genetic similarity</title>

Modern genomics techniques generate overwhelming quantities of data. Extracting population genetic variation demands computationally efficient methods to determine genetic relatedness between individuals (or “samples”) in an unbiased manner, preferably &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt;. Rapid estimation of genetic relatedness directly from sequencing data has the potential to overcome reference genome bias, and to verify that individuals belong to the correct genetic lineage before conclusions are drawn using mislabelled, or misidentified samples. We present the &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mer Weighted Inner Product (kWIP), an assembly-, and alignment-free estimator of genetic similarity. kWIP combines a probabilistic data structure with a novel metric, the weighted inner product (WIP), to efficiently calculate pairwise similarity between sequencing runs from their &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mer counts. It produces a distance matrix, which can then be further analysed and visualised. Our method does not require prior knowledge of the underlying genomes and applications include establishing sample identity and detecting mix-up, non-obvious genomic variation, and population structure. We show that kWIP can reconstruct the true relatedness between samples from simulated populations. By re-analysing several published datasets we show that our results are consistent with marker-based analyses. kWIP is written in C++, licensed under the GNU GPL, and is available from https://github.com/kdmurray91/kwip.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tulTaPSFLkI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Minseung Kim, Ameen Eetemadi, Ilias Tagkopoulos&lt;/p&gt;

Protein inference, the identification of the protein set that is the origin of a given peptide profile, is a fundamental challenge in proteomics. We present DeepPep, a deep-convolutional neural network framework that predicts the protein set from a proteomics mixture, given the sequence universe of possible proteins and a target peptide profile. In its core, DeepPep quantifies the change in probabilistic score of peptide-spectrum matches in the presence or absence of a specific protein, hence selecting as candidate proteins those with the largest impact to the peptide profile. Application of the method across datasets argues for its competitive predictive ability (AUC of 0.80±0.18, AUPR of 0.84±0.28) in inferring proteins without need of peptide detectability on which the most competitive method rely. We find that the convolutional neural network architecture outperforms the traditional artificial neural network architectures without convolution layers in protein inference. We expect that similar deep learning architectures that allow learning nonlinear patterns can be further extended to problems in metagenome profiling and cell type inference. The source code of DeepPep and the benchmark datasets used in this study are available at https://deeppep.github.io/DeepPep/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZthcKVb-HhE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Few auditory functions are as important or as universal as the capacity for auditory spatial awareness (e.g., sound localization). That ability relies on sensitivity to acoustical cues—particularly interaural time and level differences (ITD and ILD)—that correlate with sound-source locations. Under nonspatial listening conditions, cortical sensitivity to ITD and ILD takes...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/_hwbuvpl8WQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>A sensory adaptation system that tunes chemoreceptor sensitivity enables motile Escherichia coli cells to track chemical gradients with high sensitivity over a wide dynamic range. Sensory adaptation involves feedback control of covalent receptor modifications by two enzymes: CheR, a methyltransferase, and CheB, a methylesterase. This study describes a CheR function...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/nzUNvD0q-m8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>l-Serine biosynthesis, a crucial metabolic process in most domains of life, is initiated by d-3-phosphoglycerate (d-3-PG) dehydrogenation, a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction catalyzed by d-3-PG dehydrogenase (SerA). d-2-Hydroxyglutarate (d-2-HG) is traditionally viewed as an abnormal metabolite associated with cancer and neurometabolic disorders.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Training Spiking Neural Networks for Cognitive Tasks: A Versatile Framework Compatible to Various Temporal Codes. (arXiv:1709.00583v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00583</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Conventional modeling approaches have found limitations in matching the
increasingly detailed neural network structures and dynamics recorded in
experiments to the diverse brain functionalities. On another approach, studies
have demonstrated to train spiking neural networks for simple functions using
supervised learning. Here, we introduce a modified SpikeProp learning
algorithm, which achieved better learning stability in different activity
states. In addition, we show biological realistic features such as lateral
connections and sparse activities can be included in the network. We
demonstrate the versatility of this framework by implementing three well-known
temporal codes for different types of cognitive tasks, which are MNIST digits
recognition, spatial coordinate transformation, and motor sequence generation.
Moreover, we find several characteristic features have evolved alongside the
task training, such as selective activity, excitatory-inhibitory balance, and
weak pair-wise correlation. The coincidence between the self-evolved and
experimentally observed features indicates their importance on the brain
functionality. Our results suggest a unified setting in which diverse cognitive
computations and mechanisms can be studied.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain plasticity, also known as neuroplasticity, is a fundamental mechanism
of neuronal adaptation in response to changes in the environment or due to
brain injury. In this review, we show our results about the effects of synaptic
plasticity on neuronal networks composed by Hodgkin-Huxley neurons. We show
that the final topology of the evolved network depends crucially on the ratio
between the strengths of the inhibitory and excitatory synapses. Excitation of
the same order of inhibition revels an evolved network that presents the
rich-club phenomenon, well known to exist in the brain. For initial networks
with considerably larger inhibitory strengths, we observe the emergence of a
complex evolved topology, where neurons sparsely connected to other neurons,
also a typical topology of the brain. The presence of noise enhances the
strength of both types of synapses, but if the initial network has synapses of
both natures with similar strengths. Finally, we show how the synchronous
behaviour of the evolved network will reflect its evolved topology.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: How nonlinear-type time-frequency analysis can help in sensing instantaneous heart rate and instantaneous respiratory rate from photoplethysmography in a reliable way. (arXiv:1701.02072v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02072</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02072</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the population of the noninvasive, economic, comfortable, and
easy-to-install photoplethysmography (PPG), it is still lacking a
mathematically rigorous and stable algorithm which is able to simultaneously
extract from a single-channel PPG signal the instantaneous heart rate (IHR) and
the instantaneous respiratory rate (IRR). In this paper, a novel algorithm
called deppG is provided to tackle this challenge. deppG is composed of two
theoretically solid nonlinear-type time-frequency analyses techniques, the
de-shape short time Fourier transform and the synchrosqueezing transform, which
allows us to extract the instantaneous physiological information from the PPG
signal in a reliable way. To test its performance, in addition to validating
the algorithm by a simulated signal and discussing the meaning of
&quot;instantaneous&quot;, the algorithm is applied to two publicly available batch
databases, the Capnobase and the ICASSP 2015 signal processing cup. The former
contains PPG signals relative to spontaneous or controlled breathing in static
patients, and the latter is made up of PPG signals collected from subjects
doing intense physical activities. The accuracies of the estimated IHR and IRR
are compared with the ones obtained by other methods, and represent the
state-of-the-art in this field of research. The results suggest the potential
of deppG to extract instantaneous physiological information from a signal
acquired from widely available wearable devices, even when a subject carries
out intense physical activities.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Knockdown of Hypocretin/Orexin Attenuates Extended-Access Cocaine Self-Administration in Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/184911v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/184911v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The hypocretin/orexin (HCRT) neuropeptide system regulates feeding, arousal state, stress responses, and reward, especially under conditions of enhanced motivational relevance. In particular, HCRT neurotransmission facilitates drug-seeking behavior in circumstances that demand increased effort and/or motivation to take the drug. The present study used a shRNA-encoding adeno-associated viral vector to knockdown Hcrt expression throughout the dorsal hypothalamus in adult rats and determine the role of HCRT in cocaine self-administration. Longterm Hcrt silencing did not impact cocaine self-administration under short-access conditions, but robustly attenuated cocaine intake during extended self-administration access, a model that mimics key features of compulsive cocaine-taking. In addition, Hcrt silencing decreased motivation for both cocaine and palatable food (i.e., sweetened condensed milk; SCM) under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement, but did not alter responding for SCM under a fixed ratio schedule. Importantly, Hcrt silencing did not affect food or water consumption, and had no consequence to general measures of arousal-dependent behaviors. At the molecular level, longterm Hcrt knockdown moderately reduced the downstream expression of dynorphin (DYN) and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) in the dorsal hypothalamus. These original findings support the hypothesis that HCRT neurotransmission promotes operant responding for both drug and non-drug rewards, preferentially under conditions requiring a high degree of motivation. Furthermore, the current study provides compelling evidence for the involvement of the HCRT system in cocaine self-administration also under low-effort conditions in rats allowed extended access, possibly via functional interactions with DYN and MCH signaling.</description>

	<description>While some individuals can defy the lure of temptation, many others find appetizing food irresistible. Using event-related potentials, we showed that individuals who find food-related images more motivationally relevant than erotic ones (&quot;sign-trackers&quot;) are more susceptible to cue-induced eating and, in the presence of a palatable food option, eat twice as much as individuals with the opposite brain reactivity profile (&quot;goal-trackers&quot;). These findings contribute to the understanding of the neurobiological basis of vulnerability to cue-induced behaviors.</description>

	<description>Learning from rewards and punishments is essential to survival, and facilitates flexible human behavior. It is widely appreciated that multiple cognitive and reinforcement learning systems contribute to behavior, but the nature of their interactions is elusive. Here, we leverage novel methods for extracting trial-by-trial indices of reinforcement learning (RL) and working memory (WM) in human electro- encephalography to reveal single trial computations beyond that afforded by behavior alone. Within-trial dynamics confirmed that increases in neural expectation were predictive of reduced neural surprise in the following feedback period, supporting central tenets of RL models. Cross-trial dynamics revealed a cooperative interplay between systems for learning, in which WM contributes expectations to guide RL, despite competition between systems during choice. Together, these results provide a deeper understanding of how multiple neural systems interact for learning and decision making, and facilitate analysis of their disruption in clinical populations.</description>

	<description>Neuroeconomics is the study of subjective preferences and value-based decision making. We present a novel framework that synthesizes findings from the literatures on neuroeconomics and creativity to provide a neurobiological description of creative cognition. It proposes that value-based decision-making processes and activity in the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) neuromodulatory system underlie creative cognition, as well as the large-scale brain network dynamics shown to be associated with creativity. This framework allows us to re-conceptualize creative cognition as driven by value-based decision making, in the process providing several falsifiable hypotheses that can further our understanding of creativity, decision making, and brain network dynamics.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Local temporal variability reflects functional network integration in the human brain: On the crucial role of the thalamus</title>

	<description>Local moment-to-moment variability exists at every level of neural organization, but its driving forces remain opaque. Based on animal work showing that within-region variability can be a primary function of synaptic input, we used fMRI to test in humans whether greater temporal variability in local brain regions was associated with higher functional network integration. We found that individuals with higher local temporal variability had a more integrated (lower-dimensional) network fingerprint, with temporal variability in the thalamus showing the strongest association with network dimensionality. Beyond animal findings showing that local variability should upregulate from thalamus to visual cortex, we found that local variability upregulated from thalamus to all structurally connected cortical targets. Critically, greater within-person thalamo-cortical upregulation was associated with higher integration in 12 of 13 examined networks. Our findings indicate that local variability primarily reflects functional integration, with the thalamus acting as a relay or modulator of variability in cortex.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/184531v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The contribution of oscillatory synchrony in the primate amygdala-prefrontal pathway to aversive learning remains unknown. We found increased power and phase synchrony in the theta range during aversive conditioning. The synchrony was linked to single-unit spiking and exhibited specific directionality between input and output measures in each region. Although it was correlated with the development of conditioned responses, it declined once the association stabilized. The results suggest that amygdala spikes aid to synchronize ACC activity and transfer error-signal information to support memory formation.</description>

	<description>In divided-attention tasks with two classes of target stimuli (e.g., auditory and visual), redundancy gains are typically observed if both targets are presented simultaneously, as compared with single-target presentation. Different models explain such redundant-signals effects, including race and coactivation models. Here we generalize one such coactivation model, the superposition model, and show that restricting this evidence accumulation process to a limited time interval, that is a temporal deadline, provides the model the ability to describe the detection behavior of two monkeys across a wide range of intensities and stimulus onset asynchronies. We present closed-form solutions for the mean absorption times and probabilities for the two-stage diffusion process with drift towards a single barrier in the presence of a temporal deadline.</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives&lt;/em&gt;: To characterize neurophysiological subcortical abnormalities in myoclonus-dystonia and their modulation by alcohol administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;: Cerebellar associative learning and basal ganglia-brainstem interaction were investigated in 17 myoclonus-dystonia patients with &lt;em&gt;epsilon-sarcoglycan&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SGCE)&lt;/em&gt; gene mutation and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls by means of classical eyeblink conditioning and blink reflex recovery cycle before and after alcohol intake resulting in a breath alcohol concentration of 0.08% (0.8 g/l). The alcohol responsiveness of clinical symptoms was evaluated by three blinded raters with a standardized video protocol and clinical rating scales including the Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale (UMRS) and the Burke Fahn Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;: Patients showed a significantly reduced number of conditioned eyeblink responses before alcohol administration compared to controls. While the conditioning response rate decreased under alcohol intake in controls, it increased in patients (ANOVA: alcohol state x Group p = 0.004). Blink reflex recovery cycle before and after alcohol intake did not differ between groups. Myoclonus improved significantly after alcohol intake (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.016). The severity of action myoclonus at baseline correlated negatively with the conditioning response in classical eyeblink conditioning in patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation&lt;/em&gt;: The combination of findings with reduced baseline acquisition of conditioned eyeblink responses and normal blink reflex recovery cycle in patients that improved significantly by alcohol intake suggests a crucial role of cerebellar networks in the generation of symptoms in these patients.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decreasing biomedical research support over the past decade has driven many talented young scientists to seek careers outside academia. In 2011, the Department of Neurology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine developed an internal grant review program (IGRP) to systematically review career development awards (CDAs) and research grants (e.g., R01s) for junior investigators prior to NIH submission. With IGRP implementation, we observed significant increases in the number of CDAs and R-grants awarded to junior investigators. Thus, internal grant review is an effective means for supporting junior faculty and help them retain their research roles within academia. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Concussion in adolescence and risk of multiple sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25036</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25036</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To assess whether concussion in childhood or adolescence is associated with subsequent multiple sclerosis risk. Previous research suggests an association but methodological limitations included retrospective data collection and small study populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: The national Swedish Patient (hospital diagnoses) and Multiple Sclerosis registers were used to identify all MS diagnoses up to 2012 among people born from 1964, when the Patient Register was established. The 7292 patients with multiple sclerosis were matched individually with 10 people without MS by sex, year of birth, age/vital status at multiple sclerosis diagnosis, and region of residence (county), resulting in a study population of 80212. Diagnoses of concussion and control diagnoses of broken limb bones were identified using the Patient Register from birth to age 10 years or from ages 11 to 20 years. Conditional logistic regression was used to examine associations with multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Concussion in adolescence was associated with a raised risk of multiple sclerosis, producing adjusted odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) of 1.22 (1.05-1.42, p=0.008) and 2.33 (1.35-4.04, p=0.002) for one diagnosis of concussion, or more than one diagnosis of concussion, respectively, compared with none. No notable association with multiple sclerosis was observed for concussion in childhood, or broken limb bones in childhood and adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Head trauma in adolescence, particularly if repeated, is associated with a raised risk of future multiple sclerosis, possibly due to initiation of an autoimmune process in the central nervous system. This further emphasises the importance of protecting young people from head injuries. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Independent circuits in basal ganglia and cortex for the processing of reward and precision feedback. (arXiv:1709.00374v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00374</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00374</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In order to understand human decision making it is necessary to understand
how the brain uses feedback to guide goal-directed behavior. The ventral
striatum (VS) appears to be a key structure in this function, responding
strongly to explicit reward feedback. However, recent results have also shown
striatal activity following correct task performance even in the absence of
feedback. This raises the possibility that, in addition to processing external
feedback, the dopamine-centered reward circuit might regulate endogenous
reinforcement signals, like those triggered by satisfaction in accurate task
performance. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test
this idea. Participants completed a simple task that garnered both reward
feedback and feedback about the precision of performance. Importantly, the
design was such that we could manipulate information about the precision of
performance within different levels of reward magnitude. Using parametric
modulation and functional connectivity analysis we identified brain regions
sensitive to each of these signals. Our results show a double dissociation:
frontal and posterior cingulate regions responded to explicit reward but were
insensitive to task precision, whereas the dorsal striatum - and putamen in
particular - was insensitive to reward but responded strongly to precision
feedback in reward-present trials. Both types of feedback activated the VS, and
sensitivity in this structure to precision feedback was predicted by
personality traits related to approach behavior and reward responsiveness. Our
findings shed new light on the role of specific brain regions in integrating
different sources of feedback to guide goal-directed behavior.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00339</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When searching for a target within an image our brain can adopt different
strategies, but which one does it choose? This question can be answered by
tracking the motion of the eye while it executes the task. Following many
individuals performing various search tasks we distinguish between two
competing strategies. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a model that
captures the interplay of the search strategies and allows us to create
artificial eye-tracking trajectories, which could be compared to the
experimental ones. Identifying the model parameters allows us to quantify the
strategy employed in terms of ensemble averages, characterizing each
experimental cohort. In this way we can discern with high sensitivity the
relation between the visual landscape and the average strategy, disclosing how
small variations in the image induce changes in the strategy.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the features of and mechanisms behind language learning can
provide insights into the general process of knowledge acquisition. Recent
methods from network science applied to language learning have advanced the
field, particularly by noting associations between densely connected words and
acquisition. However, the importance of sparse areas of the network, or
knowledge gaps, remains unexplored. Here we create a semantic feature network
in which words correspond to nodes and in which connections correspond to
semantic similarity. We develop a new analytical approach built on principles
of applied topology to query the prevalence of knowledge gaps, which we propose
manifest as cavities within the network. We detect topological cavities of
multiple dimensions in the growing semantic feature network of children ages 16
to 30 months. The pattern of cavity appearance matches that of a constrained
null model, created by predefining the affinity of each node for connections.
Furthermore, when word acquisition time is computed from children of mothers
with differing levels of education, we find that despite variation at the word
level, the global organization as measured by persistent homology remains
comparable. We show that topological properties of a node correlate with
filling in cavities better than simple lexical properties such as the length
and frequency of the corresponding word. Finally, we show that the large-scale
architecture of the semantic feature network is topologically accommodating to
many node orders. We discuss the importance of topology in language learning,
and we speculate that the formation and filling of knowledge gaps may be a
robust feature of knowledge acquisition.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The signatures of conscious access and phenomenology are consistent with large-scale brain communication at criticality. (arXiv:1709.00050v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Conscious awareness refers to the association of information processing in
the brain that is accompanied by subjective, reportable experiences. Current
models of conscious access propose that sufficiently strong sensory stimuli
ignite a global network of regions allowing further processing. The immense
number of possible experiences indicates that brain activity associated with
conscious awareness must be highly differentiated. However, information must
also be integrated to account for the unitary nature of consciousness. We
present a conceptual computational model that identifies conscious access with
self-sustained percolation in an anatomical network. We show that if activity
propagates at the critical threshold, the amount of integrated information
(Phi) is maximal after conscious access, as well as other related markers. We
also identify a posterior hotspot of regions with high levels of information
sharing during conscious access. Finally, competitive activity spreading
qualitatively describes the results of paradigms such as backward masking and
binocular rivalry.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Robustly representing inferential uncertainty in deep neural networks through sampling. (arXiv:1611.01639v4 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As deep neural networks (DNNs) are applied to increasingly challenging
problems, they will need to be able to represent their own uncertainty.
Modelling uncertainty is one of the key features of Bayesian methods. Using
Bernoulli dropout with sampling at prediction time has recently been proposed
as an efficient and well performing variational inference method for DNNs.
However, sampling from other multiplicative noise based variational
distributions has not been investigated in depth. We evaluated Bayesian DNNs
trained with Bernoulli or Gaussian multiplicative masking of either the units
(dropout) or the weights (dropconnect). We tested the calibration of the
probabilistic predictions of Bayesian fully connected and convolutional DNNs on
two visual inference tasks (MNIST and CIFAR-10). Sampling at prediction time
increased the quality of the DNNs' uncertainty estimates. Sampling weights,
whether Gaussian or Bernoulli, led to more accurate representation of
uncertainty compared to sampling of units. However, sampling units using either
Gaussian or Bernoulli dropout led to increased convolutional neural network
(CNN) classification accuracy. Based on these findings we used both Bernoulli
dropout and Gaussian dropconnect concurrently, which we show approximates the
use of a spike-and-slab variational distribution without increasing the number
of learned parameters. We found that spike-and-slab sampling efficiently
combined the advantages of the other methods: it classifies with high accuracy
and robustly represents inferential uncertainty for all tested architectures.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Systemic evidence of acute seizure-associated neuronal injury in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/184366v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/184366v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Patients with drug refractory temporal lobe epilepsy frequently accumulate cognitive impairment over time, suggesting neuronal loss induced by seizures. We measured serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), a neuronal injury marker, relative to levels of S100{beta}, a marker of glial injury, at 6 AM, 9 AM, noon, 3 PM, and 6 PM over the course of several days in 7 epilepsy patients and 4 healthy controls. All epilepsy patients exhibited significant deviations in NSE levels through time, and 4 of the epilepsy patients exhibited large sample entropy values and large signal variation metrics for NSE relative to S100{beta}. Controls did not exhibit such changes. Correlation analysis revealed that NSE levels were significantly elevated after clinical seizure events. There was also a highly significant relationship between increased EEG spike frequency and an increase in serum NSE levels measured 24 hours later. The detection of large but transient post-ictal increases in NSE suggests that even self-limited seizures may cause an injury to neurons that underlies cognitive decline in some patients. Post-ictal assessment of serum NSE may serve as a biomarker for measuring the efficacy of future acute neuroprotective strategies in epilepsy patients.</description>

	<description>Humans display anticipatory motor responses to minimize the adverse effects of predictable perturbations. A widely accepted explanation for this behavior relies on the notion of an inverse model that, learning from motor errors, anticipates corrective responses. Here, we propose and validate the alternative hypothesis that anticipatory control can be realized through a cascade of purely sensory predictions that drive the motor system, reflecting the causal sequence of the perceptual events preceding the error. We compare both hypotheses in a simulated anticipatory postural adjustment task. We observe that adaptation in the sensory domain, but not in the motor one, supports the robust and generalizable anticipatory control characteristic of biological systems. Our proposal unites the neurobiology of the cerebellum with the theory of active inference and provides a concrete implementation of its core tenets with great relevance both to our understanding of biological control systems and, possibly, to their emulation in complex artefacts.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Local context influences memory for emotional stimuli but not electrophysiological markers of emotion-dependent attention</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/184309v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/184309v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Emotional Enhancement of free recall can be context dependent. It is readily observed when emotional and neutral scenes are encoded and recalled together, in a &quot;mixed&quot; list, but diminishes when these scenes are encoded separately, in &quot;pure&quot; lists. We examined the hypothesis that this effect is due to differences of allocation of attention to neutral stimuli according to whether they are presented in mixed or pure lists, especially when encoding is intentional. Using picture stimuli that were controlled for semantic relatedness, our results contradicted this hypothesis. The amplitude of well-known electrophysiological markers of emotion-related attention, the Early Posterior Negativity (EPN), the Late Positive Potential (LPP), and the Slow Wave (SW), was higher for emotional stimuli. Crucially, the emotional modulation of these ERPs was insensitive to list context, observed equally in pure and mixed lists. Although list context did not modulate neural markers of emotion-related attention, list context did modulate the effect of emotion on free recall. The apparent decoupling of the emotional effects on attention and memory challenges existing hypotheses accounting for the emotional enhancement of memory. We close by discussing whether findings are more compatible with an alternative hypothesis, where the magnitude of emotional memory enhancement is, at least in part, a consequence of retrieval dynamics.</description>

	<description>Effective behaviour and cognition requires the ability to make predictions about the temporal properties of events, such as duration. It is well known that violations of temporal structure within sequences of stimuli lead to neurophysiological effects known as the (temporal) mismatch negativity (TMMN). However, previous studies investigating this phenomenon have typically presented successive stimulus intervals (i.e., durations) within a rhythmic structure, conflating the contributions of rhythmic temporal processing with those specific to duration. In a novel behavioural paradigm which extends the classic temporal oddball design, we examined the neurophysiological correlates of prediction violation under both rhythmically (isochronous) and arrhythmically (anisochronous) presented durations, in visual and auditory modalities. Using event-related potential (ERP), multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), and temporal generalisation analysis (TGA) analyses, we found evidence for common, and distinct neurophysiological responses related to duration predictions and their violation, across isochronous and anisochronous conditions. Further, using TGA we could directly compare processes underlying duration prediction violation across different modalities, despite differences in processing latency of audition and vision. We discovered a common set of neurophysiological responses that are elicited whenever a duration prediction is violated, regardless of presentation modality, indicating the existence of a supramodal duration prediction mechanism. Altogether, our data show that the human brain encodes predictions specifically about duration, in addition to those from rhythmic structure, and that the neural underpinnings of these predictions generalize across modalities. These findings support the idea that time perception is based on similar principles of inference as characterize &quot;predictive processing&quot; theories of perception.</description>

	<description>Physiological ageing affects brain structure and function impacting its morphology, connectivity and performance. However, at which extent brain-connectivity metrics reflect the age of an individual and whether treatments or lifestyle factors such as physical activity influence the age-connectivity match is still unclear. Here, we assessed the level of physical activity and collected brain images from healthy participants (N=155) ranging from 10 to 80 years to build functional (resting-state) and structural (tractography) connectivity matrices that were combined as connectivity descriptors. Connectivity descriptors were used to compute a maximum likelihood age estimator that was optimized by minimizing the mean absolute error. The connectivity-based estimated age, i.e. the brain-connectome age (BCA), was compared to the chronological age (ChA). Our results were threefold. First, we showed that ageing widely affects the structural-functional connectivity of multiple structures, such as the anterior part of the default mode network, basal ganglia, thalamus, insula, cingulum, hippocampus, parahippocampus, occipital cortex, fusiform, precuneus and temporal pole. Second, our analysis showed that the structure-function connectivity between basal ganglia and thalamus to orbitofrontal and frontal areas make a major contribution to age estimation. Third, we found that high levels of physical activity reduce BCA as compared to ChA, and vice versa, low levels increment it. In conclusion, the BCA model results highlight the impact of physical activity and the key role played by the connectivity between basal ganglia and thalamus to frontal areas on the process of healthy aging. Notably, the same methodology can be generally applied both to evaluate the impact of other factors and therapies on brain ageing, and to identify the structural-functional brain connectivity correlate of other biomarkers than ChA.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Low-intensity focused ultrasound alters the latency and spatial patterns of sensory-evoked cortical responses in vivo.</title>

	<description>The use of transcranial, low intensity focused ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging neuromodulation technology that shows promise for both therapeutic and research applications. Compared with other noninvasive neuromodulation approaches, key technical advantages include high lateral resolution of stimulation and deep penetration depth. However, empirically observed effects in vivo are diverse; for example, variations in sonication location and waveform can alternatively elicit putatively inhibitory or excitatory effects. At a fundamental level, it is unclear how FUS alters the function of neural circuits at the site of sonication. To address this knowledge gap, we developed an approach to optically interrogate the spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity in the cortex directly at the acoustic focus, thereby offering a glimpse into the local effects of FUS on distributed populations of neurons in vivo. Our experiments probed electrical activity through the use of voltage sensitive dyes (VSDs) and, in transgenic GCaMP6f mice, monitored associated Ca2+ responses. Our results directly demonstrate that low-intensity FUS adjusts both the kinetics and spatial patterns of sensory receptive fields at the acoustic focus in vivo. Although our experimental configuration limits interpretation to population activity, the use of VSDs ensures that the detected alterations reflect activity in cortical neurons, unobscured by signals in subcortical or laterally distant cortical regions. More generally, this optical measurement paradigm can be implemented to observe FUS-induced alterations in cortical representation with higher lateral resolution spatial versatility than is practical through more conventional electrode-based measurements. Our findings suggest that reports of FUS-induced sensory modulation in human studies may partly reflect alterations cortical representation and reactivity.</description>

	<description>Humans' and non-human animals' ability to process time on the scale of milliseconds and seconds is essential for adaptive behaviour. A central question of how brains keep track of time is how specific temporal information across different sensory modalities is. In the present study, we show that encoding of temporal intervals in auditory and visual modalities are qualitatively similar. Participants were instructed to reproduce intervals in the range from 750 ms to 1500 ms marked by auditory or visual stimuli. Our behavioural results suggest that, although participants were more accurate in reproducing intervals marked by auditory stimuli, there was a strong correlation in performance between modalities. Using multivariate pattern analysis in scalp EEG, we show that activity during late periods of the intervals was similar within and between modalities. Critically, we show that a multivariate pattern classifier was able to accurately predict the elapsed interval, even when trained on an interval marked by a stimulus of a different sensory modality. Taken together, our results suggest that, while there are differences in the processing of intervals marked by auditory and visual stimuli, they also share a common neural representation.</description>

	<description>Biologists establish the existence of experimental effects by applying treatments or interventions to biological entities or units, such as people, animals, slice preparations, or cells. When done appropriately, independent replication of the entity-intervention pair contributes to the sample size (N) and forms the basis of statistical inference. However, sometimes the appropriate entity-intervention pair may not be obvious, and the wrong choice can make an experiment worthless. We surveyed a random sample of published animal experiments from 2011 to 2016 where interventions were applied to parents but effects examined in the offspring, as regulatory authorities have provided clear guidelines on replication with such designs. We found that only 22% of studies (95% CI = 17% to 29%) replicated the correct entity-intervention pair and thus made valid statistical inferences. Approximately half of the studies (46%, 95% CI = 38% to 53%) had pseudoreplication while 32% (95% CI = 26% to 39%) provided insufficient information to make a judgement. Pseudoreplication artificially inflates the sample size, leading to more false positive results and inflating the apparent evidence supporting a scientific claim. It is hard for science to advance when so many experiments are poorly designed and analysed. We argue that distinguishing between biological units, experimental units, and observational units clarifies where replication should occur, describe the criteria for genuine replication, and provide guidelines for designing and analysing in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A topographic visual pathway into the central brain of Drosophila</title>

	<description>The visual system is characterized by a strict topographic organization from the retina towards multiple layers of synaptic integration. Recent studies in Drosophila have shown that in the transition from the optic lobes to the central brain, due to convergence of columnar neurons onto optic glomeruli, distinct synaptic units employed in the computation of different visual features, the retinotopic representation is lost in these circuits. However, functional imaging revealed a spatial representation of visual cues in the Drosophila central complex, raising the question about the underlying circuitry, which bypasses optic glomerulus convergence. While characterizing afferent arborizations within Drosophila visual glomeruli, we discovered a spatial segregation of topographic and non-topographic projections from distinct molecular classes of medulla projection neurons, medullo-tubercular (MeTu) neurons, into a specific central brain glomerulus, the anterior optic tubercle (AOTu). Single cell analysis revealed that topographic information is organized by ensembles of MeTu neurons (type 1), forming parallel channels within the AOTu, while a separate class of MeTu neurons (type 2) displays convergent projection, associated with a loss of spatial resolution. MeTu afferents in the AOTu synapse onto a matching topographic field of output projection neurons, these tubercular-bulbar (TuBu) neurons relay visual information towards dendritic fields of central complex ring neurons in the bulb neuropil. Within the bulb, neuronal proximity of the topographic AOTu map as well as channel identity is maintained despite the absence of a stereotyped map organization, providing the structural basis for spatial representation of visual information in the central complex (CX). TuBu neurons project onto dendritic fields of efferent ring neurons, where distinct sectors of the bulb correspond to a distinct ring domain in the ellipsoid body. We found a stereotypic circuitry for each analyzed TuBu class, thus the individual channels of peripheral topography are maintained in the central complex structure. Together with previous data showing rough topography within the lobula AOTu domain, our results on the organization of medulla projection neurons define the AOTu neuropil as the main relay station for spatial information from the optic lobes into the central brain.</description>

Modelling ionic channels represents a fundamental step towards developing biologically detailed neuron models. Until recently, the voltage-gated ion channels have been mainly modelled according to the formalism introduced by the seminal works of Hodgkin and Huxley (HH). However, following the continuing achievements in the biophysical and molecular comprehension of these pore-forming transmembrane proteins, the HH formalism turned out to carry limitations and inconsistencies in reproducing the ion-channels electrophysiological behaviour. At the same time, Markov-type kinetic models have been increasingly proven to successfully replicate both the electrophysiological and biophysical features of different ion channels. However, in order to model even the finest non-conducting molecular conformational change, they are often equipped with a considerable number of states and related transitions, which make them computationally heavy and less suitable for implementation in conductance-based neurons and large networks of those. In this purely modelling study we develop a Markov-type kinetic model for all human voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs). The model framework is detailed, unifying (i.e., it accounts for all ion-channel isoforms) and computationally efficient (i.e. with a minimal set of states and transitions). The electrophysiological data to be modelled are gathered from previously published studies on whole-cell patch-clamp experiments in mammalian cell lines heterologously expressing the human VGSC subtypes (from Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 to Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.9). By adopting a minimum sequence of states, and using the same state diagram for all the distinct isoforms, the model ensures the lightest computational load when used in neuron models and neural networks of increasing complexity. The transitions between the states are described by original ordinary differential equations, which represent the rate of the state transitions as a function of voltage (i.e., membrane potential). The kinetic model, developed in the NEURON simulation environment, appears to be the simplest and most parsimonious way for a detailed phenomenological description of the human VGSCs electrophysiological behaviour.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_o404RFqmDo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Understanding how neural populations encode sensory information thereby leading to perception and behavior (i.e., the neural code) remains an important problem in neuroscience. When investigating the neural code, one must take into account the fact that neural activities are not independent but are actually correlated with one another. Such correlations are seen ubiquitously and have a strong impact on neural coding. Here we investigated how differences in the antagonistic center-surround receptive field (RF) organization across three parallel sensory maps influence correlations between the activities of electrosensory pyramidal neurons. Using a model based on known anatomical differences in receptive field center size and overlap, we initially predicted large differences in correlated activity across the maps. However, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological recordings showed that, contrary to modeling predictions, electrosensory pyramidal neurons across all three segments displayed nearly identical correlations. To explain this surprising result, we incorporated the effects of RF surround in our model. By systematically varying both the RF surround gain and size relative to that of the RF center, we found that multiple RF structures gave rise to similar levels of correlation. In particular, incorporating known physiological differences in RF structure between the three maps in our model gave rise to similar levels of correlation. Our results show that RF center overlap alone does not determine correlations which has important implications for understanding how RF structure influences correlated neural activity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ty2LC2VNPl8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The capacity of pluripotent embryonic stem cells to differentiate into any cell type in the body makes them invaluable in the field of regenerative medicine. However, because of the complexity of both the core pluripotency network and the process of cell fate computation it is not yet possible to control the fate of stem cells. We present a theoretical model of stem cell fate computation that is based on Halley and Winkler’s Branching Process Theory (BPT) and on Greaves &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;.’s agent-based computer simulation derived from that theoretical model. BPT abstracts the complex production and action of a Transcription Factor (TF) into a single critical branching process that may dissipate, maintain, or become supercritical. Here we take the single TF model and extend it to multiple interacting TFs, and build an agent-based simulation of multiple TFs to investigate the dynamics of such coupled systems. We have developed the simulation and the theoretical model together, in an iterative manner, with the aim of obtaining a deeper understanding of stem cell fate computation, in order to influence experimental efforts, which may in turn influence the outcome of cellular differentiation. The model used is an example of self-organization and could be more widely applicable to the modelling of other complex systems. The simulation based on this model, though currently limited in scope in terms of the biology it represents, supports the utility of the Halley and Winkler’s branching process model in describing the behaviour of stem cell gene regulatory networks. Our simulation demonstrates three key features: (i) the existence of a critical value of the branching process parameter, dependent on the details of the cistrome in question; (ii) the ability of an active cistrome to “ignite” an otherwise fully dissipated cistrome, and drive it to criticality; (iii) how coupling cistromes together can reduce their critical branching parameter values needed to drive them to criticality.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/r1JHEeymEL0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A long tradition in theoretical neuroscience casts sensory processing in the
brain as the process of inferring the maximally consistent interpretations of
imperfect sensory input. Recently it has been shown that Gamma-band inhibition
can enable neural attractor networks to approximately carry out such a sampling
mechanism. In this paper we propose a novel neural network model based on
irregular gating inhibition, show analytically how it implements a Monte-Carlo
Markov Chain (MCMC) sampler, and describe how it can be used to model networks
of both neural attractors as well as of single spiking neurons. Finally we show
how this model applied to spiking neurons gives rise to a new putative
mechanism that could be used to implement stochastic synaptic weights in
biological neural networks and in neuromorphic hardware.

	<description>In mammals, acoustic information arises in the cochlea and is transmitted to the ventral cochlear nuclei (VCN). Three groups of VCN neurons extract different features from the firing of auditory nerve fibers and convey that information along separate pathways through the brainstem. Two of these pathways process temporal information: octopus cells detect coincident firing among auditory nerve fibers and transmit signals along monaural pathways, and bushy cells sharpen the encoding of fine structure and feed binaural pathways.</description>

	<description>During many real-life situations, multiple factors interact to determine threat level. Importantly, their interaction evolves over time, such that aversive anticipation changes dynamically. Studies have taken initial strides at understanding how factors such as proximity and direction influence responses to threat. However, by and large, these studies have investigated the contributions of independent threat-related factors. Therefore, little is known about how they dynamically interact during aversive anticipation. To address these gaps, in the current functional MRI study involving healthy adult human volunteers, we investigated interactions between proximity, direction, and speed during a dynamic threat-of-shock paradigm. Whereas some brain regions tracked individual threat-related factors, others were also sensitive to combinations of these variables, including their three-way combination. For example, the hippocampus was particularly sensitive to threat proximity. In contrast, among others, signals in the anterior insula and PAG tracked the interaction of all three factors. In the right amygdala, we observed a proximity by direction interaction, but in the opposite direction as the anterior insula and PAG; retreat vs. approach responses were stronger when threat was closer compared to farther. Thus, in the context of our task, intriguingly, it appears that the amygdala provided a safety-related response, especially when threat was closer. Taken together, our study refines our understanding of the brain mechanisms involved during aversive anticipation in human brain. Importantly, it emphasizes that threat processing should be understood in a manner that is both context sensitive and dynamic.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Electrophysiological indices reflect switches between Bayesian and heuristic strategies in perceptual learning</title>

	<description>Given finite cognitive resources, agents should allocate these to maximise desirable outcomes while minimising cognitive effort. This trade-off has often been studied as a competition between Bayesian inference and 'fast-and-frugal' heuristic strategies. An important open question in this regard is whether utilisation of Bayesian inference is dependent upon motivational state, and how this is reflected in the brain. We recorded electroencephalography from 23 participants performing a perceptual learning task with both monetary and a non-monetary instructive feedback conditions. Using model-based cluster analysis, we found that only participants who switched between a Bayesian and a heuristic strategy showed worse performance for instructive than monetary feedback, whereas participants who consistently employed Bayesian inference showed equivalent performance in both feedback conditions. This pattern of behavioural results was mirrored by differences in neural encoding of feedback in two event-related potential components: the P3, and the late positive potential. These findings suggest that use of Bayesian inference in perceptual learning may depend on motivational state.</description>

	<description>A neural system has the ability to flexibly perform many tasks, but the underlying mechanism cannot be elucidated in traditional experimental and modeling studies designed for one task at a time. Here, we trained a single network model to perform 20 cognitive tasks that may involve working memory, decision-making, categorization and inhibitory control. We found that after training, recurrent units developed into clusters that are functionally specialized for various cognitive processes. We introduce a measure to quantify relationships between single-unit neural representations of tasks, and report five distinct types of such relationships that can be tested experimentally. Surprisingly, our network developed compositionality of task representations, a critical feature for cognitive flexibility, whereby one task can be performed by recombining instructions for other tasks. Finally, we demonstrate how the network could learn multiple tasks sequentially. This work provides a computational platform to investigate neural representations of many cognitive tasks.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Brain structure mediates the association between height and cognitive ability</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/183525v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Height and general cognitive ability (GCA) are positively associated, but the underlying mechanisms of this relationship are unclear. We used a sample of 515 middle-aged male twins with structural magnetic resonance imaging data to study if the association between height and cognitive ability is mediated by cortical size. We used genetically, ontogenetically and phylogenetically distinct cortical metrics of cortical surface area (SA) and cortical thickness (CT). Our results indicate that the well-replicated height-GCA association is accounted for by individual differences in total cortical SA (highly heritable metric related to global brain size), and not mean CT, and that the genetic association between SA and GCA underlies the phenotypic height-GCA relationship.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A computational model of spatio-temporal cardiac intracellular calcium handling with realistic structure and spatial flux distribution from sarcoplasmic reticulum and t-tubule reconstructions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Michael A. Colman, Christian Pinali, Andrew W. Trafford, Henggui Zhang, Ashraf Kitmitto&lt;/p&gt;

Intracellular calcium cycling is a vital component of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. The key structures responsible for controlling calcium dynamics are the cell membrane (comprising the surface sarcolemma and transverse-tubules), the intracellular calcium store (the sarcoplasmic reticulum), and the co-localisation of these two structures to form dyads within which calcium-induced-calcium-release occurs. The organisation of these structures tightly controls intracellular calcium dynamics. In this study, we present a computational model of intracellular calcium cycling in three-dimensions (3-D), which incorporates high resolution reconstructions of these key regulatory structures, attained through imaging of tissue taken from the sheep left ventricle using serial block face scanning electron microscopy. An approach was developed to model the sarcoplasmic reticulum structure at the whole-cell scale, by reducing its full 3-D structure to a 3-D network of one-dimensional strands. The model reproduces intracellular calcium dynamics during control pacing and reveals the high-resolution 3-D spatial structure of calcium gradients and intracellular fluxes in both the cytoplasm and sarcoplasmic reticulum. We also demonstrated the capability of the model to reproduce potentially pro-arrhythmic dynamics under perturbed conditions, pertaining to calcium-transient alternans and spontaneous release events. Comparison with idealised cell models emphasised the importance of structure in determining calcium gradients and controlling the spatial dynamics associated with calcium-transient alternans, wherein the probabilistic nature of dyad activation and recruitment was constrained. The model was further used to highlight the criticality in calcium spark propagation in relation to inter-dyad distances. The model presented provides a powerful tool for future investigation of structure-function relationships underlying physiological and pathophysiological intracellular calcium handling phenomena at the whole-cell. The approach allows for the first time direct integration of high-resolution images of 3-D intracellular structures with models of calcium cycling, presenting the possibility to directly assess the functional impact of structural remodelling at the cellular scale.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/l1xtSADDZ4s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mouth-clicks used by blind expert human echolocators – signal description and model based signal synthesis</title>

Echolocation is the ability to use sound-echoes to infer spatial information about the environment. Some blind people have developed extraordinary proficiency in echolocation using mouth-clicks. The first step of human biosonar is the transmission (mouth click) and subsequent reception of the resultant sound through the ear. Existing head-related transfer function (HRTF) data bases provide descriptions of reception of the resultant sound. For the current report, we collected a large database of click emissions with three blind people expertly trained in echolocation, which allowed us to perform unprecedented analyses. Specifically, the current report provides the first ever description of the spatial distribution (i.e. beam pattern) of human expert echolocation transmissions, as well as spectro-temporal descriptions at a level of detail not available before. Our data show that transmission levels are fairly constant within a 60° cone emanating from the mouth, but levels drop gradually at further angles, more than for speech. In terms of spectro-temporal features, our data show that emissions are consistently very brief (~3ms duration) with peak frequencies 2-4kHz, but with energy also at 10kHz. This differs from previous reports of durations 3-15ms and peak frequencies 2-8kHz, which were based on less detailed measurements. Based on our measurements we propose to model transmissions as sum of monotones modulated by a decaying exponential, with angular attenuation by a modified cardioid. We provide model parameters for each echolocator. These results are a step towards developing computational models of human biosonar. For example, in bats, spatial and spectro-temporal features of emissions have been used to derive and test model based hypotheses about behaviour. The data we present here suggest similar research opportunities within the context of human echolocation. Relatedly, the data are a basis to develop synthetic models of human echolocation that could be virtual (i.e. simulated) or real (i.e. loudspeaker, microphones), and which will help understanding the link between physical principles and human behaviour.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MUsIJbXVblY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Continual One-Shot Learning of Hidden Spike-Patterns with Neural Network Simulation Expansion and STDP Convergence Predictions. (arXiv:1708.09072v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09072</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09072</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a constructive algorithm that achieves successful
one-shot learning of hidden spike-patterns in a competitive detection task. It
has previously been shown (Masquelier et al., 2008) that spike-timing-dependent
plasticity (STDP) and lateral inhibition can result in neurons competitively
tuned to repeating spike-patterns concealed in high rates of overall
presynaptic activity. One-shot construction of neurons with synapse weights
calculated as estimates of converged STDP outcomes results in immediate
selective detection of hidden spike-patterns. The capability of continual
learning is demonstrated through the successful one-shot detection of new sets
of spike-patterns introduced after long intervals in the simulation time.
Simulation expansion (Lightheart et al., 2013) has been proposed as an approach
to the development of constructive algorithms that are compatible with
simulations of biological neural networks. A simulation of a biological neural
network may have orders of magnitude fewer neurons and connections than the
related biological neural systems; therefore, simulated neural networks can be
assumed to be a subset of a larger neural system. The constructive algorithm is
developed using simulation expansion concepts to perform an operation
equivalent to the exchange of neurons between the simulation and the larger
hypothetical neural system. The dynamic selection of neurons to simulate within
a larger neural system (hypothetical or stored in memory) may be a starting
point for a wide range of developments and applications in machine learning and
the simulation of biology.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Balance of excitation and inhibition determines 1/f power spectrum in neuronal networks. (arXiv:1708.09042v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09042</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09042</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The $1/f$-like decay observed in the power spectrum of electro-physiological
signals, along with scale-free statistics of the so-called neuronal avalanches,
constitute evidences of criticality in neuronal systems. Recent in vitro
studies have shown that avalanche dynamics at criticality corresponds to some
specific balance of excitation and inhibition, thus suggesting that this is a
basic feature of the critical state of neuronal networks. In particular, a lack
of inhibition significantly alters the temporal structure of the spontaneous
avalanche activity and leads to an anomalous abundance of large avalanches.
Here we study the relationship between network inhibition and the scaling
exponent $\beta$ of the power spectral density (PSD) of avalanche activity in a
neuronal network model inspired in Self-Organized Criticality (SOC). We find
that this scaling exponent depends on the percentage of inhibitory synapses and
tends to the value $\beta = 1$ for a percentage of about 30%. More
specifically, $\beta$ is close to $2$, namely brownian noise, for purely
excitatory networks and decreases towards values in the interval $[1,1.4]$ as
the percentage of inhibitory synapses ranges between 20 and 30%, in agreement
with experimental findings. These results indicate that the level of inhibition
affects the frequency spectrum of resting brain activity and suggest the
analysis of the PSD scaling behavior as a possible tool to study pathological
conditions.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dystroglycan Maintains Inner Limiting Membrane Integrity to Coordinate Retinal Development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8559?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Proper neural circuit formation requires the precise regulation of neuronal migration, axon guidance, and dendritic arborization. Mutations affecting the function of the transmembrane glycoprotein dystroglycan cause a form of congenital muscular dystrophy that is frequently associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Despite its importance in brain development, the role of dystroglycan in regulating retinal development remains poorly understood. Using a mouse model of dystroglycanopathy (&lt;i&gt;ISPD&lt;sup&gt;L79*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) and conditional &lt;i&gt;dystroglycan&lt;/i&gt; mutants of both sexes, we show that dystroglycan is critical for the proper migration, axon guidance, and dendritic stratification of neurons in the inner retina. Using genetic approaches, we show that dystroglycan functions in neuroepithelial cells as an extracellular scaffold to maintain the integrity of the retinal inner limiting membrane. Surprisingly, despite the profound disruptions in inner retinal circuit formation, spontaneous retinal activity is preserved. These results highlight the importance of dystroglycan in coordinating multiple aspects of retinal development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The extracellular environment plays a critical role in coordinating neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth during neural circuit development. The transmembrane glycoprotein dystroglycan functions as a receptor for multiple extracellular matrix proteins and its dysfunction leads to a form of muscular dystrophy frequently associated with neurodevelopmental defects. Our results demonstrate that dystroglycan is required for maintaining the structural integrity of the inner limiting membrane (ILM) in the developing retina. In the absence of functional dystroglycan, ILM degeneration leads to defective migration, axon guidance, and mosaic spacing of neurons and a loss of multiple neuron types during retinal development. These results demonstrate that disorganization of retinal circuit development is a likely contributor to visual dysfunction in patients with dystroglycanopathy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Frontoparietal Structural Connectivity in Childhood Predicts Development of Functional Connectivity and Reasoning Ability: A Large-Scale Longitudinal Investigation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8549?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8549?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prior research points to a positive concurrent relationship between reasoning ability and both frontoparietal structural connectivity (SC) as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (Tamnes et al., 2010) and frontoparietal functional connectivity (FC) as measured by fMRI (Cocchi et al., 2014). Further, recent research demonstrates a link between reasoning ability and FC of two brain regions in particular: rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) and the inferior parietal lobe (IPL) (Wendelken et al., 2016). Here, we sought to investigate the concurrent and dynamic, lead–lag relationships among frontoparietal SC, FC, and reasoning ability in humans. To this end, we combined three longitudinal developmental datasets with behavioral and neuroimaging data from 523 male and female participants between 6 and 22 years of age. Cross-sectionally, reasoning ability was most strongly related to FC between RLPFC and IPL in adolescents and adults, but to frontoparietal SC in children. Longitudinal analysis revealed that RLPFC–IPL SC, but not FC, was a positive predictor of future changes in reasoning ability. Moreover, we found that RLPFC–IPL SC at one time point positively predicted future changes in RLPFC–IPL FC, whereas, in contrast, FC did not predict future changes in SC. Our results demonstrate the importance of strong white matter connectivity between RLPFC and IPL during middle childhood for the subsequent development of both robust FC and good reasoning ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The human capacity for reasoning develops substantially during childhood and has a profound impact on achievement in school and in cognitively challenging careers. Reasoning ability depends on communication between lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices. Therefore, to understand how this capacity develops, we examined the dynamic relationships over time among white matter tracts connecting frontoparietal cortices (i.e., structural connectivity, SC), coordinated frontoparietal activation (functional connectivity, FC), and reasoning ability in a large longitudinal sample of subjects 6–22 years of age. We found that greater frontoparietal SC in childhood predicts future increases in both FC and reasoning ability, demonstrating the importance of white matter development during childhood for subsequent brain and cognitive functioning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Selective Phosphorylation of AMPA Receptor Contributes to the Network of Long-Term Potentiation in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8534?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Phosphorylation of AMPA receptor GluA1 plays important roles in synaptic potentiation. Most previous studies have been performed in the hippocampus, while the roles of GluA1 phosphorylation in the cortex remain unknown. Here we investigated the involvement of the phosphorylation of GluA1 in the LTP in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) using mice with a GluA1 knock-in mutation at the PKA phosphorylation site serine 845 (s845A) or CaMKII/PKC phosphorylation site serine 831 (s831A). The network LTP, which is constructed by multiple recordings of LTP at different locations within the ACC, was also investigated. We found that the expression of LTP and network LTP was significantly impaired in the s845A mice, but not in the s831A mice. By contrast, basal synaptic transmission and NMDA receptor-mediated responses were not affected. Furthermore, to uncover potential information under the current acquired data, a new method for reconstruction and better visualization of the signals was developed to observe the spatial localizations and dynamic temporal changes of fEPSP signals and multiple LTP responses within the ACC circuit. Our results provide strong evidence that PKA phosphorylation of the GluA1 is important for the network LTP expression in the ACC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Previous studies have shown that PKA and PKC phosphorylation of AMPA receptor GluA1 plays critical roles in LTP in the hippocampus, while the roles of GluA1 phosphorylation in the cortex remain unknown. In the present study, by combining a 64-channel multielectrode system and a novel analysis and visualization method, we observed the accurate spatial localization and dynamic temporal changes of network fEPSP signals and LTP responses within the ACC circuit and found that PKA phosphorylation, but not PKC phosphorylation, of the GluA1 is required for LTP in the ACC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Drosophila Nociceptive Sensitization Requires BMP Signaling via the Canonical SMAD Pathway</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8524?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8524?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nociceptive sensitization is a common feature in chronic pain, but its basic cellular mechanisms are only partially understood. The present study used the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; model system and a candidate gene approach to identify novel components required for modulation of an injury-induced nociceptive sensitization pathway presumably downstream of Hedgehog. This study demonstrates that RNAi silencing of a member of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway, Decapentaplegic (Dpp), specifically in the Class IV multidendritic nociceptive neuron, significantly attenuated ultraviolet injury-induced sensitization. Furthermore, overexpression of Dpp in Class IV neurons was sufficient to induce thermal hypersensitivity in the absence of injury. The requirement of various BMP receptors and members of the SMAD signal transduction pathway in nociceptive sensitization was also demonstrated. The effects of BMP signaling were shown to be largely specific to the sensitization pathway and not associated with changes in nociception in the absence of injury or with changes in dendritic morphology. Thus, the results demonstrate that Dpp and its pathway play a crucial and novel role in nociceptive sensitization. Because the BMP family is so strongly conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates, it seems likely that the components analyzed in this study represent potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of chronic pain in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This report provides a genetic analysis of primary nociceptive neuron mechanisms that promote sensitization in response to injury. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; larvae whose primary nociceptive neurons were reduced in levels of specific components of the BMP signaling pathway, were injured and then tested for nocifensive responses to a normally subnoxious stimulus. Results suggest that nociceptive neurons use the BMP2/4 ligand, along with identified receptors and intracellular transducers to transition to a sensitized state. These findings are consistent with the observation that BMP receptor hyperactivation correlates with bone abnormalities and pain sensitization in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (Kitterman et al., 2012). Because nociceptive sensitization is associated with chronic pain, these findings indicate that human BMP pathway components may represent targets for novel pain-relieving drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Feedback Inhibition Shapes Emergent Computational Properties of Cortical Microcircuit Motifs</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8511?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical microcircuits are very complex networks, but they are composed of a relatively small number of stereotypical motifs. Hence, one strategy for throwing light on the computational function of cortical microcircuits is to analyze emergent computational properties of these stereotypical microcircuit motifs. We are addressing here the question how spike timing-dependent plasticity shapes the computational properties of one motif that has frequently been studied experimentally: interconnected populations of pyramidal cells and parvalbumin-positive inhibitory cells in layer 2/3. Experimental studies suggest that these inhibitory neurons exert some form of divisive inhibition on the pyramidal cells. We show that this data-based form of feedback inhibition, which is softer than that of winner-take-all models that are commonly considered in theoretical analyses, contributes to the emergence of an important computational function through spike timing-dependent plasticity: The capability to disentangle superimposed firing patterns in upstream networks, and to represent their information content through a sparse assembly code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We analyze emergent computational properties of a ubiquitous cortical microcircuit motif: populations of pyramidal cells that are densely interconnected with inhibitory neurons. Simulations of this model predict that sparse assembly codes emerge in this microcircuit motif under spike timing-dependent plasticity. Furthermore, we show that different assemblies will represent different hidden sources of upstream firing activity. Hence, we propose that spike timing-dependent plasticity enables this microcircuit motif to perform a fundamental computational operation on neural activity patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The structure in cortical microcircuits deviates from what would be expected in a purely random network, which has been seen as evidence of clustering. To address this issue, we sought to reproduce the nonrandom features of cortical circuits by considering several distinct classes of network topology, including clustered networks, networks with distance-dependent connectivity, and those with broad degree distributions. To our surprise, we found that all of these qualitatively distinct topologies could account equally well for all reported nonrandom features despite being easily distinguishable from one another at the network level. This apparent paradox was a consequence of estimating network properties given only small sample sizes. In other words, networks that differ markedly in their global structure can look quite similar locally. This makes inferring network structure from small sample sizes, a necessity given the technical difficulty inherent in simultaneous intracellular recordings, problematic. We found that a network statistic called the sample degree correlation (SDC) overcomes this difficulty. The SDC depends only on parameters that can be estimated reliably given small sample sizes and is an accurate fingerprint of every topological family. We applied the SDC criterion to data from rat visual and somatosensory cortex and discovered that the connectivity was not consistent with any of these main topological classes. However, we were able to fit the experimental data with a more general network class, of which all previous topologies were special cases. The resulting network topology could be interpreted as a combination of physical spatial dependence and nonspatial, hierarchical clustering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The connectivity of cortical microcircuits exhibits features that are inconsistent with a simple random network. Here, we show that several classes of network models can account for this nonrandom structure despite qualitative differences in their global properties. This apparent paradox is a consequence of the small numbers of simultaneously recorded neurons in experiment: when inferred via small sample sizes, many networks may be indistinguishable despite being globally distinct. We develop a connectivity measure that successfully classifies networks even when estimated locally with a few neurons at a time. We show that data from rat cortex is consistent with a network in which the likelihood of a connection between neurons depends on spatial distance and on nonspatial, asymmetric clustering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Visual Perceptual Echo Reflects Learning of Regularities in Rapid Luminance Sequences</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8486?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A novel neural signature of active visual processing has recently been described in the form of the &quot;perceptual echo&quot;, in which the cross-correlation between a sequence of randomly fluctuating luminance values and occipital electrophysiological signals exhibits a long-lasting periodic (~100 ms cycle) reverberation of the input stimulus (VanRullen and Macdonald, 2012). As yet, however, the mechanisms underlying the perceptual echo and its function remain unknown. Reasoning that natural visual signals often contain temporally predictable, though nonperiodic features, we hypothesized that the perceptual echo may reflect a periodic process associated with regularity learning. To test this hypothesis, we presented subjects with successive repetitions of a rapid nonperiodic luminance sequence, and examined the effects on the perceptual echo, finding that echo amplitude linearly increased with the number of presentations of a given luminance sequence. These data suggest that the perceptual echo reflects a neural signature of regularity learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when a set of repeated sequences was followed by a sequence with inverted luminance polarities, the echo amplitude decreased to the same level evoked by a novel stimulus sequence. Crucially, when the original stimulus sequence was re-presented, the echo amplitude returned to a level consistent with the number of presentations of this sequence, indicating that the visual system retained sequence-specific information, for many seconds, even in the presence of intervening visual input. Altogether, our results reveal a previously undiscovered regularity learning mechanism within the human visual system, reflected by the perceptual echo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; How the brain encodes and learns fast-changing but nonperiodic visual input remains unknown, even though such visual input characterizes natural scenes. We investigated whether the phenomenon of &quot;perceptual echo&quot; might index such learning. The perceptual echo is a long-lasting reverberation between a rapidly changing visual input and evoked neural activity, apparent in cross-correlations between occipital EEG and stimulus sequences, peaking in the alpha (~10 Hz) range. We indeed found that perceptual echo is enhanced by repeatedly presenting the same visual sequence, indicating that the human visual system can rapidly and automatically learn regularities embedded within fast-changing dynamic sequences. These results point to a previously undiscovered regularity learning mechanism, operating at a rate defined by the alpha frequency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: N1-Src Kinase Is Required for Primary Neurogenesis in Xenopus tropicalis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The presence of the neuronal-specific N1-Src splice variant of the C-Src tyrosine kinase is conserved through vertebrate evolution, suggesting an important role in complex nervous systems. Alternative splicing involving an &lt;i&gt;N1-Src&lt;/i&gt;-specific microexon leads to a 5 or 6 aa insertion into the SH3 domain of Src. A prevailing model suggests that N1-Src regulates neuronal differentiation via cytoskeletal dynamics in the growth cone. Here we investigated the role of n1-src in the early development of the amphibian &lt;i&gt;Xenopus tropicalis&lt;/i&gt;, and found that &lt;i&gt;n1-src&lt;/i&gt; expression is regulated in embryogenesis, with highest levels detected during the phases of primary and secondary neurogenesis. &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization analysis, using locked nucleic acid oligo probes complementary to the &lt;i&gt;n1-src&lt;/i&gt; microexon, indicates that &lt;i&gt;n1-src&lt;/i&gt; expression is highly enriched in the open neural plate during neurula stages and in the neural tissue of adult frogs. Given the &lt;i&gt;n1-src&lt;/i&gt; expression pattern, we investigated a possible role for n1-src in neurogenesis. Using splice site-specific antisense morpholino oligos, we inhibited &lt;i&gt;n1-src&lt;/i&gt; splicing, while preserving &lt;i&gt;c-src&lt;/i&gt; expression. Differentiation of neurons in the primary nervous system is reduced in &lt;i&gt;n1-src&lt;/i&gt;-knockdown embryos, accompanied by a severely impaired touch response in later development. These data reveal an essential role for n1-src in amphibian neural development and suggest that alternative splicing of C-Src in the developing vertebrate nervous system evolved to regulate neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases acts in signaling pathways that regulate cell migration, cell adhesion, and proliferation. Srcs are also enriched in the brain, where they play key roles in neuronal development and neurotransmission. Vertebrates have evolved a neuron-specific splice variant of C-Src, N1-Src, which differs from C-Src by just 5 or 6 aa. N1-Src is poorly understood and its high similarity to C-Src has made it difficult to delineate its function. Using antisense knockdown of the &lt;i&gt;n1-src&lt;/i&gt; microexon, we have studied neuronal development in the &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; embryo in the absence of &lt;i&gt;n1-src&lt;/i&gt;, while preserving &lt;i&gt;c-src&lt;/i&gt;. Loss of n1-src causes a striking absence of primary neurogenesis, implicating n1-src in the specification of neurons early in neural development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Membrane-Associated Effects of Glucocorticoid on BACE1 Upregulation and A{beta} Generation: Involvement of Lipid Raft-Mediated CREB Activation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8459?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glucocorticoid has been widely accepted to induce Alzheimer's disease, but the nongenomic effect of glucocorticoid on amyloid β (Aβ) generation has yet to be studied. Here, we investigated the effect of the nongenomic pathway induced by glucocorticoid on amyloid precursor protein processing enzymes as well as Aβ production using male ICR mice and human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells. Mice groups exposed to restraint stress or intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ showed impaired cognition, decreased intracellular glucocorticoid receptor (GR) level, but elevated level of membrane GR (mGR). In this respect, we identified the mGR-dependent pathway evoked by glucocorticoid using impermeable cortisol conjugated to BSA (cortisol-BSA) on SK-N-MC cells. Cortisol-BSA augmented the expression of β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the level of C-terminal fragment β of amyloid precursor protein (C99) and Aβ production, which were maintained even after blocking intracellular GR. We also found that cortisol-BSA enhanced the interaction between mGR and Gαs, which colocalized in the lipid raft. The subsequently activated CREB by cortisol-BSA bound to the CRE site of the BACE1 promoter increasing its expression, which was downregulated by inhibiting CBP. Consistently, blocking CBP attenuated cognitive impairment and Aβ production induced by corticosterone treatment or intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ more efficiently than inhibiting intracellular GR in mice. In conclusion, glucocorticoid couples mGR with Gαs and triggers cAMP-PKA-CREB axis dependent on the lipid raft to stimulate BACE1 upregulation and Aβ generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been growing sharply and stress is considered as the major environment factor of AD. Glucocorticoid is the primarily responsive factor to stress and is widely known to induce AD. However, most AD patients usually have impaired genomic pathway of glucocorticoid due to intracellular glucocorticoid receptor deficiency. In this respect, the genomic mechanism of glucocorticoid faces difficulties in explaining the consistent amyloid β (Aβ) production. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the novel pathway of glucocorticoid on Aβ generation to find a more selective therapeutic approach to AD patients. In this study, we revealed the importance of nongenomic pathway induced by glucocorticoid where membrane glucocorticoid receptor plays an important role in Aβ formation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Genome Stability by DNA Polymerase {beta} in Neural Progenitors Contributes to Neuronal Differentiation in Cortical Development</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;DNA repair is crucial for genome stability in the developing cortex, as somatic &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; mutations cause neurological disorders. However, how DNA repair contributes to neuronal development is largely unknown. To address this issue, we studied the spatiotemporal roles of DNA polymerase β (Polβ), a key enzyme in DNA base excision repair pathway, in the developing cortex using distinct forebrain-specific conditional knock-out mice, &lt;i&gt;Emx1-Cre/Pol&lt;/i&gt;β&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Nex-Cre/Pol&lt;/i&gt;β&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Polβ expression was absent in both neural progenitors and postmitotic neurons in &lt;i&gt;Emx1-Cre/Pol&lt;/i&gt;β&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, whereas only postmitotic neurons lacked Polβ expression in &lt;i&gt;Nex-Cre/Pol&lt;/i&gt;β&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. We found that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were frequently detected during replication in cortical progenitors of &lt;i&gt;Emx1-Cre/Pol&lt;/i&gt;β&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Increased DSBs remained in postmitotic cells, which resulted in p53-mediated neuronal apoptosis. This neuronal apoptosis caused thinning of the cortical plate, although laminar structure was normal. In addition, accumulated DSBs also affected growth of corticofugal axons but not commissural axons. These phenotypes were not observed in &lt;i&gt;Nex-Cre/Pol&lt;/i&gt;β&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Moreover, cultured Polβ-deficient neural progenitors exhibited higher sensitivity to the base-damaging agent methylmethanesulfonate, resulting in enhanced DSB formation. Similar damage was found by vitamin C treatment, which induces TET1-mediated DNA demethylation via 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. Together, genome stability mediated by Polβ-dependent base excision repair is crucial for the competence of neural progenitors, thereby contributing to neuronal differentiation in cortical development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; DNA repair is crucial for development of the nervous system. However, how DNA polymerase β (Polβ)-dependent DNA base excision repair pathway contributes to the process is still unknown. We found that loss of Polβ in cortical progenitors rather than postmitotic neurons led to catastrophic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during replication and p53-mediated neuronal apoptosis, which resulted in thinning of the cortical plate. The DSBs also affected corticofugal axon growth in surviving neurons. Moreover, induction of base damage and DNA demethylation intermediates in the genome increased DSBs in cultured Polβ-deficient neural progenitors. Thus, genome stability by Polβ-dependent base excision repair in neural progenitors is required for the viability and differentiation of daughter neurons in the developing nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Segregation of Visual Response Properties in the Mouse Superior Colliculus and Their Modulation during Locomotion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8428?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The superior colliculus (SC) receives direct input from the retina and integrates it with information about sound, touch, and state of the animal that is relayed from other parts of the brain to initiate specific behavioral outcomes. The superficial SC layers (sSC) contain cells that respond to visual stimuli, whereas the deep SC layers (dSC) contain cells that also respond to auditory and somatosensory stimuli. Here, we used a large-scale silicon probe recording system to examine the visual response properties of SC cells of head-fixed and alert male mice. We found cells with diverse response properties including: (1) orientation/direction-selective (OS/DS) cells with a firing rate that is suppressed by drifting sinusoidal gratings (negative OS/DS cells); (2) suppressed-by-contrast cells; (3) cells with complex-like spatial summation nonlinearity; and (4) cells with Y-like spatial summation nonlinearity. We also found specific response properties that are enriched in different depths of the SC. The sSC is enriched with cells with small RFs, high evoked firing rates (FRs), and sustained temporal responses, whereas the dSC is enriched with the negative OS/DS cells and with cells with large RFs, low evoked FRs, and transient temporal responses. Locomotion modulates the activity of the SC cells both additively and multiplicatively and changes the preferred spatial frequency of some SC cells. These results provide the first description of the negative OS/DS cells and demonstrate that the SC segregates cells with different response properties and that the behavioral state of a mouse affects SC activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The superior colliculus (SC) receives visual input from the retina in its superficial layers (sSC) and induces eye/head-orientating movements and innate defensive responses in its deeper layers (dSC). Despite their importance, very little is known about the visual response properties of dSC neurons. Using high-density electrode recordings and novel model-based analysis, we found several novel visual response properties of the SC cells, including encoding of a cell's preferred orientation or direction by suppression of the firing rate. The sSC and the dSC are enriched with cells with different visual response properties. Locomotion modulates the cells in the SC. These findings contribute to our understanding of how the SC processes visual inputs, a critical step in comprehending visually guided behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Learning Predictive Statistics: Strategies and Brain Mechanisms</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;When immersed in a new environment, we are challenged to decipher initially incomprehensible streams of sensory information. However, quite rapidly, the brain finds structure and meaning in these incoming signals, helping us to predict and prepare ourselves for future actions. This skill relies on extracting the statistics of event streams in the environment that contain regularities of variable complexity from simple repetitive patterns to complex probabilistic combinations. Here, we test the brain mechanisms that mediate our ability to adapt to the environment's statistics and predict upcoming events. By combining behavioral training and multisession fMRI in human participants (male and female), we track the corticostriatal mechanisms that mediate learning of temporal sequences as they change in structure complexity. We show that learning of predictive structures relates to individual decision strategy; that is, selecting the most probable outcome in a given context (maximizing) versus matching the exact sequence statistics. These strategies engage distinct human brain regions: maximizing engages dorsolateral prefrontal, cingulate, sensory–motor regions, and basal ganglia (dorsal caudate, putamen), whereas matching engages occipitotemporal regions (including the hippocampus) and basal ganglia (ventral caudate). Our findings provide evidence for distinct corticostriatal mechanisms that facilitate our ability to extract behaviorally relevant statistics to make predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Making predictions about future events relies on interpreting streams of information that may initially appear incomprehensible. Past work has studied how humans identify repetitive patterns and associative pairings. However, the natural environment contains regularities that vary in complexity from simple repetition to complex probabilistic combinations. Here, we combine behavior and multisession fMRI to track the brain mechanisms that mediate our ability to adapt to changes in the environment's statistics. We provide evidence for an alternate route for learning complex temporal statistics: extracting the most probable outcome in a given context is implemented by interactions between executive and motor corticostriatal mechanisms compared with visual corticostriatal circuits (including hippocampal cortex) that support learning of the exact temporal statistics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Reconfiguration of Brain Network Architectures between Resting-State and Complexity-Dependent Cognitive Reasoning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8399?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8399?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Our capacity for higher cognitive reasoning has a measurable limit. This limit is thought to arise from the brain's capacity to flexibly reconfigure interactions between spatially distributed networks. Recent work, however, has suggested that reconfigurations of task-related networks are modest when compared with intrinsic &quot;resting-state&quot; network architecture. Here we combined resting-state and task-driven functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine how flexible, task-specific reconfigurations associated with increasing reasoning demands are integrated within a stable intrinsic brain topology. Human participants (21 males and 28 females) underwent an initial resting-state scan, followed by a cognitive reasoning task involving different levels of complexity, followed by a second resting-state scan. The reasoning task required participants to deduce the identity of a missing element in a 4 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 4 matrix, and item difficulty was scaled parametrically as determined by relational complexity theory. Analyses revealed that external task engagement was characterized by a significant change in functional brain modules. Specifically, resting-state and null-task demand conditions were associated with more segregated brain-network topology, whereas increases in reasoning complexity resulted in merging of resting-state modules. Further increments in task complexity did not change the established modular architecture, but affected selective patterns of connectivity between frontoparietal, subcortical, cingulo-opercular, and default-mode networks. Larger increases in network efficiency within the newly established task modules were associated with higher reasoning accuracy. Our results shed light on the network architectures that underlie external task engagement, and highlight selective changes in brain connectivity supporting increases in task complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Humans have clear limits in their ability to solve complex reasoning problems. It is thought that such limitations arise from flexible, moment-to-moment reconfigurations of functional brain networks. It is less clear how such task-driven adaptive changes in connectivity relate to stable, intrinsic networks of the brain and behavioral performance. We found that increased reasoning demands rely on selective patterns of connectivity within cortical networks that emerged in addition to a more general, task-induced modular architecture. This task-driven architecture reverted to a more segregated resting-state architecture both immediately before and after the task. These findings reveal how flexibility in human brain networks is integral to achieving successful reasoning performance across different levels of cognitive demand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: 2-Arachidonoylglycerol Reduces Proteoglycans and Enhances Remyelination in a Progressive Model of Demyelination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8385?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The failure to undergo remyelination is a critical impediment to recovery in multiple sclerosis. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) accumulate at demyelinating lesions creating a nonpermissive environment that impairs axon regeneration and remyelination. Here, we reveal a new role for 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), the major CNS endocannabinoid, in the modulation of CSPGs deposition in a progressive model of multiple sclerosis, the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease. Treatment with a potent reversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase, which accounts for 85% of the 2-AG degradation in the mouse CNS, modulates neuroinflammation and reduces CSPGs accumulation and astrogliosis around demyelinated lesions in the spinal cord of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-infected mice. Inhibition of 2-AG hydrolysis augments the number of mature oligodendrocytes and increases MBP, leading to remyelination and functional recovery of mice. Our findings establish a mechanism for 2-AG promotion of remyelination with implications in axonal repair in CNS demyelinating pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The deposition of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans contributes to the failure in remyelination associated with multiple sclerosis. Here we unveil a new role for 2-arachidonoylglycerol, the major CNS endocannabinoid, in the modulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan accumulation in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease. The treatment during the chronic phase with a potent reversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase, which accounts for 85% of the 2-arachidonoylglycerol degradation in the mouse CNS, modulates neuroinflammation and reduces chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan deposition around demyelinated lesions in the spinal cord of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-infected mice. The increased 2-arachidonoylglycerol tone promotes remyelination in a model of progressive multiple sclerosis ameliorating motor dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Basolateral Amygdala to Orbitofrontal Cortex Projections Enable Cue-Triggered Reward Expectations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8374?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8374?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;To make an appropriate decision, one must anticipate potential future rewarding events, even when they are not readily observable. These expectations are generated by using observable information (e.g., stimuli or available actions) to retrieve often quite detailed memories of available rewards. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are two reciprocally connected key nodes in the circuitry supporting such outcome-guided behaviors. But there is much unknown about the contribution of this circuit to decision making, and almost nothing known about the whether any contribution is via direct, monosynaptic projections, or the direction of information transfer. Therefore, here we used designer receptor-mediated inactivation of OFC-&amp;gt;BLA or BLA-&amp;gt;OFC projections to evaluate their respective contributions to outcome-guided behaviors in rats. Inactivation of BLA terminals in the OFC, but not OFC terminals in the BLA, disrupted the selective motivating influence of cue-triggered reward representations over reward-seeking decisions as assayed by Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer. BLA-&amp;gt;OFC projections were also required when a cued reward representation was used to modify Pavlovian conditional goal-approach responses according to the reward's current value. These projections were not necessary when actions were guided by reward expectations generated based on learned action-reward contingencies, or when rewards themselves, rather than stored memories, directed action. These data demonstrate that BLA-&amp;gt;OFC projections enable the cue-triggered reward expectations that can motivate the execution of specific action plans and allow adaptive conditional responding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Deficits anticipating potential future rewarding events are associated with many psychiatric diseases. Presently, we know little about the neural circuits supporting such reward expectation. Here we show that basolateral amygdala to orbitofrontal cortex projections are required for expectations of specific available rewards to influence reward seeking and decision making. The necessity of these projections was limited to situations in which expectations were elicited by reward-predictive cues. These projections therefore facilitate adaptive behavior by enabling the orbitofrontal cortex to use environmental stimuli to generate expectations of potential future rewarding events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Adaptive Encoding of Outcome Prediction by Prefrontal Cortex Ensembles Supports Behavioral Flexibility</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8363?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8363?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to play a critical role in behavioral flexibility by monitoring action–outcome contingencies. How PFC ensembles represent shifts in behavior in response to changes in these contingencies remains unclear. We recorded single-unit activity and local field potentials in the dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) of male rats during a set-shifting task that required them to update their behavior, among competing options, in response to changes in action–outcome contingencies. As behavior was updated, a subset of PFC ensembles encoded the current trial outcome before the outcome was presented. This novel outcome-prediction encoding was absent in a control task, in which actions were rewarded pseudorandomly, indicating that PFC neurons are not merely providing an expectancy signal. In both control and set-shifting tasks, dmPFC neurons displayed postoutcome discrimination activity, indicating that these neurons also monitor whether a behavior is successful in generating rewards. Gamma-power oscillatory activity increased before the outcome in both tasks but did not differentiate between expected outcomes, suggesting that this measure is not related to set-shifting behavior but reflects expectation of an outcome after action execution. These results demonstrate that PFC neurons support flexible rule-based action selection by predicting outcomes that follow a particular action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Tracking action–outcome contingencies and modifying behavior when those contingencies change is critical to behavioral flexibility. We find that ensembles of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex neurons differentiate between expected outcomes when action–outcome contingencies change. This predictive mode of signaling may be used to promote a new response strategy at the service of behavioral flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brief, intermittent oxygen reductions [acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH)] evokes spinal plasticity. Models of AIH-induced neuroplasticity have focused on motoneurons; however, most midcervical interneurons (C-INs) also respond to hypoxia. We hypothesized that AIH would alter the functional connectivity between C-INs and induce persistent changes in discharge. Bilateral phrenic nerve activity was recorded in anesthetized and ventilated adult male rats and a multielectrode array was used to record C4/5 spinal discharge before [baseline (BL)], during, and 15 min after three 5 min hypoxic episodes (11% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H1–H3). Most C-INs (94%) responded to hypoxia by either increasing or decreasing firing rate. Functional connectivity was examined by cross-correlating C-IN discharge. Correlograms with a peak or trough were taken as evidence for excitatory or inhibitory connectivity between C-IN pairs. A subset of C-IN pairs had increased excitatory cross-correlations during hypoxic episodes (34%) compared with BL (19%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Another subset had a similar response following each episode (40%) compared with BL (19%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). In the latter group, connectivity remained elevated 15 min post-AIH (30%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0002). Inhibitory C-IN connectivity increased during H1–H3 (4.5%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0160), but was reduced 15 min post-AIH (0.5%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0439). Spike-triggered averaging indicated that a subset of C-INs is synaptically coupled to phrenic motoneurons and excitatory inputs to these &quot;pre-phrenic&quot; cells increased during AIH. We conclude that AIH alters connectivity of the midcervical spinal network. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that AIH induces plasticity within the propriospinal network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) can trigger spinal plasticity associated with sustained increases in respiratory, somatic, and/or autonomic motor output. The impact of AIH on cervical spinal interneuron (C-IN) discharge and connectivity is unknown. Our results demonstrate that AIH recruits excitatory C-INs into the spinal respiratory (phrenic) network. AIH also enhances excitatory and reduces inhibitory connections among the C-IN network. We conclude that C-INs are part of the respiratory, somatic, and/or autonomic response to AIH, and that propriospinal plasticity may contribute to sustained increases in motor output after AIH.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Optogenetic Central Amygdala Stimulation Intensifies and Narrows Motivation for Cocaine</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8330?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8330?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Addiction is often characterized by intense motivation for a drug, which may be narrowly focused at the expense of other rewards. Here, we examined the role of amygdala-related circuitry in the amplification and narrowing of motivation focus for intravenous cocaine. We paired optogenetic channelrhodopsin (ChR2) stimulation in either central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) or basolateral amygdala (BLA) of female rats with one particular nose-poke porthole option for earning cocaine infusions (0.3 mg/kg, i.v.). A second alternative porthole earned identical cocaine but without ChR2 stimulation. Consequently, CeA rats quickly came to pursue their CeA ChR2-paired cocaine option intensely and exclusively, elevating cocaine intake while ignoring their alternative cocaine alone option. By comparison, BLA ChR2 pairing failed to enhance cocaine motivation. CeA rats also emitted consummatory bites toward their laser-paired porthole, suggesting that higher incentive salience made that cue more attractive. A separate progressive ratio test of incentive motivation confirmed that CeA ChR2 amplified rats' motivation, raising their breakpoint effort price for cocaine by 10-fold. However, CeA ChR2 laser on its own lacked any reinforcement value: laser by itself was never self-stimulated, not even by the same rats in which it amplified motivation for cocaine. Conversely, CeA inhibition by muscimol/baclofen microinjections prevented acquisition of cocaine self-administration and laser preference, whereas CeA inhibition by optogenetic halorhodopsin suppressed cocaine intake, indicating that CeA circuitry is needed for ordinary cocaine motivation. We conclude that CeA ChR2 excitation paired with a cocaine option specifically focuses and amplifies motivation to produce intense pursuit and consumption focused on that single target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In addiction, intense incentive motivation often becomes narrowly focused on a particular drug of abuse. Here we show that pairing central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) optogenetic stimulation with one option for earning intravenous cocaine makes that option almost the exclusive focus of intense pursuit and consumption. CeA stimulation also elevated the effort cost rats were willing to pay for cocaine and made associated cues become intensely attractive. However, we also show that CeA laser had no reinforcing properties at all when given alone for the same rats. Therefore, CeA laser pairing makes its associated cocaine option and cues become powerfully attractive in a nearly addictive fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Fetal Growth and Premature Delivery in Pregnant Women on Anti-epileptic Drugs</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; To evaluate the effects of epilepsy and antiepileptic drugs (AED) use during pregnancy on fetal growth and preterm delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; This study included singleton liveborns born to women enrolled in the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry between 1997 and 2016. Data were collected prospectively through telephone interviews. The prevalence of preterm birth (&amp;lt;37 weeks) and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) among infants exposed prenatally to AED when used by women with epilepsy (WWE) or women without epilepsy (WWOE) was compared with that among infants unexposed to AEDs and born to WWOE. Multivariable log-binomial regression models were used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; The study population included infants born to 6,777 AED-WWE, 696 AED-WWOE, and 486 no-AED WWOE. The risk of prematurity was 6.2% for no-AED-WWOE, 9.3% for AED-WWE (RR 1.5, 95%CI: 1.0-2.1) and 10.5% for AED-WWOE (RR 1.5: 1.0-2.4). Prenatal exposure to AED in WWE and WWOE was associated with a mean lower birth weight of 110 and 136 grams, respectively, as compared to no-AED WWOE. The prevalence of SGA was 5.0% for no-AED-WWOE, 10.9% for AED-WWE (RR 2.0: 1.3-3.0) and 11.0% for AED-WWOE (RR 1.9: 1.2-2.9). Within users of AEDs in monotherapy, the prevalence of SGA ranged from 7.3% for lamotrigine to 18.5% for topiramate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; Women on AEDs during pregnancy, whether for epilepsy or for other neuropsychiatric indications, are at a higher risk of delivering prematurely and giving birth to SGA newborns. The risk may vary by drug. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Degeneration of serotonin neurons triggers spasticity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25030</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25030</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Spasticity occurs in a wide range of neurological diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, after trauma or after stroke and is characterized by increased reflexes leading to muscle hypertonia. Spasticity is a painful symptom and can severely restrict everyday life, but might also participate in maintaining a low level of motor function in severely impaired patients. Constitutive activity of the serotonin receptors 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/C&lt;/sub&gt; is required for the development of spasticity after spinal cord injury or during amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We sought here to provide direct evidence for a role of brainstem serotonin neurons in spasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;em&gt;SOD1&lt;/em&gt;(G37R) mice expressing a conditional allele of an ALS-linked SOD1 mutation were crossed to Tph2-CRE mice expressing CRE in serotonergic neurons. Measurement of long lasting reflex using EMG, behavioural follow up and histological techniques were used to characterize spasticity and motor phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Deleting mutant SOD1 expression selectively in brainstem serotonin neurons was sufficient to rescue loss of TPH2 immunoreactivity and largely preserve serotonin innervation of motor neurons in the spinal cord. Furthermore, this abrogated constitutive activity of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/C&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and abolished spasticity in end-stage mice. Consistent with spasticity mitigating motor symptoms, selective deletion worsened motor function and accelerated the onset of paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Degeneration of serotonin neurons is necessary to trigger spasticity through the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/C&lt;/sub&gt; receptor. The wide range of drugs targeting the serotonergic system could be useful to treat spasticity in neurological diseases. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: GABBR2 mutations determine phenotype in Rett syndrome and epileptic encephalopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25032</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25032</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Rett syndrome (RTT) and epileptic encephalopathy (EE) are devastating neurodevelopmental disorders with distinct diagnostic criteria. However, highly heterogeneous and overlapping clinical features often allocate patients into the boundary of the two conditions, complicating accurate diagnosis and appropriate medical interventions. Therefore, we investigated the specific molecular mechanism that allows an understanding of the pathogenesis and relationship of these two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We screened novel genetic factors from 34 RTT-like patients without &lt;em&gt;MECP2&lt;/em&gt; mutations, which account for ∼90% of RTT cases, by whole exome sequencing. The biological function of the discovered variants was assessed in cell culture and &lt;em&gt;Xenopus tropicalis&lt;/em&gt; models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We identified a recurring &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; variant in GABAB receptor R2 (&lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt;) that reduces the receptor function, whereas different &lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt; variants in EE patients possess a more profound effect in reducing receptor activity and are more responsive to agonist rescue in an animal model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt; is a genetic factor that determines RTT- or EE-like phenotype expression depending on the variant positions. &lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt;-mediated GABA signaling is a crucial factor in determining the severity and nature of neurodevelopmental phenotypes.

Seizure-induced brain damage is not conclusively demonstrated either in humans or in animal models of epilepsy. We evaluated the expression of brain injury biomarkers on postsurgical brain tissue obtained from 20 patients with frequent seizures and a long history of drug-resistant focal epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25005-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expression patterns of specific glial, neuronal, and inflammatory molecules were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in the core of type II focal cortical dysplasias (FCD-II), at the FCD boundary (perilesion), and in the adjacent normal-appearing area included in the epileptogenic region. We also analyzed surgical specimens from cryptogenic patients not presenting structural alterations at imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25005-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astroglial and microglial activation, reduced neuronal density, perivascular CD3-positive T-lymphocyte clustering, and fibrinogen extravasation were demonstrated in the core of FCD-II lesions. No pathological immunoreactivity was observed outside the FCD-II or in cryptogenetic specimens, where the occurrence of interictal and ictal epileptiform activity was confirmed by either stereo-electroencephalography or intraoperative electrocorticography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25005-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recurrent seizures do not induce the expression of brain damage markers in nonlesional epileptogenic cortex studied in postsurgical tissue from cryptogenic and FCD patients. This evidence argues against the hypothesis that epileptiform activity per se contributes to focal brain injury, at least in the neocortical epilepsies considered here.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25010-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite numerous studies suggesting the role of insular cortex in the processing of gustatory and olfactory inputs, the exact location of olfactogustatory representation in the insula remains controversial. Here we provide a functional mapping of olfactory–gustatory responses to stimulation of the human insular cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25010-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We reviewed 651 electrical stimulations of the insula that were performed in 221 patients, using stereotactically implanted depth electrodes, during the presurgical evaluation of drug-refractory epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25010-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gustatory sensations were evoked in 15 (2.7%) of the 550 stimulations that elicited a clinical response. They were exclusively obtained after stimulation of a relatively delimited zone of insula, located in its mid-dorsal part (posterior short gyrus). Six olfactory sensations (1.1%) could be obtained during stimulations of an insular region that partially overlapped with the gustatory representation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25010-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study provides a functional mapping of gustatory representation in the insular posterior short gyrus and the first detailed description of olfactory sensations obtained by direct stimulation of mid-dorsal insula. Our data also show a spatial overlap between gustatory, olfactory, and oral somatosensory representation in the mid-dorsal insula, and suggest that this part of the insula may be an integrated oral sensory region that plays a key role in flavor perception. It also indicates that dysfunction in this region should be considered during the evaluation of gustatory and olfactory epileptic seizures.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary and secondary conditions leading to thiamine deficiency have overlapping features in children, presenting with acute episodes of encephalopathy, bilateral symmetric brain lesions, and high excretion of organic acids that are specific of thiamine-dependent mitochondrial enzymes, mainly lactate, alpha-ketoglutarate, and branched chain keto-acids. Undiagnosed and untreated thiamine deficiencies are often fatal or lead to severe sequelae. Herein, we describe the clinical and genetic characterization of 79 patients with inherited thiamine defects causing encephalopathy in childhood, identifying outcome predictors in patients with pathogenic &lt;em&gt;SLC19A3&lt;/em&gt; variants, the most common genetic etiology. We propose diagnostic criteria that will aid clinicians to establish a faster and accurate diagnosis so that early vitamin supplementation is considered.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Are there optical communication channels in the brain?. (arXiv:1708.08887v1 [physics.bio-ph])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite great progress in neuroscience, there are still fundamental
unanswered questions about the brain, including the origin of subjective
experience and consciousness. Some answers might rely on new physical
mechanisms. Given that biophotons have been discovered in the brain, it is
interesting to explore if neurons use photonic communication in addition to the
well-studied electro-chemical signals. Such photonic communication in the brain
would require waveguides. Here we review recent work [S. Kumar, K. Boone, J.
Tuszynski, P. Barclay, and C. Simon, Scientific Reports 6, 36508 (2016)]
suggesting that myelinated axons could serve as photonic waveguides. The light
transmission in the myelinated axon was modeled, taking into account its
realistic imperfections, and experiments were proposed both in-vivo and
in-vitro to test this hypothesis. Potential implications for quantum biology
are discussed.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pain is a complex and subjective experience that poses a number of
measurement challenges. While self-report by the patient is viewed as the gold
standard of pain assessment, this approach fails when patients cannot verbally
communicate pain intensity or lack normal mental abilities. Here, we present a
pain intensity measurement method based on physiological signals. Specifically,
we implement a multi-task learning approach based on neural networks that
accounts for individual differences in pain responses while still leveraging
data from across the population. We test our method in a dataset containing
multi-modal physiological responses to nociceptive pain.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Synchrony-induced modes of oscillation of a neural field model. (arXiv:1708.08672v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08672</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08672</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We investigate the modes of oscillation of heterogeneous ring-networks of
quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons with non-local, space-dependent coupling.
Perturbations of the equilibrium state with a particular wave number produce
transient standing waves with a specific frequency, analogous to those in a
tense string. In the neuronal network, the equilibrium corresponds to a
spatially homogeneous, asynchronous state. Perturbations of this state excite
the network's oscillatory modes, which reflect the interplay of episodes of
synchronous spiking with the excitatory-inhibitory spatial interactions. In the
thermodynamic limit, an exact low-dimensional neural field model describing the
macroscopic dynamics of the network is derived. This allows us to obtain
formulas for the Turing eigenvalues of the spatially-homogeneous state, and
hence to obtain its stability boundary. We find that the frequency of each
Turing mode depends on the corresponding Fourier coefficient of the synaptic
pattern of connectivity. The decay rate instead, is identical for all
oscillation modes as a consequence of the heterogeneity-induced
desynchronization of the neurons. Finally, we numerically compute the spectrum
of spatially-inhomogeneous solutions branching from the Turing bifurcation,
showing that similar oscillatory modes operate in neural bump states, and are
maintained away from onset.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fluctuation analysis in nonstationary conditions: single Ca channel current in cortical pyramidal neurons. (arXiv:1603.02007v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02007</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02007</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fluctuation analysis is a method which allows measurement of the single
channel current of ion channels even when it is too small to be resolved
directly with the patch clamp technique. This is the case for voltage-gated
Ca2+ channels (VGCCs). They are present in all mammalian central neurons,
controlling presynaptic release of transmitter, postsynaptic signaling and
synaptic integration. The amplitudes of their single channel currents in a
physiological concentration of extracellular Ca2+, however, are small and not
well determined. But measurement of this quantity is essential for estimating
numbers of functional VGCCs in the membrane and the size of channel-associated
Ca2+ signaling domains, and for understanding the stochastic nature of Ca2+
signaling. Here, we recorded the VGCC current in nucleated patches from layer 5
pyramidal neurons in rat neocortex, in physiological external Ca2+ (1-2 mM).
The ensemble-averaging of current responses required for conventional
fluctuation analysis proved impractical because of the rapid rundown of VGCC
currents. We therefore developed a more robust method, using mean current
fitting of individual current responses and band-pass filtering. Furthermore,
voltage ramp stimulation proved useful. We validated the accuracy of the method
by analyzing simulated data. At an external Ca2+ concentration of 1 mM, and a
membrane potential of -20 mV, we found that the average single channel current
amplitude was about 0.04 pA, increasing to 0.065 pA at 2 mM external Ca2+, and
0.12 pA at 5 mM. The relaxation time constant of the fluctuations was in the
range 0.2-0.8 ms. The results are relevant to understanding the stochastic
properties of dendritic Ca2+ spikes in neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons.
With the reported method, single channel current amplitude of native VGCCs can
be resolved accurately despite conditions of unstable rundown.

	<description>Adesnik shows that a decreasing excitation/inhibition ratio contributes to contrast and sizing tuning in the visual cortex of awake mice. A decreasing E/I ratio with increasing cortical drive might underlie many types of cortical computations.</description>

	<title>Neuron: Inferior Olivary TMEM16B Mediates Cerebellar Motor Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30701-8?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30701-8?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Zhang et al. discover an overlooked Ca2+-activated Cl− conductance in inferior olive neurons. TMEM16B encodes this conductance and mediates membrane repolarization via a negative feedback on voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. TMEM16B deficiency decreases IO excitability, leading to cerebellar motor learning defects.</description>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30691-8?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Rudebeck et al. show that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) make dissociable contributions to decision-making. The VLPFC, but not the OFC, is critical for updating stimulus-outcome availability, whereas the OFC, but not the VLPFC, is vital for updating stimulus-outcome desirability.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We review our current software tools and theoretical methods for applying the
Neural Engineering Framework to state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware. These
methods can be used to implement linear and nonlinear dynamical systems that
exploit axonal transmission time-delays, and to fully account for nonideal
mixed-analog-digital synapses that exhibit higher-order dynamics with
heterogeneous time-constants. This summarizes earlier versions of these methods
that have been discussed in a more biological context (Voelker &amp;amp; Eliasmith,
2017) or regarding a specific neuromorphic architecture (Voelker et al., 2017).

&lt;p&gt;Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9orf72 gene locus create double jeopardy, first by leading to DNA–RNA R-loops that spawn double-strand breaks and second by the synthesis of dipeptide repeats that hinder DNA repair. This two-pronged mechanism may explain neurodegeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Domain-based prediction of the human isoform interactome provides insights into the functional impact of alternative splicing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005717</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Mohamed Ali Ghadie, Luke Lambourne, Marc Vidal, Yu Xia&lt;/p&gt;

Alternative splicing is known to remodel protein-protein interaction networks (“interactomes”), yet large-scale determination of isoform-specific interactions remains challenging. We present a domain-based method to predict the isoform interactome from the reference interactome. First, we construct the domain-resolved reference interactome by mapping known domain-domain interactions onto experimentally-determined interactions between reference proteins. Then, we construct the isoform interactome by predicting that an isoform loses an interaction if it loses the domain mediating the interaction. Our prediction framework is of high-quality when assessed by experimental data. The predicted human isoform interactome reveals extensive network remodeling by alternative splicing. Protein pairs interacting with different isoforms of the same gene tend to be more divergent in biological function, tissue expression, and disease phenotype than protein pairs interacting with the same isoforms. Our prediction method complements experimental efforts, and demonstrates that integrating structural domain information with interactomes provides insights into the functional impact of alternative splicing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pOE3h8IZjMI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A method of determining where to target surveillance efforts in heterogeneous epidemiological systems</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005712</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexander J. Mastin, Frank van den Bosch, Timothy R. Gottwald, Vasthi Alonso Chavez, Stephen R. Parnell&lt;/p&gt;

The spread of pathogens into new environments poses a considerable threat to human, animal, and plant health, and by extension, human and animal wellbeing, ecosystem function, and agricultural productivity, worldwide. Early detection through effective surveillance is a key strategy to reduce the risk of their establishment. Whilst it is well established that statistical and economic considerations are of vital importance when planning surveillance efforts, it is also important to consider epidemiological characteristics of the pathogen in question—including heterogeneities within the epidemiological system itself. One of the most pronounced realisations of this heterogeneity is seen in the case of vector-borne pathogens, which spread between ‘hosts’ and ‘vectors’—with each group possessing distinct epidemiological characteristics. As a result, an important question when planning surveillance for emerging vector-borne pathogens is where to place sampling resources in order to detect the pathogen as early as possible. We answer this question by developing a statistical function which describes the probability distributions of the prevalences of infection at first detection in both hosts and vectors. We also show how this method can be adapted in order to maximise the probability of early detection of an emerging pathogen within imposed sample size and/or cost constraints, and demonstrate its application using two simple models of vector-borne citrus pathogens. Under the assumption of a linear cost function, we find that sampling costs are generally minimised when either hosts or vectors, but not both, are sampled.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HsuotfhBM24&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: HLA class I haplotype diversity is consistent with selection for frequent existing haplotypes</title>

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) contains the most polymorphic genetic system in humans, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes of the adaptive immune system. High allelic diversity in HLA is argued to be maintained by balancing selection, such as negative frequency-dependent selection or heterozygote advantage. Selective pressure against immune escape by pathogens can maintain appreciable frequencies of many different HLA alleles. The selection pressures operating on combinations of HLA alleles across loci, or haplotypes, have not been extensively evaluated since the high HLA polymorphism necessitates very large sample sizes, which have not been available until recently. We aimed to evaluate the effect of selection operating at the HLA haplotype level by analyzing HLA A~C~B~DRB1~DQB1 haplotype frequencies derived from over six million individuals genotyped by the National Marrow Donor Program registry. In contrast with alleles, HLA haplotype diversity patterns suggest purifying selection, as certain HLA allele combinations co-occur in high linkage disequilibrium. Linkage disequilibrium is positive (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'&amp;gt;0) among frequent haplotypes and negative (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'&amp;lt;0) among rare haplotypes. Fitting the haplotype frequency distribution to several population dynamics models, we found that the best fit was obtained when significant positive frequency-dependent selection (FDS) was incorporated. Finally, the Ewens-Watterson test of homozygosity showed excess homozygosity for 5-locus haplotypes within 23 US populations studied, with an average &lt;i&gt;Fnd&lt;/i&gt; of 28.43. Haplotype diversity is most consistent with purifying selection for HLA Class I haplotypes (HLA-A, -B, -C), and was not inferred for HLA Class II haplotypes (-DRB1 and—DQB1). We discuss our empirical results in the context of evolutionary theory, exploring potential mechanisms of selection that maintain high linkage disequilibrium in MHC haplotype blocks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/983RcTGNU5k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dysregulation of LIMK-1/Cofilin-1 pathway: A possible basis for alteration of neuronal morphology in experimental cerebral malaria</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25028</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Loss of cognition even after survival is the salient feature of cerebral malaria (CM). Currently, the fate of neuronal morphology is not studied at the ultra-structural level in CM. Recent studies suggest that maintenance of neuronal morphology and dendritic spine density (actin dynamics in particular) are essential for proper cognitive functions. LIMK-1/Cofilin-1signaling pathway is known to involve in the maintenance of actin dynamics through regulation of cofilin-1, in executing learning and memory functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Using experimental mouse model, we analyzed the behavioural parameters of CM, asymptomatic mice by performing Rapid Murine Coma Behaviour Scale experiment (RMCBS). We performed Golgi-Cox staining to assess neuronal morphology, dendritic spine density and arborization in the brain cortex subjected to &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium berghei ANKA&lt;/em&gt; infection compared to asymptomatic, anemic and control groups. We studied the neural gene expression pattern of LIMK-1, cofilin-1 and β-actin in all the experimental groups by semi-quantitative, quantitative PCR followed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We observed significant loss of dendritic spine density, abnormal spine morphology, reduced dendritic arborization; extensive dendritic varicosities in the cortical neurons of CM infected brain. Further, these observations correlated with diminished protein levels of LIMK-1, cofilin-1, phospho-cofilin-1 and β-actin in the whole brain lysates as well as formation of actin-cofilin rods in the brain sections of mice symptomatic to CM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Overall, our findings suggest that the altered neuronal morphology and dysregulation of LIMK-1/cofilin-1 pathway could affect the cognitive outcome after experimental CM. Therefore, this study could help to establish newer therapeutic strategies aiming long-term cognitive impairment after CM. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Robust averaging protects decisions from noise in neural computations</title>

An ideal observer will give equivalent weight to sources of information that are equally reliable. However, when averaging visual information, human observers tend to downweight or discount features that are relatively outlying or deviant (‘robust averaging’). Why humans adopt an integration policy that discards important decision information remains unknown. Here, observers were asked to judge the average tilt in a circular array of high-contrast gratings, relative to an orientation boundary defined by a central reference grating. Observers showed robust averaging of orientation, but the extent to which they did so was a positive predictor of their overall performance. Using computational simulations, we show that although robust averaging is suboptimal for a perfect integrator, it paradoxically enhances performance in the presence of “late” noise, i.e. which corrupts decisions during integration. In other words, robust decision strategies increase the brain’s resilience to noise arising in neural computations during decision-making.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9-7Oog0_4kM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Towards a category theory approach to analogy: Analyzing re-representation and acquisition of numerical knowledge</title>

Category Theory, a branch of mathematics, has shown promise as a modeling framework for higher-level cognition. We introduce an algebraic model for &lt;i&gt;analogy&lt;/i&gt; that uses the language of category theory to explore analogy-related cognitive phenomena. To illustrate the potential of this approach, we use this model to explore three objects of study in cognitive literature. First, (a) we use &lt;i&gt;commutative diagrams&lt;/i&gt; to analyze an effect of playing particular educational board games on the learning of numbers. Second, (b) we employ a notion called &lt;i&gt;coequalizer&lt;/i&gt; as a formal model of re-representation that explains a property of computational models of analogy called “flexibility” whereby non-similar representational elements are considered matches and placed in structural correspondence. Finally, (c) we build a formal learning model which shows that re-representation, language processing and analogy making can explain the acquisition of knowledge of rational numbers. These objects of study provide a picture of acquisition of numerical knowledge that is compatible with empirical evidence and offers insights on possible connections between notions such as relational knowledge, analogy, learning, conceptual knowledge, re-representation and procedural knowledge. This suggests that the approach presented here facilitates mathematical modeling of cognition and provides novel ways to think about analogy-related cognitive phenomena.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sBo6FmxKjSc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Noise correlations in the human brain and their impact on pattern classification</title>

Multivariate decoding methods, such as multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), are highly effective at extracting information from brain imaging data. Yet, the precise nature of the information that MVPA draws upon remains controversial. Most current theories emphasize the enhanced sensitivity imparted by aggregating across voxels that have mixed and weak selectivity. However, beyond the selectivity of individual voxels, neural variability is correlated across voxels, and such noise correlations may contribute importantly to accurate decoding. Indeed, a recent computational theory proposed that noise correlations enhance multivariate decoding from heterogeneous neural populations. Here we extend this theory from the scale of neurons to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and show that noise correlations between heterogeneous populations of voxels (i.e., voxels selective for different stimulus variables) contribute to the success of MVPA. Specifically, decoding performance is enhanced when voxels with high vs. low noise correlations (measured during rest or in the background of the task) are selected during classifier training. Conversely, voxels that are strongly selective for one class in a GLM or that receive high classification weights in MVPA tend to exhibit high noise correlations with voxels selective for the other class being discriminated against. Furthermore, we use simulations to show that this is a general property of fMRI data and that selectivity and noise correlations can have distinguishable influences on decoding. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that if there is signal in the data, the resulting above-chance classification accuracy is modulated by the magnitude of noise correlations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MRF7w8Pk05Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Data driven flexible backbone protein design</title>

Protein design remains an important problem in computational structural biology. Current computational protein design methods largely use physics-based methods, which make use of information from a single protein structure. This is despite the fact that multiple structures of many protein folds are now readily available in the PDB. While ensemble protein design methods can use multiple protein structures, they treat each structure independently. Here, we introduce a flexible backbone strategy, FlexiBaL-GP, which learns global protein backbone movements directly from multiple protein structures. FlexiBaL-GP uses the machine learning method of Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models to learn a lower dimensional representation of the protein coordinates that best represent backbone movements. These learned backbone movements are used to explore alternative protein backbones, while engineering a protein within a parallel tempered MCMC framework. Using the human ubiquitin–USP21 complex as a model we demonstrate that our design strategy outperforms current strategies for the interface design task of identifying tight binding ubiquitin variants for USP21.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t6T6ch57tGE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In recent years, there have been many computational simulations of spontaneous neural dynamics. Here, we describe a simple model of spontaneous neural dynamics that controls an agent moving in a simple virtual environment. These dynamics generate interesting brain-environment feedback interactions that rapidly destabilize neural and behavioral dynamics demonstrating the need for homeostatic mechanisms. We investigate roles for homeostatic plasticity both locally (local inhibition adjusting to balance excitatory input) as well as more globally (regional “task negative” activity that compensates for “task positive”, sensory input in another region) balancing neural activity and leading to more stable behavior (trajectories through the environment). Our results suggest complementary functional roles for both local and macroscale mechanisms in maintaining neural and behavioral dynamics and a novel functional role for macroscopic “task-negative” patterns of activity (e.g., the default mode network).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kCaFdi-3S6Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Spread of hospital-acquired infections: A comparison of healthcare networks</title>

Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), including emerging multi-drug resistant organisms, threaten healthcare systems worldwide. Efficient containment measures of HAIs must mobilize the entire healthcare network. Thus, to best understand how to reduce the potential scale of HAI epidemic spread, we explore patient transfer patterns in the French healthcare system. Using an exhaustive database of all hospital discharge summaries in France in 2014, we construct and analyze three patient networks based on the following: transfers of patients with HAI (HAI-specific network); patients with suspected HAI (suspected-HAI network); and all patients (general network). All three networks have heterogeneous patient flow and demonstrate small-world and scale-free characteristics. Patient populations that comprise these networks are also heterogeneous in their movement patterns. Ranking of hospitals by centrality measures and comparing community clustering using community detection algorithms shows that despite the differences in patient population, the HAI-specific and suspected-HAI networks rely on the same underlying structure as that of the general network. As a result, the general network may be more reliable in studying potential spread of HAIs. Finally, we identify transfer patterns at both the French regional and departmental (county) levels that are important in the identification of key hospital centers, patient flow trajectories, and regional clusters that may serve as a basis for novel wide-scale infection control strategies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Hha9dvbFa6M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Histologic and biochemical alterations predict pulmonary mechanical dysfunction in aging mice with chronic lung inflammation</title>

Both aging and chronic inflammation produce complex structural and biochemical alterations to the lung known to impact work of breathing. Mice deficient in surfactant protein D (Sftpd) develop progressive age-related lung pathology characterized by tissue destruction/remodeling, accumulation of foamy macrophages and alteration in surfactant composition. This study proposes to relate changes in tissue structure seen in normal aging and in chronic inflammation to altered lung mechanics using a computational model. Alterations in lung function in aging and Sftpd -/- mice have been inferred from fitting simple mechanical models to respiratory impedance data (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rs&lt;/sub&gt;), however interpretation has been confounded by the simultaneous presence of multiple coexisting pathophysiologic processes. In contrast to the inverse modeling approach, this study uses simulation from experimental measurements to recapitulate how aging and inflammation alter &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rs&lt;/sub&gt;. Histologic and mechanical measurements were made in C57BL6/J mice and congenic Sftpd-/- mice at 8, 27 and 80 weeks of age (n = 8/group). An anatomic computational model based on published airway morphometry was developed and &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rs&lt;/sub&gt; was simulated between 0.5 and 20 Hz. End expiratory pressure dependent changes in airway caliber and recruitment were estimated from mechanical measurements. Tissue elements were simulated using the constant phase model of viscoelasticity. Baseline elastance distribution was estimated in 8-week-old wild type mice, and stochastically varied for each condition based on experimentally measured alteration in elastic fiber composition, alveolar geometry and surfactant composition. Weighing reduction in model error against increasing model complexity allowed for identification of essential features underlying mechanical pathology and their contribution to &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rs&lt;/sub&gt;. Using a maximum likelihood approach, alteration in lung recruitment and diminished elastic fiber density were shown predictive of mechanical alteration at airway opening, to a greater extent than overt acinar wall destruction. Model-predicted deficits in PEEP-dependent lung recruitment correlate with altered lung lining fluid composition independent of age or genotype.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/W_PqHjUd6fU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Deciphering HLA-I motifs across HLA peptidomes improves neo-antigen predictions and identifies allostery regulating HLA specificity</title>

The precise identification of Human Leukocyte Antigen class I (HLA-I) binding motifs plays a central role in our ability to understand and predict (neo-)antigen presentation in infectious diseases and cancer. Here, by exploiting co-occurrence of HLA-I alleles across ten newly generated as well as forty public HLA peptidomics datasets comprising more than 115,000 unique peptides, we show that we can rapidly and accurately identify many HLA-I binding motifs and map them to their corresponding alleles without any &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; knowledge of HLA-I binding specificity. Our approach recapitulates and refines known motifs for 43 of the most frequent alleles, uncovers new motifs for 9 alleles that up to now had less than five known ligands and provides a scalable framework to incorporate additional HLA peptidomics studies in the future. The refined motifs improve neo-antigen and cancer testis antigen predictions, indicating that unbiased HLA peptidomics data are ideal for &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; predictions of neo-antigens from tumor exome sequencing data. The new motifs further reveal distant modulation of the binding specificity at P2 for some HLA-I alleles by residues in the HLA-I binding site but outside of the B-pocket and we unravel the underlying mechanisms by protein structure analysis, mutagenesis and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; binding assays.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PyX3xsSmxSk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Phantom Limbs, Neuroprosthetics, and the Developmental Origins of Embodiment</title>

	<description>Amputees who wish to rid themselves of a phantom limb must weaken the neural representation of the absent limb. Conversely, amputees who wish to replace a lost limb must assimilate a neuroprosthetic with the existing neural representation. Whether we wish to remove a phantom limb or assimilate a synthetic one, we will benefit from knowing more about the developmental process that enables embodiment. A potentially critical contributor to that process is the spontaneous activity – in the form of limb twitches – that occurs exclusively and abundantly during active (REM) sleep, a particularly prominent state in early development.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Temperature manipulation of neuronal dynamics in a forebrain motor control nucleus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005699</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Matías A. Goldin, Gabriel B. Mindlin&lt;/p&gt;

Different neuronal types within brain motor areas contribute to the generation of complex motor behaviors. A widely studied songbird forebrain nucleus (HVC) has been recognized as fundamental in shaping the precise timing characteristics of birdsong. This is based, among other evidence, on the stretching and the “breaking” of song structure when HVC is cooled. However, little is known about the temperature effects that take place in its neurons. To address this, we investigated the dynamics of HVC both experimentally and computationally. We developed a technique where simultaneous electrophysiological recordings were performed during temperature manipulation of HVC. We recorded spontaneous activity and found three effects: widening of the spike shape, decrease of the firing rate and change in the interspike interval distribution. All these effects could be explained with a detailed conductance based model of all the neurons present in HVC. Temperature dependence of the ionic channel time constants explained the first effect, while the second was based in the changes of the maximal conductance using single synaptic excitatory inputs. The last phenomenon, only emerged after introducing a more realistic synaptic input to the inhibitory interneurons. Two timescales were present in the interspike distributions. The behavior of one timescale was reproduced with different input balances received form the excitatory neurons, whereas the other, which disappears with cooling, could not be found assuming poissonian synaptic inputs. Furthermore, the computational model shows that the bursting of the excitatory neurons arises naturally at normal brain temperature and that they have an intrinsic delay at low temperatures. The same effect occurs at single synapses, which may explain song stretching. These findings shed light on the temperature dependence of neuronal dynamics and present a comprehensive framework to study neuronal connectivity. This study, which is based on intrinsic neuronal characteristics, may help to understand emergent behavioral changes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mXYitYBBMvs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dopamine transporter imaging deficit predicts early transition to synucleinopathy in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25026</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25026</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To determine the usefulness of dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging to identify idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (IRBD) patients at risk for short-term development of clinically-defined synucleinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Eighty-seven patients with polysomnography-confirmed IRBD underwent &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I-FP-CIT DAT-SPECT. Results were compared with 20 matched controls without RBD who underwent DAT-SPECT. In patients, FP-CIT uptake was considered abnormal when values were two standard deviations below controls' mean uptake. After DAT-SPECT, patients were followed-up during 5.7 ± 2.2 (range, 2.6-9.9) years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Baseline DAT deficit was found in 51 (58.6%) patients. During follow-up 25 (28.7%) subjects developed clinically-defined synucleinopathy (Parkinson disease in 11, dementia with Lewy bodies in 13, multiple system atrophy in one) with mean latency of 3.2 ± 1.9 years from imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed increased risk of incident synucleinopathy in patients with abnormal DAT-SPECT than with normal DAT-SPECT (20% vs. 6% at three years, 33% vs. 18% at five years; log rank test, p=0.006).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Receiver operating characteristics curve revealed that reduction of FP-CIT uptake in putamen greater than 25% discriminated patients with DAT deficit who developed synucleinopathy from patients with DAT deficit that remained disease-free after three years of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 5-year follow-up, DAT-SPECT had 75% sensitivity, 51% specificity, 44% positive predictive value, 80% negative predictive value, and like-hood ratio 1.54 to predict synucleinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: DAT-SPECT identifies IRBD patients at short-term risk for synucleinopathy. Decreased FP-CIT putamen uptake greater than 25% predicts synucleinopathy after three years follow-up. These observations may be useful to select candidates for disease-modification trials in IRBD.

	<description>To date, studies have demonstrated the dynamic influence of exogenous environmental stimuli on multiple regions of the brain. This environmental influence positively and negatively impacts programs governing myelination, and acts on myelinating oligodendrocyte (OL) cells across the human lifespan. Developmentally, environmental manipulation of OL progenitor cells (OPCs) has profound effects on the establishment of functional cognitive, sensory, and motor programs. Furthermore, central nervous system (CNS) myelin remains an adaptive entity in adulthood, sensitive to environmentally induced structural changes.</description>

	<description>In physiological conditions, adult neurons have low intracellular Cl− [(Cl−)I] levels underlying the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibitory drive. In contrast, neurons have high (Cl−)I levels and excitatory GABA actions in a wide range of pathological conditions including spinal cord lesions, chronic pain, brain trauma, cerebrovascular infarcts, autism, Rett and Down syndrome, various types of epilepsies, and other genetic or environmental insults. The diuretic highly specific NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist bumetanide (PubChem CID: 2461) efficiently restores low (Cl−)I levels and attenuates many disorders in experimental conditions and in some clinical trials.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Seizing Control of KCC2: A New Therapeutic Target for Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30123-6?rss=yes</guid>

	<description>Deficits in GABAergic inhibition result in the abnormal neuronal activation and synchronization that underlies seizures. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for transforming a normal brain into an epileptic one remain largely unknown. Hyperpolarizing inhibition mediated by type A GABA (GABAA) receptors is dependent on chloride extrusion by the neuron-specific type 2K+–Cl− cotransporter (KCC2). Loss-of-function mutations in KCC2 are a known cause of infantile epilepsy in humans and KCC2 dysfunction is present in patients with both idiopathic and acquired epilepsy.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Neurons have diverse molecular, morphological, connectional and functional properties. We believe that the only realistic way to manage this complexity — and thereby pave the way for understanding the structure, function and development of brain circuits — is to group neurons into types, which can &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used antidepressants; however, their mechanism of action is elusive. The authors here show that activation of serotonin 5-HT1B receptors on cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons (CCK neurons) in the dentate gyrus underlies the effects of acute SSRI treatment on &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuronal loss is a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD), but the mechanisms through which the neurons die are unclear. Here, the authors described evidence for the activation of necroptosis — a programmed form of necrosis that has been implicated in multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functional connectivity analyses of group data have revealed several large-scale distributed brain networks, including the default network (DN), frontoparietal control network (FPN) and dorsal attention network (dATN); however, few studies have examined network organization within individual subjects. The authors performed multiple functional MRI scans in &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuropathic pain is a common adverse effect of chemotherapeutic agents, such as oxaliplatin. The authors here showed that antibiotic-mediated eradication of the gut microbiota protects mice against both oxaliplatin-induced inflammation in the dorsal root ganglia and mechanical hyperalgesia. The permissive effect of the gut microbiota &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The likelihood of winning a bout of competitive behaviour is increased by past wins, and the neural circuitry underlying this crucial determinant of social rank in a group of mice is identified as a projection from the mediodorsal thalamus to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
