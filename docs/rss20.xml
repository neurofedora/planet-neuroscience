	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Structure and variability of delay activity in premotor cortex</title>

Voluntary movements are widely considered to be planned before they are executed. Recent studies have hypothesized that neural activity in motor cortex during preparation acts as an ‘initial condition’ which seeds the proceeding neural dynamics. Here, we studied these initial conditions in detail by investigating 1) the organization of neural states for different reaches and 2) the variance of these neural states from trial to trial. We examined population-level responses in macaque premotor cortex (PMd) during the preparatory stage of an instructed-delay center-out reaching task with dense target configurations. We found that after target onset the neural activity on single trials converges to neural states that have a clear low-dimensional structure which is organized by both the reach endpoint and maximum speed of the following reach. Further, we found that variability of the neural states during preparation resembles the spatial variability of reaches made in the absence of visual feedback: there is less variability in direction than distance in neural state space. We also used offline decoding to understand the implications of this neural population structure for brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). We found that decoding of angle between reaches is dependent on reach distance, while decoding of arc-length is independent. Thus, it might be more appropriate to quantify decoding performance for discrete BMIs by using arc-length between reach end-points rather than the angle between them. Lastly, we show that in contrast to the common notion that direction can better be decoded than distance, their decoding capabilities are comparable. These results provide new insights into the dynamical neural processes that underline motor control and can inform the design of BMIs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N3F6MvYWZS4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Mutation signatures in cancer genomes reflect endogenous and exogenous mutational processes, offering insights into tumour etiology, features for prognostic and biologic stratification and vulnerabilities to be exploited therapeutically. We present a novel machine learning formalism for improved signature inference, based on multi-modal correlated topic models (MMCTM) which can at once infer signatures from both single nucleotide and structural variation counts derived from cancer genome sequencing data. We exemplify the utility of our approach on two hormone driven, DNA repair deficient cancers: breast and ovary (n = 755 samples total). We show how introducing correlated structure both within and between modes of mutation can increase accuracy of signature discovery, particularly in the context of sparse data. Our study emphasizes the importance of integrating multiple mutation modes for signature discovery and patient stratification, and provides a statistical modeling framework to incorporate additional features of interest for future studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9-7X5eaEu-c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Deletion of Ripk3 Prevents Motor Neuron Death In Vitro but not In Vivo</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence suggests that necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death (PCD), contributes to neurodegeneration in several disorders, including ALS. Supporting this view, investigations in both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; models of ALS have implicated key molecular determinants of necroptosis in the death of spinal motor neurons (MNs). Consistent with a pathogenic role of necroptosis in ALS, we showed increased mRNA levels for the three main necroptosis effectors &lt;i&gt;Ripk1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ripk3&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Mlkl&lt;/i&gt; in the spinal cord of mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt;) transgenic mice (Tg), an established model of ALS. In addition, protein levels of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1; but not of RIPK3, MLKL or activated MLKL) were elevated in spinal cord extracts from these Tg SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mice. In postmortem motor cortex samples from sporadic and familial ALS patients, no change in protein levels of RIPK1 were detected. Silencing of &lt;i&gt;Ripk3&lt;/i&gt; in cultured MNs protected them from toxicity associated with SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; astrocytes. However, constitutive deletion of &lt;i&gt;Ripk3&lt;/i&gt; in Tg SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mice failed to provide behavioral or neuropathological improvement, demonstrating no similar benefit of &lt;i&gt;Ripk3&lt;/i&gt; silencing &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Lastly, we detected no genotype-specific myelin decompaction, proposed to be a proxy of necroptosis in ALS, in either Tg SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Optineurin&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice, another ALS mouse model. These findings argue against a role for RIPK3 in Tg SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt;-induced neurodegeneration and call for further preclinical investigations to determine if necroptosis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We develop a method for the automated detection and segmentation of speech
balloons in comic books, including their carrier and tails. Our method is based
on a deep convolutional neural network that was trained on annotated pages of
the Graphic Narrative Corpus. More precisely, we are using a fully
convolutional network approach inspired by the U-Net architecture, combined
with a VGG-16 based encoder. The trained model delivers state-of-the-art
performance with an F1-score of over 0.94. Qualitative results suggest that
wiggly tails, curved corners, and even illusory contours do not pose a major
problem. Furthermore, the model has learned to distinguish speech balloons from
captions. We compare our model to earlier results and discuss some possible
applications.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Assessing Olfaction Using Ultrasonic Vocalization Recordings in Mouse Pups with a Sono-olfactometer. (arXiv:1902.08087v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Olfaction is the first sensory modality to develop during fetal life in
mammals, and plays a key role in the various behaviors of neonates such as
feeding and social interaction. Odorant cues (i.e., mother or predator scents)
can trigger potentiation or inhibition of ultrasonic vocalizations (USV)
emitted by pups following their isolation. Here, we report how USV are
inhibited by olfactory cues using a sono-olfactometer that has been designed to
quantify precisely olfaction in pups congenitally infected by cytomegalovirus.
This olfactory-driven behavioral test assesses the USV emitted in presence of
unfamiliar odorants such as citral scent or adult male mouse scent. We measure
the number of USV emitted as an index of odorant detection during the three
periods of the 5-min isolation time of the pup into the sono-olfactometer:
first period without any odorant, second period with odorant exposure and last
period with exhaust odorant. This protocol can be easily used to reveal
olfactory deficits in pups with altered olfactory system due to toxic lesions
or infectious diseases.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Whole-brain computational modeling based on structural connectivity measures
has shown great promise in successfully simulating fMRI BOLD signals that
includes temporal co-activation patterns that are highly similar to empirical
functional connectivity patterns during resting state. Importantly, previous
studies have shown that spontaneous fluctuations in co-activation patterns of
distributed brain regions have an inherent dynamic nature with regard to the
frequency spectrum of intrinsic brain oscillations. In this modeling study, we
introduce frequency dynamics into a system of coupled oscillators, where each
oscillator represents the local mean-field model of a brain region. We first
show that the collective behavior of interacting oscillators reproduces
previously shown features of brain dynamics. Our analysis of static and dynamic
measures of simulated BOLD fMRI signals support the notion that the frequency
of each oscillator is modulated by flow of activity in its neighborhood.
Second, we examine the effects of simulated lesions in gray brain matter by
applying a new perturbation protocol to our model. We present a new approach to
map the effects of vulnerability in brain networks and introducing a measure of
regional hazardousness based on mapping of the degree of divergence in a
feature space consisting of graph theoretical measures.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Cross-frequency interactions during diffusion on complex networks are facilitated by scale-free properties. (arXiv:1902.07857v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We studied the interactions between different temporal scales of diffusion
processes on complex networks and found them to be stronger in scale-free (SF)
than in Erdos-Renyi (ER) networks, especially for the case of phase-amplitude
coupling (PAC)-the phenomenon where the phase of an oscillatory mode modulates
the amplitude of another oscillation. We found that SF networks facilitate PAC
between slow and fast frequency components of the diffusion process, whereas ER
networks enable PAC between slow-frequency components. Nodes contributing the
most to the generation of PAC in SF networks were non-hubs that connected with
high probability to hubs. Additionally, brain networks from healthy controls
(HC) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients presented a weaker PAC between slow
and fast frequencies than SF, but higher than ER. We found that PAC decreased
in AD compared to HC and was more strongly correlated to the scores of two
different cognitive tests than what the strength of functional connectivity
was, suggesting a link between cognitive impairment and multi-scale information
flow in the brain.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Stress-induced analgesia in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain and healthy controls. (arXiv:1902.07795v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07795</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07795</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain show impairments
in their pain-modulatory capacity. Stress-induced analgesia (SIA) is a paradigm
of endogenous pain inhibition mainly tested in animals. It has not been tested
in patients with chronic pain despite the important role of stress in pain
modulation and the chronicity process. Methods: SIA was tested in 22 patients
with chronic musculoskeletal pain and 18 healthy participants matched for age
and gender. Pain thresholds, pain tolerance and suprathreshold pain sensitivity
were examined before and after a cognitive stressor. Additionally, chronic
stress levels, pain catastrophizing and pain characteristics were assessed as
potential modulating factors. Results: Patients with chronic musculoskeletal
pain compared to healthy controls showed significantly impaired SIA
(F(1,37)=5.63, p=.02) for pain thresholds, but not pain tolerance
(F(1,37)=0.05, p=.83) and stress-induced hyperalgesia (SIH) to suprathreshold
pain ratings (F(1,37)=7.76, p=.008). Patients (r(22)=-0.50, p=.05) but not
controls (r(18)=-0.39, p=.13) with high catastrophizing had low SIA as assessed
by pain thresholds. In controls suprathreshold pain ratings were significantly
positively correlated with catastrophizing (r(18)=0.57, p=.03) and life-time
stress exposure (r(18)=0.54, p=.03). In patients neither catastrophizing
(r(22)=0.21, p=.34) nor stress exposure (r(22)=0.34, p=.34) were associated
with suprathreshold SIH. Discussion: Our data suggest impairments of SIA and
SIH in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Catastrophizing was
associated with deficient SIA in the patients and higher pain ratings in
controls. High life time stress also increased pain ratings in the controls.

	<description>Touch sensation is initiated by mechanosensory neurons that innervate distinct skin structures; however, little is known about how these neurons are patterned during mammalian skin development. We explored the cellular basis of touch-receptor patterning in mouse touch domes, which contain mechanosensory Merkel cell-neurite complexes and abut primary hair follicles. At embryonic stage 16.5 (E16.5), touch domes emerge as patches of Merkel cells and keratinocytes clustered with a previously unsuspected population of &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt;-expressing dermal cells. Epidermal Noggin overexpression at E14.5 disrupted touch-dome formation but not hair-follicle specification, demonstrating a temporally distinct requirement for BMP signaling in placode-derived structures. Surprisingly, two neuronal populations preferentially targeted touch domes during development but only one persisted in mature touch domes. Finally, Keratin-17-expressing keratinocytes but not Merkel cells were necessary to establish innervation patterns during development. These findings identify key cell types and signaling pathways required for targeting Merkel-cell afferents to discrete mechanosensory compartments.</description>

	<description>Pyomyositis is a severe bacterial infection of skeletal muscle, commonly affecting children in tropical regions, predominantly caused by &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;. To understand the contribution of bacterial genomic factors to pyomyositis, we conducted a genome-wide association study of &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; cultured from 101 children with pyomyositis and 417 children with asymptomatic nasal carriage attending the Angkor Hospital for Children, Cambodia. We found a strong relationship between bacterial genetic variation and pyomyositis, with estimated heritability 63.8% (95% CI 49.2-78.4%). The presence of the Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) locus increased the odds of pyomyositis 130-fold (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;-17.9&lt;/sup&gt;). The signal of association mapped both to the PVL-coding sequence and the sequence immediately upstream. Together these regions explained over 99.9% of heritability (95% CI 93.5-100%). Our results establish staphylococcal pyomyositis, like tetanus and diphtheria, as critically dependent on a single toxin and demonstrate the potential for association studies to identify specific bacterial genes promoting severe human disease.</description>

	<description>In epilepsy, brain networks generate pathological high-frequency oscillations (pHFOs) during interictal periods. To understand how pHFOs differ from normal oscillations in overlapping frequency bands and potentially perturb hippocampal processing, we performed high-density single unit and local field potential recordings from hippocampi of behaving rats with and without chronic epilepsy. In epileptic animals, we observed two types of co-occurring fast oscillations, which by comparison to control animals we could classify as ‘ripple-like’ or ‘pHFO’. We compared their spectral characteristics, brain state dependence, and cellular participants. Strikingly, pHFO occurred irrespective of brain state, were associated with interictal spikes, engaged distinct subnetworks of principal neurons compared to ripple-like events, increased the sparsity of network activity, and initiated both general and immediate disruptions in spatial information coding. Taken together, our findings suggest that events that result in pHFOs have an immediate impact on memory processes, corroborating the need for proper classification of pHFOs to facilitate therapeutic interventions that selectively target pathological activity.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40919</link>
	<description>In living organisms, self-organised waves of signalling activity propagate spatiotemporal information within tissues. During the development of the largest component of the visual processing centre of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; brain, a travelling wave of proneural gene expression initiates neurogenesis in the larval optic lobe primordium and drives the sequential transition of neuroepithelial cells into neuroblasts. Here, we propose that this ‘proneural wave’ is driven by an excitable reaction-diffusion system involving epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling interacting with the proneural gene &lt;i&gt;l’sc&lt;/i&gt;. Within this framework, a propagating transition zone emerges from molecular feedback and diffusion. Ectopic activation of EGFR signalling in clones within the neuroepithelium demonstrates that a transition wave can be excited anywhere in the tissue by inducing signalling activity, consistent with a key prediction of the model. Our model illuminates the physical and molecular underpinnings of proneural wave progression and suggests a generic mechanism for regulating the sequential differentiation of tissues.</description>

	<description>Deployment of covert attention to a spatial location can cause large decreases in low-frequency correlated variability among neurons in macaque area V4 whose receptive-fields lie at the attended location. It has been estimated that this reduction accounts for a substantial fraction of the attention-mediated improvement in sensory processing. These estimates depend on assumptions about how population signals are decoded and the conclusion that correlated variability impairs perception, is purely hypothetical. Here we test this proposal directly by optogenetically inducing low-frequency fluctuations, to see if this interferes with performance in an attention-demanding task. We find that low-frequency optical stimulation of neurons in V4 elevates correlations among pairs of neurons and impairs the animal's ability to make fine sensory discriminations. Stimulation at higher frequencies does not impair performance, despite comparable modulation of neuronal responses. These results support the hypothesis that attention-dependent reductions in correlated variability contribute to improved perception of attended stimuli.</description>

	<description>Navigating an odor landscape is a critical behavior for the survival of many species, including mice. One ethologically relevant mouse behavior is locating food using odor concentration gradients. To model this behavior, we use a naturalistic open field odor-based spot-finding task, examining navigation strategies as mice search for and approach an odor source. Mice were trained to navigate to odor sources paired with food reward. We detected behavioral changes consistent with localization of the odor source when mice were 10cm away from the source. These behaviors included both orientation towards the source and increased exploration time. We found that the amplitude of &quot;casting,&quot; lateral back and forth head movement, increased exponentially with proximity to the source. We then created concentration-dependent models to simulate mouse behavior, which provided evidence for a serial-sniffing strategy (sampling concentration, moving in space, then sampling again) and a stereo-sniffing strategy (inter-nostril comparison of concentration in a single sniff). Together, these results elucidate key components of behavioral strategies for odor-based navigation.</description>

	<description>Recent theories of cortical function construe the brain as performing hierarchical Bayesian inference. According to these theories, the precision of cortical unsigned prediction error (i.e., surprise) signals plays a key role in learning and decision-making, to be controlled by dopamine, and to contribute to the pathogenesis of psychosis. To test these hypotheses, we studied learning with variable outcome-precision in healthy individuals after dopaminergic modulation and in patients with early psychosis. Behavioural computational modelling indicated that precision-weighting of unsigned prediction errors benefits learning in health, and is impaired in psychosis. FMRI revealed coding of unsigned prediction errors relative to their precision in bilateral superior frontal gyri and dorsal anterior cingulate, which was perturbed by dopaminergic modulation, impaired in psychosis, and associated with task performance and schizotypy. We conclude that precision-weighting of cortical prediction error signals is a key mechanism through which dopamine modulates inference and contributes to the pathogenesis of psychosis.</description>

	<description>Predicting variability in cognition traits is an attractive and challenging area of research, where different approaches and datasets have been implemented with mixed results. Some powerful Machine Learning algorithms employed before are difficult to interpret, while other algorithms are easy to interpret but might not be as powerful. To improve understanding of individual cognitive differences in humans, we make use of the most recent developments in Machine Learning in which powerful prediction models can be interpreted with confidence. We used neuroimaging data and a variety of behavioural, cognitive, affective and health measures from 905 people obtained from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). As a main contribution of this paper, we show how one could interpret the neuroanatomical basis of cognition, with recent methods which we believe are not yet fully explored in the field. By reducing neuroimages to a well characterised set of features generated from surface-based morphometry and cortical myelin estimates, we make the interpretation of such models easier as each feature is self-explanatory. The code used in this tool is available in a public repository: https://github.com/tjiagoM/interpreting-cognition-paper-2019</description>

Assuming a linear dependence of the BOLD percent signal change on the echo time (TE) and using sparsity-promoting regularized least squares estimation, ME-SPFM yields voxelwise time-varying estimates of the changes in the transverse relaxation ({Delta}R2*) without prior knowledge of the timings of individual BOLD events. Our results in multi-echo fMRI data collected during a multi-task event-related paradigm at 3 Tesla demonstrate that the maps of R2* changes obtained with ME-SPFM at the times of the stimulus trials show high spatial and temporal concordance with the activation maps and BOLD signals obtained with standard model-based analysis. This method yields estimates of {Delta}R2* having physiologically plausible values. Owing to its ability to blindly detect events, ME-SPFM also enables us to map {Delta}R2* associated with spontaneous, transient BOLD responses occurring between trials. This framework is a step towards deciphering the dynamic nature of brain activity in naturalistic paradigms, resting-state or experimental paradigms with unknown timing of the BOLD events.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Chronic Ethanol Differentially Modulates Glutamate Release from Dorsal and Ventral Prefrontal Cortical Inputs onto Rat Basolateral Amygdala Principal Neurons</title>

	<description>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) have strong reciprocal connectivity. Projections from the BLA to the mPFC can bidirectionally modulate anxiety-related behaviors but it is unclear if the same is true for mPFC to BLA projections. Our laboratory is specifically interested in withdrawal-related anxiety-like behavior and the underlying synaptic plasticity. Here, we use optogenetics and chemogenetics to characterize the neurophysiological and behavioral alterations produced by chronic ethanol exposure and withdrawal on dorsal mPFC/prelimbic (dmPFC/PL) and ventral mPFC (vmPFC/IL) terminals in the BLA. We exposed adult male Sprague-Dawley rats to chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) using vapor chambers, measured anxiety-like behavior on the elevated zero maze (EZM), and used electrophysiology to record glutamatergic and GABAergic responses in BLA principal neurons. We found that 24-hour withdrawal following a 7-day CIE exposure significantly increased the glutamate release probability from PL/dmPFC terminals, but significantly decreases the glutamate release probability from IL/vmPFC terminals. Chemogenetic inhibition of PL/dmPFC terminals in the BLA attenuated the increased withdrawal-dependent, anxiety-like behavior. These data demonstrate that chronic ethanol exposure and withdrawal strengthens the PL/dmPFC-BLA pathway but weakens the IL/vmPFC-BLA pathway. Moreover, we provide novel evidence that the PL/dmPFC-BLA pathway can modulate anxiety-like behavior. These findings suggest that mPFC-BLA circuits known to regulate the acquisition of aversive behaviors are up-regulated by chronic ethanol while those involved with the extinction of these behaviors are down-regulated.</description>

	<description>The integration of synaptic inputs onto dendrites provides the basis for computation within individual neurons. Whereas recent studies have begun to outline the spatial organization of synaptic inputs on individual neurons, the underlying principles related to the specific neural functions is not well known. Here we performed two-photon dendritic imaging with genetically-encoded glutamate sensor in awake monkeys, and successfully mapped the excitatory synaptic inputs on dendrites of individual V1 neurons with high spatial and temporal resolution. We found that although synaptic inputs on dendrites were functionally clustered by feature, they were highly scattered in multidimensional feature space, providing a potential substrate of local feature integration on dendritic branches. We also found that nearly all individual neurons received both abundant orientation-selective and color-selective inputs. Furthermore, we found apical dendrites received more diverse inputs than basal dendrites, with larger receptive fields, and relatively longer response latencies, suggesting a specific apical role in integrating feedback in visual information processing.</description>

	<description>Microglia are resident immune cells that dynamically survey the brain parenchyma, interacting with neurons in both health and disease. However, it is still unclear how neuronal network activity drives microglial dynamics. Utilizing in vivo two-photon imaging of microglia in awake mice, we found that inhibition of neuronal activity under general anesthesia dramatically increased microglial process surveillance. Accordingly, both sensory deprivation and optogenetic inhibition of local neuronal network activity in awake mice resulted in similar increases in microglial process surveillance. We further determined that reduced norepinephrine signaling is responsible for the observed increase in microglial process surveillance. Our results demonstrate that microglial process dynamics are directly influenced by neural activities through norepinephrine signaling in awake animals and indicate the importance of awake imaging for studying microglia-neuron interactions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Consciousness as a Concrete Physical Phenomenon</title>

	<description>Why any type of neural activation is associated with subjective, conscious experience is a fundamental unsolved question in neuroscience. To bridge the gap between neural activity and conscious experience, one seemingly must tie together two very different entities. The paradigmatic view in consciousness science is that subjective experiences are private and cannot be scientifically observed or described: science can only discover correlations between subjective experiences and their neural realizers, but never observe or describe the experiences themselves. We present a metatheory of consciousness that explains how subjective experiences are related to empirical observations and models, and why the two appear so different from each other. We argue that consciousness is a concrete physical process that causally interacts with other physical phenomena. This entails that consciousness can be empirically observed and characterized. The reason why subjective experiences and empirical observations and models of them appear so different is explained by what we call the observer-observed distinction. Empirical observations are always distinct from the observer, but a subject and her experiences constitute a single physical-biological system. We argue that once science has completely described 1) the constitutive neural mechanisms that are isomorphic with experiences, 2) the etiological mechanisms that experiences are based on, and 3) their causal power, then science has provided an exhaustive description of phenomenology. Our conclusion is that, if we accept this framework we call Naturalistic Monism, consciousness collapses into a standard problem of science.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Importance of Anti-Correlations in Graph Theory Based Classification of Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/557512v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>In recent years, there has been a significant growth in the number of applications of machine learning (ML) techniques to the study and identification of neurological disorders. These methods rely heavily on what features are made available to the ML algorithm. Features such as graph theoretical metrics of resting-state fMRI-based brain networks have proven useful. However, the computation of functional brain networks relies on making an arbitrary choice about whether the obtained anti-correlations, representing the strengths of functional connections in the brain, should be discarded or not. In this study, we examine how this choice affects the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) model for classifying autism spectrum disorder. We extracted graph theoretical features using three different pipelines for constructing the functional network graph. These pipelines primarily used positive weights, negative weights (anti-correlations) and only the absolute value of weights of the correlation matrix derived from fMRI time-series. Our results suggest that in the presence of Global Signal Regression (GSR) the features extracted from anti-correlations play a major role in improving model performance. However, this does not undermine the importance of features from other pipelines.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A voltage-based metaplasticity rule applied to the model hippocampal granule cell accounts for homeostatic heterosynaptic plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/557173v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/557173v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic efficacies are involved in establishment of long-term memories. In this process, neurons need to adjust the overall efficacy of their synapses by using mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity to balance their activity and control their firing rate. For instance, in the dentate granule cell in vivo, induction of homosynaptic LTP in the tetanized medial perforant path is accompanied by heterosynaptic LTD in the non-tetanized lateral perforant path. We used the compartmental model of this cell to test the following hypotheses: 1. Using plasticity and metaplasticity rules both based on postsynaptic voltage we can reproduce homosynaptic LTP and concurrent heterosynaptic LTD, provided there is an ongoing noisy spontaneous activity; 2. Frequency of an ongoing noisy spontaneous activity along the lateral path determines the magnitude of heterosynaptic LTD. In experiments where procaine was used to block the lateral spontaneous activity, no heterosynaptic LTD occurred. However, when the procaine was washed out and a second tetanization was applied to the medial path, no heterosynaptic LTD could have been induced neither. Our simulations predict that the reduced frequency of spontaneous activity in the lateral perforant path can account for this lasting absence of heterosynaptic LTD.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Altered brain morphology in boys with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder with and without comorbid conduct disorder/oppositional defiant disorder</title>

	<description>About 50% of ADHD patients suffer from comorbidity with oppositional defiant disorder/conduct disorder (ODD/CD). Most previous studies on structural morphology did not differentiate between pure ADHD (ADHD-only) and ADHD with comorbid ODD/CD (ADHD+ODD/CD) and only focused on specific measures (e.g. volumetric differences), leading to inconsistent results. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the structural profile of ADHD-only versus ADHD+ODD/CD spanning different indices, i.e. subcortical and cortical volume, cortical thickness, and surface area. We aimed to disentangle disorder-specific etiological contributions regarding structural brain alterations and expected similar and differential alterations between the patient groups. We acquired structural images from an adolescent sample range (11 to 17 years) matched with regard to age, pubertal status, and IQ - including 36 boys with ADHD-only, 26 boys with ADHD+ODD/CD, and 30 typically developing boys (TD). We analyzed subcortical and cortical volume, cortical thickness, and surface area with FreeSurfer. We found reductions in total gray matter and right cerebellar volume as well as total surface area for both patient groups. For the left cerebellar volume ADHD+ODD/CD, but not ADHD only differed from TD. Boys with ADHD+ODD/CD had a thicker cortex than the other groups in a right rostral middle frontal cluster, which was related to stronger ODD/CD symptoms, even when controlling for ADHD symptoms. No group differences in local cortical volume or surface area emerged. Overall, we found similarities but also differences in brain morphology between the two related disorders. Patients with a double burden seem to be even more affected than patients with pure ADHD.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Independent working memory resources for egocentric and allocentric spatial information</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by David Aagten-Murphy, Paul M. Bays&lt;/p&gt;

Visuospatial working memory enables us to maintain access to visual information for processing even when a stimulus is no longer present, due to occlusion, our own movements, or transience of the stimulus. Here we show that, when localizing remembered stimuli, the precision of spatial recall does not rely solely on memory for individual stimuli, but additionally depends on the relative distances between stimuli and visual landmarks in the surroundings. Across three separate experiments, we consistently observed a spatially selective improvement in the precision of recall for items located near a persistent landmark. While the results did not require that the landmark be visible throughout the memory delay period, it was essential that it was visible both during encoding and response. We present a simple model that can accurately capture human performance by considering relative (allocentric) spatial information as an independent localization estimate which degrades with distance and is optimally integrated with egocentric spatial information. Critically, allocentric information was encoded without cost to egocentric estimation, demonstrating independent storage of the two sources of information. Finally, when egocentric and allocentric estimates were put in conflict, the model successfully predicted the resulting localization errors. We suggest that the relative distance between stimuli represents an additional, independent spatial cue for memory recall. This cue information is likely to be critical for spatial localization in natural settings which contain an abundance of visual landmarks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zTQCOc-GLrU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

This simple concept underlies rapid electrical signaling in the brain as well as several important aspects of neural plasticity. Although the soma accounts for less than 1% of many neurons by membrane area, it has been the major site of measuring ion channel function. However, the axon is one of the longest processes found in cellular biology and hosts a multitude of critical signaling functions in the brain. Not only does the axon initiate and rapidly propagate action potentials (APs) across the brain but it also forms the presynaptic terminals that convert these electrical inputs into chemical outputs. Here, we review recent advances in the physiological role of ion channels within the diverse landscape of the axon and presynaptic terminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

the acoustic informational mix, determine which sources are of interest, decide
whether extra resources should be allocated to extracting more information from
them, or act upon them. While decision making is a high-level process that is
accomplished by the listener's cognition, selection and elimination of acoustic
information is manifest along the entire auditory system, from periphery to
cortex. This review examines latent informational paradigms in hearing research
and demonstrates how several hearing mechanisms conspire to gradually eliminate
information from the auditory sensory channel. It is motivated through the
computational need of the brain to decomplexify unpredictable real-world
signals in real time. Decomplexification through information loss is suggested
to constitute a unifying principle of the mammalian hearing system, which is
specifically demonstrated in human hearing. This perspective can be readily
generalised to other sensory modalities.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain cortical layer has a convoluted morphology that is unique to
each individual. Characterization of the cortical morphology is necessary in
longitudinal studies of structural brain change, as well as in discriminating
individuals in health and disease. A method for encoding the cortical
morphology in the form of a graph is presented. The design of graphs that
encode the global cerebral hemisphere cortices as well as localized cortical
regions is proposed. Spectral metrics derived from these graphs are then
studied and proposed as descriptors of cortical morphology. As proof-of-concept
of their applicability in characterizing cortical morphology, the metrics are
studied in the context of hemispheric asymmetry as well as gender dependent
discrimination of cortical morphology.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Assessment of cortical reorganization and preserved function in phantom limb pain: a methodological perspective. (arXiv:1902.07268v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Phantom limb pain (PLP) has been associated with both the reorganization of
the somatotopic map in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and preserved S1
function. Here we assessed the nature of the information (sensory, motor) that
reaches S1 and methodological differences in the assessment of cortical
representations that might explain these findings. We used functional magnetic
resonance imaging during a virtual hand motor task, analogous to the classical
mirror box task, in amputees with and without PLP and in matched controls. We
assessed the relationship between task-related activation maxima and PLP
intensity in S1 versus motor (M1) maps. We also measured cortical distances
between the location of activation maxima using region of interest (ROI),
defined from individual or group analyses. Amputees showed significantly
increased activity in M1 and S1 compared to controls, which was not
significantly related to PLP intensity. The location of activation maxima
differed between groups depending on M1 and S1 maps. Neural activity was
positively related to PLP only in amputees with pain and only if a
group-defined ROI was chosen. These findings show that the analysis of changes
in S1 versus M1 yields different results, possibly indicating different
pain-related processes.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We develop a theoretical framework for defining and identifying flows of
information in computational systems. Here, a computational system is assumed
to be a directed graph, with &quot;clocked&quot; nodes that send transmissions to each
other along the edges of the graph at discrete points in time. A few measures
of information flow have been proposed previously in the literature, and
measures of directed causal influence are currently being used as a heuristic
proxy for information flow. However, there is as yet no rigorous treatment of
the problem with formal definitions and clearly stated assumptions, and the
process of defining information flow is often conflated with the problem of
estimating it. In this work, we provide a new information-theoretic definition
for information flow in a computational system, which we motivate using a
series of examples. We then show that this definition satisfies intuitively
desirable properties, including the existence of &quot;information paths&quot;, along
which information flows from the input of the computational system to its
output. Finally, we describe how information flow might be estimated in a
noiseless setting, and provide an algorithm to identify information paths on
the time-unrolled graph of a computational system.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: MYOD1 functions as a clock amplifier as well as a critical co-factor for downstream circadian gene expression in muscle</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.43017</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43017</link>
	<description>In the present study we show that the master myogenic regulatory factor, MYOD1, is a positive modulator of molecular clock amplitude and functions with the core clock factors for expression of clock-controlled genes in skeletal muscle. We demonstrate that MYOD1 directly regulates the expression and circadian amplitude of the positive core clock factor &lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt;. We identify a non-canonical E-box element in &lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt; and demonstrate that is required for full MYOD1-responsiveness. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays demonstrate that MYOD1 colocalizes with both BMAL1 and CLOCK throughout myonuclei. We demonstrate that MYOD1 and BMAL1:CLOCK work in a synergistic fashion through a tandem E-box to regulate the expression and amplitude of the muscle specific clock-controlled gene, Titin-cap (&lt;i&gt;Tcap&lt;/i&gt;). In conclusion, these findings reveal mechanistic roles for the muscle specific transcription factor MYOD1 in the regulation of molecular clock amplitude as well as synergistic regulation of clock-controlled genes in skeletal muscle.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: An updated phylogeny of the Alphaproteobacteria reveals that the Rickettsiales and Holosporales have independent origins</title>

	<description>The &lt;i&gt;Alphaproteobacteria&lt;/i&gt; is an extraordinarily diverse and ancient group of bacteria. Previous attempts to infer its deep phylogeny have been plagued with methodological artefacts. To overcome this, we analyzed a dataset of 200 single-copy and conserved genes and employed diverse strategies to reduce compositional artefacts. Such strategies include using novel dataset-specific profile mixture models and recoding schemes, and removing sites, genes and taxa that are compositionally biased. We show that the &lt;i&gt;Rickettsiales&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Holosporales&lt;/i&gt; (both groups of intracellular parasites of eukaryotes) are not sisters to each other, but instead, the &lt;i&gt;Holosporales&lt;/i&gt; has a derived position within the &lt;i&gt;Rhodospirillales&lt;/i&gt;. A synthesis of our results also leads to an updated proposal for the higher-level taxonomy of the &lt;i&gt;Alphaproteobacteria&lt;/i&gt;. Our robust consensus phylogeny will serve as a framework for future studies that aim to place mitochondria, and novel environmental diversity, within the &lt;i&gt;Alphaproteobacteria&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41563</link>
	<description>Cortical networks are characterized by sparse connectivity, with synapses found at only a subset of axo-dendritic contacts. Yet within these networks, neurons can exhibit high connection probabilities, suggesting that cell-intrinsic factors, not proximity, determine connectivity. Here, we identify ephrin-B3 (eB3) as a factor that determines synapse density by mediating a cell-cell competition that requires ephrin-B-EphB signaling. In a microisland culture system designed to isolate cell-cell competition, we find that eB3 determines winning and losing neurons in a contest for synapses. In a Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM) genetic mouse model system in vivo the relative levels of eB3 control spine density in layer 5 and 6 neurons. MADM cortical neurons in vitro reveal that eB3 controls synapse density independently of action potential-driven activity. Our findings illustrate a new class of competitive mechanism mediated by trans-synaptic organizing proteins which control the number of synapses neurons receive relative to neighboring neurons.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Activation mechanism of ATP-sensitive K+ channels explored with real-time nucleotide binding</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.41103</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41103</link>
	<description>The response of ATP-sensitive K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt;) to cellular metabolism is coordinated by three classes of nucleotide binding site (NBS). We used a novel approach involving labeling of intact channels in a native, membrane environment with a non-canonical fluorescent amino acid and measurement (using FRET with fluorescent nucleotides) of steady-state and time-resolved nucleotide binding to dissect the role of NBS2 of the accessory SUR1 subunit of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; in channel gating. Binding to NBS2 was Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-independent, but Mg was required to trigger a conformational change in SUR1. Mutation of a lysine (K1384A) in NBS2 that coordinates bound nucleotides increased the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; for trinitrophenyl-ADP binding to NBS2, but only in the presence of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, indicating that this mutation disrupts the ligand-induced conformational change. Comparison of nucleotide-binding with ionic currents suggests a model in which each nucleotide binding event to NBS2 of SUR1 is independent and promotes K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; activation by the same amount.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Developmental changes in the processing of faces as revealed by EEG decoding</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/557447v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/557447v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Rapidly and accurately processing information from faces is a critical human function that is known to improve with developmental age. Understanding the underlying drivers of this improvement remains a contentious question, with debate continuing as to the presence of early vs. late maturation of face processing mechanisms. Recent behavioural evidence suggests an important hallmark of expert face processing, the face inversion effect, is present in very young children, yet neural support for this remains unclear. To address this, we conducted a detailed investigation of the neural dynamics of face-selective processing in children spanning a range of ages (6 to 11 years) and adults. Uniquely, we applied multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to the electroencephalogram signal (EEG) to test for the presence of a distinct neural profile associated with canonical upright faces when compared both to other objects (houses) and to inverted faces. Results revealed robust discrimination profiles, at the individual level, of differentiated neural activity associated with broad face categorization and further with its expert processing, as indexed by the face inversion effect, from the youngest ages tested. This result is consistent with an early functional maturation of broad face processing mechanisms. Yet, clear quantitative differences between the response profile of children and adults is suggestive of age-related refinement of this system with developing face and general expertise. Standard ERP analysis also provides some support for qualitative differences in the neural response to inverted faces in children in contrast to adults. This neural profile is in line with recent behavioural studies that have reported impressively expert early face abilities during childhood, while also providing novel evidence of the ongoing neural specialisation between child and adulthood.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Association Between The Posterior Part Of The Circle Of Willis And Vertebral Artery Hypoplasia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/557397v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/557397v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background. It is not clear whether the configuration of the posterior part of the circle of Willis (CW) depends on the proximal part of the vertebrobasilar system. Our aim is to evaluate the posterior part of CW in association with different size of vertebral arteries (VA) in subjects free from stroke and TIA. Materials and methods. The present study was based on a sample of 923 subjects free from stroke and TIA who were examined from 2013 through 2018. All the participants underwent MRA examination. The duplex ultrasonographic examination of the extracranial arteries (vertebral and carotid) was performed. VA was defined as hypoplastic (VAH) when VA diameter in the entire course was less than 2.5 mm. We classified the posterior communicating arteries (PCoA) as presence PCoA, absence/hypoplastic PCoA and fetal CW (FCW). The comparison of the posterior part of CW was made in subjects with normal VA and VAH of a different degree (communicating with basilar artery (VAH-BA) and not communicating with the basilar artery and terminating in PICA, neck or aplasia (VAH-PICA)). Results. FCW was found in 15.9% of subjects, bilaterally - in 2.3 %. The coexisting VAH was more common in subjects with FCW rather than in those with adult CW (respectively, 28.6% and 13.4%, p&amp;lt;0.001). Aplasia of A1 of the anterior cerebral artery, i.e. blood flow redistribution in the anterior part of anterior circulation in the majority of cases (in 6 of 7 cases) was found ipsilaterally to FCW. FCW was recorded in 50% of the subjects with VA - PICA in comparison with 13.5% of those with normal VA and 22.8% with VAH - BA, p&amp;lt;0.005. On the contrary, absence/hypoplasia of both PCoA was mostly found in the group with normal VA in comparison with VAH-BA and VAH-PICA (accordingly, 50.7%, 38.6% and 12.5%, p&amp;lt;0.01). Conclusion. Individuals with VAH have a different pattern of the posterior part of CW in comparison with those with normal VA. With the increasing degree of VAH, the proportion of FCW increases, while the proportion of absence/hypoplastic of both PCoA decreases.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Polymodal Sensory Thalamic Inputs to the Rat Lateral Amygdala are Facilitated by Chronic Ethanol Exposure and Regulate Withdrawal-associated Anxiety</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/557256v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/557256v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Thalamic projections to the lateral amygdala regulate the acquisition of conditioned aversive and reward-related behaviors. Recent work suggests that exposure to chronic ethanol up-regulates presynaptic function of lateral amygdala stria terminalis inputs which contain projections from somatosensory thalamic nuclei. To understand potential contributions by thalamic inputs and their role in the expression of withdrawal-associated aversive behaviors, we integrated optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches with in vitro measures of synaptic function and anxiety-like behavior. We found that expression of Channelrhodopsin in the caudal extension of the posterior thalamic group (cPO) produced monosynaptic glutamatergic synaptic responses in lateral amygdala principal neurons that could be inhibited by co-expression of the hM4-Gi-DREADD. Chronic ethanol exposure increased glutamate release from these cPO terminals but did not impact inhibition by the DREADD agonist, CNO. Systemic injection of CNO specifically reduced withdrawal-related increases in anxiety-like behaviors in animals expressing the Gi-DREADD in cPO. And, microinjection of CNO directly into the lateral amygdala mimicked this anti-anxiety effect. These findings suggest that the cPO-LA circuit is vulnerable to chronic ethanol exposure and plays an important role in regulating anxiety-like behavior following chronic ethanol exposure.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Identifying cortical substrates underlying the phenomenology of stereopsis and realness: A pilot fMRI study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/557157v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/557157v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Viewing a real scene or a stereoscopic image (e.g. 3D movies) with both eyes yields a vivid subjective impression of object solidity, tangibility, immersive negative space and sense of realness; something that is not experienced when viewing single pictures of 3D scenes normally with both eyes. This phenomenology, sometimes referred to as stereopsis, is conventionally ascribed to the derivation of depth from the differences in the two eye's images (binocular disparity). Here we report on a pilot study designed to explore if dissociable neural activity associated with the phenomenology of realness can be localised in the cortex. In order to dissociate subjective impression from disparity processing, we capitalised on the finding that the impression of realness associated with stereoscopic viewing can also be generated when viewing a single picture of a 3D scene with one eye through an aperture. Under a blocked fMRI design, subjects viewed intact and scrambled images of natural 3-D objects and scenes under three viewing conditions: (1) single pictures viewed normally with both eyes (binocular) (2) single pictures viewed with one eye through an aperture (monocular-aperture); (3) stereoscopic anaglyph images of the same scenes viewed with both eyes (binocular stereopsis). Fixed-effects GLM contrasts aimed at isolating the phenomenology of stereopsis demonstrated a selective recruitment of similar posterior parietal regions for both monocular and binocular stereopsis conditions. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that the cortical processing underlying the subjective impression of realness may be dissociable and distinct from the derivation of depth from disparity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Using extracellular low frequency signals to improve the spike sorting of cerebellar complex spikes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/556985v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/556985v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The challenge of spike sorting has been addressed by numerous electrophysiological studies. These methods tend to focus on the information conveyed by the high frequencies, but ignore the potentially informative signals at lower frequencies. Activation of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum by input from the climbing fibers results in a large amplitude dendritic spike concurrent with a high frequency burst known as a complex spike. Due to the variability in the high frequency component of complex spikes, previous methods have struggled to sort these complex spikes in an accurate and reliable way. However, complex spikes have a prominent extracellular low frequency signal generated by the input from the climbing fibers. We exploited this to improve complex spike sorting by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the low frequencies of the signal and show that the low frequency first PC achieves a better separation of the complex spikes from noise. The low frequency data are more effective in detecting events entering into the analysis, and therefore can be harnessed to analyze the data with a larger signal to noise ratio. These two advantages make our method more effective for complex spike sorting. Our characterization of the dendritic low frequency components of complex spikes can be applied in other studies to gain insights into processing in the cerebellum.</description>

	<description>Fast and slow decisions exhibit distinct behavioral properties, such as the presence of decision bias in faster but not slower responses. This dichotomy is currently explained by assuming that distinct cognitive processes map to separate brain mechanisms. Here, we suggest an alternative, single-process account based on the stochastic properties of decision processes. Our experimental results show perceptual biases in a variety of tasks (specifically: learned priors, tilt illusion, and tilt aftereffect) that were much reduced with increasing reaction time. To account for this, we consider a simple yet general explanation: prior and noisy decision-related evidence are integrated serially, with evidence and noise accumulating over time (as in the standard drift diffusion model). With time, owing to noise accumulation, the prior effect is predicted to diminish. This illustrates that a clear behavioral separation - presence vs. absence of bias - may reflect a simple stochastic mechanism.</description>

	<description>Aging is associated with an increased ability to delay gratification. Moreover, even when matched for performance, young and aged subjects recruit distinct brain circuitry to complete complex cognitive tasks. Experiments herein used an optogenetic approach to test whether altered recruitment of the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a brain region implicated in valuation of reward-cost contingencies, contributes to age-dependent changes in intertemporal decision making. BLA inactivation while rats deliberated prior to choices between options that yielded either small, immediate or large, delayed rewards rendered both young and aged rats less impulsive. In contrast, BLA inactivation after choices were made (during evaluation of choice outcomes) rendered young rats more impulsive but had no effect in aged rats. These data define multiple, temporally-discrete roles for BLA circuits in intertemporal decision making and implicate altered recruitment of BLA in the elevated preference for delayed rewards that is characteristic of advanced age.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Novel transcriptome-based polygenic risk score for depression is associated with neural processing of social stimuli</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/556852v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Background: Convergent data from imaging and postmortem brain transcriptome studies implicate corticolimbic circuit (CLC) dysregulation in the pathophysiology of depression. To more directly bridge these lines of work, we generated a novel transcriptome-based polygenic risk score (T-PRS), capturing subtle shifts towards depression-like gene expression patterns. We then mapped this T-PRS onto CLC function and related depressive symptoms in a non-clinical sample of young adults. Methods: Genetic, self-report, and neuroimaging data were available in 482 Duke Neurogenetics Study participants (226 men; age 19.78+/-1.23). T-PRS was generated based on common functional SNPs shifting gene expression in the brain towards a depression-like state. We used multivariate partial least squares regression to map T-PRS onto whole-brain activity patterns during perceptual processing of social stimuli (i.e., human faces). Posthoc univariate analyses followed up on the link between T-PRS and amygdala reactivity to neutral and threatening faces. For comparison, we generated a PRS summarizing depression risk variants identified by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC-PRS). Sex was modeled as moderating factor. Results: T-PRS was associated with male-specific reductions in neural response to neutral faces in a widespread network of cortical and subcortical regions (multivariate p=0.03) including the amygdala (beta=-0.14, p=0.04). These results mirrored patterns associated with PGC-PRS independently of sex (ps&amp;lt;0.01). Reduced reactivity to neutral faces was further associated with increased self-reported anhedonia. Conclusions: We demonstrate for the first time that in men functional SNPs mimicking the postmortem transcriptomic signature of depression are associated with blunted neural activity to social stimuli, which may be expressed as increased anhedonia.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Delta and theta neural entrainment during phonological and semantic processing in speech perception</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/556837v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Neural entrainment of acoustic envelopes is important for speech intelligibility in spoken language processing. However, it is unclear how it contributes to processing at different linguistic hierarchical levels. The present EEG study investigated this issue when participants responded to stimuli that dissociated phonological and semantic processing (real-word, pseudo-word and backward utterances). Multivariate Temporal Response Function (mTRF) model was adopted to map speech envelopes from multiple spectral bands onto EEG signals, providing a direct approach to measure neural entrainment. We tested the hypothesis that entrainment at delta (supra-syllabic) and theta (syllabic and sub-syllabic) bands take distinct roles at different hierarchical levels. Results showed that both types of entrainment involve speech-specific processing, but their underlying mechanisms were different. Theta-band entrainment was modulated by phonological but not semantic contents, reflecting the possible mechanism of tracking syllabic- and sub-syllabic patterns during phonological processing. Delta-band entrainment, on the other hand, was modulated by semantic information, indexing more attention-demanding, effortful phonological encoding when higher-level (semantic) information is deficient. Interestingly, we further demonstrated the statistical capacity of mTRFs at the delta-band and theta-band to classify utterances according to their semantic (real-word vs. pseudo-word) and phonological (real-word and pseudo-word vs. backward) contents, respectively. Moreover, analyses on the response weighting of mTRFs showed that delta-band entrainment sustained across neural processing stages up to higher-order timescales (~ 300 ms), while theta-band entrainment occurred mainly at early, perceptual processing stages (&amp;lt; 160 ms). This indicates that, compared to theta-band entrainment, delta-band entrainment may reflect increased involvement of higher-order cognitive functions during interactions between phonological and semantic processing. As such, we conclude that neural entrainment is not only associated with speech intelligibility, but also with the hierarchy of linguistic (phonological and semantic) content. The present study thus provide a new insight into cognitive mechanisms of neural entrainment for spoken language processing.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Machine learning analysis of gene expression data reveals novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and identifies therapeutic targets for soft tissue sarcomas</title>

Based on morphology it is often challenging to distinguish between the many different soft tissue sarcoma subtypes. Moreover, outcome of disease is highly variable even between patients with the same disease. Machine learning on transcriptome sequencing data could be a valuable new tool to understand differences between and within entities. Here we used machine learning analysis to identify novel diagnostic and prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for soft tissue sarcomas. Gene expression data was used from the Cancer Genome Atlas, the Genotype-Tissue Expression data and the French Sarcoma Group. We identified three groups of tumors that overlap in their molecular profile as seen with unsupervised t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding clustering and a deep neural network. The three groups corresponded to subtypes that are morphologically overlapping. Using a random forest algorithm, we identified novel diagnostic markers for soft tissue sarcoma that distinguished between synovial sarcoma and MPNST, and that we validated using qRT-PCR in an independent series. Next, we identified prognostic genes that are strong predictors of disease outcome when used in a k-nearest neighbor algorithm. The prognostic genes were further validated in expression data from the French Sarcoma Group. One of these, &lt;i&gt;HMMR&lt;/i&gt;, was validated in an independent series of leiomyosarcomas using immunohistochemistry on tissue micro array as a prognostic gene for disease-free interval. Furthermore, reconstruction of regulatory networks combined with data from the Connectivity Map showed, amongst others, that HDAC inhibitors could be a potential effective therapy for multiple soft tissue sarcoma subtypes. A viability assay with two HDAC inhibitors confirmed that both leiomyosarcoma and synovial sarcoma are sensitive to HDAC inhibition. In this study we identified novel diagnostic markers, prognostic markers and therapeutic leads from multiple soft tissue sarcoma gene expression datasets. Thus, machine learning algorithms are powerful new tools to improve our understanding of rare tumor entities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nvDdAFQafQ0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: High frequency oscillation networks and surgical outcome in adult focal epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25442?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25442?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether high frequency oscillations (HFOs) show spatiotemporal propagation and assess the relevance of the earliest oscillations in relation to the seizure onset zone and postsurgical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We retrospectively investigated the intracerebral EEG of patients who became seizure free after subsequent surgery. We marked HFOs during one hour of recordings. We calculated the time delay between pairs of channels as the median delay between their HFOs, and constructed a time line of the delay of each channel with respect to the earliest channel (first source channel). A network was defined when a temporal order could be established among the channels based on the existence of statistically significant delays.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen patients with good surgical outcome were included. We found ripple networks in all patients, and fast ripple networks in 9. For ripples, first source channels were found in a higher proportion in the seizure onset zone than the rest of the network channels (15/27, 56% vs. 93/262, 35%; p=0.04). For both ripples and fast ripples, first source channels were resected more often that the rest of the network channels (Ripples: 13/27, 48% vs. 65/262, 25%; p=0.01. Fast ripples: 8/9, 89% vs. 17/40, 43%; p=0.002); channels with the highest rates of ripples and fast ripples were resected in a similar proportion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate that interictal HFOs are organized in networks, and indicate a possible need for the resection of first source channels. However, resecting them is not superior to resecting channels with highest rates of HFOs.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 1990s we estimated the genetic contribution to Parkinson's disease risk in a large population‐based twin registry. Because many unaffected twins were still alive, prior concordance estimates were based on incomplete information. 95% of twins are now deceased. Here we update concordance and heritability through 2015 using National Death Index data. In total, we identified 30 concordant and 193 discordant pairs. Probandwise concordance was 0.20 in monozygotic and 0.13 in dizygotic pairs. Heritability was 0.27 overall, 0.83 in pairs diagnosed &lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;50, and 0.19 in pairs diagnosed &amp;gt;50. High concordance in dizygotic twins suggests shared effects of early childhood environment.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we examined the potential causal effect of smoking on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using the Project MinE data involving 12,577 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 23,475 controls in a Mendelian randomization (MR) framework. The MR approach has the potential to investigate causal relationship between a risk factor and a disease, avoiding confounding and information bias that often present in conventional epidemiological studies. We found that smokers had a higher risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis compared to never smokers. Our study thus provides evidence for a causal relationship between smoking and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Increased Resurgent Sodium Currents in Nav1.8 Contribute to Nociceptive Sensory Neuron Hyperexcitability Associated with Peripheral Neuropathies</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuropathic pain is a significant public health challenge, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Painful small fiber neuropathy (SFN) may be caused by gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.8, a sodium channel subtype predominantly expressed in peripheral nociceptive neurons. However, it is not clear how Nav1.8 disease mutations induce sensory neuron hyperexcitability. Here we studied two mutations in Nav1.8 associated with hypersensitive sensory neurons: G1662S reported in painful SFN; and T790A, which underlies increased pain behaviors in the &lt;i&gt;Possum&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mouse strain. We show that, in male DRG neurons, these mutations, which impair inactivation, significantly increase TTX-resistant resurgent sodium currents mediated by Nav1.8. The G1662S mutation doubled resurgent currents, and the T790A mutation increased them fourfold. These unusual currents are typically evoked during the repolarization phase of action potentials. We show that the T790A mutation greatly enhances DRG neuron excitability by reducing current threshold and increasing firing frequency. Interestingly, the mutation endows DRG neurons with multiple early afterdepolarizations and leads to substantial prolongation of action potential duration. In DRG neurons, siRNA knockdown of sodium channel β4 subunits fails to significantly alter T790A current density but reduces TTX-resistant resurgent currents by 56%. Furthermore, DRG neurons expressing T790A channels exhibited reduced excitability with fewer early afterdepolarizations and narrower action potentials after β4 knockdown. Together, our data demonstrate that open-channel block of TTX-resistant currents, enhanced by gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.8, can make major contributions to the hyperexcitability of nociceptive neurons, likely leading to altered sensory phenotypes including neuropathic pain in SFN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This work demonstrates that two disease mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 that induce nociceptor hyperexcitability increase resurgent currents. Nav1.8 is crucial for pain sensations. Because resurgent currents are evoked during action potential repolarization, they can be crucial regulators of action potential activity. Our data indicate that increased Nav1.8 resurgent currents in DRG neurons greatly prolong action potential duration and enhance repetitive firing. We propose that Nav1.8 open-channel block is a major factor in Nav1.8-associated pain mechanisms and that targeting the molecular mechanism underlying these unique resurgent currents represents a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of aberrant pain sensations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Overreactivity and defensive behaviors in response to tactile stimuli are common symptoms in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. Similarly, somatosensory hypersensitivity has also been described in mice lacking ASD-associated genes such as &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; (fragile X mental retardation protein 1). &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice also show reduced functional connectivity between sensory cortical areas, which may represent an endogenous biomarker for their hypersensitivity. Here, we measured whole-brain functional connectivity in &lt;i&gt;Engrailed-2&lt;/i&gt; knock-out (&lt;i&gt;En2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) adult mice, which show a lower expression of &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; and anatomical defects common to &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knock-outs. MRI-based resting-state functional connectivity in adult &lt;i&gt;En2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice revealed significantly reduced synchronization in somatosensory-auditory/associative cortices and dorsal thalamus, suggesting the presence of aberrant somatosensory processing in these mutants. Accordingly, when tested in the whisker nuisance test, &lt;i&gt;En2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; but not WT mice of both sexes showed fear behavior in response to repeated whisker stimulation. &lt;i&gt;En2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice undergoing this test exhibited decreased c-Fos-positive neurons (a marker of neuronal activity) in layer IV of the primary somatosensory cortex and increased immunoreactive cells in the basolateral amygdala compared with WT littermates. Conversely, when tested in a sensory maze, &lt;i&gt;En2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; and WT mice spent a comparable time in whisker-guided exploration, indicating that whisker-mediated behaviors are otherwise preserved in &lt;i&gt;En2&lt;/i&gt; mutants. Therefore, fearful responses to somatosensory stimuli in &lt;i&gt;En2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice are accompanied by reduced basal connectivity of sensory regions, reduced activation of somatosensory cortex, and increased activation of the basolateral amygdala, suggesting that impaired somatosensory processing is a common feature in mice lacking ASD-related genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Overreactivity to tactile stimuli is a common symptom in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. Recent studies performed in mice bearing ASD-related mutations confirmed these findings. Here, we evaluated the behavioral response to whisker stimulation in mice lacking the ASD-related gene &lt;i&gt;Engrailed-2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;En2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice). Compared with WT controls, &lt;i&gt;En2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed reduced functional connectivity in the somatosensory cortex, which was paralleled by fear behavior, reduced activation of somatosensory cortex, and increased activation of the basolateral amygdala in response to repeated whisker stimulation. These results suggest that impaired somatosensory signal processing is a common feature in mice harboring ASD-related mutations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Degeneration of ipRGCs in Mouse Models of Huntington's Disease Disrupts Non-Image-Forming Behaviors Before Motor Impairment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1505?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which express the photopigment melanopsin, are photosensitive neurons in the retina and are essential for non-image-forming functions, circadian photoentrainment, and pupillary light reflexes. Five subtypes of ipRGCs (M1–M5) have been identified in mice. Although ipRGCs are spared in several forms of inherited blindness, they are affected in Alzheimer's disease and aging, which are associated with impaired circadian rhythms. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal neurodegenerative disease caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the &lt;i&gt;huntingtin&lt;/i&gt; gene. In addition to motor function impairment, HD mice also show impaired circadian rhythms and loss of ipRGC. Here, we found that, in HD mouse models (R6/2 and N171-82Q male mice), the expression of melanopsin was reduced before the onset of motor deficits. The expression of retinal T-box brain 2, a transcription factor essential for ipRGCs, was associated with the survival of ipRGCs. The number of M1 ipRGCs in R6/2 male mice was reduced due to apoptosis, whereas non-M1 ipRGCs were relatively resilient to HD progression. Most importantly, the reduced innervations of M1 ipRGCs, which was assessed by X-gal staining in R6/2-OPN4&lt;sup&gt;Lacz/+&lt;/sup&gt; male mice, contributed to the diminished light-induced c-fos and vasoactive intestinal peptide in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), which may explain the impaired circadian photoentrainment in HD mice. Collectively, our results show that M1 ipRGCs were susceptible to the toxicity caused by mutant Huntingtin. The resultant impairment of M1 ipRGCs contributed to the early degeneration of the ipRGC–SCN pathway and disrupted circadian regulation during HD progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Circadian disruption is a common nonmotor symptom of Huntington's disease (HD). In addition to the molecular defects in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the cause of circadian disruption in HD remains to be further explored. We hypothesized that ipRGCs, by integrating light input to the SCN, participate in the circadian regulation in HD mice. We report early reductions in melanopsin in two mouse models of HD, R6/2, and N171-82Q. Suppression of retinal T-box brain 2, a transcription factor essential for ipRGCs, by mutant Huntingtin might mediate the reduced number of ipRGCs. Importantly, M1 ipRGCs showed higher susceptibility than non-M1 ipRGCs in R6/2 mice. The resultant impairment of M1 ipRGCs contributed to the early degeneration of the ipRGC–SCN pathway and the circadian abnormality during HD progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Activation of 5-HT1A Receptors Promotes Retinal Ganglion Cell Function by Inhibiting the cAMP-PKA Pathway to Modulate Presynaptic GABA Release in Chronic Glaucoma</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptor agonists are neuroprotective in CNS injury models. However, the neuroprotective functional implications and synaptic mechanism of 8-hydroxy-2- (di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a serotonin receptor (5-HT1A) agonist, in an adult male Wistar rat model of chronic glaucoma model remain unknown. We found that ocular hypertension decreased 5-HT1A receptor expression in rat retinas because the number of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) was significantly reduced in rats with induced ocular hypertension relative to that in control retinas and 8-OH-DPAT enhanced the RGC viability. The protective effects of 8-OH-DPAT were blocked by intravitreal administration of the selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 or the selective GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist SR95531. Using patch-clamp techniques, spontaneous and miniature GABAergic IPSCs (sIPSCs and mIPSCs, respectively) of RGCs in rat retinal slices were recorded. 8-OH-DPAT significantly increased the frequency and amplitude of GABAergic sIPSCs and mIPSCs in ON- and OFF-type RGCs. Among the signaling cascades mediated by the 5-HT1A receptor, the role of cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling was investigated. The 8-OH-DPAT-induced changes at the synaptic level were enhanced by PKA inhibition by H-89 and blocked by PKA activation with bucladesine. Furthermore, the density of phosphorylated PKA (p-PKA)/PKA was significantly increased in glaucomatous retinas and 8-OH-DPAT significantly decreased p-PKA/PKA expression, which led to the inhibition of PKA phosphorylation upon relieving neurotransmitter GABA release. These results showed that the activation of 5-HT1A receptors in retinas facilitated presynaptic GABA release functions by suppressing cAMP-PKA signaling and decreasing PKA phosphorylation, which could lead to the de-excitation of RGC circuits and suppress excitotoxic processes in glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We found that serotonin (5-HT) receptors in the retina (5-HT1A receptors) were downregulated after intraocular pressure elevation. Patch-clamp recordings demonstrated differences in the frequencies of miniature GABAergic IPSCs (mIPSCs) in ON- and OFF-type retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and RGCs in normal and glaucomatous retinal slices. Therefore, phosphorylated protein kinase A (PKA) inhibition upon release of the neurotransmitter GABA was eliminated by 8-hydroxy-2- (di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), which led to increased levels of GABAergic mIPSCs in ON- and OFF-type RGCs, thus enhancing RGC viability and function. These protective effects were blocked by the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist SR95531 or the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635. This study identified a novel mechanism by which activation of 5-HT1A receptors protects damaged RGCs via the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway that modulates GABAergic presynaptic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sequential Control Underlies Robust Ramping Dynamics in the Rostrolateral Prefrontal Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An essential human skill is our capacity to monitor and execute a sequence of tasks in the service of an overarching goal. Such a sequence can be as mundane as making a cup of coffee or as complex as flying a fighter plane. Previously, we showed that, during sequential control, the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) exhibits activation that ramps steadily through the sequence and is necessary for sequential task execution using fMRI in humans (Desrochers et al., 2015). It remains unknown what computations may underlie this ramping dynamic. Across two independent fMRI experiments, we manipulated three features that were unique to the sequential control task to determine whether and how they modulated ramping activity in the RLPFC: (1) sequence position uncertainty, (2) sequential monitoring without external position cues (i.e., from memory), and (3) sequential monitoring without multilevel decision making (i.e., task execution). We replicated the ramping activation in RLPFC and found it to be remarkably robust regardless of the level of task abstraction or engagement of memory functions. Therefore, these results both replicate and extend previous findings regarding the function of the RLPFC. They suggest that sequential control processes are integral to the dynamics of RLPFC activity. Advancing knowledge of the neural bases of sequential control is crucial for our understanding of the sequential processes that are necessary for daily living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We perform sequences of tasks every day, but little is known about how they are controlled in the brain. Previously we found that ramping activity in the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) was necessary to perform a sequence of tasks. We designed two independent fMRI experiments in human participants to determine which features of the previous sequential task potentially engaged ramping in the RLPFC. We found that any demand to monitor a sequence of state transitions consistently elicited ramping in the RLPFC, regardless of the level of the decisions made at each step in the sequence or engagement of memory functions. These results provide a framework for understanding RLPFC function during sequential control, and consequently, daily life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Active Zone Proteins RIM1{alpha}{beta} Are Required for Normal Corticostriatal Transmission and Action Control</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic regulation of synaptic transmission at cortical inputs to the dorsal striatum is considered critical for flexible and efficient action learning and control. Presynaptic mechanisms governing the properties and plasticity of glutamate release from these inputs are not fully understood, and the corticostriatal synaptic processes that support normal action learning and control remain unclear. Here we show in male and female mice that conditional deletion of presynaptic proteins RIM1αβ (RIM1) from excitatory cortical neurons impairs corticostriatal synaptic transmission in the dorsolateral striatum. Key forms of presynaptic G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated short- and long-term striatal plasticity are spared following RIM1 deletion. Conditional RIM1 KO mice show heightened novelty-induced locomotion and impaired motor learning on the accelerating rotarod. They further show heightened self-paced instrumental responding for food and impaired learning of a habitual instrumental response strategy. Together, these findings reveal a selective role for presynaptic RIM1 in neurotransmitter release at prominent basal ganglia synapses, and provide evidence that RIM1-dependent processes help to promote the refinement of skilled actions, constrain goal-directed behaviors, and support the learning and use of habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our daily functioning hinges on the ability to flexibly and efficiently learn and control our actions. How the brain encodes these capacities is unclear. Here we identified a selective role for presynaptic proteins RIM1αβ in controlling glutamate release from cortical inputs to the dorsolateral striatum, a brain structure critical for action learning and control. Behavioral analysis of mice with restricted genetic deletion of RIM1αβ further revealed roles for RIM1αβ-dependent processes in the learning and refinement of motor skills and the balanced expression of goal-directed and habitual actions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Emotionally Aversive Cues Suppress Neural Systems Underlying Optimal Learning in Socially Anxious Individuals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1445?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning and decision-making are modulated by socio-emotional processing and such modulation is implicated in clinically relevant personality traits of social anxiety. The present study elucidates the computational and neural mechanisms by which emotionally aversive cues disrupt learning in socially anxious human individuals. Healthy volunteers with low or high trait social anxiety performed a reversal learning task requiring learning actions in response to angry or happy face cues. Choice data were best captured by a computational model in which learning rate was adjusted according to the history of surprises. High trait socially anxious individuals used a less-dynamic strategy for adjusting their learning rate in trials started with angry face cues and unlike the low social anxiety group, their dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activity did not covary with the learning rate. Our results demonstrate that trait social anxiety is accompanied by disruption of optimal learning and dACC activity in threatening situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Social anxiety is known to influence a broad range of cognitive functions. This study tests whether and how social anxiety affects human value-based learning as a function of uncertainty in the learning environment. The findings indicate that, in a threatening context evoked by an angry face, socially anxious individuals fail to benefit from a stable learning environment with highly predictable stimulus–response–outcome associations. Under those circumstances, socially anxious individuals failed to use their dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, a region known to adjust learning rate to environmental uncertainty. These findings open the way to modify neurobiological mechanisms of maladaptive learning in anxiety and depressive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Changes in Endogenous Dopamine Induced by Methylphenidate Predict Functional Connectivity in Nonhuman Primates</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1436?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1436?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine (DA) levels in the striatum are increased by many therapeutic drugs, such as methylphenidate (MPH), which also alters behavioral and cognitive functions thought to be controlled by the PFC dose-dependently. We linked DA changes and functional connectivity (FC) using simultaneous [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fallypride PET and resting-state fMRI in awake male rhesus monkeys after oral administration of various doses of MPH. We found a negative correlation between [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fallypride nondisplaceable binding potential (BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt;) and MPH dose in the head of the caudate (hCd), demonstrating increased extracellular DA resulting from MPH administration. The decreased BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; was negatively correlated with FC between the hCd and the PFC. Subsequent voxelwise analyses revealed negative correlations with FC between the hCd and the dorsolateral PFC, hippocampus, and precuneus. These results, showing that MPH-induced changes in DA levels in the hCd predict resting-state FC, shed light on a mechanism by which changes in striatal DA could influence function in the PFC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dopamine transmission is thought to play an essential role in shaping large scale-neural networks that underlie cognitive functions. It is the target of therapeutic drugs, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin), which blocks the dopamine transporter, thereby increasing extracellular dopamine levels. Methylphenidate is used extensively to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, even though its effects on cognitive functions and their underlying neural mechanisms are not well understood. To date, little is known about the link between changes in dopamine levels and changes in functional brain organization. Using simultaneous PET/MR imaging, we show that methylphenidate-induced changes in endogenous dopamine levels in the head of the caudate predict changes in resting-state functional connectivity between this structure and the prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Frequency Shifts and Depth Dependence of Premotor Beta Band Activity during Perceptual Decision-Making</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1420?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1420?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural activity in the premotor and motor cortices shows prominent structure in the beta frequency range (13–30 Hz). Currently, the behavioral relevance of this beta band activity (BBA) is debated. The underlying source of motor BBA and how it changes as a function of cortical depth are also not completely understood. Here, we addressed these unresolved questions by investigating BBA recorded using laminar electrodes in the dorsal premotor cortex of 2 male rhesus macaques performing a visual reaction time (RT) reach discrimination task. We observed robust BBA before and after the onset of the visual stimulus but not during the arm movement. While poststimulus BBA was positively correlated with RT throughout the beta frequency range, prestimulus correlation varied by frequency. Low beta frequencies (~12–20 Hz) were positively correlated with RT, and high beta frequencies (~22–30 Hz) were negatively correlated with RT. Analysis and simulations suggested that these frequency-dependent correlations could emerge due to a shift in the component frequencies of the prestimulus BBA as a function of RT, such that faster RTs are accompanied by greater power in high beta frequencies. We also observed a laminar dependence of BBA, with deeper electrodes demonstrating stronger power in low beta frequencies both prestimulus and poststimulus. The heterogeneous nature of BBA and the changing relationship between BBA and RT in different task epochs may be a sign of the differential network dynamics involved in cue expectation, decision-making, motor preparation, and movement execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Beta band activity (BBA) has been implicated in motor tasks, in disease states, and as a potential signal for brain–machine interfaces. However, the behavioral relevance of BBA and its laminar organization in premotor cortex have not been completely elucidated. Here we addressed these unresolved issues using simultaneous recordings from multiple cortical layers of the premotor cortex of monkeys performing a decision-making task. Our key finding is that BBA is not a monolithic signal. Instead, BBA consists of at least two frequency bands. The relationship between BBA and eventual behavior, such as reaction time, also dynamically changes depending on task epoch. We also provide further evidence that BBA is laminarly organized, with greater power in deeper electrodes for low beta frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Prefrontal-Bed Nucleus Circuit Modulation of a Passive Coping Response Set</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1405?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges facing neuroscience entails localization of circuits and mechanisms accounting for how multiple features of stress responses are organized to promote survival during adverse experiences. The rodent medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is generally regarded as a key site for cognitive and affective information processing, and the anteroventral bed nuclei of the stria terminalis (avBST) integrates homeostatic information from a variety of sources, including the mPFC. Thus, we proposed that the mPFC is capable of generating multiple features (endocrine, behavioral) of adaptive responses via its influence over the avBST. To address this possibility, we first optogenetically inhibited input to avBST from the rostral prelimbic cortical region of mPFC and observed concurrent increases in immobility and hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) output in male rats during tail suspension, whereas photostimulation of this pathway decreased immobility during the same challenge. Anatomical tracing experiments confirmed projections from the rostral prelimbic subfield to separate populations of avBST neurons, and from these to HPA effector neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, and to aspects of the midbrain periaqueductal gray that coordinate passive defensive behaviors. Finally, stimulation and inhibition of the prelimbic–avBST pathway, respectively, decreased and increased passive coping in the shock-probe defensive burying test, without having any direct effect on active coping (burying) behavior. These results define a new neural substrate in the coordination of a &lt;i&gt;response set&lt;/i&gt; that involves the gating of passive, rather than active, coping behaviors while restraining neuroendocrine activation to optimize adaptation during threat exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The circuits and mechanisms accounting for how multiple features of responses are organized to promote adaptation have yet to be elucidated. Our report identifies a prefrontal–bed nucleus pathway that organizes a &lt;i&gt;response set&lt;/i&gt; capable of gating passive coping behaviors while concurrently restraining neuroendocrine activation during exposure to inescapable stressors. These data provide insight into the central organization of how multiple features of responses are integrated to promote adaptation during adverse experiences, and how disruption in one neural pathway may underlie a broad array of maladaptive responses in stress-related psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Heparan Sulfate Sulfation by Hs2st Restricts Astroglial Precursor Somal Translocation in Developing Mouse Forebrain by a Non-Cell-Autonomous Mechanism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1386?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1386?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Heparan sulfate (HS) is a cell surface and extracellular matrix carbohydrate extensively modified by differential sulfation. HS interacts physically with canonical fibroblast growth factor (FGF) proteins that signal through the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. At the embryonic mouse telencephalic midline, FGF/ERK signaling drives astroglial precursor somal translocation from the ventricular zone of the corticoseptal boundary (CSB) to the induseum griseum (IG), producing a focus of &lt;i&gt;Slit2&lt;/i&gt;-expressing astroglial guidepost cells essential for interhemispheric corpus callosum (CC) axon navigation. Here, we investigated the cell and molecular function of a specific form of HS sulfation, 2-O HS sulfation catalyzed by the enzyme Hs2st, in midline astroglial development and in regulating FGF protein levels and interaction with HS. &lt;i&gt;Hs2st&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; embryos of either sex exhibit a grossly enlarged IG due to precocious astroglial translocation and conditional &lt;i&gt;Hs2st&lt;/i&gt; mutagenesis and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; culture experiments show that &lt;i&gt;Hs2st&lt;/i&gt; is not required cell autonomously by CC axons or by the IG astroglial cell lineage, but rather acts non-cell autonomously to suppress the transmission of translocation signals to astroglial precursors. Rescue of the &lt;i&gt;Hs2st&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; astroglial translocation phenotype by pharmacologically inhibiting FGF signaling shows that the normal role of Hs2st is to suppress FGF-mediated astroglial translocation. We demonstrate a selective action of Hs2st on FGF protein by showing that &lt;i&gt;Hs2st&lt;/i&gt; (but not &lt;i&gt;Hs6st1&lt;/i&gt;) normally suppresses the levels of Fgf17 protein in the CSB region &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and use a biochemical assay to show that &lt;i&gt;Hs2st&lt;/i&gt; (but not &lt;i&gt;Hs6st1&lt;/i&gt;) facilitates a physical interaction between the Fgf17 protein and HS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We report a novel non-cell-autonomous mechanism regulating cell signaling in developing brain. Using the developing mouse telencephalic midline as an exemplar, we show that the specific sulfation modification of the cell surface and extracellular carbohydrate heparan sulfate (HS) performed by Hs2st suppresses the supply of translocation signals to astroglial precursors by a non-cell-autonomous mechanism. We further show that Hs2st modification selectively facilitates a physical interaction between Fgf17 and HS and suppresses Fgf17 protein levels &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, strongly suggesting that Hs2st acts selectively on Fgf17 signaling. HS interacts with many signaling proteins potentially encoding numerous selective interactions important in development and disease, so this class of mechanism may apply more broadly to other biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cross-Modal Competition: The Default Computation for Multisensory Processing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1374?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1374?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mature multisensory superior colliculus (SC) neurons integrate information across the senses to enhance their responses to spatiotemporally congruent cross-modal stimuli. The development of this neurotypic feature of SC neurons requires experience with cross-modal cues. In the absence of such experience the response of an SC neuron to congruent cross-modal cues is no more robust than its response to the most effective component cue. This &quot;default&quot; or &quot;naive&quot; state is believed to be one in which cross-modal signals do not interact. The present results challenge this characterization by identifying interactions between visual-auditory signals in male and female cats reared without visual-auditory experience. By manipulating the relative effectiveness of the visual and auditory cross-modal cues that were presented to each of these naive neurons, an active competition between cross-modal signals was revealed. Although contrary to current expectations, this result is explained by a neuro-computational model in which the default interaction is mutual inhibition. These findings suggest that multisensory neurons at all maturational stages are capable of some form of multisensory integration, and use experience with cross-modal stimuli to transition from their initial state of competition to their mature state of cooperation. By doing so, they develop the ability to enhance the physiological salience of cross-modal events thereby increasing their impact on the sensorimotor circuitry of the SC, and the likelihood that biologically significant events will elicit SC-mediated overt behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The present results demonstrate that the default mode of multisensory processing in the superior colliculus is competition, not non-integration as previously characterized. A neuro-computational model explains how these competitive dynamics can be implemented via mutual inhibition, and how this default mode is superseded by the emergence of cooperative interactions during development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Longitudinally Mapping Childhood Socioeconomic Status Associations with Cortical and Subcortical Morphology</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) impacts cognitive development and mental health, but its association with human structural brain development is not yet well characterized. Here, we analyzed 1243 longitudinally acquired structural MRI scans from 623 youth (299 female/324 male) to investigate the relation between SES and cortical and subcortical morphology between ages 5 and 25 years. We found positive associations between SES and total volumes of the brain, cortical sheet, and four separate subcortical structures. These associations were stable between ages 5 and 25. Surface-based shape analysis revealed that higher SES is associated with areal expansion of lateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate, lateral temporal, and superior parietal cortices and ventrolateral thalamic, and medial amygdalo-hippocampal subregions. Meta-analyses of functional imaging data indicate that cortical correlates of SES are centered on brain systems subserving sensorimotor functions, language, memory, and emotional processing. We further show that anatomical variation within a subset of these cortical regions partially mediates the positive association between SES and IQ. Finally, we identify neuroanatomical correlates of SES that exist above and beyond accompanying variation in IQ. Although SES is clearly a complex construct that likely relates to development through diverse, nondeterministic processes, our findings elucidate potential neuroanatomical mediators of the association between SES and cognitive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with developmental disparities in mental health, cognitive ability, and academic achievement, but efforts to understand underlying SES–brain relationships are ongoing. Here, we leverage a unique developmental neuroimaging dataset to longitudinally map the associations between SES and regional brain anatomy at high spatiotemporal resolution. We find widespread associations between SES and global cortical and subcortical volumes and surface area and localize these correlations to a distributed set of cortical, thalamic, and amygdalo-hippocampal subregions. Anatomical variation within a subset of these regions partially mediates the positive relationship between SES and IQ. Our findings help to localize cortical and subcortical systems that represent candidate biological substrates for the known relationships between SES and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: ARL13B, a Joubert Syndrome-Associated Protein, Is Critical for Retinogenesis and Elaboration of Mouse Photoreceptor Outer Segments</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1347?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in the Joubert syndrome-associated small GTPase ARL13B are linked to photoreceptor impairment and vision loss. To determine the role of ARL13B in the development, function, and maintenance of ciliated photoreceptors, we generated a pan-retina knock-out (&lt;i&gt;Six3&lt;/i&gt;-Cre) and a rod photoreceptor-specific inducible conditional knock-out (&lt;i&gt;Pde6g&lt;/i&gt;-Cre&lt;sup&gt;ERT2&lt;/sup&gt;) of ARL13B using murine models. Embryonic deletion of ARL13B led to defects in retinal development with reduced cell proliferation. In the absence of ARL13B, photoreceptors failed to develop outer segment (OS) membranous discs and axonemes, resulting in loss of function and rapid degeneration. Additionally, the majority of photoreceptor basal bodies did not dock properly at the apical edge of the inner segments. The removal of ARL13B in adult rod photoreceptor cells after maturation of OS resulted in loss of photoresponse and vesiculation in the OS. Before changes in photoresponse, removal of ARL13B led to mislocalization of rhodopsin, prenylated phosphodiesterase-6 (PDE6), and intraflagellar transport protein-88 (IFT88). Our findings show that ARL13B is required at multiple stages of retinogenesis, including early postnatal proliferation of retinal progenitor cells, development of photoreceptor cilia, and morphogenesis of photoreceptor OS discs regardless of sex. Last, our results establish a need for ARL13B in photoreceptor maintenance and protein trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The normal development of photoreceptor cilia is essential to create functional, organized outer segments with stacked membrane discs that house the phototransduction proteins necessary for sight. Our study identifies a complex role for ARL13B, a small GTPase linked to Joubert syndrome and visual impairment, at various stages of photoreceptor development. Loss of ARL13B led to defects in retinal proliferation, altered placement of basal bodies crucial for components of the cilium (transition zone) to emanate, and absence of photoreceptor-stacked discs. These defects led to extinguished visual response and dysregulated protein trafficking. Our findings show the complex role ARL13B plays in photoreceptor development, viability, and function. Our study accounts for the severe retinal impairment observed in ARL13B-linked Joubert syndrome patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Loss of Adult 5-HT1A Autoreceptors Results in a Paradoxical Anxiogenic Response to Antidepressant Treatment</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line antidepressants but require several weeks to elicit their actions. Chronic SSRI treatment induces desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors to enhance 5-HT neurotransmission. Mice (both sexes) with gene deletion of 5-HT1A autoreceptors in adult 5-HT neurons (&lt;i&gt;1AcKO&lt;/i&gt;) were tested for response to SSRIs. Tamoxifen-induced recombination in adult &lt;i&gt;1AcKO&lt;/i&gt; mice specifically reduced 5-HT1A autoreceptor levels. The &lt;i&gt;1AcKO&lt;/i&gt; mice showed a loss of 5-HT1A autoreceptor-mediated hypothermia and electrophysiological responses, but no changes in anxiety- or depression-like behavior. Subchronic fluoxetine (FLX) treatment induced an unexpected anxiogenic effect in &lt;i&gt;1AcKO&lt;/i&gt; mice in the novelty suppressed feeding and elevated plus maze tests, as did escitalopram in the novelty suppressed feeding test. No effect was seen in wild-type (&lt;i&gt;WT&lt;/i&gt;) mice. Subchronic FLX increased 5-HT metabolism in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and raphe of &lt;i&gt;1AcKO&lt;/i&gt; but not &lt;i&gt;WT&lt;/i&gt; mice, suggesting hyperactivation of 5-HT release. To detect chronic cellular activation, FosB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were quantified. FosB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were reduced in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus (CA2/3) and increased in dorsal raphe 5-HT cells of &lt;i&gt;1AcKO&lt;/i&gt; mice, suggesting increased raphe activation. In &lt;i&gt;WT&lt;/i&gt; but not &lt;i&gt;1AcKO&lt;/i&gt; mice, FLX reduced FosB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the median raphe, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and median septum, which receive rich 5-HT projections. Thus, in the absence of 5-HT1A autoreceptors, SSRIs induce a paradoxical anxiogenic response. This may involve imbalance in activation of dorsal and median raphe to regulate septohippocampal or fimbria-fornix pathways. These results suggest that markedly reduced 5-HT1A autoreceptors may provide a marker for aberrant response to SSRI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective in treating anxiety and depression in humans and mouse models. However, in some cases, SSRIs can increase anxiety, but the mechanisms involved are unclear. Here we show that, rather than enhancing SSRI benefits, adulthood knockout (KO) of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor, a critical negative regulator of 5-HT activity, results in an SSRI-induced anxiety effect that appears to involve a hyperactivation of the 5-HT system in certain brain areas. Thus, subjects with very low levels of 5-HT1A autoreceptors, such as during childhood or adolescence, may be at risk for an SSRI-induced anxiety response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Autophagosomes and endosomes sequester cellular cargo through different mechanisms, but these pathways converge upon fusion with lysosomes. Both pathways are spatially regulated, with distinct features evident in the soma, axons, and dendrites, possibly as an adaptation to the unique morphology of neurons and the specific demands of each compartment. Relatively little is known about how autophagy and endo-lysosomal degradation interact and how their activities may be coordinated. We review our current understanding of autophagy and endo-lysosomal degradation in neurons, highlighting common features and differences as well as the intersection of these two essential cellular pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

We review here recent advances in Septin-mediated processes of neuron differentiation, which enlighten similarities and differences between neuron and yeast polarity programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R pore-forming (α, β, and non-α/β) subunits were isolated approximately 30 years ago and have since been the focus of extensive studies. As a result, many properties of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs, including subunit assembly and channel and pharmacological properties, have been discovered. However, several of the underlying mechanisms such as the process for the synaptic localization of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs remain unsolved. A reinvestigation of native GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R complexes in the brain and primary neurons identified two major molecular constituents, namely, the transmembrane GARLH/LHFPL protein family and the inhibitory synaptic protein neuroligin 2. This identification of the principal components of native receptor complexes may provide new mechanistic insight on receptor regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

As such, transport of messenger RNAs serves as a set of blueprints for the synthesis of specific proteins at distal sites. RNA localization to dendrites and axons confers the ability to regulate translation with extraordinary precision in space and time. Although the rationale for RNA localization is quite compelling, it is unclear how a neuron orchestrates such a complex task of distributing over a thousand different mRNAs to their respective subcellular compartments. Recent single-molecule imaging studies have led to insights into the kinetics of individual mRNAs. We can now peer into the transport dynamics of mRNAs in both dendrites and axons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Damaged mitochondria, which are highly deleterious to the neuron, must be rapidly repaired or eliminated, even when they are left at terminals extremely far away from the soma. The unique shape of neurons complicates the tasks of both transporting and clearing mitochondria. Errors in the underlying molecular regulations cause detrimental neurodegeneration. Here, we review the molecular machinery and regulatory mechanisms employed to transport, distribute, and clear mitochondria in neurons, and how these fundamental regulations are compromised in neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: A surface‐in gradient of thalamic damage evolves in pediatric multiple sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25429?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25429?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central nervous system pathology in multiple sclerosis includes both focal inflammatory perivascular injury and injury to superficial structures, including the subpial region of the cortex, which reportedly exhibits a gradient of damage from the surface inward. We assessed how early in the multiple sclerosis course a &quot;surface‐in&quot; process of injury suggesting progressive biology may begin.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We focused on the thalamus, which notably has both a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) interface and a white matter interface. Thalamic volume trajectories were assessed in a prospectively followed cohort of children from initial presentation with either multiple sclerosis or monophasic acquired demyelination, and healthy controls. Voxelwise volume changes were calculated using deformation‐based morphometry, and analyzed in relation to distance from the CSF interface by mixed effects modeling and semiparametric smoothing methods.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty‐seven children with multiple sclerosis and 73 children with monophasic demyelination were prospectively followed with yearly brain scans (mean follow‐up = 4.6 years, standard deviation = 1.9). A total of 282 healthy children with serial scans were included as controls. Relative to healthy controls, children with multiple sclerosis and children with monophasic demyelination demonstrated volume loss in thalamic regions adjacent to the white matter. However, only children with multiple sclerosis exhibited an additional surface‐in gradient of thalamic injury on the ventricular side, which was already notable in the first year of clinical disease (asymptote estimate = 3.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.44–4.58, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0002) and worsened over time (asymptote:time estimate = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.12–0.54, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0021).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that a multiple sclerosis disease‐specific surface‐in process of damage can manifest at the earliest stages of the disease. Ann Neurol 2019;00:1–12&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Identifying nonlinear dynamical systems via generative recurrent neural networks with applications to fMRI. (arXiv:1902.07186v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07186</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07186</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A major tenet in theoretical neuroscience is that cognitive and behavioral
processes are ultimately implemented in terms of the neural system dynamics.
Accordingly, a major aim for the analysis of neurophysiological measurements
should lie in the identification of the computational dynamics underlying task
processing. Here we advance a state space model (SSM) based on generative
piecewise-linear recurrent neural networks (PLRNN) to assess dynamics from
neuroimaging data. In contrast to many other nonlinear time series models which
have been proposed for reconstructing latent dynamics, our model is easily
interpretable in neural terms, amenable to systematic dynamical systems
analysis of the resulting set of equations, and can straightforwardly be
transformed into an equivalent continuous-time dynamical system. The major
contributions of this paper are the introduction of a new observation model
suitable for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) coupled to the latent
PLRNN, an efficient stepwise training procedure that forces the latent model to
capture the 'true' underlying dynamics rather than just fitting (or predicting)
the observations, and of an empirical measure based on the Kullback-Leibler
divergence to evaluate from empirical time series how well this goal of
approximating the underlying dynamics has been achieved. We validate and
illustrate the power of our approach on simulated 'ground-truth' dynamical
(benchmark) systems as well as on actual experimental fMRI time series. Given
that fMRI is one of the most common techniques for measuring brain activity
non-invasively in human subjects, this approach may provide a novel step toward
analyzing aberrant (nonlinear) dynamics for clinical assessment or
neuroscientific research.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06915</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We show that \emph{stochastic bursting} is observed in a ring of
unidirectional delay-coupled noisy excitable systems, thanks to the
combinational action of time-delayed coupling and noise. Under the
approximation of timescale separation, i.e., when the time delays in each
connection are much larger than the characteristic duration of the spikes, the
observed rather coherent spike pattern can be described by idealized coupled
point processes with a leader-follower relationship. We derive analytically the
statistics of the spikes in each unit, pairwise correlations between any two
units, and the spectrum of the total output from the network. Theory is in a
good agreement with the simulations with a network of theta-neurons.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Large-scale directed network inference with multivariate transfer entropy and hierarchical statistical testing. (arXiv:1902.06828v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06828</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06828</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Network inference algorithms are valuable tools for the study of large-scale
neuroimaging datasets. Multivariate transfer entropy is well suited for this
task, being a model-free measure that captures nonlinear and lagged
dependencies between time series to infer a minimal directed network model.
Greedy algorithms have been proposed to efficiently deal with high-dimensional
datasets while avoiding redundant inferences and capturing synergistic effects.
However, multiple statistical comparisons may inflate the false positive rate
and are computationally demanding, which limited the size of previous
validation studies. The algorithm we present---as implemented in the IDTxl
open-source software---addresses these challenges by employing hierarchical
statistical tests to control the family-wise error rate and to allow for
efficient parallelisation. The method was validated on synthetic datasets
involving random networks of increasing size (up to 100 nodes), for both linear
and nonlinear dynamics. The performance increased with the length of the time
series, reaching consistently high precision, recall, and specificity (&amp;gt;98% on
average) for 10000 time samples. Varying the statistical significance threshold
showed a more favourable precision-recall trade-off for longer time series.
Both the network size and the sample size are one order of magnitude larger
than previously demonstrated, showing feasibility for typical EEG and MEG
experiments.

	<description>Autosomal-dominant Schnyder corneal dystrophy (SCD) is characterized by corneal opacification owing to overaccumulation of cholesterol. SCD is caused by mutations in UBIAD1, which utilizes geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGpp) to synthesize vitamin K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Using cultured cells, we previously showed that sterols trigger binding of UBIAD1 to the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR), thereby inhibiting its endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) (Schumacher et al. 2015). GGpp triggers release of UBIAD1 from HMGCR, allowing maximal ERAD and ER-to-Golgi transport of UBIAD1. SCD-associated UBIAD1 resists GGpp-induced release and is sequestered in ER to inhibit ERAD. We now report knockin mice expressing SCD-associated UBIAD1 accumulate HMGCR in several tissues resulting from ER sequestration of mutant UBIAD1 and inhibition of HMGCR ERAD. Corneas from aged knockin mice exhibit signs of opacification and sterol overaccumulation. These results establish the physiological significance of UBIAD1 in cholesterol homeostasis and indicate inhibition of HMGCR ERAD contributes to SCD pathogenesis.</description>

	<description>The lipid scramblase TMEM16F initiates blood coagulation by catalyzing the exposure of phosphatidylserine in platelets. The protein is part of a family of membrane proteins, which encompasses calcium-activated channels for ions and lipids. Here, we reveal features of murine TMEM16F (mTMEM16F) that underlie its function as a lipid scramblase and an ion channel. The cryo-EM data of mTMEM16F in absence and presence of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; define the ligand-free closed conformation of the protein and the structure of a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-bound intermediate. Both conformations resemble their counterparts of the scrambling-incompetent anion channel mTMEM16A, yet with distinct differences in the region of ion and lipid permeation. In conjunction with functional data, we demonstrate the relationship between ion conduction and lipid scrambling. Although activated by a common mechanism, both functions appear to be mediated by alternate protein conformations that are at equilibrium in the ligand-bound state.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Stepwise activation mechanism of the scramblase nhTMEM16 revealed by cryo-EM</title>

	<description>Scramblases catalyze the movement of lipids between both leaflets of a bilayer. Whereas the X-ray structure of the protein nhTMEM16 has previously revealed the architecture of a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent lipid scramblase, its regulation mechanism has remained elusive. Here, we have used cryo-electron microscopy and functional assays to address this question. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-bound and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free conformations of nhTMEM16 in detergent and lipid nanodiscs illustrate the interactions with its environment and they reveal the conformational changes underlying its activation. In this process, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding induces a stepwise transition of the catalytic subunit cavity, converting a closed cavity that is shielded from the membrane in the absence of ligand, into a polar furrow that becomes accessible to lipid headgroups in the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-bound state. Additionally, our structures demonstrate how nhTMEM16 distorts the membrane at both entrances of the subunit cavity, thereby decreasing the energy barrier for lipid movement.</description>

	<description>Pyrophosphate (PPi), a byproduct of macromolecule biosynthesis is maintained at low levels by soluble inorganic pyrophosphatases (sPPase) found in all eukaryotes. In plants, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-pumping pyrophosphatases (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase) convert the substantial energy present in PPi into an electrochemical gradient. We show here, that both cold- and heat stress sensitivity of &lt;i&gt;fugu5&lt;/i&gt; mutants lacking the major H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase isoform AVP1 is correlated with reduced SUMOylation. In addition, we show that increased PPi concentrations interfere with SUMOylation in yeast and we provide evidence that SUMO activating E1-enzymes are inhibited by micromolar concentrations of PPi in a non-competitive manner. Taken together, our results do not only provide a mechanistic explanation for the beneficial effects of AVP1 overexpression in plants but they also highlight PPi as an important integrator of metabolism and stress tolerance.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Structural insights into SETD3-mediated histidine methylation on β-actin</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43676</link>
	<description>SETD3 is a member of the SET (Su(var)3-9, Enhancer of zeste, and Trithorax) domain protein superfamily and plays important roles in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, muscle differentiation, and carcinogenesis. Previously we identified SETD3 as the actin-specific methyltransferase that methylates the N&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of His73 on β-actin (Kwiatkowski et al. 2018). Here, we present two structures of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-adenosyl-L-homocysteine-bound SETD3 in complex with either an unmodified β-actin peptide or its His-methylated variant. Structural analyses, supported by biochemical experiments and enzyme activity assays, indicate that the recognition and methylation of β-actin by SETD3 are highly sequence specific, and both SETD3 and β-actin adopt pronounced conformational changes upon binding to each other. In conclusion, this study is the first to show a catalytic mechanism of SETD3-mediated histidine methylation on β-actin, which not only throws light on the protein histidine methylation phenomenon, but also facilitates the design of small molecule inhibitors of SETD3.</description>

	<description>The linguistic foundations of science and technology include many terms that have been borrowed from ancient languages. In the case of terms with origins in the Greek language, the modern meaning can often differ significantly from the original one. Here we use the PubMed database to demonstrate the prevalence of words of Greek origin in the language of modern science, and call for scientists to exercise care when coining new terms.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Programmed conversion of hypertrophic chondrocytes into osteoblasts and marrow adipocytes within zebrafish bones</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.42736</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42736</link>
	<description>Much of the vertebrate skeleton develops from cartilage templates that are progressively remodeled into bone. Lineage tracing studies in mouse suggest that chondrocytes within these templates persist and become osteoblasts, yet the underlying mechanisms of this process and whether chondrocytes can generate other derivatives remain unclear. We find that zebrafish cartilages undergo extensive remodeling and vascularization during juvenile stages to generate fat-filled bones. Growth plate chondrocytes marked by &lt;i&gt;sox10 &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;col2a1a&lt;/i&gt; contribute to osteoblasts, marrow adipocytes, and mesenchymal cells within adult bones. At the edge of the hypertrophic zone, chondrocytes re-enter the cell cycle and express &lt;i&gt;leptin receptor &lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;lepr&lt;/i&gt;), suggesting conversion into progenitors. Further, mutation of &lt;i&gt;matrix metalloproteinase 9 &lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;mmp9&lt;/i&gt;) results in delayed growth plate remodeling and fewer marrow adipocytes. Our data support Mmp9-dependent growth plate remodeling and conversion of chondrocytes into osteoblasts and marrow adipocytes as conserved features of bony vertebrates.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Multiscale modeling of influenza A virus replication in cell cultures predicts infection dynamics for highly different infection conditions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Rüdiger, Sascha Young Kupke, Tanja Laske, Pawel Zmora, Udo Reichl&lt;/p&gt;

Influenza A viruses (IAV) are commonly used to infect animal cell cultures for research purposes and vaccine production. Their replication is influenced strongly by the multiplicity of infection (MOI), which ranges over several orders of magnitude depending on the respective application. So far, mathematical models of IAV replication have paid little attention to the impact of the MOI on infection dynamics and virus yields. To address this issue, we extended an existing model of IAV replication in adherent MDCK cells with kinetics that explicitly consider the time point of cell infection. This modification does not only enable the fitting of high MOI measurements, but also the successful prediction of viral release dynamics of low MOI experiments using the same set of parameters. Furthermore, this model allows the investigation of defective interfering particle (DIP) propagation in different MOI regimes. The key difference between high and low MOI conditions is the percentage of infectious virions among the total virus particle release. Simulation studies show that DIP interference at a high MOI is determined exclusively by the DIP content of the seed virus while, in low MOI conditions, it is predominantly controlled by the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; generation of DIPs. Overall, the extended model provides an ideal framework for the prediction and optimization of cell culture-derived IAV manufacturing and the production of DIPs for therapeutic use.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NatcusQY3NQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Allosteric mechanism of the circadian protein Vivid resolved through Markov state model and machine learning analysis</title>

The fungal circadian clock photoreceptor Vivid (VVD) contains a photosensitive allosteric light, oxygen, voltage (LOV) domain that undergoes a large N-terminal conformational change. The mechanism by which a blue-light driven covalent bond formation leads to a global conformational change remains unclear, which hinders the further development of VVD as an optogenetic tool. We answered this question through a novel computational platform integrating Markov state models, machine learning methods, and newly developed community analysis algorithms. Applying this new integrative approach, we provided a quantitative evaluation of the contribution from the covalent bond to the protein global conformational change, and proposed an atomistic allosteric mechanism leading to the discovery of the unexpected importance of A’α/Aβ and previously overlooked Eα/Fα loops in the conformational change. This approach could be applicable to other allosteric proteins in general to provide interpretable atomistic representations of their otherwise elusive allosteric mechanisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RJ65cTk-XxE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A saturated reaction in repressor synthesis creates a daytime dead zone in circadian clocks</title>

Negative feedback loops (NFLs) for circadian clocks include light-responsive reactions that allow the clocks to shift their phase depending on the timing of light signals. Phase response curves (PRCs) for light signals in various organisms include a time interval called a dead zone where light signals cause no phase shift during daytime. Although the importance of the dead zone for robust light entrainment is known, how the dead zone arises from the biochemical reactions in an NFL underlying circadian gene expression rhythms remains unclear. In addition, the observation that the light-responsive reactions in the NFL vary between organisms raises the question as to whether the mechanism for dead zone formation is common or distinct between different organisms. Here we reveal by mathematical modeling that the saturation of a biochemical reaction in repressor synthesis in an NFL is a common mechanism of daytime dead zone generation. If light signals increase the degradation of a repressor protein, as in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, the saturation of repressor mRNA transcription nullifies the effect of light signals, generating a dead zone. In contrast, if light signals induce the transcription of repressor mRNA, as in mammals, the saturation of repressor translation can generate a dead zone by cancelling the influence of excess amount of mRNA induced by light signals. Each of these saturated reactions is located next to the light-responsive reaction in the NFL, suggesting a design principle for daytime dead zone generation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fl8k8W5KC3g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Phenotypical variability in the absence of genetic variation often reflects complex energetic landscapes associated with underlying gene regulatory networks (GRNs). In this view, different phenotypes are associated with alternative states of complex nonlinear systems: stable attractors in deterministic models or modes of stationary distributions in stochastic descriptions. We provide theoretical and practical characterizations of these landscapes, specifically focusing on stochastic Slow Promoter Kinetics (SPK), a time scale relevant when transcription factor binding and unbinding are affected by epigenetic processes like DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling. In this case, largely unexplored except for numerical simulations, adiabatic approximations of promoter kinetics are not appropriate. In contrast to the existing literature, we provide rigorous analytic characterizations of multiple modes. A general formal approach gives insight into the influence of parameters and the prediction of how changes in GRN wiring, for example through mutations or artificial interventions, impact the possible number, location, and likelihood of alternative states. We adapt tools from the mathematical field of singular perturbation theory to represent stationary distributions of Chemical Master Equations for GRNs as mixtures of Poisson distributions and obtain explicit formulas for the locations and probabilities of metastable states as a function of the parameters describing the system. As illustrations, the theory is used to tease out the role of cooperative binding in stochastic models in comparison to deterministic models, and applications are given to various model systems, such as toggle switches in isolation or in communicating populations, a synthetic oscillator, and a trans-differentiation network.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iXjE6wxdvww&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Recent advances in next-generation sequencing and computational technologies have enabled routine analysis of large-scale single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. However, scRNA-seq technologies have suffered from several technical challenges, including low mean expression levels in most genes and higher frequencies of missing data than bulk population sequencing technologies. Identifying functional gene sets and their regulatory networks that link specific cell types to human diseases and therapeutics from scRNA-seq profiles are daunting tasks. In this study, we developed a Component Overlapping Attribute Clustering (COAC) algorithm to perform the localized (subpopulation) gene co-expression network analysis from large-scale scRNA-seq profiles. Gene subnetworks that represent specific gene co-expression patterns are inferred from the components of a decomposed matrix of scRNA-seq profiles. We showed that single-cell gene subnetworks identified by COAC from multiple time points within cell phases can be used for cell type identification with high accuracy (83%). In addition, COAC-inferred subnetworks from melanoma patients’ scRNA-seq profiles are highly correlated with survival rate from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Moreover, the localized gene subnetworks identified by COAC from individual patients’ scRNA-seq data can be used as pharmacogenomics biomarkers to predict drug responses (The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranges from 0.728 to 0.783) in cancer cell lines from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database. In summary, COAC offers a powerful tool to identify potential network-based diagnostic and pharmacogenomics biomarkers from large-scale scRNA-seq profiles.

The presence of treatment-resistant cells is an important factor that limits the efficacy of cancer therapy, and the prospect of resistance is considered the major cause of the treatment strategy. Several recent studies have employed mathematical models to elucidate the dynamics of generating resistant cancer cells and attempted to predict the probability of emerging resistant cells. The purpose of this paper is to present numerical approach to compute the number of resistant cells and the emerging probability of resistance. Stochastic model was designed and developed a method to approximately but efficiently compute the number of resistant cells and the probability of resistance. To model the progression of cancer, a discrete-state, two-dimensional Markov process whose states are the total number of cells and the number of resistant cells was employed. Then exact analysis and approximate aggregation approaches were proposed to calculate the number of resistant cells and the probability of resistance when the cell population reaches detection size. To confirm the accuracy of computed results of approximation, relative errors between exact analysis and approximation were computed. The numerical values of our approximation method were very close to those of exact analysis calculated in the range of small detection size M = 500, 100, and 1500. Then computer simulation was performed to confirm the accuracy of computed results of approximation when the detection size was M = 10000,30000,50000,100000 and 1000000. All the numerical results of approximation fell between the upper level and the lower level of 95% confidential intervals and our method took less time to compute over a broad range of cell size. The effects of parameter change on emerging probabilities of resistance were also investigated by computed values using approximation method. The results showed that the number of divisions until the cell population reached the detection size is important for emerging the probability of resistance. The next step of numerical approach is to compute the emerging probabilities of resistance under drug administration and with multiple mutation. Another effective approximation would be necessary for the analysis of the latter case.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aiyrMkQ6Zrc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Graph-based representations are considered to be the future for reference genomes, as they allow integrated representation of the steadily increasing data on individual variation. Currently available tools allow &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; assembly of graph-based reference genomes, alignment of new read sets to the graph representation as well as certain analyses like variant calling and haplotyping. We here present a first method for calling ChIP-Seq peaks on read data aligned to a graph-based reference genome. The method is a graph generalization of the peak caller MACS2, and is implemented in an open source tool, &lt;i&gt;Graph Peak Caller&lt;/i&gt;. By using the existing tool &lt;i&gt;vg&lt;/i&gt; to build a pan-genome of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;, we validate our approach by showing that Graph Peak Caller with a pan-genome reference graph can trace variants within peaks that are not part of the linear reference genome, and find peaks that in general are more motif-enriched than those found by MACS2.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5eBzGrN_ang&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Rare variants are of increasing interest to genetic association studies because of their etiological contributions to human complex diseases. Due to the rarity of the mutant events, rare variants are routinely analyzed on an aggregate level. While aggregation analyses improve the detection of global-level signal, they are not able to pinpoint causal variants within a variant set. To perform inference on a localized level, additional information, e.g., biological annotation, is often needed to boost the information content of a rare variant. Following the observation that important variants are likely to cluster together on functional domains, we propose a protein structure guided local test (POINT) to provide variant-specific association information using structure-guided aggregation of signal. Constructed under a kernel machine framework, POINT performs local association testing by borrowing information from neighboring variants in the 3-dimensional protein space in a data-adaptive fashion. Besides merely providing a list of promising variants, POINT assigns each variant a p-value to permit variant ranking and prioritization. We assess the selection performance of POINT using simulations and illustrate how it can be used to prioritize individual rare variants in &lt;i&gt;PCSK9, ANGPTL4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CETP&lt;/i&gt; in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) clinical trial data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LIYyATJn8_E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Purkinje neurons in the caudal cerebellar vermis combine semicircular canal and otolith signals to segregate linear and gravitational acceleration, evidence for how the cerebellum creates internal models of body motion. However, it is not known which cerebellar circuit connections are necessary to perform this computation. We first showed that this...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/9QQMtBcGZUc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Marmoset has emerged as a useful nonhuman primate species for studying brain structure and function. Previous studies on the mouse primary auditory cortex (A1) showed that neurons with preferential frequency-tuning responses are mixed within local cortical regions, despite a large-scale tonotopic organization.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Homocysteine and Small Vessel Stroke: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25440?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25440?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trials of B vitamin therapy to lower blood total homocysteine (tHcy) levels for prevention of stroke are inconclusive. Secondary analyses of trial data and epidemiologic studies suggest that tHcy levels may be particularly associated with small vessel stroke (SVS). We assessed whether circulating tHcy and B vitamin levels are selectively associated with SVS, but not other stroke subtypes, using Mendelian randomization.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used summary statistics data for single‐nucleotide polymorphisms associated with tHcy (n=18), folate (n=3), vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (n=1), and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (n=14) levels, and the corresponding data for stroke from the MEGASTROKE consortium (n=16 952 subtyped ischemic stroke cases and 404 630 non‐cases).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetically predicted tHcy was associated with SVS, with an odds ratio of 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13‐1.58, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=6.7×10&lt;sup&gt;‐4&lt;/sup&gt;) per 1 SD increase in genetically predicted tHcy levels, but was not associated with large artery or cardioembolic stroke. The association was mainly driven by single‐nucleotide polymorphisms at or near the &lt;i&gt;MTHFR&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MUT&lt;/i&gt; genes. The odds ratios of SVS per 1 SD increase in genetically predicted folate and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; levels were 0.49 (95% 0.34‐0.71, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=1.3×10&lt;sup&gt;‐4&lt;/sup&gt;) and 0.70 (95% 0.52‐0.94, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=0.02), respectively. Genetically higher vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; levels were not associated with any stroke subtype.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that any effect of homocysteine‐lowering treatment in preventing stroke will be confined to the SVS subtype. Whether genetic variants at or near the &lt;i&gt;MTHFR&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MUT&lt;/i&gt; genes influence SVS risk through pathways other than homocysteine levels and downstream effects require further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>RSS PAP: An adenosine A2A receptor antagonist improves multiple symptoms of repeated quinpirole induced psychosis</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by the repeated rise of concerns (obsessions) and repetitive unwanted behavior (compulsions). Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is the first-choice drug, response rates to SSRI treatment vary between symptom dimensions. In this study, to find a therapeutic target for SSRI-resilient OCD symptoms, we evaluated treatment responses of quinpirole sensitization-induced OCD-related behaviors in mice. SSRI administration rescued the cognitive inflexibility, as well as hyperactivity in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), while no improvement was observed for the repetitive behavior. D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor signaling in the central striatum (CS) was involved in SSRI-resistant repetitive behavior. An adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; antagonist, istradefylline, which rescued abnormal excitatory synaptic function in the CS indirect pathway medium spiny neurons of sensitized mice, alleviated both of the QNP-induced abnormal behaviors with only short-term administration. These results provide a new insight into therapeutic strategies for SSRI-resistant OCD symptoms and indicate the potential of A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; antagonists as a rapid-acting anti-OCD drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Clinical studies show distinct therapeutic efficacies for SSRIs between subtypes of OCD symptoms. While abnormal activity in the cortico-striatal pathway is critically involved in the pathophysiology of OCD, the neurological mechanisms and therapeutic strategies for SSRI-resistant symptoms remain unclear. In this study, we showed that repeated injection of dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonist, quinpirole elicited two distinct OCD-related behaviors; cognitive inflexibility (SSRI-responsive) and repetitive behavior (SSRI-resistant). While SSRI treatment normalized hyperactivity of the orbitofrontal cortex, we also demonstrated the imbalanced excitatory inputs in the central striatum of quinpirole-treated mice and the therapeutic potential of an A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; antagonist as a modulator of indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (MSNs).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A computational model for grid maps in neural populations. (arXiv:1902.06553v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06553</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06553</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, together with place, speed and border
cells, are major contributors to the organization of spatial representations in
the brain. In this contribution we introduce a novel theoretical and
algorithmic framework able to explain the emergence of hexagonal grid-like
response patterns from the statistics of the input stimuli. We show that this
pattern is a result of minimal variance encoding of neurons. The novelty lies
into the formulation of the encoding problem through the modern Frame Theory
language, specifically that of equiangular Frames, providing new insights about
the optimality of hexagonal grid receptive fields. The model proposed overcomes
some crucial limitations of the current attractor and oscillatory models. It is
based on the well-accepted and tested hypothesis of Hebbian learning, providing
a simplified cortical-based framework that does not require the presence of
theta velocity-driven oscillations (oscillatory model) or translational
symmetries in the synaptic connections (attractor model). We moreover
demonstrate that the proposed encoding mechanism naturally maps shifts,
rotations and scaling of the stimuli onto the shape of grid cells' receptive
fields, giving a straightforward explanation of the experimental evidence of
grid cells remapping under transformations of environmental cues.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Metabolic basis of brain-like electrical signalling in bacterial communities. (arXiv:1902.06352v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06352</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06352</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Information processing in the mammalian brain relies on a careful regulation
of the membrane potential dynamics of its constituent neurons, which propagates
across the neuronal tissue via electrical signalling. We recently reported the
existence of electrical signalling in a much simpler organism, the bacterium
Bacillus subtilis. In dense bacterial communities known as biofilms,
nutrient-deprived B. subtilis cells in the interior of the colony use
electrical communication to transmit stress signals to the periphery, which
interfere with the growth of peripheral cells and reduce nutrient consumption,
thereby relieving stress from the interior. Here we explicitly address the
interplay between metabolism and electrophysiology in bacterial biofilms, by
introducing a spatially-extended mathematical model that combines the metabolic
and electrical components of the phenomenon in a discretised reaction-diffusion
scheme. The model is experimentally validated by environmental and genetic
perturbations, and confirms that metabolic stress is transmitted through the
bacterial population via a potassium wave. Interestingly, this behaviour is
reminiscent of cortical spreading depression in the brain, characterised by a
wave of electrical activity mediated by potassium diffusion that has been
linked to various neurological disorders, calling for future studies on the
evolutionary link between the two phenomena.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Afferent Fiber Activity-Induced Cytoplasmic Calcium Signaling in Parvalbumin-Positive Inhibitory Interneurons of the Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn. (arXiv:1902.06250v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06250</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06250</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal calcium (Ca2+) signaling represents a molecular trigger for diverse
central nervous system adaptations and maladaptions. The altered function of
dorsal spinal inhibitory interneurons is strongly implicated in the mechanisms
underlying central sensitization in chronic pain. Surprisingly little is known,
however, about the characteristics and consequences of Ca2+ signaling in these
cells, including whether and how they are changed following a peripheral insult
or injury and how such alterations might influence maladaptive pain plasticity.
As a first step towards clarifying the precise role of Ca2+ signaling in dorsal
spinal inhibitory neurons for central sensitization, we established methods for
characterizing Ca2+ signals in genetically defined populations of these cells.
In particular, we employed recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors to
deliver subcellularly targeted, genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators into
parvalbumin-positive spinal inhibitory neurons. Using wide-field microscopy, we
observed both spontaneous and afferent fiber activity triggered Ca2+ signals in
these cells. We propose that these methods may be adapted in future studies for
the precise characterization and manipulation of Ca2+ signaling in diverse
spinal inhibitory neuron subtypes, thereby enabling the clarification of its
role in the mechanisms underlying pain chronicity and opening the door for
possibly novel treatment directions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Power contours: optimising sample size and precision in experimental psychology and human neuroscience. (arXiv:1902.06122v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06122</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06122</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When designing experimental studies with human participants, experimenters
must decide how many trials each participant will complete, as well as how many
participants to test. Most discussion of statistical power (the ability of a
study design to detect an effect) has focussed on sample size, and assumed
sufficient trials. Here we explore the influence of both factors on statistical
power, represented as a two-dimensional plot on which iso-power contours can be
visualised. We demonstrate the conditions under which the number of trials is
particularly important, i.e. when the within-participant variance is large
relative to the between-participants variance. We then derive power contour
plots using existing data sets for eight experimental paradigms and
methodologies (including reaction times, sensory thresholds, fMRI, MEG, and
EEG), and provide estimates of the within- and between-participant variance for
each method. In all cases, the within-participant variance was larger than the
between-participants variance, meaning that the number of trials has a
meaningful influence on statistical power in commonly used paradigms. An online
tool is provided (https://shiny.york.ac.uk/powercontours/) for generating power
contours, from which the optimal combination of trials and participants can be
calculated when designing future studies.

	<description>Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-containing proteins in plants and animals mediate intracellular pathogen-sensing. Plant NLRs typically detect strain-specific pathogen effectors and trigger immune responses often linked to localized host cell death. The barley &lt;i&gt;Mla&lt;/i&gt; disease resistance locus has undergone extensive functional diversification in the host population and encodes numerous allelic NLRs each detecting a matching isolate-specific avirulence effector (AVR&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) of the fungal pathogen &lt;i&gt;Blumeria graminis&lt;/i&gt; f. sp. &lt;i&gt;hordei&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Bgh&lt;/i&gt;). We report here the isolation of &lt;i&gt;Bgh&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;AVR&lt;sub&gt;a7&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AVR&lt;sub&gt;a9&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AVR&lt;sub&gt;a10&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;and &lt;i&gt;AVR&lt;sub&gt;a22&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, which encode small secreted proteins recognized by allelic MLA7, MLA9, MLA10, and MLA22 receptors, respectively. These effectors are sequence-unrelated, except for allelic &lt;i&gt;AVR&lt;sub&gt;a10 &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;AVR&lt;sub&gt;a22&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; that are co-maintained in pathogen populations in the form of a balanced polymorphism. Contrary to numerous examples of indirect recognition of bacterial effectors by plant NLRs, co-expression experiments with matching &lt;i&gt;Mla&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;AVR&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; pairs indicate direct detection of the sequence-unrelated fungal effectors by MLA receptors.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Compensatory growth renders Tcf7l1a dispensable for eye formation despite its requirement in eye field specification</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.40093</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40093</link>
	<description>The vertebrate eye originates from the eye field, a domain of cells specified by a small number of transcription factors. In this study, we show that Tcf7l1a is one such transcription factor that acts cell-autonomously to specify the eye field in zebrafish. Despite the much-reduced eye field in &lt;i&gt;tcf7l1a&lt;/i&gt; mutants, these fish develop normal eyes revealing a striking ability of the eye to recover from a severe early phenotype. This robustness is not mediated through genetic compensation at neural plate stage; instead, the smaller optic vesicle of &lt;i&gt;tcf7l1a&lt;/i&gt; mutants shows delayed neurogenesis and continues to grow until it achieves approximately normal size. Although the developing eye is robust to the lack of Tcf7l1a function, it is sensitised to the effects of additional mutations. In support of this, a forward genetic screen identified mutations in &lt;i&gt;hesx1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cct5&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;gdf6a&lt;/i&gt;, which give synthetically enhanced eye specification or growth phenotypes when in combination with the &lt;i&gt;tcf7l1a&lt;/i&gt; mutation.</description>

	<description>Over a billion people worldwide are affected by vitamin D deficiency. Although vitamin D deficiency is associated with impaired cognition, the mechanisms mediating this link are poorly understood. The extracellular matrix (ECM) has now emerged as an important participant of synaptic plasticity and a new hypothesis is that vitamin D may interact with aggregates of the ECM, perineuronal nets (PNNs), to regulate brain plasticity. Dysregulation of PNNs caused by vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the presentation of cognitive deficits.</description>

	<description>From an evolutionary perspective, the genes of enteric microbes transmitted reliably across generations are nearly as much a part of the human organism as our own genes. Disruption of the microbiome leading to extinction of key ‘heirloom’ taxa can deprive individuals of metabolic pathways that have been present in their ancestors for millennia. Some of these pathways support essential synthesis and toxin clearance processes, including the generation of blood–brain barrier-crossing metabolic products crucial for normal brain function.</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the association of poststroke baseline blood pressure with cerebral collateral flow and functional outcome in acute ischemic patients with large vessel occlusion/stenosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients identified with large vessel occlusion/stenosis with baseline multimodal computed tomography, follow‐up imaging, and complete clinical profiles were included. A 90‐day modified Rankin Scale of 0–1 was defined as an excellent functional outcome. Cerebral collateral flow was quantified by the volume ratio of tissue within the delay time &amp;gt;3 seconds perfusion lesion with severely delayed contrast transit (delay time &amp;gt;3 seconds/delay time &amp;gt;6 seconds).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 306 patients included in this study. With every increase of 10 mmHg in baseline systolic blood pressure, the odds of achieving an excellent functional outcome decreased by 12% in multivariate analysis (odds ratio = 0.88, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.048). Conversely, increased baseline blood pressure was associated with better collateral flow. In subgroup analysis of patients with major reperfusion, higher blood pressure was associated with decreased infarct growth and a better clinical outcome, and vice versa in patients without reperfusion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher baseline blood pressure in acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion/stenosis was associated with better collateral flow. However, for patients without reperfusion, higher baseline blood pressure was associated with increased infarct growth, leading to an unfavorable clinical outcome. The relationship between blood pressure and outcomes is highly dependent on reperfusion, and active blood pressure–lowering treatment may be inappropriate in acute ischemic stroke patients prior to reperfusion treatment.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Functional deficiency in endogenous interleukin‐1 receptor antagonist in patients with febrile infection‐related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25439?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25439?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently reported successful treatment of a child with febrile infection‐related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), a subtype of new‐onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE), with the recombinant interleukin‐1 (IL1) receptor antagonist (IL1RA) anakinra. On this basis, we tested whether endogenous IL1RA production or function is deficient in FIRES patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levels of IL1β and IL1RA were measured in serum and CSF. The inhibitory activity of endogenous IL1RA was assessed using a cell‐based reporter assay. &lt;i&gt;IL1RN&lt;/i&gt; gene variants were identified by sequencing. Expression levels for the secreted and intracellular isoforms of IL1RA were measured in patient and control cells by real‐time polymerase chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levels of endogenous IL1RA and IL1β were elevated in the serum and CSF of patients with FIRES (n=7) relative to healthy controls (n=10). Serum from FIRES patients drove IL1R signaling activity and potentiated IL1R signaling in response to exogenous IL1β in a cell‐based reporter assay. Functional assessment of endogenous IL1RA activity in three FIRES patients revealed attenuated inhibition of IL1R signaling. Sequencing of &lt;i&gt;IL1RN&lt;/i&gt; in our index patient revealed multiple variants. This was accompanied by reduced expression of intracellular but not secreted isoforms of IL1RA in the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that FIRES is associated with reduced expression of intracellular IL1RA isoforms and a functional deficiency in IL1RA inhibitory activity. These observations may provide insight into disease pathogenesis for FIRES and other inflammatory seizure disorders and may provide a valuable biomarker for therapeutic decision‐making.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: SCN1A gain‐of‐function in early infantile encephalopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25438?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To elucidate the biophysical basis underlying the distinct and severe clinical presentation in patients with the recurrent missense &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; variant, p.Thr226Met. Patients with this variant show a well‐defined genotype‐phenotype correlation and present with developmental and early‐infantile epileptic encephalopathy that is far more severe than the typical &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; Dravet syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole cell patch clamp and dynamic action potential clamp were used to study T226M Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 channels expressed in mammalian cells. Computational modeling was used to explore the neuronal scale mechanisms that account for altered action potential firing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T226M channels exhibited hyperpolarizing shifts of the activation and inactivation curves and enhanced fast inactivation. Dynamic action potential clamp hybrid simulation showed that model neurons containing T226M conductance displayed a left shift in rheobase relative to control. At current stimulation levels that produced repetitive active potential firing in control model neurons, depolarization block and cessation of action potential firing occurred in T226M model neuron. Fully computationally simulated neuron models recapitulated the findings from dynamic action potential clamp and also showed that heterozygous T226M models were also more susceptible to depolarization block.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a biophysical perspective the T226M mutation produces gain‐of‐function. Somewhat paradoxically our data suggest that this gain‐of‐function would cause interneurons to more readily develop depolarization block. This “functional dominant negative” interaction would produce a more profound disinhibition than seen with haploinsufficiency that is typical of Dravet syndrome and could readily explain the more severe phenotype of patients with T226M mutation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Disruption of the prefrontal cortex improves implicit contextual memory-guided attention: combined behavioural and electrophysiological evidence. (arXiv:1902.05915v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05915</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05915</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many studies have shown that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays
an important role in top-down cognitive control over intentional and deliberate
behavior. However, recent studies have reported that DLPFC-mediated top-down
control interferes with implicit forms of learning. Here we used continuous
theta burst stimulation (cTBS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) to
investigate the causal role of DLPFC in implicit contextual memory-guided
attention. We aimed to test whether transient disruption of the DLPFC would
interfere with implicit learning performance and related electrical brain
activity. We applied neuronavigation-guided cTBS to the DLPFC or to the vertex
as a control region prior to the performance of an implicit contextual learning
task. We found that cTBS applied over the DLPFC significantly improved
performance during implicit contextual learning. We also noted that beta-band
(13-19 Hz) oscillatory power was reduced at fronto-central channels about 140
to 370 ms after visual stimulus onset in cTBS DLPFC compared with cTBS vertex.
Taken together, our results provide evidence that DLPFC-mediated top-down
control interferes with contextual memory-guided attention and beta-band
oscillatory activity.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Gamma band oscillations reflect sensory and affective dimensions of pain. (arXiv:1902.05899v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05899</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05899</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pain is a multidimensional process, which can be modulated by emotions,
however, the mechanisms underlying this modulation are unknown. We used
pictures with different emotional valence (negative, positive, neutral) as
primes and applied electrical painful stimuli as targets to healthy
participants. We assessed pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings and
recorded electroencephalograms (EEG). We found that pain unpleasantness, and
not pain intensity ratings were modulated by emotion, with increased ratings
for negative and decreased for positive pictures. We also found two consecutive
gamma band oscillations (GBOs) related to pain processing from time frequency
analyses of the EEG signals. An early GBO had a cortical distribution
contralateral to the painful stimulus, and its amplitude was positively
correlated with intensity and unpleasantness ratings, but not with prime
valence. The late GBO had a centroparietal distribution and its amplitude was
larger for negative compared to neutral and positive pictures. The emotional
modulation effect (negative versus positive) of the late GBO amplitude was
positively correlated with pain unpleasantness. The early GBO might reflect the
overall pain perception, possibly involving the thalamocortical circuit, while
the late GBO might be related to the affective dimension of pain and top-down
related processes.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Assessing the Level of Autonomic Nervous Activity for Effective Biofeedback Training. (arXiv:1902.05845v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05845</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05845</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a prototype of a new biofeedback training based on
mathematical models of cardiovascular control. For this purpose we develop a
low-cost device that is able to record and process arterial pulse wave via
photoplethysmograph and skin temperature on the peripheral part of the arm. A
benchmark analysis of our device against a registered cardiovascular
measurement system (Biopac MP35 from Biopac Inc., USA) shows that heart rate
and skin temperature values delivered by our device are acceptable with a very
low residual error (+/-1 beat/min, +/-1 oC).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both measured signals are feed into a mathematical model which estimates the
level of activity of both sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the
autonomic nervous system. That information is used jointly with other
biological parameters for investigating the stress score of the subject. The
data is processed in real-time and continuously displayed to the user for
effective biofeedback training.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complete solution was preliminary tested on three volunteers who used the
displayed biofeedback information in order to regulate their emotional state
successfully during Biofeedback training. They exhibited a significant
reduction in stress score compared to three control subjects who did not used
our solution during biofeedback training. This supports the benefits of
biofeedback training with autonomic nervous tone assessment as effective
holistic healing method.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sleep stages classification is a crucial task in the context of sleep
studies. It involves the simultaneous analysis of multiple signals recorded
during sleep. However, it is complex and tedious, and even the trained expert
can spend several hours scoring a single night recording. Multiple automatic
methods have tried to solve these problems in the past, most of them by
classifying a feature vector that is engineered for a specific dataset. In this
work, we avoid this bias using a deep learning model that learns relevant
features without human intervention. Particularly, we propose an ensemble of 5
convolutional networks that achieves a kappa index of 0.83 when classifying a
dataset of 500 sleep recordings.

Cembrowski and Spruston describe the heterogeneity of hippocampal pyramidal cells and argue that these cells can act as a model of within-cell-type heterogeneity in the brain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrn/rss/current/~4/V18cn4lIkxw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Hypoosmotic conditions activate volume-regulated anion channels in vertebrate cells. These channels are formed by leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 8 (LRRC8) family members and contain LRRC8A in homo- or hetero-hexameric assemblies. Here we present single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structures of &lt;i&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/i&gt; LRRC8A in complex with the inhibitor DCPIB reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs. DCPIB plugs the channel like a cork in a bottle - binding in the extracellular selectivity filter and sterically occluding ion conduction. Constricted and expanded structures reveal coupled dilation of cytoplasmic LRRs and the channel pore, suggesting a mechanism for channel gating by internal stimuli. Conformational and symmetry differences between LRRC8A structures determined in detergent micelles and lipid bilayers related to reorganization of intersubunit lipid binding sites demonstrate a critical role for the membrane in determining channel structure. These results provide insight into LRRC8 gating and inhibition and the role of lipids in the structure of an ionic-strength sensing ion channel.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Efficient neural decoding of self-location with a deep recurrent network</title>

Place cells in the mammalian hippocampus signal self-location with sparse spatially stable firing fields. Based on observation of place cell activity it is possible to accurately decode an animal’s location. The precision of this decoding sets a lower bound for the amount of information that the hippocampal population conveys about the location of the animal. In this work we use a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) decoder to infer the location of freely moving rats from single unit hippocampal recordings. RNNs are biologically plausible models of neural circuits that learn to incorporate relevant temporal context without the need to make complicated assumptions about the use of prior information to predict the current state. When decoding animal position from spike counts in 1D and 2D-environments, we show that the RNN consistently outperforms a standard Bayesian approach with either flat priors or with memory. In addition, we also conducted a set of sensitivity analysis on the RNN decoder to determine which neurons and sections of firing fields were the most influential. We found that the application of RNNs to neural data allowed flexible integration of temporal context, yielding improved accuracy relative to the more commonly used Bayesian approaches and opens new avenues for exploration of the neural code.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lLRmD88blGo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Verbalizing phylogenomic conflict: Representation of node congruence across competing reconstructions of the neoavian explosion</title>

Phylogenomic research is accelerating the publication of landmark studies that aim to resolve deep divergences of major organismal groups. Meanwhile, systems for identifying and integrating the products of phylogenomic inference–such as newly supported clade concepts–have not kept pace. However, the ability to &lt;i&gt;verbalize&lt;/i&gt; node concept congruence and conflict across multiple, in effect simultaneously endorsed phylogenomic hypotheses, is a prerequisite for building synthetic data environments for biological systematics and other domains impacted by these conflicting inferences. Here we develop a novel solution to the conflict verbalization challenge, based on a logic representation and reasoning approach that utilizes the language of Region Connection Calculus (RCC–5) to produce consistent &lt;i&gt;alignments&lt;/i&gt; of node concepts endorsed by incongruent phylogenomic studies. The approach employs clade concept labels to individuate concepts used by each source, even if these carry identical names. Indirect RCC–5 modeling of &lt;i&gt;intensional&lt;/i&gt; (property-based) node concept definitions, facilitated by the local relaxation of coverage constraints, allows parent concepts to attain congruence in spite of their differentially sampled children. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we align two recent phylogenomic reconstructions of higher-level avian groups that entail strong conflict in the &quot;neoavian explosion&quot; region. According to our representations, this conflict is constituted by 26 instances of input &quot;whole concept&quot; overlap. These instances are further resolvable in the output labeling schemes and visualizations as &quot;split concepts&quot;, which provide the labels and relations needed to build truly synthetic phylogenomic data environments. Because the RCC–5 alignments fundamentally reflect the trained, logic-enabled judgments of systematic experts, future designs for such environments need to promote a culture where experts routinely assess the intensionalities of node concepts published by our peers–even and especially when we are not in agreement with each other.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UeKsJptfnwM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

MDGAs, immunoglobulin superfamily proteins, negatively regulate synapse development through blocking neuroligin–neurexin interactions. Recent analyses of MDGA–neuroligin complexes revealed the structural basis of this activity and indicate that MDGAs interact with all neuroligins with differential affinities. Surprisingly, analyses of mouse mutants revealed a functional divergence, with targeted mutation of &lt;em&gt;Mdga1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mdga2&lt;/em&gt; elevating inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively, on hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Further research is needed to determine the synapse-specific organizing properties of MDGAs in neural circuits, which may depend on relative levels and subcellular distributions of each MDGA, neuroligin and neurexin. Behavioral deficits in &lt;em&gt;Mdga&lt;/em&gt; mutant mice support genetic links to schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders and raise the possibility of harnessing these interactions for therapeutic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Large-Scale 3-5 Hz Oscillation Constrains the Expression of Neocortical Fast Ripples in a Mouse Model of Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Large-scale slow oscillations allow the integration of neuronal activity across brain regions during sensory or cognitive processing. However, evidence that this form of coding also holds for pathological networks, such as for distributed networks in epileptic disorders, does not yet exist. Here, we show in a mouse model of unilateral hippocampal epilepsy that epileptic fast ripples generated in the neocortex distant from the primary focus occur during transient trains of interictal epileptic discharges. During these epileptic paroxysms, local phase-locking of neuronal firing and a phase–amplitude coupling of the epileptic discharges over a slow oscillation at 3–5 Hz are detected. Furthermore, the buildup of the slow oscillation begins in the bihippocampal network that includes the focus, which synchronizes and drives the activity across the large-scale epileptic network into the frontal cortex. This study provides the first functional description of the emergence of neocortical fast ripples in hippocampal epilepsy and shows that cross-frequency coupling might be a fundamental mechanism underlying the spreading of epileptic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: The VWFA Is the Home of Orthographic Learning When Houses Are Used as Letters</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Learning to read specializes a portion of the left mid-fusiform cortex for printed word recognition, the putative visual word form area (VWFA). This study examined whether a VWFA specialized for English is sufficiently malleable to support learning a perceptually atypical second writing system. The study utilized an artificial orthography, HouseFont, in which house images represent English phonemes. House images elicit category-biased activation in a spatially distinct brain region, the so-called parahippocampal place area (PPA). Using house images as letters made it possible to test whether the capacity for learning a second writing system involves neural territory that supports reading in the first writing system, or neural territory tuned for the visual features of the new orthography. Twelve human adults completed two weeks of training to establish basic HouseFont reading proficiency and underwent functional neuroimaging pre and post-training. Analysis of three functionally defined regions of interest (ROIs), the VWFA, and left and right PPA, found significant pre-training versus post-training increases in response to HouseFont words only in the VWFA. Analysis of the relationship between the behavioral and neural data found that activation changes from pre-training to post-training within the VWFA predicted HouseFont reading speed. These results demonstrate that learning a new orthography utilizes neural territory previously specialized by the acquisition of a native writing system. Further, they suggest VWFA engagement is driven by orthographic functionality and not the visual characteristics of graphemes, which informs the broader debate about the nature of category-specialized areas in visual association cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Modes of Accessing Bicarbonate for the Regulation of Membrane Guanylate Cyclase (ROS-GC) in Retinal Rods and Cones</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The membrane guanylate cyclase, ROS-GC, that synthesizes cyclic GMP for use as a second messenger for visual transduction in retinal rods and cones, is stimulated by bicarbonate. Bicarbonate acts directly on ROS-GC1, because it enhanced the enzymatic activity of a purified, recombinant fragment of bovine ROS-GC1 consisting solely of the core catalytic domain. Moreover, recombinant ROS-GC1 proved to be a true sensor of bicarbonate, rather than a sensor for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Access to bicarbonate differed in rods and cones of larval salamander, &lt;i&gt;Ambystoma tigrinum&lt;/i&gt;, of unknown sex. In rods, bicarbonate entered at the synapse and diffused to the outer segment, where it was removed by Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent exchange. In contrast, cones generated bicarbonate internally from endogenous CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or from exogenous CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that was present in extracellular solutions of bicarbonate. Bicarbonate production from both sources of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was blocked by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide. Carbonic anhydrase II expression was verified immunohistochemically in cones but not in rods. In addition, cones acquired bicarbonate at their outer segments as well as at their inner segments. The multiple pathways for access in cones may support greater uptake of bicarbonate than in rods and buffer changes in its intracellular concentration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Ferroptosis in Neurons and Cancer Cells Is Similar But Differentially Regulated by Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/1/ENEURO.0263-18.2019?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ferroptotic death is a mechanism for tumor suppression by pharmacological inhibitors that target the X&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; transporter (cystine/glutamate antiporter) in a host of non-CNS and CNS tumors. Inhibition of this transporter leads to reduction of cystine uptake, cyst(e)ine deprivation, subsequent depletion of the versatile antioxidant glutathione, and reactive lipid species-dependent death. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibitors of the X&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; transporter can also induce neuronal cell death raising concerns about toxicity in the CNS and PNS if these agents are used for chemotherapy. Here, we show that ferroptotic death induced by the canonical ferroptosis inducer erastin is similar in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and primary cortical neurons although cell death is mediated more potently in cancer cells. Reducing the toxicity of ferroptosis inducers will require, among other things, the identification of agents that protect neurons from ferroptosis but exacerbate it in tumor cells. Although we show that a number of agents known to block ferroptosis in primary mouse neurons also inhibit ferroptosis in fibrosarcoma cells, class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors selectively protect neurons while augmenting ferroptosis in cancer cells. Our results further suggest that cell death pathways induced by erastin in these two cell types are statistically identical to each other and identical to oxidative glutamate toxicity in neurons, where death is also mediated via inhibition of X&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; cystine transport. Together, these studies identify HDACs inhibitors as a novel class of agents to augment tumor suppression by ferroptosis induction and to minimize neuronal toxicity that could manifest as peripheral neuropathy or chemo brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Synaptic Organization of VGLUT3 Expressing Low-Threshold Mechanosensitive C Fiber Terminals in the Rodent Spinal Cord</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/1/ENEURO.0007-19.2019?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/1/ENEURO.0007-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Low-threshold mechanosensitive C fibers (C-LTMRs) that express the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3 are thought to signal affective touch, and may also play a role in mechanical allodynia. However, the nature of the central termination of C-LTMRs in the dorsal horn remains largely unexplored. Here, we used light and electron microscopy in combination with VGLUT3 immunolabeling as a marker of C-LTMR terminations to investigate this issue. VGLUT3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; C-LTMRs formed central terminals of Type II glomeruli in the inner part of lamina II of the dorsal horn, often establishing multiple asymmetric synapses with postsynaptic dendrites but also participating in synaptic configurations with presynaptic axons and dendrites. Unexpectedly, essentially all VGLUT3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; C-LTMR terminals showed substantial VGLUT1 expression in the rat, whereas such terminals in mice lacked VGLUT1. Most VGLUT3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; C-LTMR terminals exhibited weak-to-moderate VGLUT2 expression. Further, C-LTMR terminals formed numerous synapses with excitatory protein kinase C (PKC) interneurons and inhibitory parvalbumin neurons, whereas synapses with calretinin neurons were scarce. C-LTMR terminals rarely if ever established synapses with neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R)-possessing dendrites traversing lamina II. Thus, VGLUT3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; C-LTMR terminals appear to largely correspond to neurofilament-lacking central terminals of Type II glomeruli in inner lamina II and can thus be identified at the ultrastructural level by morphological criteria. The participation of C-LTMR terminals in Type II glomeruli involving diverse populations of interneuron indicates highly complex modes of integration of C-LTMR mediated signaling in the dorsal horn. Furthermore, differences in VGLUT1 expression indicate distinct species differences in synaptic physiology of C-LTMR terminals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Next-Generation Sequencing has made available substantial amounts of large-scale Omics data, providing unprecedented opportunities to understand complex biological systems. Specifically, the value of RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data has been confirmed in inferring how gene regulatory systems will respond under various conditions (bulk data) or cell types (single-cell data). RNA-Seq can generate genome-scale gene expression profiles that can be further analyzed using correlation analysis, co-expression analysis, clustering, differential gene expression (DGE), among many other studies. While these analyses can provide invaluable information related to gene expression, integration and interpretation of the results can prove challenging. Here we present a tool called IRIS-EDA, which is a Shiny web server for expression data analysis. It provides a straightforward and user-friendly platform for performing numerous computational analyses on user-provided RNA-Seq or Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data. Specifically, three commonly used R packages (edgeR, DESeq2, and limma) are implemented in the DGE analysis with seven unique experimental design functionalities, including a user-specified design matrix option. Seven discovery-driven methods and tools (correlation analysis, heatmap, clustering, biclustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)) are provided for gene expression exploration which is useful for designing experimental hypotheses and determining key factors for comprehensive DGE analysis. Furthermore, this platform integrates seven visualization tools in a highly interactive manner, for improved interpretation of the analyses. It is noteworthy that, for the first time, IRIS-EDA provides a framework to expedite submission of data and results to NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) Data Principles. IRIS-EDA is freely available at http://bmbl.sdstate.edu/IRIS/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XQ7EidTt2EQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We seek to characterize the motility of mouse fibroblasts on 2D substrates. Utilizing automated tracking techniques, we find that cell trajectories are super-diffusive, where displacements scale faster than &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; in all directions. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain such statistics in other cell types: run and tumble behavior with Lévy-distributed run times, and ensembles of cells with heterogeneous speed and rotational noise. We develop an automated toolkit that directly compares cell trajectories to the predictions of each model and demonstrate that ensemble-averaged quantities such as the mean-squared displacements and velocity autocorrelation functions are equally well-fit by either model. However, neither model correctly captures the short-timescale behavior quantified by the displacement probability distribution or the turning angle distribution. We develop a hybrid model that includes both run and tumble behavior and heterogeneous noise during the runs, which correctly matches the short-timescale behaviors and indicates that the run times are not Lévy distributed. The analysis tools developed here should be broadly useful for distinguishing between mechanisms for superdiffusivity in other cells types and environments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KIPDgR1gWNs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The dynamic nature of technological developments invites us to rethink the learning spaces. In this context, science education can be enriched by the contribution of new computational resources, making the educational process more up-to-date, challenging, and attractive. Bioinformatics is a key interdisciplinary field, contributing to the understanding of biological processes that is often underrated in secondary schools. As a useful resource in learning activities, bioinformatics could help in engaging students to integrate multiple fields of knowledge (logical-mathematical, biological, computational, etc.) and generate an enriched and long-lasting learning environment. Here, we report our recent project in which high school students learned basic concepts of programming applied to solving biological problems. The students were taught the Python syntax, and they coded simple tools to answer biological questions using resources at hand. Notably, these were built mostly on the students’ own smartphones, which proved to be capable, readily available, and relevant complementary tools for teaching. This project resulted in an empowering and inclusive experience that challenged differences in social background and technological accessibility.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DU--q7uExMA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The current working model is that upon release, dopamine diffuses to influence many target cells via wide-spread receptors. Recent studies, however, suggest that dopamine release is fast and generates small signaling hotspots. In this review, we summarize progress on the understanding of the dopamine release apparatus and evaluate how its properties may shape dopamine signaling during firing. We discuss how mechanisms of regulation may act through this machinery and propose that striatal architecture for dopamine signaling may have evolved to support rapid dopamine coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Estradiol-Induced Potentiation of Dopamine Release in Dorsal Striatum Following Amphetamine Administration Requires Estradiol Receptors and mGlu5</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Estradiol potentiates behavioral sensitization to cocaine as well as self-administration of cocaine and other drugs of abuse in female rodents. Furthermore, stimulated dopamine (DA) in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is rapidly enhanced by estradiol, and it is hypothesized that this enhanced DA release mediates the more rapid escalation of drug taking seen in females, compared with males. The mechanisms mediating the effect of estradiol to enhance stimulated DA release were investigated in this study. Using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microdialysis and high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection, we first examined the effect of estradiol on amphetamine-induced DA increase in the DLS of ovariectomized rats. We then tested whether the potentiation of this DA increase could be blocked by the estradiol receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780 (ICI), or an antagonist to the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu5), 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP). There is evidence that estradiol receptors collaborate with mGlu5 within caveoli in DLS and mGlu5 is hypothesized to mediate many of the effects of estradiol in the addiction processes in females. Our data show that estradiol enhances the DA response to amphetamine. Either ICI or MPEP prevented the effect of estradiol to enhance DA release. Importantly, our results also showed that neither ICI or MPEP alone is able to influence the DA response to amphetamine when estradiol is not administrated, suggesting that ICI and MPEP act via estradiol receptors. Together, our findings demonstrate that estradiol potentiates amphetamine-stimulated DA release in the DLS and this effect requires both estradiol receptors and mGlu5.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: The disease-associated chaperone FKBP51 impairs cognitive function by accelerating AMPA receptor recycling</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Increased expression of the &lt;i&gt;FK506-binding protein 5&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;FKBP5)&lt;/i&gt; gene has been associated with a number of diseases, but most prominently in connection to psychiatric illnesses. Many of these psychiatric disorders present with dementia and other cognitive deficits, but a direct connection between these issues and alterations in &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; remains unclear. We generated a novel transgenic mouse to selectively overexpress &lt;i&gt;FKBP5,&lt;/i&gt; which encodes the FKBP51 protein, in the corticolimbic system, which had no overt effects on gross body weight, motor ability, or general anxiety. Instead, we found that overexpression of FKBP51 impaired long-term depression as well as spatial reversal learning and memory, suggesting a role in glutamate receptor regulation. Indeed, FKBP51 altered the association of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) with AMPA receptors, which was accompanied by an accelerated rate of AMPA receptor. In this way, the chaperone system is critical in triage decisions for AMPA receptor trafficking. Imbalance in the chaperone system may manifest in impairments in both inhibitory learning and cognitive function. These findings uncover an unexpected and essential mechanism for learning and memory that is controlled by the psychiatric risk factor &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Candidate studies have identified a link between &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; allelic variants and psychiatric disorders. Patients with these disorders often present with cognitive defects. &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; variants have been correlated to decreased hippocampal volume, but a direct connection between &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; and cognitive function has not been established. Here, we have found that mice with high levels of &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; have altered reversal learning and memory, which may be through direct regulation of neuronal activity by regulating AMPA receptors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A well-established notion in cognitive neuroscience proposes that multiple brain systems contribute to choice behaviour. These include: (1) a model-free system that uses values cached from the outcome history of alternative actions, and (2) a model-based system that considers action outcomes and the transition structure of the environment. The widespread use of this distinction, across a range of applications, renders it important to index their distinct influences with high reliability. Here we consider the two-stage task, widely considered as a gold standard measure for the contribution of model-based and model-free systems to human choice. We tested the internal/temporal stability of measures from this task, including those estimated via an established computational model, as well as an extended model using drift-diffusion. Drift-diffusion modeling suggested that both choice in the first stage, and RTs in the second stage, are directly affected by a model-based/free trade-off parameter. Both parameter recovery and the stability of model-based estimates were poor but improved substantially when both choice and RT were used (compared to choice only), and when more trials (than conventionally used in research practice) were included in our analysis. The findings have implications for interpretation of past and future studies based on the use of the two-stage task, as well as for characterising the contribution of model-based processes to choice behaviour.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/86pzuygctls&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

An important goal of systems medicine is to study disease in the context of genetic and environmental perturbations to the human interactome network. For diseases with both genetic and infectious contributors, a key postulate is that similar perturbations of the human interactome by either disease mutations or pathogens can have similar disease consequences. This postulate has so far only been tested for a few viral species at the level of whole proteins. Here, we expand the scope of viral species examined, and test this postulate more rigorously at the higher resolution of protein domains. Focusing on diseases with both genetic and viral contributors, we found significant convergent perturbation of the human domain-resolved interactome by endogenous genetic mutations and exogenous viral proteins inducing similar disease phenotypes. Pan-cancer, pan-oncovirus analysis further revealed that domains of human oncoproteins either physically targeted or structurally mimicked by oncoviruses are enriched for cancer driver rather than passenger mutations, suggesting convergent targeting of cancer driver pathways by diverse oncoviruses. Our study provides a framework for high-resolution, network-based comparison of various disease factors, both genetic and environmental, in terms of their impacts on the human interactome.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SPabstvBCoc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;LRRK2&lt;/i&gt; mutations, the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) display incomplete penetrance, indicating the importance of other genetic and environmental influences on disease pathogenesis in &lt;i&gt;LRRK2&lt;/i&gt; mutation carriers. The present study investigates whether urate, an antioxidant, Nrf2 activator, and inverse risk factor for idiopathic PD, is one such candidate biomarker of PD risk modulation in pathogenic &lt;i&gt;LRRK2&lt;/i&gt; mutation carriers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banked plasma samples or urate levels were obtained for three cohorts of age‐ and sex‐matched subjects with and without a known &lt;i&gt;LRRK2&lt;/i&gt; mutation in PD and unaffected controls to conduct a pilot study of 192 subjects from the LRRK2 Cohort Consortium (LCC) and two validation studies of 380 additional subjects from the LCC and of 922 subjects from the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative. Urate levels were compared by multiple regression between subjects with and without a PD diagnosis conditional on &lt;i&gt;LRRK2&lt;/i&gt; status, controlling for age and sex.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non‐manifesting &lt;i&gt;LRRK2&lt;/i&gt; mutation carriers had significantly higher levels of urate than those who developed PD in each of the three independent cohorts. A meta‐analysis demonstrated an adjusted mean difference of 0.62 mg/dL (p&amp;lt;0.001), with similar results for separate assessments of women (p&amp;lt;0.02) and men (p&amp;lt;0.001). A 2 mg/dL increment in urate concentration decreased the odds of having PD by more than 50% (OR = 0.48; p = 0.004).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings identify and substantiate urate as a biomarker of resistance to PD among &lt;i&gt;LRRK2&lt;/i&gt; mutation carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study analyzed serum neurofilament light chains (NfL) in 2 European cohorts of 312 MS patients to investigate whether NfL are biomarkers of PML during natalizumab treatment. The cohort comprised 25 PML, 136 natalizumab‐treated, and 151 untreated MS patients. Patients subsequently developing PML had similar NfL to other natalizumab‐treated MS patients. At PML onset, NfL were 10‐fold higher than in the pre‐PML condition and in natalizumab‐treated or untreated MS patients, and NfL continued to increase until onset of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. The results suggest that in natalizumab‐treated patients NfL may represent an early and accessible marker of PML.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Motor and reinforcement learning have been classically linked to functionally independent brain networks centered on the cerebellum and the basal ganglia respectively. In a recent study published in &lt;i&gt;eNeuro,&lt;/i&gt; Therrien et al. (2018) showed that increasing motor noise in healthy subjects disrupts reinforcement learning. However, this impairment remained well below that detected in cerebellar patients even when motor noise in healthy subjects was adjusted to match that observed in the patients. This suggests that impaired reinforcement learning following cerebellar damage cannot be solely accounted for by altered motor noise in these patients. Based on recent anatomical and functional evidence, we argue that the cerebellum may directly contribute to reinforcement learning, consistent with its tight connections with the basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the gradual degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to striatal dopamine depletion. A partial unilateral striatal 6-OHDA lesion causes 40 – 60% dopamine depletion in the lesioned rat striatum, modeling the early stage of PD. In this study, we explored the connectivity between the brain regions in partially 6-OHDA lesioned male Wistar rats under urethane anesthesia using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 5 weeks after the 6-OHDA infusion. Under urethane anesthesia, the brain fluctuates between the two states, resembling rapid-eye-movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep states. We observed clear urethane-induced sleep-like states in 8/19 lesioned animals and 8/18 control animals. 6-OHDA lesioned animals exhibited significantly lower functional connectivity between the brain regions. However, we observed these differences only during the REM-like sleep state, suggesting the involvement of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway in REM sleep regulation. Corticocortical and corticostriatal connections were decreased in both hemispheres, reflecting the global effect of the lesion. Overall, this study describes a promising model to study PD-related sleep disorders in rats using fMRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Disturbances in sleep patterns and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder are among the first symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, PD-related sleep disorders have been virtually unexplored in animal models. This is a first study which has examined the functional connectivity (FC) during urethane-induced sleep-like states in the partial striatal 6-OHDA lesion rat model of early-stage PD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that FC is significantly decreased in 6-OHDA lesioned animals, but only during the REM-like state. These changes affected both the lesioned and intact hemispheres, mostly involving corticocortical and corticostriatal connections. The results suggest that this rat model is a promising tool for studying sleep disturbances in early-stage Parkinson’s disease with resting-state fMRI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Individuals with sleep apnea often exhibit changes in cognitive behaviors consistent with alterations in the hippocampus. It is hypothesized that adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus is an ongoing process that maintains normal hippocampal function in many mammalian species, including humans. However, the impact of chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH), a principal consequence of sleep apnea, on hippocampal adult neurogenesis remains unclear. Using a murine model, we examined the impact of 30 d of IH (IH&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;) on adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus. Although IH&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; did not affect paired-pulse facilitation, IH&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; suppressed long-term potentiation (LTP). Immunohistochemical experiments also indicate that IH perturbs multiple aspects of adult neurogenesis. IH&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; increased the number of proliferating Sox2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neural progenitor cells in the subgranular zone yet reduced the number of doublecortin-positive neurons. Consistent with these findings, cell lineage tracing revealed that IH&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; increased the proportion of radial glial cells in the subgranular zone, yet decreased the proportion of adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus. While administration of a superoxide anion scavenger during IH did not prevent neural progenitor cell proliferation, it mitigated the IH-dependent suppression of LTP and prevented adult-born neuron loss. These data demonstrate that IH causes both reactive oxygen species-dependent and reactive oxygen species-independent effects on adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus. Our findings identify cellular and neurophysiological changes in the hippocampus that may contribute to cognitive and behavioral deficits occurring in sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Individuals with sleep apnea experience periods of intermittent hypoxia (IH) that can negatively impact many aspects of brain function. Neurons are continually generated throughout adulthood to support hippocampal physiology and behavior. This study demonstrates that IH exposure attenuates hippocampal long-term potentiation and reduces adult neurogenesis. Antioxidant treatment mitigates these effects indicating that oxidative signaling caused by IH is a significant factor that impairs synaptic plasticity and reduces adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dissociable Disruptions in Thalamic and Hippocampal Resting-State Functional Connectivity in Youth with 22q11.2 Deletions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a recurrent copy number variant with high penetrance for developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. Study of individuals with 22q11DS therefore may offer key insights into neural mechanisms underlying such complex illnesses. Resting-state functional connectivity MRI studies in idiopathic schizophrenia have consistently revealed disruption of thalamic and hippocampal circuitry. Here, we sought to test whether this circuitry is similarly disrupted in the context of this genetic high-risk condition. To this end, resting-state functional connectivity patterns were assessed in a sample of human youth with 22q11DS (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 42; 59.5% female) and demographically matched healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 39; 53.8% female). Neuroimaging data were acquired via single-band protocols and analyzed in line with methods provided by the Human Connectome Project. We computed functional relationships between individual-specific anatomically defined thalamic and hippocampal seeds and all gray matter voxels in the brain. Whole-brain Type I error protection was achieved through nonparametric permutation-based methods. The 22q11DS patients displayed dissociable disruptions in thalamic and hippocampal functional connectivity relative to control subjects. Thalamocortical coupling was increased in somatomotor regions and reduced across associative networks. The opposite effect was observed for the hippocampus in regards to somatomotor and associative network connectivity. The thalamic and hippocampal dysconnectivity observed in 22q11DS suggests that high genetic risk for psychiatric illness is linked with disruptions in large-scale corticosubcortical networks underlying higher-order cognitive functions. These effects highlight the translational importance of large-effect copy number variants for informing mechanisms underlying neural disruptions observed in idiopathic developmental neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Investigation of neuroimaging biomarkers in highly penetrant genetic syndromes represents a more biologically tractable approach to identify neural circuit disruptions underlying developmental neuropsychiatric conditions. The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome confers particularly high risk for psychotic disorders and is thus an important translational model in which to investigate systems-level mechanisms implicated in idiopathic illness. Here, we show resting-state fMRI evidence of large-scale sensory and executive network disruptions in youth with 22q11DS. In particular, this study provides the first evidence that these networks are disrupted in a dissociable fashion with regard to the functional connectivity of the thalamus and hippocampus, suggesting circuit-level dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Mechanisms of Emotion Regulation Moderate the Predictive Value of Affective and Value-Related Brain Responses to Persuasive Messages</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Emotionally evocative messages can be an effective way to change behavior, but the neural pathways that translate messages into effects on individuals and populations are not fully understood. We used a human functional neuroimaging approach to ask how affect-, value-, and regulation-related brain systems interact to predict effects of graphic anti-smoking messages for individual smokers (both males and females) and within a population-level messaging campaign. Results indicated that increased activity in the amygdala, a region involved in affective reactivity, predicted both personal quit intentions and population-level information-seeking and this was mediated by activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a region involved in computing an integrative value signal. Further, the predictive value of these regions was moderated by expression of a meta-analytically defined brain pattern indexing emotion regulation. That is, amygdala and vmPFC activity strongly tracked with population behavior only when participants showed low recruitment of this brain pattern, which consists of regions involved in goal-driven regulation of affective responses. Overall, these findings suggest that affective and value-related brain responses can predict the success of persuasive messages and that neural mechanisms of emotion regulation can shape these responses, moderating the extent to which they track with population-level message impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; People and organizations often appeal to our emotions to persuade us, but how these appeals engage the brain to drive behavior is not fully understood. We present an fMRI-based model that integrates affect-, control-, and value-related brain responses to predict the impact of graphic anti-smoking stimuli within a small group of smokers and a larger-scale public messaging campaign. This model indicated that amygdala activity predicted the impact of the anti-smoking messages, but that this relationship was mediated by ventromedial prefrontal cortex and moderated by expression of a distributed brain pattern associated with regulating emotion. These results suggest that neural mechanisms of emotion regulation can shape the extent to which affect and value-related brain responses track with population behavioral effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Upregulation of Anandamide Hydrolysis in the Basolateral Complex of Amygdala Reduces Fear Memory Expression and Indices of Stress and Anxiety</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Increased anandamide (AEA) signaling through inhibition of its catabolic enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in the basolateral complex of amygdala (BLA) is thought to buffer against the effects of stress and reduces behavioral signs of anxiety and fear. However, examining the role of AEA signaling in stress, anxiety, and fear through pharmacological depletion has been challenging due to the redundant complexity of its biosynthesis and the lack of a pharmacological synthesis inhibitor. We developed a herpes simplex viral vector to rapidly yet transiently overexpress FAAH specifically within the BLA to assess the impact of suppressing AEA signaling on stress, fear, and anxiety in male rats. Surprisingly, FAAH overexpression in BLA dampened stress-induced corticosterone release, reduced anxiety-like behaviors, and decreased conditioned fear expression. Interestingly, depleting AEA signaling in the BLA did not prevent fear conditioning itself or fear reinstatement. These effects were specific to the overexpression of FAAH because they were reversed by intra-BLA administration of an FAAH inhibitor. Moreover, the fear-suppressive effects of FAAH overexpression were also mitigated by intra-BLA administration of a low dose of a GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist, but not an NMDA/AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, suggesting that they were mediated by an increase in GABAergic neurotransmission. Our data suggest that a permissive AEA tone within the BLA might gate GABA release and that loss of this tone through elevated AEA hydrolysis increases inhibition in the BLA, which in turn reduces stress, anxiety, and fear. These data provide new insights on the mechanisms by which amygdalar endocannabinoid signaling regulates emotional behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Amygdala endocannabinoid signaling is involved in the regulation of stress, anxiety, and fear. Our data indicate that viral-mediated augmentation of anandamide hydrolysis within the basolateral amygdala reduces behavioral indices of stress, anxiety, and conditioned fear expression. These same effects have been previously documented with inhibition of anandamide hydrolysis in the same brain region. Our results indicate that the ability of anandamide signaling to regulate emotional behavior is nonlinear and may involve actions at distinct neuronal populations, which could be influenced by the basal level of anandamide. Modulation of anandamide signaling is a current clinical therapeutic target for stress-related psychiatric illnesses, so these data underscore the importance of fully understanding the mechanisms by which anandamide signaling regulates amygdala-dependent changes in emotionality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Stress Elicits Contrasting Effects on the Structure and Number of Astrocytes in the Amygdala versus Hippocampus</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Stress causes divergent patterns of structural and physiological plasticity in the hippocampus versus amygdala. However, a majority of earlier studies focused primarily on neurons. Despite growing evidence for the importance of glia in health and disease, relatively little is known about how stress affects astrocytes. Further, previous work focused on hippocampal astrocytes. Hence, we examined the impact of chronic immobilization stress (2 h/d, 10 d), on the number and structure of astrocytes in the rat hippocampus and amygdala. We observed a reduction in the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes in the basal amygdala (BA), 1 d after the end of 10 d of chronic stress. Detailed morphometric analysis of individual dye-filled astrocytes also revealed a decrease in the neuropil volume occupied by these astrocytes in the BA, alongside a reduction in the volume fraction of fine astrocytic protrusions rather than larger dendrite-like processes. By contrast, the same chronic stress had no effect on the number or morphology of astrocytes in hippocampal area CA3. We also confirmed previous reports that chronic stress triggers dendritic hypertrophy in dye-filled BA principal neurons that were located adjacent to astrocytes that had undergone atrophy. Thus, building on earlier evidence for contrasting patterns of stress-induced plasticity in neurons across brain areas, our findings offer new evidence that the same stress can also elicit divergent morphological effects in astrocytes in the hippocampus versus the amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: A Cellular Mechanism Underlying Enhanced Capability for Complex Olfactory Discrimination Learning</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The biological mechanisms underlying complex forms of learning requiring the understanding of rules based on previous experience are not yet known. Previous studies have raised the intriguing possibility that improvement in complex learning tasks requires the long-term modulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability, induced by reducing the conductance of the slow calcium-dependent potassium current (sI&lt;sub&gt;AHP&lt;/sub&gt;) simultaneously in most neurons in the relevant neuronal networks in several key brain areas. Such sI&lt;sub&gt;AHP&lt;/sub&gt; reduction is expressed in attenuation of the postburst afterhyperpolarization (AHP) potential, and thus in enhanced repetitive action potential firing. Using complex olfactory discrimination (OD) learning as a model for complex learning, we show that brief activation of the GluK2 subtype glutamate receptor results in long-lasting enhancement of neuronal excitability in neurons from controls, but not from trained rats. Such an effect can be obtained by a brief tetanic synaptic stimulation or by direct application of kainate, both of which reduce the postburst AHP in pyramidal neurons. Induction of long-lasting enhancement of neuronal excitability is mediated via a metabotropic process that requires PKC and ERK activation. Intrinsic neuronal excitability cannot be modulated by synaptic activation in neurons from GluK2 knock-out mice. Accordingly, these mice are incapable of learning the complex OD task. Moreover, viral-induced overexpression of Gluk2 in piriform cortex pyramidal neurons results in remarkable enhancement of complex OD learning. Thus, signaling via kainate receptors has a central functional role in higher cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the familial aggregation of idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), neurodegenerative diseases, and related biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 404 and 387 first‐degree relatives of 102 patients with iRBD and 89 controls were recruited, respectively. Among them, 204 and 208 relatives of patients and controls underwent face‐to‐face clinical assessment, while 97 and 75 relatives underwent further video‐polysomnographic assessment, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with relatives of controls, relatives of patients demonstrated higher levels of RBD features including chin tonic electromyography activity (mean: 1.5&amp;amp;pm7.5 vs. 0.3&amp;amp;pm1.0, p=0.04) and behavioral events (n [weighted %]: 12 [11.3] vs. 2 [1.9], adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=7.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.54‐33.33, p=0.009) during rapid eye movement sleep, probable diagnosis (n [%]: 57 [14.9] vs. 20 [4.9], aHR=3.45, 95% CI=1.96‐6.25, p &amp;lt;0.001), and definite diagnosis (n [weighted %]: 10 [8.4] vs. 2 [1.4], aHR=5.56, 95% CI=1.16‐25.00, p=0.03). They also had higher risks of Parkinson's disease (3.1% vs 0.5%, aHR=5.88, 95% CI=1.37‐25.00, p=0.02), dementia (6.9% vs. 2.6%, aHR=2.44, 95% CI=1.15‐5.26, p=0.02), constipation (8.3% vs. 2.4%, adjusted odds ratio=4.21, 95% CI=1.34‐13.17, p=0.01), and motor dysfunction (MDS‐UPDRS part III motor score, mean: 1.9&amp;amp;pm3.2 vs. 0.9&amp;amp;pm2.3, p=0.002). The unaffected relatives of patients demonstrated a higher likelihood ratio of prodromal Parkinson's disease (median [interquartile range]: 0.27 [1.19] vs. 0.22 [0.51], p=0.03).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iRBD is familial aggregated from isolated features to full‐blown sleep disorder. Relatives of patients carry a higher risk of alpha‐synucleinopathy in terms of neurodegenerative diseases and prodromal markers, suggesting a familial aggregation and staging pathology of alpha‐synucleinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although BP variability has been regarded as a risk factor for hemorrhagic transformation (HTF) after intravenous thrombolysis, its effect on HTF after endovascular recanalization therapy (ERT) remains to be elucidated. We aimed to study the relationship between BP variability and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) after successful recanalization with ERT.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 211 patients with acute ischemic stroke and successful recanalization (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b or 3) after ERT were included between January 2013 and May 2017. The BP data following ERT was obtained over the first 24 hours using parameters including mean, maximum, minimum, difference between maximum and minimum, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, successive variations, and time rate (TR) of BP variation for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). sICH was defined as parenchymal hemorrhage type 2 with neurological deterioration of 4 points of more on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the included patients, 20 (9.5%) developed sICH after successful ERT. The parameters linked with BP fluctuation over time were significantly related to sICH. After adjusting for confounders, the TR of SBP (per 0.1 mmHg/min increase) variation was independently associated with sICH (odds ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.013–2.886).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time‐related BP variability in the first 24 hours following successful ERT was more correlated with sICH than other absolute BP level. This suggests that maintaining a stable BP may be an important factor in preventing sICH after successful ERT.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Maps of variability in cell lineage trees</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Damien G. Hicks, Terence P. Speed, Mohammed Yassin, Sarah M. Russell&lt;/p&gt;

New approaches to lineage tracking have allowed the study of differentiation in multicellular organisms over many generations of cells. Understanding the phenotypic variability observed in these lineage trees requires new statistical methods. Whereas an invariant cell lineage, such as that for the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, can be described by a lineage map, defined as the pattern of phenotypes overlaid onto the binary tree, a traditional lineage map is static and does not describe the variability inherent in the cell lineages of higher organisms. Here, we introduce lineage variability maps which describe the pattern of second-order variation in lineage trees. These maps can be undirected graphs of the partial correlations between every lineal position, or directed graphs showing the dynamics of bifurcated patterns in each subtree. We show how to infer these graphical models for lineages of any depth from sample sizes of only a few pedigrees. This required developing the generalized spectral analysis for a binary tree, the natural framework for describing tree-structured variation. When tested on pedigrees from &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; expressing a marker for pharyngeal differentiation potential, the variability maps recover essential features of the known lineage map. When applied to highly-variable pedigrees monitoring cell size in T lymphocytes, the maps show that most of the phenotype is set by the founder naive T cell. Lineage variability maps thus elevate the concept of the lineage map to the population level, addressing questions about the potency and dynamics of cell lineages and providing a way to quantify the progressive restriction of cell fate with increasing depth in the tree.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NySPD1pQXwY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: A poly-glutamine region in the Drosophila vesicular acetylcholine transporter dictates fill-level of cholinergic synaptic vesicles</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0477-18.2019v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0477-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Whilst the primary role of vesicular transporters is to load neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles, accumulating evidence suggests that these proteins also contribute to additional aspects of synaptic function, including vesicle release. In this study, we extend the role of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) to include regulating the transmitter content of synaptic vesicles. We report that manipulation of a C-terminal poly-glutamine (polyQ) region in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; VAChT is sufficient to influence transmitter content, and release frequency, of cholinergic vesicles from the terminals of premotor interneurons. Specifically, we find that reduction of the polyQ region, by one glutamine residue (&lt;i&gt;13Q to 12Q&lt;/i&gt;), results in a significant increase in both amplitude and frequency of spontaneous cholinergic mEPSCs recorded in the aCC and RP2 motoneurons. Moreover, this truncation also results in evoked synaptic currents that show increased duration: consistent with increased ACh release. By contrast, extension of the polyQ region by one glutamine (&lt;i&gt;13Q to 14Q&lt;/i&gt;) is sufficient to reduce mEPSC amplitude and frequency and, moreover, prevents evoked synaptic vesicle release. Finally, a complete deletion of the PolyQ region (13Q to 0Q) has no obvious effects to mEPSCs, but again evoked synaptic currents show increased duration. The mechanisms that ensure synaptic vesicles are filled to physiologically-appropriate levels remain unknown. Our study identifies the polyQ region of the insect VAChT to be required for correct vesicle transmitter loading and, thus, provides opportunity to increase understanding of this critical aspect of neurotransmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Neurotransmitter-loading of synaptic vesicles is tightly regulated and underpins the quantal theory of neurotransmission. However, although observed at every synapse studied, the mechanistic basis that ensures vesicle-filling stops at a fixed, pre-determined, level remains poorly understood. In this study we identify a C-terminal poly-glutamine region in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; VAChT to be critical for vesicle-loading of ACh. Reduction or extension of this region, by just one glutamine residue, is sufficient to increase or decrease, respectively, the amount of ACh loaded. Our work significantly advances the field of synaptic physiology by identifying a region of a vesicular transporter that regulates the extent to which synaptic vesicles are filled.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Selective activation of cholecystokinin-expressing {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (CCK-GABA) neurons enhances memory and cognition</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Cholecystokinin-expressing GABAergic (CCK-GABA) neurons are perisomatic inhibitory cells that have been argued to regulate emotion and sculpt the network oscillations associated with cognition. However, no study has selectively manipulated CCK-GABA neuron activity during behavior in freely-moving animals. To explore the behavioural effects of activating CCK-GABA neurons on emotion and cognition, we utilized a novel intersectional genetic mouse model coupled with a chemogenetic approach. Specifically, we generated triple transgenic &lt;i&gt;CCK-Cre;Dlx5/6-Flpe;RC::FL-hM3Dq&lt;/i&gt; (CCK-GABA/hM3Dq) mice that expressed the synthetic excitatory hM3Dq receptor in CCK-GABA neurons. Results showed that CNO-mediated activation of CCK-GABA neurons did not alter open field or tail suspension performance and only slightly increased anxiety in the elevated plus maze. Though CNO treatment had only modestly affected emotional behavior, it significantly enhanced multiple cognitive and memory behaviors including social recognition, contextual fear conditioning, contextual discrimination, object recognition and problem-solving in the puzzle box. Collectively, these findings suggest that systemic activation of CCK-GABA neurons minimally affects emotion but significantly enhances cognition and memory. Our results imply that CCK-GABA neurons are more functionally diverse than originally expected and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cognitive/memory disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; CCK-GABA neurons are thought to play an important role in pathologies such as schizophrenia, but their contributions to behavior in the healthy states are poorly understood. Here we report a novel method for selectively targeting CCK-GABA neurons and manipulating their activity during behavioural tasks. Our data demonstrate that activating CCK-GABA neurons subtly affects emotional behavior but surprisingly enhances multiple memory and cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: The Role of Glutamatergic and Dopaminergic Neurons in the Periaqueductal Gray/Dorsal Raphe: Separating Analgesia and Anxiety</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The periaqueductal gray (PAG) is a significant modulator of both analgesic and fear behaviors in both humans and rodents, but the underlying circuitry responsible for these two phenotypes is incompletely understood. Importantly, it is not known if there is a way to produce analgesia without anxiety by targeting the PAG, as modulation of glutamate or GABA neurons in this area initiates both antinociceptive and anxiogenic behavior. While dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG) /dorsal raphe display a supraspinal antinociceptive effect, their influence on anxiety and fear are unknown. Using DAT-cre and Vglut2-cre male mice, we introduced Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to DA and glutamate neurons within the vlPAG using viral-mediated delivery and found that levels of analgesia were significant and quantitatively similar when DA and glutamate neurons were selectively stimulated. Activation of glutamatergic neurons, however, reliably produced higher indices of anxiety, with increased freezing time and more time spent in the safety of a dark enclosure. In contrast, animals in which PAG/dorsal raphe DA neurons were stimulated failed to show fear behaviors. DA-mediated antinociception was inhibitable by haloperidol and was sufficient to prevent persistent inflammatory pain induced by carrageenan. In summary, only activation of DA neurons in the PAG/dorsal raphe produced profound analgesia without signs of anxiety, indicating that PAG/dorsal raphe DA neurons are an important target involved in analgesia that may lead to new treatments for pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Clinicians have long had the goal of separating analgesia from anxiety when using deep brain electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (PAG) for difficult to treat pain. Here we show that selective activation of dopamine neurons within the PAG produces analgesia without other behavioral effects, while stimulating glutamate neurons mediates stress-induced anxiety and analgesia. Our results suggest that dopamine agonists may represent a novel class of analgesic drugs and elucidate target neurons that could mediate their effect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Myelin is a multilayer lipid membrane structure that wraps and insulates axons, allowing for the efficient propagation of action potentials. During developmental myelination of the central nervous system (CNS), oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) proliferate and migrate to their final destination, where they terminally differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes and myelinate axons. Lineage progression and terminal differentiation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells are under tight transcriptional and post-transcriptional control.</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: The VWFA is the home of orthographic learning when houses are used as letters</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Learning to read specializes a portion of the left mid-fusiform cortex for printed word recognition, the putative &quot;visual word form area&quot; (VWFA). This study examined whether a VWFA specialized for English is sufficiently malleable to support learning a perceptually atypical second writing system. The study utilized an artificial orthography, &quot;HouseFont,&quot; in which house images represent English phonemes. House images elicit category-biased activation in a spatially distinct brain region, the so-called &quot;parahippocampal place area&quot; (PPA). Using house images as letters made it possible to test whether the capacity for learning a second writing system involves neural territory that supports reading in the first writing system, or neural territory tuned for the visual features of the new orthography. Twelve human adults completed two-weeks of training to establish basic HouseFont reading proficiency and underwent functional neuroimaging pre and post-training. Analysis of three functionally defined regions of interest, the VWFA, and left and right PPA, found significant pre- versus post-training increases in response to HouseFont words only in the VWFA. Analysis of the relationship between the behavioral and neural data found that activation changes from pre- to post-training within the VWFA predicted HouseFont reading speed. These results demonstrate that learning a new orthography utilizes neural territory previously specialized by the acquisition of a native writing system. Further, they suggest VWFA engagement is driven by orthographic functionality and not the visual characteristics of graphemes, which informs the broader debate about the nature of category-specialized areas in visual association cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Fluent reading recruits a portion of the brain known as the visual word form area (VWFA), but it is less well understood how malleable the VWFA remains after acquiring literacy in a native language. There is also debate about the type of visual information the VWFA can process as orthographically meaningful. We tested whether native English-speaking adults could learn a second, visually atypical writing system for English and used neuroimaging data to assess the location of any learning effects. Participants acquired basic reading ability and learning effects were found in the neural territory that underlies English reading. This suggests that the VWFA remains plastic after initial literacy and is not restricted by the visual features of a writing system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Assessing the impacts of correlated variability with dissociated timescales</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Despite the profound influence on coding capacity of sensory neurons, the measurements of noise correlations have been inconsistent. This is, possibly, because nonstationarity, i.e. drifting baselines, engendered the spurious long-term correlations even if no actual short-term correlation existed. Although attempts to separate them have been made previously, they were ad hoc for specific cases or computationally too demanding. Here we proposed an information-geometric method to unbiasedly estimate pure short-term noise correlations irrespective of the background brain activities without demanding computational resources. First, the benchmark simulations demonstrated that the proposed estimator is more accurate and computationally e cient than the conventional correlograms and the residual correlations with Kalman filters or moving averages of length three or more, while the best moving average of length two coincided with the propose method regarding correlation estimates. Next, we analyzed the cat V1 neural responses to demonstrate that the statistical test accompanying the proposed method combined with the existing nonstationarity test enabled us to dissociate short- and long-term noise correlations. When we excluded the spurious noise correlations of purely long-term nature, only small fraction of neuron pairs showed significant short-term correlations, possibly reconciling the previous inconsistent observations on existence of significant noise correlations. The decoding accuracy was slightly improved by the short-term correlations. Although the long-term correlations deteriorated the generalizability, the generalizability was recovered by the decoder with trend removal, suggesting that brains could overcome nonstationarity. Thus the proposed method enables us to elucidate the impacts of short- and long-term noise correlations in a dissociated manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The proposed measure for spike-count noise correlations, based on the local temporal detrending, enables us to decompose the correlated responses into long- and short-timescale components. The proposed method is essential to elucidate the population codes in the era of large-scale electrophysiology as it works for large number of simultaneously recorded neurons while existing methods do not. With the additional help of the machine learning that classifies stimuli from neural activities, we demonstrate proper ways to assess the impacts on decoding of the presence of short- or long-term noise correlations, separately. The well-designed decoding analysis with dissociated correlated activities will help to gain insight into the brain’s decoding strategies under changing environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Aerobic glycolysis is required for spatial memory acquisition but not memory retrieval in mice</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;The consolidation of newly formed memories and their retrieval are energetically demanding processes. Aerobic glycolysis (AG), also known as the Warburg effect, consists of the production of lactate from glucose in the presence of oxygen. The astrocyte neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis posits that astrocytes process glucose by AG to generate lactate, which is used as a fuel source within neurons to maintain synaptic activity. Studies in mice have demonstrated that lactate transport between astrocytes and neurons is required for long-term memory formation, yet the role of lactate production in memory acquisition and retrieval has not previously been explored. Here, we examined the effect of dichloroacetic acid (DCA), a chemical inhibitor of lactate production, on spatial learning and memory in mice using the Morris Water Maze (MWM). &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; hyperpolarized &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed decreased conversion of pyruvate to lactate in the mouse brain following DCA administration, concomitant with a reduction in phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). DCA exposure before each training session in the MWM impaired learning, which subsequently resulted in impaired memory during the probe trial. In contrast, mice that underwent training without DCA exposure, but received a single DCA injection before the probe trial exhibited normal memory. Our findings indicate that AG plays a key role during memory acquisition but is less important for retrieval of established memories. Thus, activation of AG may be important for learning-dependent synaptic plasticity rather than the activation of signaling cascades required for memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE&lt;/b&gt; Neuronal activation is an energetically demanding process. The brain is mainly fueled by glucose, yet a substantial portion of this metabolite is converted to lactate despite the presence of adequate oxygen, a phenomenon known as aerobic glycolysis (AG). The transport of lactate between astrocytes and neurons is key for learning and memory, yet the role of lactate production in these processes is poorly understood. Here we report that administration of dichloroacetate (DCA), a chemical inhibitor of AG, attenuates conversion of pyruvate to lactate in the brains of mice. DCA exposure impaired spatial learning but had no effect on the retrieval of an established memory. These observations suggest that lactate production may be required for memory acquisition but not retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Disorders of consciousness (DOC) are a common consequence of severe brain injuries, and clinical evaluation is critical to provide a correct diagnosis and prognosis. The revised Motor Behavior Tool (MBT‐r) is a clinical complementary tool aiming to identify subtle motor behaviors that might reflect residual cognition in DOC. In this prospective study including 30 DOC patients in the early stage after brain injury, we show that the revised MBT‐r has an excellent inter‐rater agreement and has the ability to identify a subgroup of patients, underestimated by the Coma Recovery Scale‐Revised, showing residual cognition and a subsequent recovery of consciousness.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Development of the clinical assessment scale in autoimmune encephalitis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25421?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25421?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no scale for rating the severity of autoimmune encephalitis (AE). In this study, we aimed to develop a novel scale for rating severity in patients with diverse AE syndromes and to verify the reliability and validity of the developed scale.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key items were generated by a panel of experts and selected according to content validity ratios. The developed scale was initially applied to 50 patients with AE (development cohort) to evaluate its acceptability, reproducibility, internal consistency, and construct validity. Then, the scale was applied to another independent cohort (validation cohort, n = 38).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new scale consisting of 9 items (seizure, memory dysfunction, psychiatric symptoms, consciousness, language problems, dyskinesia/dystonia, gait instability and ataxia, brainstem dysfunction, and weakness) was developed. Each item was assigned a value of up to 3 points. The total score could therefore range from 0 to 27. We named the scale the Clinical Assessment Scale in Autoimmune Encephalitis (CASE). The new scale showed excellent interobserver (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.97) and intraobserver (ICC = 0.96) reliability for total scores, was highly correlated with modified Rankin scale (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.86, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and had acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.88). Additionally, in the validation cohort, the scale showed high interobserver reliability (ICC = 0.99) and internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.92).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CASE is a novel clinical scale for AE with a high level of clinimetric properties. It would be suitable for application in clinical practice and might help overcome the limitations of current outcome scales for AE. Ann Neurol 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In fact, mutations in genes encoding synaptic proteins are enriched and overlap among different conditions highlighting the complex and pleiotropic nature of these disorders. In this review, we discuss recently described candidate genes that affect excitatory synapse function and result in changes in spine number and morphology. Spine pathology has been observed in several animal models of disease and in human brain post-mortem samples from ID, ASD, and schizophrenia patients. Recent data point to convergent mechanisms, such as dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton and dysfunction of microglia synaptic remodeling, underlying dendritic spine dysgenesis. Interestingly, the reversion of important pathologic features, including spine abnormalities, has been observed in adult animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting that therapies may not be restricted to a specific developmental window. Shedding light on the specific mechanisms impacted in neuropsychiatric disorders will undeniably contribute to the development of more directed and personalized therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

In neurons and circuits, these molecules serve especially critical functions that ensure neural activity is maintained within appropriate physiological parameters. Their targets include synaptic proteins, ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, and components of essential signaling cascades. Here, we discuss how several species of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) regulate intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission, both during development and in mature circuits. Furthermore, we present the relationships between aberrant ncRNA expression and psychiatric disorders. The research presented here demonstrates how ncRNAs can be useful tools for elucidating fundamental neurobiology mechanisms and identifying the key molecular players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Skin Nerve Pathology: Biomarkers of Premanifest and Manifest Amyloid Neuropathy</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small‐fiber sensory and autonomic symptoms are early presentations of familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) with transthyretin (TTR) mutations. This study aimed to explore the potential of skin nerve pathologies as early and disease‐progression biomarkers and their relationship with skin amyloid deposits.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skin biopsies were performed in patients and carriers to measure intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) density, sweat gland innervation index of structural protein gene product 9.5 [SGII(PGP9.5)] and peptidergic vasoactive intestinal peptide [SGII(VIP)], and cutaneous amyloid index. These skin pathologies were analyzed with clinical disability assessed by FAP stage score (stage 0~4) and compared to neurophysiological and psychophysical tests.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 70 TTR‐mutant subjects (22 carriers and 48 patients) and 66 cases were TTR‐A97S. Skin nerve pathologies were distinct according to stage. In carriers, both skin denervation and peptidergic sudomotor denervation were evident: (1) IENF density was gradually reduced from stage 0 through 4, and (2) SGII(VIP) was markedly reduced from stage 1 to 2. In contrast, SGII(PGP9.5) was similar between carriers and controls, but it declined in patients from stage 2. Skin amyloids were absent in carriers and became detectable from stage 1. Cutaneous amyloid index was correlated with SGII(PGP9.5) and stage in a multivariable mixed‐effect model. When all tests were compared, only IENF density, SGII(PGP9.5), and cutaneous amyloid index were correlated with stage, and IENF density had the highest abnormal rate in carriers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomarkers of sensory and sudomotor innervation exhibited a stage‐dependent progression pattern, with sensory nerve degeneration as the early skin nerve pathology.&lt;/p&gt;

Microtubules in signal-receiving dendrites and signal-sending axons differ in their organization and microtubule-associated proteins. These differences, coupled with microtubule post-translational modifications, combine to locally regulate intracellular transport, morphology, and function. Recent discoveries provide new insight into the regulation of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays in neurons, the relationship between microtubule acetylation and mechanosensation, and the spatial patterning of microtubules that regulates motor activity and cargo delivery in axons and dendrites. Together, these new studies bring us closer to understanding how microtubule function is locally tuned to match the specialized tasks associated with signal reception and transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Neural Dynamics of Familiar Face Recognition</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz010</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz010/5308440?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In real-life situations, the appearance of a person’s face can vary substantially across different encounters, making face recognition a challenging task for the visual system. Recent fMRI decoding studies have suggested that face recognition is supported by identity representations located in regions of the occipitotemporal cortex. Here, we used EEG to elucidate the temporal emergence of these representations. Human participants viewed a set of highly variable face images of 4 highly familiar celebrities (2 males and 2 females), while performing an orthogonal task. Univariate analyses of event-related EEG responses revealed a pronounced differentiation between male and female faces, but not between identities of the same sex. Using multivariate representational similarity analysis, we observed a gradual emergence of face identity representations, with an increasing degree of invariance. Face identity information emerged rapidly, starting shortly after 100 ms from stimulus onset, but was modulated by sex differences and image similarities. From 400 ms after onset and predominantly in the right hemisphere, identity representations showed 2 invariance properties: 1) they equally discriminated identities of opposite sexes and of the same sex, and 2) they were tolerant to image-based variations. These invariant representations may be a crucial prerequisite for successful face recognition in everyday situations, where the appearance of a familiar person can vary drastically.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as avolition, apathy, and anhedonia, precede the onset of debilitating motor symptoms in Huntington’s disease (HD), and their development may give insight into early disease progression and treatment. However, the neuronal and circuit mechanisms of premanifest HD pathophysiology are not well-understood. Here, using a transgenic rat model expressing the full-length human mutant HD gene, we find early and profound deficits in reward motivation in the absence of gross motor abnormalities. These deficits are accompanied by significant and progressive dysfunction in corticostriatal processing and communication among brain areas critical for reward-driven behavior. Together, our results define early corticostriatal dysfunction as a possible pathogenic contributor to psychiatric disturbances and may help identify potential pharmacotherapeutic targets for the treatment of HD.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Remnant cholesterol and risk of ischemic stroke in 112,512 individuals from the general population</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25432?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25432?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High remnant cholesterol concentrations are associated with high risk of ischemic heart disease, but whether this is also the case for ischemic stroke is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that high remnant cholesterol concentrations are associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;102,964 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study with information on remnant cholesterol at baseline in 2003‐15 were included in a prospective observational association study. Individuals were followed for up to 14 years, during which time 2,488 were diagnosed with an ischemic stroke. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression models. Results were independently confirmed in 9,548 individuals enrolled in the Copenhagen City Heart Study in 1991‐94; 983 ischemic strokes developed during up to 26 years of follow‐up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepwise higher remnant cholesterol concentrations were associated with stepwise higher ischemic stroke risk in the Copenhagen General Population Study, with multivariable adjusted hazard ratios up to 1.99(95%confidence interval: 1.49‐2.67) for individuals with remnant cholesterol concentrations ≥1.5mmol/L(58mg/dL), compared to individuals with remnant cholesterol &amp;lt;0.5mmol/L(19mg/dL). Results were similar in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. Cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke at age 80 in the Copenhagen General Population Study ranged from 7.3% for individuals with remnant cholesterol &amp;lt;0.5mmol/L(19mg/dL) to 11.5% for individuals with remnant cholesterol ≥1.5mmol/L(58mg/dL).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals with high remnant cholesterol concentrations had higher risk of ischemic stroke. These results indicate that randomized clinical trials with remnant cholesterol lowering in individuals with high concentrations, with the aim of preventing ischemic strokes, are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Shared polygenic risk and causal inferences in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify shared polygenic risk and causal associations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linkage disequilibrium score regression and Mendelian randomization were applied in a large‐scale, data‐driven manner to explore genetic correlations and causal relationships between &amp;gt; 700 phenotypic traits and ALS. Exposures consisted of publicly available genome‐wide association studies (GWASes) summary statistics from &lt;i&gt;MR Base&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;LD‐hub&lt;/i&gt;. The outcome data came from the recently published ALS GWAS involving 20,806 cases and 59,804 controls. Multivariate analyses, genetic risk profiling and Bayesian colocalization analyses were also performed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have shown via linkage disequilibrium score regression that ALS shares polygenic risk genetic factors with a number of traits and conditions, including positive correlations with smoking status and moderate levels of physical activity, and negative correlations with higher cognitive performance, higher educational attainment, and light levels of physical activity. Using Mendelian randomization, we found evidence that hyperlipidemia is a causal risk factor for ALS and localized putative functional signals within loci of interest.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have developed a public resource (&lt;a href=&quot;https://lng-nia.shinyapps.io/mrshiny&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;https://lng‐nia.shinyapps.io/mrshiny&lt;/a&gt;) which we hope will become a valuable tool for the ALS community, and that will be expanded and updated as new data become available. Shared polygenic risk exists between ALS and educational attainment, physical activity, smoking and tenseness/restlessness. We also found evidence that elevated LDL cholesterol is a causal risk factor for ALS. Future randomized controlled trials should be considered as a proof of causality.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Cholinergic system changes of falls and freezing of gait in Parkinson disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25430?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25430?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postural instability and gait difficulties (PIGD) represent debilitating disturbances in Parkinson's disease (PD). Prior acetylcholinesterase PET imaging studies implicate cholinergic changes as significant contributors to PIGD features. These studies were limited in quantification of striatal cholinergic synapse integrity. Vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) PET ligands are better suited for evaluation of high binding areas. We examined associations between regional VAChT expression and freezing of gait (FoG) and falls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ninety‐four PD subjects underwent clinical assessment and VAChT ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FEOBV) PET.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐five subjects (37.2%) reported a history of falls and 15 (16%) had observed FoG. Univariate volume‐of‐interest analyses demonstrated significantly reduced thalamic (P=0.0016) VAChT expression in fallers compared to non‐fallers. VAChT expression was significantly reduced in the striatum (P=0.0012) and limbic archicortex (P=0.004) in freezers compared to non‐freezers. Whole brain voxel‐based analyses of FEOBV PET complemented these findings and showed more granular changes associated with falling history including the right visual thalamus (especially the right lateral geniculate nucleus, LGN), right caudate nucleus, and bilateral prefrontal regions. Freezers had prominent VAChT expression reductions in the bilateral striatum, temporal and mesiofrontal limbic regions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings confirm and extend on previous PET findings of thalamic cholinergic deficits associated with falling history and now emphasize right visual thalamus complex changes, including the right LGN. FoG status is associated with reduced VAChT expression in striatal cholinergic interneurons and the limbic archicortex. These observations suggest different cholinergic systems changes underlying falls and FOG in PD.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Environmental enrichment, new neurons and the neurobiology of individuality&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental enrichment, new neurons and the neurobiology of individuality, Published online: 05 February 2019; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-019-0120-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41583-019-0120-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Environmental enrichment is a classical experimental paradigm for the study of the interaction between genes and the environment. In this Opinion, Kempermann discusses how this paradigm can be further developed in order to capture the essence of interindividual differences in brain function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrn/rss/current/~4/74oh2SXVOzk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>
