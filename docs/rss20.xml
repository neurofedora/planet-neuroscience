	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Continual One-Shot Learning of Hidden Spike-Patterns with Neural Network Simulation Expansion and STDP Convergence Predictions. (arXiv:1708.09072v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09072</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09072</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a constructive algorithm that achieves successful
one-shot learning of hidden spike-patterns in a competitive detection task. It
has previously been shown (Masquelier et al., 2008) that spike-timing-dependent
plasticity (STDP) and lateral inhibition can result in neurons competitively
tuned to repeating spike-patterns concealed in high rates of overall
presynaptic activity. One-shot construction of neurons with synapse weights
calculated as estimates of converged STDP outcomes results in immediate
selective detection of hidden spike-patterns. The capability of continual
learning is demonstrated through the successful one-shot detection of new sets
of spike-patterns introduced after long intervals in the simulation time.
Simulation expansion (Lightheart et al., 2013) has been proposed as an approach
to the development of constructive algorithms that are compatible with
simulations of biological neural networks. A simulation of a biological neural
network may have orders of magnitude fewer neurons and connections than the
related biological neural systems; therefore, simulated neural networks can be
assumed to be a subset of a larger neural system. The constructive algorithm is
developed using simulation expansion concepts to perform an operation
equivalent to the exchange of neurons between the simulation and the larger
hypothetical neural system. The dynamic selection of neurons to simulate within
a larger neural system (hypothetical or stored in memory) may be a starting
point for a wide range of developments and applications in machine learning and
the simulation of biology.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Balance of excitation and inhibition determines 1/f power spectrum in neuronal networks. (arXiv:1708.09042v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09042</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09042</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The $1/f$-like decay observed in the power spectrum of electro-physiological
signals, along with scale-free statistics of the so-called neuronal avalanches,
constitute evidences of criticality in neuronal systems. Recent in vitro
studies have shown that avalanche dynamics at criticality corresponds to some
specific balance of excitation and inhibition, thus suggesting that this is a
basic feature of the critical state of neuronal networks. In particular, a lack
of inhibition significantly alters the temporal structure of the spontaneous
avalanche activity and leads to an anomalous abundance of large avalanches.
Here we study the relationship between network inhibition and the scaling
exponent $\beta$ of the power spectral density (PSD) of avalanche activity in a
neuronal network model inspired in Self-Organized Criticality (SOC). We find
that this scaling exponent depends on the percentage of inhibitory synapses and
tends to the value $\beta = 1$ for a percentage of about 30%. More
specifically, $\beta$ is close to $2$, namely brownian noise, for purely
excitatory networks and decreases towards values in the interval $[1,1.4]$ as
the percentage of inhibitory synapses ranges between 20 and 30%, in agreement
with experimental findings. These results indicate that the level of inhibition
affects the frequency spectrum of resting brain activity and suggest the
analysis of the PSD scaling behavior as a possible tool to study pathological
conditions.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neurexin and Neuroligin-based adhesion complexes drive axonal arborisation growth independent of synaptic activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/182808v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Building arborisations of the right size and shape is fundamental for neural network function. Live imaging studies in vertebrate brains strongly suggest that nascent synapses are critical for branch growth during the development of axonal and dendritic arborisations. The molecular mechanisms underlying such synaptotropic events are largely unknown. Here we present a novel system in Drosophila for studying the development of complex axonal arborisations live, in vivo during metamorphosis. In these growing axonal arborisations we see a relationship between the punctate localisations of presynaptic components and branch dynamics that is very similar to synaptotropic growth described in fish and frogs. These presynaptic components however do not appear to represent functional presynaptic release sites and are not paired with clusters of neurotransmitter receptors. Pharmacological and genetic knockdowns of evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission do not impact the outgrowth of these neurons. Instead, we find that axonal branch growth is regulated by the dynamic focal localisations of synaptic adhesion proteins Neurexin and Neuroligin. These adhesion complexes provide selective stability for filopodia by a stick-and-grow-based mechanism wholly independent of synaptic activity.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Proper neural circuit formation requires the precise regulation of neuronal migration, axon guidance, and dendritic arborization. Mutations affecting the function of the transmembrane glycoprotein dystroglycan cause a form of congenital muscular dystrophy that is frequently associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Despite its importance in brain development, the role of dystroglycan in regulating retinal development remains poorly understood. Using a mouse model of dystroglycanopathy (&lt;i&gt;ISPD&lt;sup&gt;L79*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) and conditional &lt;i&gt;dystroglycan&lt;/i&gt; mutants of both sexes, we show that dystroglycan is critical for the proper migration, axon guidance, and dendritic stratification of neurons in the inner retina. Using genetic approaches, we show that dystroglycan functions in neuroepithelial cells as an extracellular scaffold to maintain the integrity of the retinal inner limiting membrane. Surprisingly, despite the profound disruptions in inner retinal circuit formation, spontaneous retinal activity is preserved. These results highlight the importance of dystroglycan in coordinating multiple aspects of retinal development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The extracellular environment plays a critical role in coordinating neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth during neural circuit development. The transmembrane glycoprotein dystroglycan functions as a receptor for multiple extracellular matrix proteins and its dysfunction leads to a form of muscular dystrophy frequently associated with neurodevelopmental defects. Our results demonstrate that dystroglycan is required for maintaining the structural integrity of the inner limiting membrane (ILM) in the developing retina. In the absence of functional dystroglycan, ILM degeneration leads to defective migration, axon guidance, and mosaic spacing of neurons and a loss of multiple neuron types during retinal development. These results demonstrate that disorganization of retinal circuit development is a likely contributor to visual dysfunction in patients with dystroglycanopathy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Frontoparietal Structural Connectivity in Childhood Predicts Development of Functional Connectivity and Reasoning Ability: A Large-Scale Longitudinal Investigation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8549?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8549?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prior research points to a positive concurrent relationship between reasoning ability and both frontoparietal structural connectivity (SC) as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (Tamnes et al., 2010) and frontoparietal functional connectivity (FC) as measured by fMRI (Cocchi et al., 2014). Further, recent research demonstrates a link between reasoning ability and FC of two brain regions in particular: rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) and the inferior parietal lobe (IPL) (Wendelken et al., 2016). Here, we sought to investigate the concurrent and dynamic, lead–lag relationships among frontoparietal SC, FC, and reasoning ability in humans. To this end, we combined three longitudinal developmental datasets with behavioral and neuroimaging data from 523 male and female participants between 6 and 22 years of age. Cross-sectionally, reasoning ability was most strongly related to FC between RLPFC and IPL in adolescents and adults, but to frontoparietal SC in children. Longitudinal analysis revealed that RLPFC–IPL SC, but not FC, was a positive predictor of future changes in reasoning ability. Moreover, we found that RLPFC–IPL SC at one time point positively predicted future changes in RLPFC–IPL FC, whereas, in contrast, FC did not predict future changes in SC. Our results demonstrate the importance of strong white matter connectivity between RLPFC and IPL during middle childhood for the subsequent development of both robust FC and good reasoning ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The human capacity for reasoning develops substantially during childhood and has a profound impact on achievement in school and in cognitively challenging careers. Reasoning ability depends on communication between lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices. Therefore, to understand how this capacity develops, we examined the dynamic relationships over time among white matter tracts connecting frontoparietal cortices (i.e., structural connectivity, SC), coordinated frontoparietal activation (functional connectivity, FC), and reasoning ability in a large longitudinal sample of subjects 6–22 years of age. We found that greater frontoparietal SC in childhood predicts future increases in both FC and reasoning ability, demonstrating the importance of white matter development during childhood for subsequent brain and cognitive functioning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Selective Phosphorylation of AMPA Receptor Contributes to the Network of Long-Term Potentiation in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8534?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Phosphorylation of AMPA receptor GluA1 plays important roles in synaptic potentiation. Most previous studies have been performed in the hippocampus, while the roles of GluA1 phosphorylation in the cortex remain unknown. Here we investigated the involvement of the phosphorylation of GluA1 in the LTP in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) using mice with a GluA1 knock-in mutation at the PKA phosphorylation site serine 845 (s845A) or CaMKII/PKC phosphorylation site serine 831 (s831A). The network LTP, which is constructed by multiple recordings of LTP at different locations within the ACC, was also investigated. We found that the expression of LTP and network LTP was significantly impaired in the s845A mice, but not in the s831A mice. By contrast, basal synaptic transmission and NMDA receptor-mediated responses were not affected. Furthermore, to uncover potential information under the current acquired data, a new method for reconstruction and better visualization of the signals was developed to observe the spatial localizations and dynamic temporal changes of fEPSP signals and multiple LTP responses within the ACC circuit. Our results provide strong evidence that PKA phosphorylation of the GluA1 is important for the network LTP expression in the ACC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Previous studies have shown that PKA and PKC phosphorylation of AMPA receptor GluA1 plays critical roles in LTP in the hippocampus, while the roles of GluA1 phosphorylation in the cortex remain unknown. In the present study, by combining a 64-channel multielectrode system and a novel analysis and visualization method, we observed the accurate spatial localization and dynamic temporal changes of network fEPSP signals and LTP responses within the ACC circuit and found that PKA phosphorylation, but not PKC phosphorylation, of the GluA1 is required for LTP in the ACC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Drosophila Nociceptive Sensitization Requires BMP Signaling via the Canonical SMAD Pathway</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8524?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8524?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nociceptive sensitization is a common feature in chronic pain, but its basic cellular mechanisms are only partially understood. The present study used the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; model system and a candidate gene approach to identify novel components required for modulation of an injury-induced nociceptive sensitization pathway presumably downstream of Hedgehog. This study demonstrates that RNAi silencing of a member of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway, Decapentaplegic (Dpp), specifically in the Class IV multidendritic nociceptive neuron, significantly attenuated ultraviolet injury-induced sensitization. Furthermore, overexpression of Dpp in Class IV neurons was sufficient to induce thermal hypersensitivity in the absence of injury. The requirement of various BMP receptors and members of the SMAD signal transduction pathway in nociceptive sensitization was also demonstrated. The effects of BMP signaling were shown to be largely specific to the sensitization pathway and not associated with changes in nociception in the absence of injury or with changes in dendritic morphology. Thus, the results demonstrate that Dpp and its pathway play a crucial and novel role in nociceptive sensitization. Because the BMP family is so strongly conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates, it seems likely that the components analyzed in this study represent potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of chronic pain in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This report provides a genetic analysis of primary nociceptive neuron mechanisms that promote sensitization in response to injury. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; larvae whose primary nociceptive neurons were reduced in levels of specific components of the BMP signaling pathway, were injured and then tested for nocifensive responses to a normally subnoxious stimulus. Results suggest that nociceptive neurons use the BMP2/4 ligand, along with identified receptors and intracellular transducers to transition to a sensitized state. These findings are consistent with the observation that BMP receptor hyperactivation correlates with bone abnormalities and pain sensitization in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (Kitterman et al., 2012). Because nociceptive sensitization is associated with chronic pain, these findings indicate that human BMP pathway components may represent targets for novel pain-relieving drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Feedback Inhibition Shapes Emergent Computational Properties of Cortical Microcircuit Motifs</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8511?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical microcircuits are very complex networks, but they are composed of a relatively small number of stereotypical motifs. Hence, one strategy for throwing light on the computational function of cortical microcircuits is to analyze emergent computational properties of these stereotypical microcircuit motifs. We are addressing here the question how spike timing-dependent plasticity shapes the computational properties of one motif that has frequently been studied experimentally: interconnected populations of pyramidal cells and parvalbumin-positive inhibitory cells in layer 2/3. Experimental studies suggest that these inhibitory neurons exert some form of divisive inhibition on the pyramidal cells. We show that this data-based form of feedback inhibition, which is softer than that of winner-take-all models that are commonly considered in theoretical analyses, contributes to the emergence of an important computational function through spike timing-dependent plasticity: The capability to disentangle superimposed firing patterns in upstream networks, and to represent their information content through a sparse assembly code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We analyze emergent computational properties of a ubiquitous cortical microcircuit motif: populations of pyramidal cells that are densely interconnected with inhibitory neurons. Simulations of this model predict that sparse assembly codes emerge in this microcircuit motif under spike timing-dependent plasticity. Furthermore, we show that different assemblies will represent different hidden sources of upstream firing activity. Hence, we propose that spike timing-dependent plasticity enables this microcircuit motif to perform a fundamental computational operation on neural activity patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: On the Structure of Cortical Microcircuits Inferred from Small Sample Sizes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8498?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The structure in cortical microcircuits deviates from what would be expected in a purely random network, which has been seen as evidence of clustering. To address this issue, we sought to reproduce the nonrandom features of cortical circuits by considering several distinct classes of network topology, including clustered networks, networks with distance-dependent connectivity, and those with broad degree distributions. To our surprise, we found that all of these qualitatively distinct topologies could account equally well for all reported nonrandom features despite being easily distinguishable from one another at the network level. This apparent paradox was a consequence of estimating network properties given only small sample sizes. In other words, networks that differ markedly in their global structure can look quite similar locally. This makes inferring network structure from small sample sizes, a necessity given the technical difficulty inherent in simultaneous intracellular recordings, problematic. We found that a network statistic called the sample degree correlation (SDC) overcomes this difficulty. The SDC depends only on parameters that can be estimated reliably given small sample sizes and is an accurate fingerprint of every topological family. We applied the SDC criterion to data from rat visual and somatosensory cortex and discovered that the connectivity was not consistent with any of these main topological classes. However, we were able to fit the experimental data with a more general network class, of which all previous topologies were special cases. The resulting network topology could be interpreted as a combination of physical spatial dependence and nonspatial, hierarchical clustering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The connectivity of cortical microcircuits exhibits features that are inconsistent with a simple random network. Here, we show that several classes of network models can account for this nonrandom structure despite qualitative differences in their global properties. This apparent paradox is a consequence of the small numbers of simultaneously recorded neurons in experiment: when inferred via small sample sizes, many networks may be indistinguishable despite being globally distinct. We develop a connectivity measure that successfully classifies networks even when estimated locally with a few neurons at a time. We show that data from rat cortex is consistent with a network in which the likelihood of a connection between neurons depends on spatial distance and on nonspatial, asymmetric clustering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Visual Perceptual Echo Reflects Learning of Regularities in Rapid Luminance Sequences</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8486?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8486?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A novel neural signature of active visual processing has recently been described in the form of the &quot;perceptual echo&quot;, in which the cross-correlation between a sequence of randomly fluctuating luminance values and occipital electrophysiological signals exhibits a long-lasting periodic (~100 ms cycle) reverberation of the input stimulus (VanRullen and Macdonald, 2012). As yet, however, the mechanisms underlying the perceptual echo and its function remain unknown. Reasoning that natural visual signals often contain temporally predictable, though nonperiodic features, we hypothesized that the perceptual echo may reflect a periodic process associated with regularity learning. To test this hypothesis, we presented subjects with successive repetitions of a rapid nonperiodic luminance sequence, and examined the effects on the perceptual echo, finding that echo amplitude linearly increased with the number of presentations of a given luminance sequence. These data suggest that the perceptual echo reflects a neural signature of regularity learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when a set of repeated sequences was followed by a sequence with inverted luminance polarities, the echo amplitude decreased to the same level evoked by a novel stimulus sequence. Crucially, when the original stimulus sequence was re-presented, the echo amplitude returned to a level consistent with the number of presentations of this sequence, indicating that the visual system retained sequence-specific information, for many seconds, even in the presence of intervening visual input. Altogether, our results reveal a previously undiscovered regularity learning mechanism within the human visual system, reflected by the perceptual echo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; How the brain encodes and learns fast-changing but nonperiodic visual input remains unknown, even though such visual input characterizes natural scenes. We investigated whether the phenomenon of &quot;perceptual echo&quot; might index such learning. The perceptual echo is a long-lasting reverberation between a rapidly changing visual input and evoked neural activity, apparent in cross-correlations between occipital EEG and stimulus sequences, peaking in the alpha (~10 Hz) range. We indeed found that perceptual echo is enhanced by repeatedly presenting the same visual sequence, indicating that the human visual system can rapidly and automatically learn regularities embedded within fast-changing dynamic sequences. These results point to a previously undiscovered regularity learning mechanism, operating at a rate defined by the alpha frequency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: N1-Src Kinase Is Required for Primary Neurogenesis in Xenopus tropicalis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8477?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The presence of the neuronal-specific N1-Src splice variant of the C-Src tyrosine kinase is conserved through vertebrate evolution, suggesting an important role in complex nervous systems. Alternative splicing involving an &lt;i&gt;N1-Src&lt;/i&gt;-specific microexon leads to a 5 or 6 aa insertion into the SH3 domain of Src. A prevailing model suggests that N1-Src regulates neuronal differentiation via cytoskeletal dynamics in the growth cone. Here we investigated the role of n1-src in the early development of the amphibian &lt;i&gt;Xenopus tropicalis&lt;/i&gt;, and found that &lt;i&gt;n1-src&lt;/i&gt; expression is regulated in embryogenesis, with highest levels detected during the phases of primary and secondary neurogenesis. &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization analysis, using locked nucleic acid oligo probes complementary to the &lt;i&gt;n1-src&lt;/i&gt; microexon, indicates that &lt;i&gt;n1-src&lt;/i&gt; expression is highly enriched in the open neural plate during neurula stages and in the neural tissue of adult frogs. Given the &lt;i&gt;n1-src&lt;/i&gt; expression pattern, we investigated a possible role for n1-src in neurogenesis. Using splice site-specific antisense morpholino oligos, we inhibited &lt;i&gt;n1-src&lt;/i&gt; splicing, while preserving &lt;i&gt;c-src&lt;/i&gt; expression. Differentiation of neurons in the primary nervous system is reduced in &lt;i&gt;n1-src&lt;/i&gt;-knockdown embryos, accompanied by a severely impaired touch response in later development. These data reveal an essential role for n1-src in amphibian neural development and suggest that alternative splicing of C-Src in the developing vertebrate nervous system evolved to regulate neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases acts in signaling pathways that regulate cell migration, cell adhesion, and proliferation. Srcs are also enriched in the brain, where they play key roles in neuronal development and neurotransmission. Vertebrates have evolved a neuron-specific splice variant of C-Src, N1-Src, which differs from C-Src by just 5 or 6 aa. N1-Src is poorly understood and its high similarity to C-Src has made it difficult to delineate its function. Using antisense knockdown of the &lt;i&gt;n1-src&lt;/i&gt; microexon, we have studied neuronal development in the &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; embryo in the absence of &lt;i&gt;n1-src&lt;/i&gt;, while preserving &lt;i&gt;c-src&lt;/i&gt;. Loss of n1-src causes a striking absence of primary neurogenesis, implicating n1-src in the specification of neurons early in neural development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Membrane-Associated Effects of Glucocorticoid on BACE1 Upregulation and A{beta} Generation: Involvement of Lipid Raft-Mediated CREB Activation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8459?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glucocorticoid has been widely accepted to induce Alzheimer's disease, but the nongenomic effect of glucocorticoid on amyloid β (Aβ) generation has yet to be studied. Here, we investigated the effect of the nongenomic pathway induced by glucocorticoid on amyloid precursor protein processing enzymes as well as Aβ production using male ICR mice and human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells. Mice groups exposed to restraint stress or intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ showed impaired cognition, decreased intracellular glucocorticoid receptor (GR) level, but elevated level of membrane GR (mGR). In this respect, we identified the mGR-dependent pathway evoked by glucocorticoid using impermeable cortisol conjugated to BSA (cortisol-BSA) on SK-N-MC cells. Cortisol-BSA augmented the expression of β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the level of C-terminal fragment β of amyloid precursor protein (C99) and Aβ production, which were maintained even after blocking intracellular GR. We also found that cortisol-BSA enhanced the interaction between mGR and Gαs, which colocalized in the lipid raft. The subsequently activated CREB by cortisol-BSA bound to the CRE site of the BACE1 promoter increasing its expression, which was downregulated by inhibiting CBP. Consistently, blocking CBP attenuated cognitive impairment and Aβ production induced by corticosterone treatment or intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ more efficiently than inhibiting intracellular GR in mice. In conclusion, glucocorticoid couples mGR with Gαs and triggers cAMP-PKA-CREB axis dependent on the lipid raft to stimulate BACE1 upregulation and Aβ generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been growing sharply and stress is considered as the major environment factor of AD. Glucocorticoid is the primarily responsive factor to stress and is widely known to induce AD. However, most AD patients usually have impaired genomic pathway of glucocorticoid due to intracellular glucocorticoid receptor deficiency. In this respect, the genomic mechanism of glucocorticoid faces difficulties in explaining the consistent amyloid β (Aβ) production. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the novel pathway of glucocorticoid on Aβ generation to find a more selective therapeutic approach to AD patients. In this study, we revealed the importance of nongenomic pathway induced by glucocorticoid where membrane glucocorticoid receptor plays an important role in Aβ formation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Genome Stability by DNA Polymerase {beta} in Neural Progenitors Contributes to Neuronal Differentiation in Cortical Development</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;DNA repair is crucial for genome stability in the developing cortex, as somatic &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; mutations cause neurological disorders. However, how DNA repair contributes to neuronal development is largely unknown. To address this issue, we studied the spatiotemporal roles of DNA polymerase β (Polβ), a key enzyme in DNA base excision repair pathway, in the developing cortex using distinct forebrain-specific conditional knock-out mice, &lt;i&gt;Emx1-Cre/Pol&lt;/i&gt;β&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Nex-Cre/Pol&lt;/i&gt;β&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Polβ expression was absent in both neural progenitors and postmitotic neurons in &lt;i&gt;Emx1-Cre/Pol&lt;/i&gt;β&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, whereas only postmitotic neurons lacked Polβ expression in &lt;i&gt;Nex-Cre/Pol&lt;/i&gt;β&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. We found that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were frequently detected during replication in cortical progenitors of &lt;i&gt;Emx1-Cre/Pol&lt;/i&gt;β&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Increased DSBs remained in postmitotic cells, which resulted in p53-mediated neuronal apoptosis. This neuronal apoptosis caused thinning of the cortical plate, although laminar structure was normal. In addition, accumulated DSBs also affected growth of corticofugal axons but not commissural axons. These phenotypes were not observed in &lt;i&gt;Nex-Cre/Pol&lt;/i&gt;β&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Moreover, cultured Polβ-deficient neural progenitors exhibited higher sensitivity to the base-damaging agent methylmethanesulfonate, resulting in enhanced DSB formation. Similar damage was found by vitamin C treatment, which induces TET1-mediated DNA demethylation via 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. Together, genome stability mediated by Polβ-dependent base excision repair is crucial for the competence of neural progenitors, thereby contributing to neuronal differentiation in cortical development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; DNA repair is crucial for development of the nervous system. However, how DNA polymerase β (Polβ)-dependent DNA base excision repair pathway contributes to the process is still unknown. We found that loss of Polβ in cortical progenitors rather than postmitotic neurons led to catastrophic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during replication and p53-mediated neuronal apoptosis, which resulted in thinning of the cortical plate. The DSBs also affected corticofugal axon growth in surviving neurons. Moreover, induction of base damage and DNA demethylation intermediates in the genome increased DSBs in cultured Polβ-deficient neural progenitors. Thus, genome stability by Polβ-dependent base excision repair in neural progenitors is required for the viability and differentiation of daughter neurons in the developing nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Segregation of Visual Response Properties in the Mouse Superior Colliculus and Their Modulation during Locomotion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The superior colliculus (SC) receives direct input from the retina and integrates it with information about sound, touch, and state of the animal that is relayed from other parts of the brain to initiate specific behavioral outcomes. The superficial SC layers (sSC) contain cells that respond to visual stimuli, whereas the deep SC layers (dSC) contain cells that also respond to auditory and somatosensory stimuli. Here, we used a large-scale silicon probe recording system to examine the visual response properties of SC cells of head-fixed and alert male mice. We found cells with diverse response properties including: (1) orientation/direction-selective (OS/DS) cells with a firing rate that is suppressed by drifting sinusoidal gratings (negative OS/DS cells); (2) suppressed-by-contrast cells; (3) cells with complex-like spatial summation nonlinearity; and (4) cells with Y-like spatial summation nonlinearity. We also found specific response properties that are enriched in different depths of the SC. The sSC is enriched with cells with small RFs, high evoked firing rates (FRs), and sustained temporal responses, whereas the dSC is enriched with the negative OS/DS cells and with cells with large RFs, low evoked FRs, and transient temporal responses. Locomotion modulates the activity of the SC cells both additively and multiplicatively and changes the preferred spatial frequency of some SC cells. These results provide the first description of the negative OS/DS cells and demonstrate that the SC segregates cells with different response properties and that the behavioral state of a mouse affects SC activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The superior colliculus (SC) receives visual input from the retina in its superficial layers (sSC) and induces eye/head-orientating movements and innate defensive responses in its deeper layers (dSC). Despite their importance, very little is known about the visual response properties of dSC neurons. Using high-density electrode recordings and novel model-based analysis, we found several novel visual response properties of the SC cells, including encoding of a cell's preferred orientation or direction by suppression of the firing rate. The sSC and the dSC are enriched with cells with different visual response properties. Locomotion modulates the cells in the SC. These findings contribute to our understanding of how the SC processes visual inputs, a critical step in comprehending visually guided behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;When immersed in a new environment, we are challenged to decipher initially incomprehensible streams of sensory information. However, quite rapidly, the brain finds structure and meaning in these incoming signals, helping us to predict and prepare ourselves for future actions. This skill relies on extracting the statistics of event streams in the environment that contain regularities of variable complexity from simple repetitive patterns to complex probabilistic combinations. Here, we test the brain mechanisms that mediate our ability to adapt to the environment's statistics and predict upcoming events. By combining behavioral training and multisession fMRI in human participants (male and female), we track the corticostriatal mechanisms that mediate learning of temporal sequences as they change in structure complexity. We show that learning of predictive structures relates to individual decision strategy; that is, selecting the most probable outcome in a given context (maximizing) versus matching the exact sequence statistics. These strategies engage distinct human brain regions: maximizing engages dorsolateral prefrontal, cingulate, sensory–motor regions, and basal ganglia (dorsal caudate, putamen), whereas matching engages occipitotemporal regions (including the hippocampus) and basal ganglia (ventral caudate). Our findings provide evidence for distinct corticostriatal mechanisms that facilitate our ability to extract behaviorally relevant statistics to make predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Making predictions about future events relies on interpreting streams of information that may initially appear incomprehensible. Past work has studied how humans identify repetitive patterns and associative pairings. However, the natural environment contains regularities that vary in complexity from simple repetition to complex probabilistic combinations. Here, we combine behavior and multisession fMRI to track the brain mechanisms that mediate our ability to adapt to changes in the environment's statistics. We provide evidence for an alternate route for learning complex temporal statistics: extracting the most probable outcome in a given context is implemented by interactions between executive and motor corticostriatal mechanisms compared with visual corticostriatal circuits (including hippocampal cortex) that support learning of the exact temporal statistics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Reconfiguration of Brain Network Architectures between Resting-State and Complexity-Dependent Cognitive Reasoning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8399?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8399?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Our capacity for higher cognitive reasoning has a measurable limit. This limit is thought to arise from the brain's capacity to flexibly reconfigure interactions between spatially distributed networks. Recent work, however, has suggested that reconfigurations of task-related networks are modest when compared with intrinsic &quot;resting-state&quot; network architecture. Here we combined resting-state and task-driven functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine how flexible, task-specific reconfigurations associated with increasing reasoning demands are integrated within a stable intrinsic brain topology. Human participants (21 males and 28 females) underwent an initial resting-state scan, followed by a cognitive reasoning task involving different levels of complexity, followed by a second resting-state scan. The reasoning task required participants to deduce the identity of a missing element in a 4 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 4 matrix, and item difficulty was scaled parametrically as determined by relational complexity theory. Analyses revealed that external task engagement was characterized by a significant change in functional brain modules. Specifically, resting-state and null-task demand conditions were associated with more segregated brain-network topology, whereas increases in reasoning complexity resulted in merging of resting-state modules. Further increments in task complexity did not change the established modular architecture, but affected selective patterns of connectivity between frontoparietal, subcortical, cingulo-opercular, and default-mode networks. Larger increases in network efficiency within the newly established task modules were associated with higher reasoning accuracy. Our results shed light on the network architectures that underlie external task engagement, and highlight selective changes in brain connectivity supporting increases in task complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Humans have clear limits in their ability to solve complex reasoning problems. It is thought that such limitations arise from flexible, moment-to-moment reconfigurations of functional brain networks. It is less clear how such task-driven adaptive changes in connectivity relate to stable, intrinsic networks of the brain and behavioral performance. We found that increased reasoning demands rely on selective patterns of connectivity within cortical networks that emerged in addition to a more general, task-induced modular architecture. This task-driven architecture reverted to a more segregated resting-state architecture both immediately before and after the task. These findings reveal how flexibility in human brain networks is integral to achieving successful reasoning performance across different levels of cognitive demand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: 2-Arachidonoylglycerol Reduces Proteoglycans and Enhances Remyelination in a Progressive Model of Demyelination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8385?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The failure to undergo remyelination is a critical impediment to recovery in multiple sclerosis. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) accumulate at demyelinating lesions creating a nonpermissive environment that impairs axon regeneration and remyelination. Here, we reveal a new role for 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), the major CNS endocannabinoid, in the modulation of CSPGs deposition in a progressive model of multiple sclerosis, the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease. Treatment with a potent reversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase, which accounts for 85% of the 2-AG degradation in the mouse CNS, modulates neuroinflammation and reduces CSPGs accumulation and astrogliosis around demyelinated lesions in the spinal cord of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-infected mice. Inhibition of 2-AG hydrolysis augments the number of mature oligodendrocytes and increases MBP, leading to remyelination and functional recovery of mice. Our findings establish a mechanism for 2-AG promotion of remyelination with implications in axonal repair in CNS demyelinating pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The deposition of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans contributes to the failure in remyelination associated with multiple sclerosis. Here we unveil a new role for 2-arachidonoylglycerol, the major CNS endocannabinoid, in the modulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan accumulation in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease. The treatment during the chronic phase with a potent reversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase, which accounts for 85% of the 2-arachidonoylglycerol degradation in the mouse CNS, modulates neuroinflammation and reduces chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan deposition around demyelinated lesions in the spinal cord of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-infected mice. The increased 2-arachidonoylglycerol tone promotes remyelination in a model of progressive multiple sclerosis ameliorating motor dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Basolateral Amygdala to Orbitofrontal Cortex Projections Enable Cue-Triggered Reward Expectations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8374?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8374?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;To make an appropriate decision, one must anticipate potential future rewarding events, even when they are not readily observable. These expectations are generated by using observable information (e.g., stimuli or available actions) to retrieve often quite detailed memories of available rewards. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are two reciprocally connected key nodes in the circuitry supporting such outcome-guided behaviors. But there is much unknown about the contribution of this circuit to decision making, and almost nothing known about the whether any contribution is via direct, monosynaptic projections, or the direction of information transfer. Therefore, here we used designer receptor-mediated inactivation of OFC-&amp;gt;BLA or BLA-&amp;gt;OFC projections to evaluate their respective contributions to outcome-guided behaviors in rats. Inactivation of BLA terminals in the OFC, but not OFC terminals in the BLA, disrupted the selective motivating influence of cue-triggered reward representations over reward-seeking decisions as assayed by Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer. BLA-&amp;gt;OFC projections were also required when a cued reward representation was used to modify Pavlovian conditional goal-approach responses according to the reward's current value. These projections were not necessary when actions were guided by reward expectations generated based on learned action-reward contingencies, or when rewards themselves, rather than stored memories, directed action. These data demonstrate that BLA-&amp;gt;OFC projections enable the cue-triggered reward expectations that can motivate the execution of specific action plans and allow adaptive conditional responding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Deficits anticipating potential future rewarding events are associated with many psychiatric diseases. Presently, we know little about the neural circuits supporting such reward expectation. Here we show that basolateral amygdala to orbitofrontal cortex projections are required for expectations of specific available rewards to influence reward seeking and decision making. The necessity of these projections was limited to situations in which expectations were elicited by reward-predictive cues. These projections therefore facilitate adaptive behavior by enabling the orbitofrontal cortex to use environmental stimuli to generate expectations of potential future rewarding events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Adaptive Encoding of Outcome Prediction by Prefrontal Cortex Ensembles Supports Behavioral Flexibility</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8363?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8363?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to play a critical role in behavioral flexibility by monitoring action–outcome contingencies. How PFC ensembles represent shifts in behavior in response to changes in these contingencies remains unclear. We recorded single-unit activity and local field potentials in the dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) of male rats during a set-shifting task that required them to update their behavior, among competing options, in response to changes in action–outcome contingencies. As behavior was updated, a subset of PFC ensembles encoded the current trial outcome before the outcome was presented. This novel outcome-prediction encoding was absent in a control task, in which actions were rewarded pseudorandomly, indicating that PFC neurons are not merely providing an expectancy signal. In both control and set-shifting tasks, dmPFC neurons displayed postoutcome discrimination activity, indicating that these neurons also monitor whether a behavior is successful in generating rewards. Gamma-power oscillatory activity increased before the outcome in both tasks but did not differentiate between expected outcomes, suggesting that this measure is not related to set-shifting behavior but reflects expectation of an outcome after action execution. These results demonstrate that PFC neurons support flexible rule-based action selection by predicting outcomes that follow a particular action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Tracking action–outcome contingencies and modifying behavior when those contingencies change is critical to behavioral flexibility. We find that ensembles of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex neurons differentiate between expected outcomes when action–outcome contingencies change. This predictive mode of signaling may be used to promote a new response strategy at the service of behavioral flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Intermittent Hypoxia Enhances Functional Connectivity of Midcervical Spinal Interneurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8349?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8349?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brief, intermittent oxygen reductions [acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH)] evokes spinal plasticity. Models of AIH-induced neuroplasticity have focused on motoneurons; however, most midcervical interneurons (C-INs) also respond to hypoxia. We hypothesized that AIH would alter the functional connectivity between C-INs and induce persistent changes in discharge. Bilateral phrenic nerve activity was recorded in anesthetized and ventilated adult male rats and a multielectrode array was used to record C4/5 spinal discharge before [baseline (BL)], during, and 15 min after three 5 min hypoxic episodes (11% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H1–H3). Most C-INs (94%) responded to hypoxia by either increasing or decreasing firing rate. Functional connectivity was examined by cross-correlating C-IN discharge. Correlograms with a peak or trough were taken as evidence for excitatory or inhibitory connectivity between C-IN pairs. A subset of C-IN pairs had increased excitatory cross-correlations during hypoxic episodes (34%) compared with BL (19%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Another subset had a similar response following each episode (40%) compared with BL (19%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). In the latter group, connectivity remained elevated 15 min post-AIH (30%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0002). Inhibitory C-IN connectivity increased during H1–H3 (4.5%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0160), but was reduced 15 min post-AIH (0.5%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0439). Spike-triggered averaging indicated that a subset of C-INs is synaptically coupled to phrenic motoneurons and excitatory inputs to these &quot;pre-phrenic&quot; cells increased during AIH. We conclude that AIH alters connectivity of the midcervical spinal network. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that AIH induces plasticity within the propriospinal network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) can trigger spinal plasticity associated with sustained increases in respiratory, somatic, and/or autonomic motor output. The impact of AIH on cervical spinal interneuron (C-IN) discharge and connectivity is unknown. Our results demonstrate that AIH recruits excitatory C-INs into the spinal respiratory (phrenic) network. AIH also enhances excitatory and reduces inhibitory connections among the C-IN network. We conclude that C-INs are part of the respiratory, somatic, and/or autonomic response to AIH, and that propriospinal plasticity may contribute to sustained increases in motor output after AIH.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Optogenetic Central Amygdala Stimulation Intensifies and Narrows Motivation for Cocaine</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8330?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/35/8330?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Addiction is often characterized by intense motivation for a drug, which may be narrowly focused at the expense of other rewards. Here, we examined the role of amygdala-related circuitry in the amplification and narrowing of motivation focus for intravenous cocaine. We paired optogenetic channelrhodopsin (ChR2) stimulation in either central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) or basolateral amygdala (BLA) of female rats with one particular nose-poke porthole option for earning cocaine infusions (0.3 mg/kg, i.v.). A second alternative porthole earned identical cocaine but without ChR2 stimulation. Consequently, CeA rats quickly came to pursue their CeA ChR2-paired cocaine option intensely and exclusively, elevating cocaine intake while ignoring their alternative cocaine alone option. By comparison, BLA ChR2 pairing failed to enhance cocaine motivation. CeA rats also emitted consummatory bites toward their laser-paired porthole, suggesting that higher incentive salience made that cue more attractive. A separate progressive ratio test of incentive motivation confirmed that CeA ChR2 amplified rats' motivation, raising their breakpoint effort price for cocaine by 10-fold. However, CeA ChR2 laser on its own lacked any reinforcement value: laser by itself was never self-stimulated, not even by the same rats in which it amplified motivation for cocaine. Conversely, CeA inhibition by muscimol/baclofen microinjections prevented acquisition of cocaine self-administration and laser preference, whereas CeA inhibition by optogenetic halorhodopsin suppressed cocaine intake, indicating that CeA circuitry is needed for ordinary cocaine motivation. We conclude that CeA ChR2 excitation paired with a cocaine option specifically focuses and amplifies motivation to produce intense pursuit and consumption focused on that single target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In addiction, intense incentive motivation often becomes narrowly focused on a particular drug of abuse. Here we show that pairing central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) optogenetic stimulation with one option for earning intravenous cocaine makes that option almost the exclusive focus of intense pursuit and consumption. CeA stimulation also elevated the effort cost rats were willing to pay for cocaine and made associated cues become intensely attractive. However, we also show that CeA laser had no reinforcing properties at all when given alone for the same rats. Therefore, CeA laser pairing makes its associated cocaine option and cues become powerfully attractive in a nearly addictive fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; To evaluate the effects of epilepsy and antiepileptic drugs (AED) use during pregnancy on fetal growth and preterm delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; This study included singleton liveborns born to women enrolled in the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry between 1997 and 2016. Data were collected prospectively through telephone interviews. The prevalence of preterm birth (&amp;lt;37 weeks) and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) among infants exposed prenatally to AED when used by women with epilepsy (WWE) or women without epilepsy (WWOE) was compared with that among infants unexposed to AEDs and born to WWOE. Multivariable log-binomial regression models were used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; The study population included infants born to 6,777 AED-WWE, 696 AED-WWOE, and 486 no-AED WWOE. The risk of prematurity was 6.2% for no-AED-WWOE, 9.3% for AED-WWE (RR 1.5, 95%CI: 1.0-2.1) and 10.5% for AED-WWOE (RR 1.5: 1.0-2.4). Prenatal exposure to AED in WWE and WWOE was associated with a mean lower birth weight of 110 and 136 grams, respectively, as compared to no-AED WWOE. The prevalence of SGA was 5.0% for no-AED-WWOE, 10.9% for AED-WWE (RR 2.0: 1.3-3.0) and 11.0% for AED-WWOE (RR 1.9: 1.2-2.9). Within users of AEDs in monotherapy, the prevalence of SGA ranged from 7.3% for lamotrigine to 18.5% for topiramate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; Women on AEDs during pregnancy, whether for epilepsy or for other neuropsychiatric indications, are at a higher risk of delivering prematurely and giving birth to SGA newborns. The risk may vary by drug. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Spasticity occurs in a wide range of neurological diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, after trauma or after stroke and is characterized by increased reflexes leading to muscle hypertonia. Spasticity is a painful symptom and can severely restrict everyday life, but might also participate in maintaining a low level of motor function in severely impaired patients. Constitutive activity of the serotonin receptors 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/C&lt;/sub&gt; is required for the development of spasticity after spinal cord injury or during amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We sought here to provide direct evidence for a role of brainstem serotonin neurons in spasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;em&gt;SOD1&lt;/em&gt;(G37R) mice expressing a conditional allele of an ALS-linked SOD1 mutation were crossed to Tph2-CRE mice expressing CRE in serotonergic neurons. Measurement of long lasting reflex using EMG, behavioural follow up and histological techniques were used to characterize spasticity and motor phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Deleting mutant SOD1 expression selectively in brainstem serotonin neurons was sufficient to rescue loss of TPH2 immunoreactivity and largely preserve serotonin innervation of motor neurons in the spinal cord. Furthermore, this abrogated constitutive activity of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/C&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and abolished spasticity in end-stage mice. Consistent with spasticity mitigating motor symptoms, selective deletion worsened motor function and accelerated the onset of paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Degeneration of serotonin neurons is necessary to trigger spasticity through the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/C&lt;/sub&gt; receptor. The wide range of drugs targeting the serotonergic system could be useful to treat spasticity in neurological diseases. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: GABBR2 mutations determine phenotype in Rett syndrome and epileptic encephalopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25032</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Rett syndrome (RTT) and epileptic encephalopathy (EE) are devastating neurodevelopmental disorders with distinct diagnostic criteria. However, highly heterogeneous and overlapping clinical features often allocate patients into the boundary of the two conditions, complicating accurate diagnosis and appropriate medical interventions. Therefore, we investigated the specific molecular mechanism that allows an understanding of the pathogenesis and relationship of these two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We screened novel genetic factors from 34 RTT-like patients without &lt;em&gt;MECP2&lt;/em&gt; mutations, which account for ∼90% of RTT cases, by whole exome sequencing. The biological function of the discovered variants was assessed in cell culture and &lt;em&gt;Xenopus tropicalis&lt;/em&gt; models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We identified a recurring &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; variant in GABAB receptor R2 (&lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt;) that reduces the receptor function, whereas different &lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt; variants in EE patients possess a more profound effect in reducing receptor activity and are more responsive to agonist rescue in an animal model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt; is a genetic factor that determines RTT- or EE-like phenotype expression depending on the variant positions. &lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt;-mediated GABA signaling is a crucial factor in determining the severity and nature of neurodevelopmental phenotypes.

Seizure-induced brain damage is not conclusively demonstrated either in humans or in animal models of epilepsy. We evaluated the expression of brain injury biomarkers on postsurgical brain tissue obtained from 20 patients with frequent seizures and a long history of drug-resistant focal epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25005-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expression patterns of specific glial, neuronal, and inflammatory molecules were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in the core of type II focal cortical dysplasias (FCD-II), at the FCD boundary (perilesion), and in the adjacent normal-appearing area included in the epileptogenic region. We also analyzed surgical specimens from cryptogenic patients not presenting structural alterations at imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25005-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astroglial and microglial activation, reduced neuronal density, perivascular CD3-positive T-lymphocyte clustering, and fibrinogen extravasation were demonstrated in the core of FCD-II lesions. No pathological immunoreactivity was observed outside the FCD-II or in cryptogenetic specimens, where the occurrence of interictal and ictal epileptiform activity was confirmed by either stereo-electroencephalography or intraoperative electrocorticography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25005-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recurrent seizures do not induce the expression of brain damage markers in nonlesional epileptogenic cortex studied in postsurgical tissue from cryptogenic and FCD patients. This evidence argues against the hypothesis that epileptiform activity per se contributes to focal brain injury, at least in the neocortical epilepsies considered here.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25010-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite numerous studies suggesting the role of insular cortex in the processing of gustatory and olfactory inputs, the exact location of olfactogustatory representation in the insula remains controversial. Here we provide a functional mapping of olfactory–gustatory responses to stimulation of the human insular cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25010-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We reviewed 651 electrical stimulations of the insula that were performed in 221 patients, using stereotactically implanted depth electrodes, during the presurgical evaluation of drug-refractory epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25010-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gustatory sensations were evoked in 15 (2.7%) of the 550 stimulations that elicited a clinical response. They were exclusively obtained after stimulation of a relatively delimited zone of insula, located in its mid-dorsal part (posterior short gyrus). Six olfactory sensations (1.1%) could be obtained during stimulations of an insular region that partially overlapped with the gustatory representation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25010-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study provides a functional mapping of gustatory representation in the insular posterior short gyrus and the first detailed description of olfactory sensations obtained by direct stimulation of mid-dorsal insula. Our data also show a spatial overlap between gustatory, olfactory, and oral somatosensory representation in the mid-dorsal insula, and suggest that this part of the insula may be an integrated oral sensory region that plays a key role in flavor perception. It also indicates that dysfunction in this region should be considered during the evaluation of gustatory and olfactory epileptic seizures.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary and secondary conditions leading to thiamine deficiency have overlapping features in children, presenting with acute episodes of encephalopathy, bilateral symmetric brain lesions, and high excretion of organic acids that are specific of thiamine-dependent mitochondrial enzymes, mainly lactate, alpha-ketoglutarate, and branched chain keto-acids. Undiagnosed and untreated thiamine deficiencies are often fatal or lead to severe sequelae. Herein, we describe the clinical and genetic characterization of 79 patients with inherited thiamine defects causing encephalopathy in childhood, identifying outcome predictors in patients with pathogenic &lt;em&gt;SLC19A3&lt;/em&gt; variants, the most common genetic etiology. We propose diagnostic criteria that will aid clinicians to establish a faster and accurate diagnosis so that early vitamin supplementation is considered.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite great progress in neuroscience, there are still fundamental
unanswered questions about the brain, including the origin of subjective
experience and consciousness. Some answers might rely on new physical
mechanisms. Given that biophotons have been discovered in the brain, it is
interesting to explore if neurons use photonic communication in addition to the
well-studied electro-chemical signals. Such photonic communication in the brain
would require waveguides. Here we review recent work [S. Kumar, K. Boone, J.
Tuszynski, P. Barclay, and C. Simon, Scientific Reports 6, 36508 (2016)]
suggesting that myelinated axons could serve as photonic waveguides. The light
transmission in the myelinated axon was modeled, taking into account its
realistic imperfections, and experiments were proposed both in-vivo and
in-vitro to test this hypothesis. Potential implications for quantum biology
are discussed.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pain is a complex and subjective experience that poses a number of
measurement challenges. While self-report by the patient is viewed as the gold
standard of pain assessment, this approach fails when patients cannot verbally
communicate pain intensity or lack normal mental abilities. Here, we present a
pain intensity measurement method based on physiological signals. Specifically,
we implement a multi-task learning approach based on neural networks that
accounts for individual differences in pain responses while still leveraging
data from across the population. We test our method in a dataset containing
multi-modal physiological responses to nociceptive pain.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Synchrony-induced modes of oscillation of a neural field model. (arXiv:1708.08672v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08672</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08672</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We investigate the modes of oscillation of heterogeneous ring-networks of
quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons with non-local, space-dependent coupling.
Perturbations of the equilibrium state with a particular wave number produce
transient standing waves with a specific frequency, analogous to those in a
tense string. In the neuronal network, the equilibrium corresponds to a
spatially homogeneous, asynchronous state. Perturbations of this state excite
the network's oscillatory modes, which reflect the interplay of episodes of
synchronous spiking with the excitatory-inhibitory spatial interactions. In the
thermodynamic limit, an exact low-dimensional neural field model describing the
macroscopic dynamics of the network is derived. This allows us to obtain
formulas for the Turing eigenvalues of the spatially-homogeneous state, and
hence to obtain its stability boundary. We find that the frequency of each
Turing mode depends on the corresponding Fourier coefficient of the synaptic
pattern of connectivity. The decay rate instead, is identical for all
oscillation modes as a consequence of the heterogeneity-induced
desynchronization of the neurons. Finally, we numerically compute the spectrum
of spatially-inhomogeneous solutions branching from the Turing bifurcation,
showing that similar oscillatory modes operate in neural bump states, and are
maintained away from onset.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fluctuation analysis in nonstationary conditions: single Ca channel current in cortical pyramidal neurons. (arXiv:1603.02007v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02007</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02007</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fluctuation analysis is a method which allows measurement of the single
channel current of ion channels even when it is too small to be resolved
directly with the patch clamp technique. This is the case for voltage-gated
Ca2+ channels (VGCCs). They are present in all mammalian central neurons,
controlling presynaptic release of transmitter, postsynaptic signaling and
synaptic integration. The amplitudes of their single channel currents in a
physiological concentration of extracellular Ca2+, however, are small and not
well determined. But measurement of this quantity is essential for estimating
numbers of functional VGCCs in the membrane and the size of channel-associated
Ca2+ signaling domains, and for understanding the stochastic nature of Ca2+
signaling. Here, we recorded the VGCC current in nucleated patches from layer 5
pyramidal neurons in rat neocortex, in physiological external Ca2+ (1-2 mM).
The ensemble-averaging of current responses required for conventional
fluctuation analysis proved impractical because of the rapid rundown of VGCC
currents. We therefore developed a more robust method, using mean current
fitting of individual current responses and band-pass filtering. Furthermore,
voltage ramp stimulation proved useful. We validated the accuracy of the method
by analyzing simulated data. At an external Ca2+ concentration of 1 mM, and a
membrane potential of -20 mV, we found that the average single channel current
amplitude was about 0.04 pA, increasing to 0.065 pA at 2 mM external Ca2+, and
0.12 pA at 5 mM. The relaxation time constant of the fluctuations was in the
range 0.2-0.8 ms. The results are relevant to understanding the stochastic
properties of dendritic Ca2+ spikes in neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons.
With the reported method, single channel current amplitude of native VGCCs can
be resolved accurately despite conditions of unstable rundown.

	<description>Making a choice requires a combination of urgency, which provides the drive to act, and perceptual analysis, which identifies the most advantageous alternative. In behaving monkeys, Thura and Cisek map these processes onto separate brain structures with a complex interplay.</description>

	<description>Kim et al. show that inhibitory basal ganglia inputs yield excitatory motor signals in the thalamus and, in excess, promote PD-like motor abnormalities. These suggest that the role of inhibitory basal ganglia circuits should be re-evaluated with consideration of their ability to induce excitatory signals at post-synaptic targets.</description>

	<description>To aid understanding of retinal structure and function, we present as an online resource the dendritic arbors and visual responses of ganglion cells in a single patch of mouse retina. We divide the inner plexiform layer, which contains the dendritic arbors of ganglion cells, into four sublaminae defined by a purely anatomical principle of arbor segregation. The sublaminae serve as the starting point for a hierarchical clustering of our ganglion cells. We propose and apply a quantitative criterion for validating a cluster as a ganglion cell type: the aggregate neurite density of a type should be approximately uniform (density conservation). Finally, we find that ganglion cells arborizing in the inner marginal sublamina of the inner plexiform layer exhibit significantly more sustained visual responses on average.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/182667v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Pyramidal neurons in layer 5 of the neocortex comprise two broad classes of projection neurons: corticofugal neurons, including corticopontine (CPn) neurons, and intratelencephalic neurons, including commissural/callosal (COM) neurons. These non-overlapping neuron subpopulations represent discrete cortical output channels contributing to perception, decision making, and behavior. CPn and COM neurons have distinct morphological and physiological characteristics, and divergent responses to modulatory transmitters such as serotonin and acetylcholine (ACh). To better understand how ACh regulates cortical output, in slices of mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC) we compared the responsivity of CPn and COM neurons to transient exposure to exogenous or endogenous ACh. In both neuron subtypes, exogenous ACh generated qualitatively similar biphasic responses in which brief hyperpolarization was followed by longer-lasting enhancement of excitability. However, cholinergic inhibition was more pronounced in COM neurons, while excitatory responses were larger and longer lasting in CPn neurons. Similarly, optically triggered release of endogenous ACh from cholinergic terminals preferentially and persistently (for ~40 s) enhanced the excitability of CPn neurons, but had little impact on COM neurons. Cholinergic excitation of CPn neurons involved at least three distinct ionic mechanisms: activation of a calcium-sensitive but calcium-permeable nonspecific cation conductance, suppression of KV7 channels (the M-current), and activation of the calcium-dependent nonspecific cation conductance underlying afterdepolarizations. Our results demonstrate projection-specific selectivity in cholinergic signaling in the PFC, and suggest that transient release of ACh during behavior will preferentially promote corticofugal output.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/182444v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Cognitive function relies on a dynamic, context-sensitive balance between functional integration and segregation in the brain. Previous work has proposed that this balance is mediated by global fluctuations in neural gain by projections from ascending neuromodulatory nuclei. To test this hypothesis in silico, we studied the effects of neural gain on network dynamics in a model of large-scale neuronal dynamics. We found that increases in neural gain pushed the network through an abrupt dynamical transition, leading to an integrated network topology that was maximal in frontoparietal  rich club regions. This gain-mediated transition was also associated with increased topological complexity, as well as increased variability in time-resolved topological structure, further highlighting the potential computational benefits of the gain-mediated network transition. These results support the hypothesis that neural gain modulation has the computational capacity to mediate the balance between integration and segregation in the brain.</description>

	<description>Human neuroscience research faces several challenges with regards to reproducibility. While scientists are generally aware that data sharing is an important component of reproducible research, it is not always clear how to usefully share data in a manner that allows other labs to understand and reproduce published findings. Here we describe a new tool, AFQ-Browser, that builds an interactive website as a companion to a published diffusion MRI study. Because AFQ-Browser is portable -- it runs in any modern web-browser -- it can facilitate transparency and data sharing. Moreover, by leveraging new web-visualization technologies to create linked views between different dimensions of a diffusion MRI dataset (anatomy, quantitative diffusion metrics, subject metadata), AFQ-Browser facilitates exploratory data analysis, fueling new scientific discoveries based on previously published datasets. In an era where Big Data is playing an increasingly prominent role in scientific discovery, so will browser-based tools for exploring high-dimensional datasets, communicating scientific discoveries, sharing and aggregating data across labs, and publishing data alongside manuscripts.</description>

	<description>Primates predominantly rely on vision to gather information from the environment, and neurons representing visual space and gaze position are found in many brain areas. Within the medial temporal lobe, a brain region critical for memory, neurons in the entorhinal cortex of macaque monkeys exhibit spatial selectivity for gaze position. Specifically, the firing rate of single neurons reflects fixation location within a visual image (Killian et al., 2012). In the rodents, entorhinal cells such as grid cells, border cells, and head direction cells show spatial representations aligned to visual environmental features instead of the body (Hafting et al., 2005, Solstad et al. 2008, Sargolini et al., 2006, Diehl et al., 2017). However, it is not known whether similar allocentric representations exist in primate entorhinal cortex. Here, we recorded neural activity in the entorhinal cortex in two male rhesus monkeys during a naturalistic, free-viewing task. Our data reveal that a majority of entorhinal neurons represent gaze position, and that simultaneously recorded neurons exhibit distinct spatial reference frames, with some neurons aligning to the visual image and others aligning to the monkey's head position. Our results also show that entorhinal neural activity can be used to predict gaze position with a high degree of accuracy. These findings demonstrate that visuospatial representation is a fundamental property of entorhinal neurons in primates, and suggest that entorhinal cortex may support relational memory and motor planning by coding attentional locus in distinct, behaviorally relevant frames of reference.</description>

	<description>Social impairments are a hallmark of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), but empirical evidence for early brain network alterations in response to social stimuli is scant in ASD. Here, we recorded the gaze patterns and brain activity of toddlers and preschoolers with ASD and their typically developing (TD) peers while they explored dynamic social scenes. Source-space directed functional connectivity analyses revealed the presence of network alterations in the theta frequency band, manifesting as increased driving (hyper-activity) and stronger connections (hyper-connectivity) from key nodes of the social brain associated with autism. Further analyses of brain-behavioural relationships within the ASD group suggested that compensatory mechanisms from dorsomedial frontal, inferior temporal and insular cortical regions were associated with lower clinical impairment and less atypical gaze patterns. Our results provide strong evidence that directed functional connectivity alterations of social brain networks is a core component of atypical brain development at early stages of ASD.</description>

	<description>Understanding the organizational logic of neural circuits requires deciphering the biological basis of neuron type diversity and identity, but there is no consensus on defining a neuron type. We analyzed single cell transcriptomes of anatomically and physiologically characterized cortical ground truth populations and conducted a computational genomic screen for transcription profiles that distinguish them. We discovered that cardinal GABAergic neuron types are delineated by a transcriptional architecture that encodes their synaptic communication patterns. This architecture comprises 6 categories of ~40 gene families including cell adhesion molecules, transmitter-modulator receptors, ion channels, signaling proteins, neuropeptides and vesicular release components, and transcription factors. Combinatorial expression of select members across families shapes a multi-layered molecular scaffold along cell membrane that may customize synaptic connectivity patterns and input-output signaling properties. This molecular genetic framework of neuronal identity integrates cell phenotypes along multiple axes and provides a foundation for discovering and classifying neuron types.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Serial quantification of brain oxygenation in acute stroke using streamlined-qBOLD</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/140897v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/140897v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>It has been proposed that metabolic markers of baseline brain oxygenation have a role to play in the early identification of the ischemic penumbra. Streamlined-qBOLD is a magnetic resonance imaging technique that does not require exogenous contrast. It is a refinement of the quantitative BOLD methodology that provides a simplified approach to mapping and quantifying baseline brain oxygenation related parameters (reversible transverse relaxation rate (R2'), deoxygenated blood volume (DBV) and deoxyhaemoglobin concentration ([dHb])) in a clinically relevant manner. Streamlined-qBOLD was applied to an exploratory cohort of acute stroke patients in a serial imaging study. Detailed voxel-level analysis was used to quantify the metabolic profile of ischaemic tissue on presentation and investigate these metrics in relation to tissue outcome. Individual patient examples illustrate the appropriate interpretation of R2', DBV and [dHb] in acute stroke and demonstrate the ability of this method to deliver regional information related to oxygen metabolism in the ischaemic tissue. Regional analysis confirms that R2', DBV and [dHb] vary between regions of ischaemia with different tissue outcomes.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We review our current software tools and theoretical methods for applying the
Neural Engineering Framework to state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware. These
methods can be used to implement linear and nonlinear dynamical systems that
exploit axonal transmission time-delays, and to fully account for nonideal
mixed-analog-digital synapses that exhibit higher-order dynamics with
heterogeneous time-constants. This summarizes earlier versions of these methods
that have been discussed in a more biological context (Voelker &amp;amp; Eliasmith,
2017) or regarding a specific neuromorphic architecture (Voelker et al., 2017).

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Network neuroscience is the emerging discipline concerned with investigating
the complex patterns of interconnections found in neural systems, and to
identify principles with which to understand them. Within this discipline, one
particularly powerful approach is network generative modeling, in which wiring
rules are algorithmically implemented to produce synthetic network
architectures with the same properties as observed in empirical network data.
Successful models can highlight the principles by which a network is organized
and potentially uncover the mechanisms by which it grows and develops. Here we
review the prospects and promise of generative models for network neuroscience.
We begin with a primer on network generative models, with a discussion of
compressibility and predictability, utility in intuiting mechanisms, and a
short history on their use in network science broadly. We then discuss
generative models in practice and application, paying particular attention to
the critical need for cross-validation. Next, we review generative models of
biological neural networks, both at the cellular and large-scale level, and
across a variety of species including \emph{C. elegans}, \emph{Drosophila},
mouse, rat, cat, macaque, and human. We offer a careful treatment of a few
relevant distinctions, including differences between generative models and null
models, sufficiency and redundancy, inferring and claiming mechanism, and
functional and structural connectivity. We close with a discussion of future
directions, outlining exciting frontiers both in empirical data collection
efforts as well as in method and theory development that, together, further the
utility of the generative network modeling approach for network neuroscience.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Advanced statistical methods for eye movement analysis and modeling: a gentle introduction. (arXiv:1506.07194v4 [physics.data-an] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07194</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07194</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this Chapter we show that by considering eye movements, and in particular,
the resulting sequence of gaze shifts, a stochastic process, a wide variety of
tools become available for analyses and modelling beyond conventional
statistical methods. Such tools encompass random walk analyses and more complex
techniques borrowed from the pattern recognition and machine learning fields.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a brief, though critical, probabilistic tour of current computational
models of eye movements and visual attention, we lay down the basis for gaze
shift pattern analysis. To this end, the concepts of Markov Processes, the
Wiener process and related random walks within the Gaussian framework of the
Central Limit Theorem will be introduced. Then, we will deliberately violate
fundamental assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem to elicit a larger
perspective, rooted in statistical physics, for analysing and modelling eye
movements in terms of anomalous, non-Gaussian, random walks and modern foraging
theory.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, by resorting to machine learning techniques, we discuss how the
analyses of movement patterns can develop into the inference of hidden patterns
of the mind: inferring the observer's task, assessing cognitive impairments,
classifying expertise.

&lt;p&gt;Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9orf72 gene locus create double jeopardy, first by leading to DNA–RNA R-loops that spawn double-strand breaks and second by the synthesis of dipeptide repeats that hinder DNA repair.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Drug discovery to counteract antinociceptive tolerance with mu-opioid receptor endocytosis</title>

	<description>Morphine antinociceptive tolerance is highly correlated with its poor ability to promote mu-opioid-receptor (MOR) endocytosis. Our objective was to discover a novel positive allosteric modulator of MOR to enhance morphine-induced MOR endocytosis. We used high-throughput screening to identify several cardiotonic steroids as positive allosteric modulators of morphine-induced MOR endocytosis having high potency and efficacy, independently of Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition. Convallatoxin was found to enhance morphine-induced MOR endocytosis through an adaptor protein 2/clathrin-dependent mechanism without regulating G protein- or {beta}-arrestin-mediated pathways. Both F243 and I292 residues of MOR were essential to the effect of convallatoxin on MOR endocytosis. Co-treatment with chronic morphine and convallatoxin reduced morphine tolerance in animal models of acute thermal pain and chronic inflammatory pain. Acute convallatoxin administration reversed morphine tolerance in morphine-tolerant mice. These findings suggest that cardiotonic steroids are potentially therapeutic for morphine side effects and open a new avenue for the study of MOR trafficking.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Posterior parietal cortex represents sensory stimulus history and is necessary for its effects on behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/182246v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/182246v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Many models of cognition and of neural computations posit the use and estimation of prior stimulus statistics: it has long been known that working memory and perception are strongly impacted by previous sensory experience, even when that sensory history is irrelevant for the current task at hand. Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms and brain regions necessary for computing and using such priors are unknown. Here we report that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is a critical locus for the representation and use of prior stimulus information. We trained rats in an auditory Parametric Working Memory (PWM) task, and found that rats displayed substantial and readily quantifiable behavioral effects of sensory stimulus history, similar to those observed in humans and monkeys. Earlier proposals that PPC supports working memory predict that optogenetic silencing of the PPC would lead to a behavioral impairment in our working memory task. Contrary to this prediction, silencing PPC produced a significant performance improvement. Quantitative analyses of behavior revealed that this improvement was due to the selective reduction of the effects of prior sensory stimuli. Electrophysiological recordings showed that PPC neurons carried far more information about sensory stimuli of previous trials than about stimuli of the current trial. Furthermore, the more information about previous trial sensory history in the neural firing rates of a given rat's PPC, the greater the behavioral effect of sensory history in that rat, suggesting a tight link between behavior and PPC representations of stimulus history. Our results indicate that the PPC is a central component in the processing of sensory stimulus history, and open a window for neurobiological investigation of long-standing questions regarding how perception and working memory are affected by prior sensory information.</description>

	<description>Semantic cognition refers to our ability to use acquired knowledge to make sense of the environment and to guide behaviour. This requires representation of knowledge as well as control processes which ensure that currently-relevant aspects of this knowledge are retrieved and selected in any given situation. These abilities can be impaired selectively following brain damage; however, the relationship between them in healthy individuals is not known. In addition, it is commonly assumed that semantic cognition is preserved in later life, because older people have greater reserves of knowledge. However, this claim overlooks the possibility of decline in semantic control processes, which has not been investigated. The study addressed these issues by assessing verbal semantic cognition in 100 young and older adults. Despite having a broader base of semantic knowledge (i.e., wider vocabulary), older people showed specific impairments in semantic control, performing more poorly than young people when required to select among competing semantic representations. Conversely, they showed improved controlled retrieval of less salient information from the semantic store. Within each age group, breadth of semantic knowledge was positively correlated with controlled retrieval but was unrelated to semantic selection ability, which was instead correlated with non-semantic executive function. These findings indicate that three distinct elements contribute to semantic cognition: (a) a store of representations which accumulates throughout the lifespan, (b) processes for controlled retrieval of less salient information from this store, which are also more developed in later life and (c) domain-general executive selection mechanisms that decline in old age. These results provide a new framework for interpreting patterns of spared and impaired verbal abilities in old age.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Deep grey matter volume loss drives disability worsening in multiple sclerosis</title>

	<description>Objective: Grey matter (GM) atrophy occurs in all multiple sclerosis (MS) phenotypes. We investigated whether there is a spatiotemporal pattern of GM atrophy that is associated with faster disability accumulation in MS. Methods: We analysed 3,604 brain high-resolution T1-weighted MRI scans from 1,417 participants: 1,214 MS patients (253 clinically-isolated syndrome [CIS], 708 relapsing-remitting [RRMS], 128 secondary-progressive [SPMS], 125 primary-progressive [PPMS]), over an average follow-up of 2.41 years (standard deviation [SD]=1.97), and 203 healthy controls (HCs) [average follow-up=1.83 year, SD=1.77], attending 7 European centres. Disability was assessed with the Expanded-Disability Status Scale (EDSS). We obtained volumes of the deep GM (DGM), temporal, frontal, parietal, occipital and cerebellar GM, brainstem and cerebral white matter. Hierarchical mixed-models assessed annual percentage rate of regional tissue loss and identified regional volumes associated with time-to-EDSS progression. Results: SPMS showed the lowest baseline volumes of cortical GM and DGM. Of all baseline regional volumes, only that of the DGM predicted time-to-EDSS progression (hazard ratio=0.73, 95% CIs 0.65, 0.82; p&amp;lt;0.001): for every standard deviation decrease in baseline DGM volume, the risk of presenting a shorter time to EDSS worsening during follow-up increased by 27%. Of all longitudinal measures, DGM showed the fastest annual rate of atrophy, which was faster in SPMS (-1.45%), PPMS (-1.66%), and RRMS (-1.34%) than CIS (-0.88%) and HCs (-0.94%) [p&amp;lt;0.01]. The rate of temporal GM atrophy in SPMS (-1.21%) was significantly faster than RRMS (-0.76%), CIS (-0.75%), and HCs (-0.51%). Similarly, the rate of parietal GM atrophy in SPMS (-1.24%) was faster than CIS (-0.63%) and HCs (-0.23%) (all p values &amp;lt;0.05). Only the atrophy rate in DGM in patients was significantly associated with disability accumulation (beta=0.04, p&amp;lt;0.001). Interpretation: This large multi-centre and longitudinal study shows that DGM volume loss drives disability accumulation in MS, and that temporal cortical GM shows accelerated atrophy in SPMS than RRMS. The difference in regional GM atrophy development between phenotypes needs to be taken into account when evaluating treatment effect of therapeutic interventions.</description>

	<description>Human motor control requires the coordination of muscle activity under the anatomical constraints imposed by the musculoskeletal system. Interactions within the central nervous system are fundamental to motor coordination, but the principles governing functional integration remain poorly understood. We use network analysis to investigate the relationship between anatomical and functional connectivity amongst 36 muscles during postural tasks. We find a modular structure of functional networks that is strongly shaped by the anatomical constraints of the musculoskeletal system. Muscle networks exhibit a multilayer architecture with distinct spectral fingerprints in which functional interactions are established across multiple timescales. Changes in postural tasks are associated with a reconfiguration in the coupling between functional modules. These results identify a distributed neural circuitry in which parallel pathways give rise to different functional modes that facilitate flexible motor behaviours. This multi-level network approach to the motor system offers a unique window into the neural basis for human movement.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Covert Shift of Attention Modulates the Value Encoding in the Orbitofrontal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/181784v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>During value-based decision making, we often evaluate the value of each option sequentially by shifting our attention, even when the options are presented simultaneously. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been suggested to encode value during value-based decision making. Yet it is not known how its activity is modulated by attention shifts. We investigated this question by employing a passive viewing task that allowed us to disentangle effects of attention, value, choice and eye movement. We found that the attention modulated OFC activity through a winner-take-all mechanism. When we attracted the monkeys' attention covertly, the OFC neuronal activity reflected the reward value of the newly attended cue. The shift of attention could be explained by a normalization model. Our results strongly argue for the hypothesis that the OFC neuronal activity represents the value of covertly attended item. They provide important insights toward the neural mechanism of value-based decision making.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Domain-based prediction of the human isoform interactome provides insights into the functional impact of alternative splicing</title>

Alternative splicing is known to remodel protein-protein interaction networks (“interactomes”), yet large-scale determination of isoform-specific interactions remains challenging. We present a domain-based method to predict the isoform interactome from the reference interactome. First, we construct the domain-resolved reference interactome by mapping known domain-domain interactions onto experimentally-determined interactions between reference proteins. Then, we construct the isoform interactome by predicting that an isoform loses an interaction if it loses the domain mediating the interaction. Our prediction framework is of high-quality when assessed by experimental data. The predicted human isoform interactome reveals extensive network remodeling by alternative splicing. Protein pairs interacting with different isoforms of the same gene tend to be more divergent in biological function, tissue expression, and disease phenotype than protein pairs interacting with the same isoforms. Our prediction method complements experimental efforts, and demonstrates that integrating structural domain information with interactomes provides insights into the functional impact of alternative splicing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pOE3h8IZjMI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A method of determining where to target surveillance efforts in heterogeneous epidemiological systems</title>

The spread of pathogens into new environments poses a considerable threat to human, animal, and plant health, and by extension, human and animal wellbeing, ecosystem function, and agricultural productivity, worldwide. Early detection through effective surveillance is a key strategy to reduce the risk of their establishment. Whilst it is well established that statistical and economic considerations are of vital importance when planning surveillance efforts, it is also important to consider epidemiological characteristics of the pathogen in question—including heterogeneities within the epidemiological system itself. One of the most pronounced realisations of this heterogeneity is seen in the case of vector-borne pathogens, which spread between ‘hosts’ and ‘vectors’—with each group possessing distinct epidemiological characteristics. As a result, an important question when planning surveillance for emerging vector-borne pathogens is where to place sampling resources in order to detect the pathogen as early as possible. We answer this question by developing a statistical function which describes the probability distributions of the prevalences of infection at first detection in both hosts and vectors. We also show how this method can be adapted in order to maximise the probability of early detection of an emerging pathogen within imposed sample size and/or cost constraints, and demonstrate its application using two simple models of vector-borne citrus pathogens. Under the assumption of a linear cost function, we find that sampling costs are generally minimised when either hosts or vectors, but not both, are sampled.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HsuotfhBM24&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: HLA class I haplotype diversity is consistent with selection for frequent existing haplotypes</title>

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) contains the most polymorphic genetic system in humans, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes of the adaptive immune system. High allelic diversity in HLA is argued to be maintained by balancing selection, such as negative frequency-dependent selection or heterozygote advantage. Selective pressure against immune escape by pathogens can maintain appreciable frequencies of many different HLA alleles. The selection pressures operating on combinations of HLA alleles across loci, or haplotypes, have not been extensively evaluated since the high HLA polymorphism necessitates very large sample sizes, which have not been available until recently. We aimed to evaluate the effect of selection operating at the HLA haplotype level by analyzing HLA A~C~B~DRB1~DQB1 haplotype frequencies derived from over six million individuals genotyped by the National Marrow Donor Program registry. In contrast with alleles, HLA haplotype diversity patterns suggest purifying selection, as certain HLA allele combinations co-occur in high linkage disequilibrium. Linkage disequilibrium is positive (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'&amp;gt;0) among frequent haplotypes and negative (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'&amp;lt;0) among rare haplotypes. Fitting the haplotype frequency distribution to several population dynamics models, we found that the best fit was obtained when significant positive frequency-dependent selection (FDS) was incorporated. Finally, the Ewens-Watterson test of homozygosity showed excess homozygosity for 5-locus haplotypes within 23 US populations studied, with an average &lt;i&gt;Fnd&lt;/i&gt; of 28.43. Haplotype diversity is most consistent with purifying selection for HLA Class I haplotypes (HLA-A, -B, -C), and was not inferred for HLA Class II haplotypes (-DRB1 and—DQB1). We discuss our empirical results in the context of evolutionary theory, exploring potential mechanisms of selection that maintain high linkage disequilibrium in MHC haplotype blocks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/983RcTGNU5k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Which spike train distance is most suitable for distinguishing rate and temporal coding?. (arXiv:1708.07508v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07508</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07508</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is commonly assumed in neuronal coding that repeated presentations of a
stimulus to a coding neuron elicit similar responses. One common way to assess
similarity are spike train distances. These can be divided into spike-resolved,
such as the Victor-Purpura and the van Rossum distance, and time-resolved, e.g.
the ISI-, the SPIKE- and the RI-SPIKE-distance. We use independent steady-rate
Poisson processes as surrogates for spike trains with fixed rate and no timing
information to address two basic questions: How does the sensitivity of the
different spike train distances to temporal coding depend on the rates of the
two processes and how do the distances deal with very low rates? Spike-resolved
distances always contain rate information even for parameters indicating time
coding. This is an issue for reasonably high rates but beneficial for very low
rates. In contrast, the operational range for detecting time coding of
time-resolved distances is superior at normal rates, but these measures produce
artefacts at very low rates. The RI-SPIKE-distance is the only measure that is
sensitive to timing information only. While our results on rate-dependent
expectation values for the spike-resolved distances agree with Chicharro et al.
(2011), we here go one step further and specifically investigate applicability
for very low rates. The most appropriate measure depends on the rates of the
data being analysed. Accordingly, we summarize our results in one table that
allows an easy selection of the preferred measure for any kind of data.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Putting the &quot;dynamic&quot; back into dynamic functional connectivity</title>

	<description>The study of fluctuations in time-resolved functional connectivity is a topic of substantial current interest. As the term 'dynamic functional connectivity' implies, such fluctuations are believed to arise from dynamics in the neuronal systems generating these signals. While considerable activity currently attends to methodological and statistical issues regarding dynamic functional connectivity, less attention has been paid toward its candidate causes. Here, we review candidate scenarios for dynamic (functional) connectivity that arise in dynamical systems with two or more subsystems; generalized synchronization, itinerancy (a form of metastability), and multistability. Each of these scenarios arise under different configurations of local dynamics and inter-system coupling: We show how they generate time series data with nonlinear and/or non-stationary multivariate statistics. The key issue is that time series generated by coupled nonlinear systems contain a richer temporal structure than matched multivariate (linear) stochastic processes. In turn, this temporal structure yields many of the phenomena proposed as important to large-scale communication and computation in the brain, such as phase-amplitude coupling, complexity and flexibility. The code for simulating these dynamics is available in a freeware software platform, the Brain Dynamics Toolbox.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Common features in plastic changes rather than constructed structures in recurrent neural network prefrontal cortex models</title>

	<description>We have flexible control over our cognition depending on the context or surrounding environments. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) controls this cognitive flexibility; however, the detailed underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Recent developments in machine learning techniques have allowed simple recurrent neural network PFC models to perform human- or animal-like behavioral tasks. These systems allow us to acquire parameters, which we could not in biological experiments, for performing the tasks. We compared four models, in which a flexible cognition task, called context-dependent integration task, was performed; subsequently, we searched for common features. In all the models, we observed that high plastic synapses were concentrated in the small neuronal population and the more concentrated neuronal units contributed further to the performance. However, there were no common properties in the constructed structures. These results suggest that plastic changes can be more general and important to accomplish cognitive tasks than features of the constructed structures.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: On the relationship between instantaneous phase synchrony and correlation-based sliding windows for time-resolved fMRI connectivity analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/179820v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Correlation-based sliding window analysis (CSWA) is the most commonly used method to estimate time-resolved functional MRI (fMRI) connectivity. However, instantaneous phase synchrony analysis (IPSA) is gaining popularity mainly because it offers single time-point resolution of time-resolved fMRI connectivity. We aim to provide a systematic comparison between these two approaches, on both temporal and topological levels. For this purpose, we used resting-state fMRI data from two separate cohorts with different temporal resolutions (45 healthy subjects from Human Connectome Project fMRI data with repetition time of 0.72 s and 25 healthy subjects from a separate validation fMRI dataset with a repetition time of 3 s). For time-resolved functional connectivity analysis, we calculated tapered CSWA over a wide range of different window lengths that were temporally and topologically compared to IPSA. We found a strong association in connectivity dynamics between IPSA and CSWA when considering the absolute values of CSWA. This association peaked at a CSWA window length of ~20 seconds, irrespective of the sampling rate of the underlying fMRI data. Narrow-band filtering of fMRI data (0.03-0.07 Hz) yielded a stronger relationship between IPSA and CSWA than wider-band (0.01-0.1 Hz). On a topological level, time-averaged IPSA and CSWA nodes were non-linearly correlated, mainly because nodes with strong negative correlations (CSWA) displayed high phase synchrony (IPSA). Our results suggest that IPSA and CSWA provide comparable characterizations of time-resolved fMRI connectivity for appropriately chosen window lengths. Although IPSA requires narrow-band fMRI filtering, we recommend the use of IPSA given that it does not mandate a (semi-)arbitrary choice of window length and window overlap. A MATLAB code for calculating IPSA is provided.</description>

	<description>Working memory capacity has long been the subject of intense research interest, but few studies have systematically investigated the dependence of capacity on memory load that exceeds our retention abilities. Under this real-world scenario, WM performance typically declines beyond a critical load among low-capacity subjects, a phenomenon known as working memory overload. We used a fronto-parietal cortical model to test the hypothesis that high-capacity subjects select a manageable number of items for storage, thereby avoiding overload. The model accounts for behavioural and electrophysiological data from high-capacity subjects in a parameter regime where competitive encoding in its prefrontal network selects items for storage, inter-aerial projections sustain their representations after stimulus offset, and weak dynamics in its parietal network limit their mutual interference. Violation of these principles accounts for these data among low-capacity subjects, implying that poor working memory performance reflects poor control over fronto-parietal circuitry, and making testable predictions for experiments.</description>

	<description>For the past decade, research on the storage limitations of working memory has been dominated by two fundamentally different hypotheses. On the one hand, the contents of working memory may be stored in a limited number of  slots, each with a fixed resolution. On the other hand, any number of items may be stored, but with decreasing resolution. These two hypotheses have been invaluable in characterizing the computational structure of working memory, but neither provides a complete account of the available experimental data, nor speaks to the neural basis of the limitations it characterizes. To address these shortcomings, we simulated a multiple-item working memory task with a cortical network model, the cellular resolution of which allowed us to quantify the coding fidelity of memoranda as a function of memory load, as measured by the discriminability, regularity and reliability of simulated neural spiking. Our simulations account for a wealth of neural and behavioural data from human and non-human primate studies, and they demonstrate that feedback inhibition not only lowers capacity, but also lowers coding fidelity by all three measures. Because the strength of inhibition scales with the number of items stored by the network, increasing this number progressively lowers fidelity until capacity is reached. As such, the model provides a mechanistic explanation for experimental data showing that working memory precision decreases with increasing memory load before levelling off at capacity. Crucially, the model makes specific, testable predictions for neural activity on multiple-item working memory tasks.</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Loss of cognition even after survival is the salient feature of cerebral malaria (CM). Currently, the fate of neuronal morphology is not studied at the ultra-structural level in CM. Recent studies suggest that maintenance of neuronal morphology and dendritic spine density (actin dynamics in particular) are essential for proper cognitive functions. LIMK-1/Cofilin-1signaling pathway is known to involve in the maintenance of actin dynamics through regulation of cofilin-1, in executing learning and memory functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Using experimental mouse model, we analyzed the behavioural parameters of CM, asymptomatic mice by performing Rapid Murine Coma Behaviour Scale experiment (RMCBS). We performed Golgi-Cox staining to assess neuronal morphology, dendritic spine density and arborization in the brain cortex subjected to &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium berghei ANKA&lt;/em&gt; infection compared to asymptomatic, anemic and control groups. We studied the neural gene expression pattern of LIMK-1, cofilin-1 and β-actin in all the experimental groups by semi-quantitative, quantitative PCR followed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We observed significant loss of dendritic spine density, abnormal spine morphology, reduced dendritic arborization; extensive dendritic varicosities in the cortical neurons of CM infected brain. Further, these observations correlated with diminished protein levels of LIMK-1, cofilin-1, phospho-cofilin-1 and β-actin in the whole brain lysates as well as formation of actin-cofilin rods in the brain sections of mice symptomatic to CM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Overall, our findings suggest that the altered neuronal morphology and dysregulation of LIMK-1/cofilin-1 pathway could affect the cognitive outcome after experimental CM. Therefore, this study could help to establish newer therapeutic strategies aiming long-term cognitive impairment after CM. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Robust averaging protects decisions from noise in neural computations</title>

An ideal observer will give equivalent weight to sources of information that are equally reliable. However, when averaging visual information, human observers tend to downweight or discount features that are relatively outlying or deviant (‘robust averaging’). Why humans adopt an integration policy that discards important decision information remains unknown. Here, observers were asked to judge the average tilt in a circular array of high-contrast gratings, relative to an orientation boundary defined by a central reference grating. Observers showed robust averaging of orientation, but the extent to which they did so was a positive predictor of their overall performance. Using computational simulations, we show that although robust averaging is suboptimal for a perfect integrator, it paradoxically enhances performance in the presence of “late” noise, i.e. which corrupts decisions during integration. In other words, robust decision strategies increase the brain’s resilience to noise arising in neural computations during decision-making.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9-7Oog0_4kM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Towards a category theory approach to analogy: Analyzing re-representation and acquisition of numerical knowledge</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005683</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jairo A. Navarrete, Pablo Dartnell&lt;/p&gt;

Category Theory, a branch of mathematics, has shown promise as a modeling framework for higher-level cognition. We introduce an algebraic model for &lt;i&gt;analogy&lt;/i&gt; that uses the language of category theory to explore analogy-related cognitive phenomena. To illustrate the potential of this approach, we use this model to explore three objects of study in cognitive literature. First, (a) we use &lt;i&gt;commutative diagrams&lt;/i&gt; to analyze an effect of playing particular educational board games on the learning of numbers. Second, (b) we employ a notion called &lt;i&gt;coequalizer&lt;/i&gt; as a formal model of re-representation that explains a property of computational models of analogy called “flexibility” whereby non-similar representational elements are considered matches and placed in structural correspondence. Finally, (c) we build a formal learning model which shows that re-representation, language processing and analogy making can explain the acquisition of knowledge of rational numbers. These objects of study provide a picture of acquisition of numerical knowledge that is compatible with empirical evidence and offers insights on possible connections between notions such as relational knowledge, analogy, learning, conceptual knowledge, re-representation and procedural knowledge. This suggests that the approach presented here facilitates mathematical modeling of cognition and provides novel ways to think about analogy-related cognitive phenomena.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sBo6FmxKjSc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Noise correlations in the human brain and their impact on pattern classification</title>

Multivariate decoding methods, such as multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), are highly effective at extracting information from brain imaging data. Yet, the precise nature of the information that MVPA draws upon remains controversial. Most current theories emphasize the enhanced sensitivity imparted by aggregating across voxels that have mixed and weak selectivity. However, beyond the selectivity of individual voxels, neural variability is correlated across voxels, and such noise correlations may contribute importantly to accurate decoding. Indeed, a recent computational theory proposed that noise correlations enhance multivariate decoding from heterogeneous neural populations. Here we extend this theory from the scale of neurons to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and show that noise correlations between heterogeneous populations of voxels (i.e., voxels selective for different stimulus variables) contribute to the success of MVPA. Specifically, decoding performance is enhanced when voxels with high vs. low noise correlations (measured during rest or in the background of the task) are selected during classifier training. Conversely, voxels that are strongly selective for one class in a GLM or that receive high classification weights in MVPA tend to exhibit high noise correlations with voxels selective for the other class being discriminated against. Furthermore, we use simulations to show that this is a general property of fMRI data and that selectivity and noise correlations can have distinguishable influences on decoding. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that if there is signal in the data, the resulting above-chance classification accuracy is modulated by the magnitude of noise correlations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MRF7w8Pk05Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Mixed Finite Element Method to Solve the EEG Forward Problem. (arXiv:1604.05764v2 [math.NA] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05764</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05764</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Finite element methods have been shown to achieve high accuracies in
numerically solving the EEG forward problem and they enable the realistic
modeling of complex geometries and important conductive features such as
anisotropic conductivities. To date, most of the presented approaches rely on
the same underlying formulation, the continuous Galerkin (CG)-FEM. In this
article, a novel approach to solve the EEG forward problem based on a mixed
finite element method (Mixed-FEM) is introduced. To obtain the Mixed-FEM
formulation, the electric current is introduced as an additional unknown
besides the electric potential. As a consequence of this derivation, the
Mixed-FEM is, by construction, current preserving, in contrast to the CG-FEM.
Consequently, a higher simulation accuracy can be achieved in certain
scenarios, e.g., when the diameter of thin insulating structures, such as the
skull, is in the range of the mesh resolution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A theoretical derivation of the Mixed-FEM approach for EEG forward
simulations is presented, and the algorithms implemented for solving the
resulting equation systems are described. Subsequently, first evaluations in
both sphere and realistic head models are presented, and the results are
compared to previously introduced CG-FEM approaches. Additional visualizations
are shown to illustrate the current preserving property of the Mixed-FEM.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these results, it is concluded that the newly presented Mixed-FEM
can at least complement and in some scenarios even outperform the established
CG-FEM approaches, which motivates a further evaluation of the Mixed-FEM for
applications in bioelectromagnetism.

Protein design remains an important problem in computational structural biology. Current computational protein design methods largely use physics-based methods, which make use of information from a single protein structure. This is despite the fact that multiple structures of many protein folds are now readily available in the PDB. While ensemble protein design methods can use multiple protein structures, they treat each structure independently. Here, we introduce a flexible backbone strategy, FlexiBaL-GP, which learns global protein backbone movements directly from multiple protein structures. FlexiBaL-GP uses the machine learning method of Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models to learn a lower dimensional representation of the protein coordinates that best represent backbone movements. These learned backbone movements are used to explore alternative protein backbones, while engineering a protein within a parallel tempered MCMC framework. Using the human ubiquitin–USP21 complex as a model we demonstrate that our design strategy outperforms current strategies for the interface design task of identifying tight binding ubiquitin variants for USP21.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t6T6ch57tGE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In recent years, there have been many computational simulations of spontaneous neural dynamics. Here, we describe a simple model of spontaneous neural dynamics that controls an agent moving in a simple virtual environment. These dynamics generate interesting brain-environment feedback interactions that rapidly destabilize neural and behavioral dynamics demonstrating the need for homeostatic mechanisms. We investigate roles for homeostatic plasticity both locally (local inhibition adjusting to balance excitatory input) as well as more globally (regional “task negative” activity that compensates for “task positive”, sensory input in another region) balancing neural activity and leading to more stable behavior (trajectories through the environment). Our results suggest complementary functional roles for both local and macroscale mechanisms in maintaining neural and behavioral dynamics and a novel functional role for macroscopic “task-negative” patterns of activity (e.g., the default mode network).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kCaFdi-3S6Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), including emerging multi-drug resistant organisms, threaten healthcare systems worldwide. Efficient containment measures of HAIs must mobilize the entire healthcare network. Thus, to best understand how to reduce the potential scale of HAI epidemic spread, we explore patient transfer patterns in the French healthcare system. Using an exhaustive database of all hospital discharge summaries in France in 2014, we construct and analyze three patient networks based on the following: transfers of patients with HAI (HAI-specific network); patients with suspected HAI (suspected-HAI network); and all patients (general network). All three networks have heterogeneous patient flow and demonstrate small-world and scale-free characteristics. Patient populations that comprise these networks are also heterogeneous in their movement patterns. Ranking of hospitals by centrality measures and comparing community clustering using community detection algorithms shows that despite the differences in patient population, the HAI-specific and suspected-HAI networks rely on the same underlying structure as that of the general network. As a result, the general network may be more reliable in studying potential spread of HAIs. Finally, we identify transfer patterns at both the French regional and departmental (county) levels that are important in the identification of key hospital centers, patient flow trajectories, and regional clusters that may serve as a basis for novel wide-scale infection control strategies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Hha9dvbFa6M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Histologic and biochemical alterations predict pulmonary mechanical dysfunction in aging mice with chronic lung inflammation</title>

Both aging and chronic inflammation produce complex structural and biochemical alterations to the lung known to impact work of breathing. Mice deficient in surfactant protein D (Sftpd) develop progressive age-related lung pathology characterized by tissue destruction/remodeling, accumulation of foamy macrophages and alteration in surfactant composition. This study proposes to relate changes in tissue structure seen in normal aging and in chronic inflammation to altered lung mechanics using a computational model. Alterations in lung function in aging and Sftpd -/- mice have been inferred from fitting simple mechanical models to respiratory impedance data (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rs&lt;/sub&gt;), however interpretation has been confounded by the simultaneous presence of multiple coexisting pathophysiologic processes. In contrast to the inverse modeling approach, this study uses simulation from experimental measurements to recapitulate how aging and inflammation alter &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rs&lt;/sub&gt;. Histologic and mechanical measurements were made in C57BL6/J mice and congenic Sftpd-/- mice at 8, 27 and 80 weeks of age (n = 8/group). An anatomic computational model based on published airway morphometry was developed and &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rs&lt;/sub&gt; was simulated between 0.5 and 20 Hz. End expiratory pressure dependent changes in airway caliber and recruitment were estimated from mechanical measurements. Tissue elements were simulated using the constant phase model of viscoelasticity. Baseline elastance distribution was estimated in 8-week-old wild type mice, and stochastically varied for each condition based on experimentally measured alteration in elastic fiber composition, alveolar geometry and surfactant composition. Weighing reduction in model error against increasing model complexity allowed for identification of essential features underlying mechanical pathology and their contribution to &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rs&lt;/sub&gt;. Using a maximum likelihood approach, alteration in lung recruitment and diminished elastic fiber density were shown predictive of mechanical alteration at airway opening, to a greater extent than overt acinar wall destruction. Model-predicted deficits in PEEP-dependent lung recruitment correlate with altered lung lining fluid composition independent of age or genotype.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/W_PqHjUd6fU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Uncovering hidden functional brain organization by random matrix theory. (arXiv:1708.07046v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the brain, systems are organized in a modular way, serving different
functionalities. We present a novel method, based on random matrix theory, for
the detection of functional modules in neural systems. Our method can
efficiently filter out both local unit-specific noise and global system- wide
dependencies that typically obfuscate the presence of sub-structures, thus
unveiling a hidden functional structure. Using correlation-based community
detection, the method yields an optimally contrasted mesoscopic functional
structure, i.e. groups of neurons (or small brain regions) that are positively
correlated internally, while at the same time negatively correlated with each
other. The method is purely data driven and does not use any presumptions or
network representation. In an experimental dataset containing time series of
neuronal gene expression, the method detects two hidden functional modules
which are recognized as existing anatomical regions, without any prior
anatomical knowledge(, showing the potential of the method to be used on brain
data).

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fluctuations between high- and low-modularity topology in time-resolved functional connectivity. (arXiv:1511.06427v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06427</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06427</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modularity is an important topological attribute for functional brain
networks. Recent studies have reported that modularity of functional networks
varies not only across individuals being related to demographics and cognitive
performance, but also within individuals co-occurring with fluctuations in
network properties of functional connectivity, estimated over short time
intervals. However, characteristics of these time-resolved functional networks
during periods of high and low modularity have remained largely unexplored. In
this study we investigate spatiotemporal properties of time-resolved networks
in the high and low modularity periods during rest, with a particular focus on
their spatial connectivity patterns, temporal homogeneity and test-retest
reliability. We show that spatial connectivity patterns of time-resolved
networks in the high and low modularity periods are represented by increased
and decreased dissociation of the default mode network module from
task-positive network modules, respectively. We also find that the instances of
time-resolved functional connectivity sampled from within the high (low)
modularity period are relatively homogeneous (heterogeneous) over time,
indicating that during the low modularity period the default mode network
interacts with other networks in a variable manner. We confirmed that the
occurrence of the high and low modularity periods varies across individuals
with moderate inter-session test-retest reliability and that it is correlated
with previously-reported individual differences in the modularity of functional
connectivity estimated over longer timescales. Our findings illustrate how
time-resolved functional networks are spatiotemporally organized during periods
of high and low modularity, allowing one to trace individual differences in
long-timescale modularity to the variable occurrence of network configurations
at shorter timescales.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Deciphering HLA-I motifs across HLA peptidomes improves neo-antigen predictions and identifies allostery regulating HLA specificity</title>

The precise identification of Human Leukocyte Antigen class I (HLA-I) binding motifs plays a central role in our ability to understand and predict (neo-)antigen presentation in infectious diseases and cancer. Here, by exploiting co-occurrence of HLA-I alleles across ten newly generated as well as forty public HLA peptidomics datasets comprising more than 115,000 unique peptides, we show that we can rapidly and accurately identify many HLA-I binding motifs and map them to their corresponding alleles without any &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; knowledge of HLA-I binding specificity. Our approach recapitulates and refines known motifs for 43 of the most frequent alleles, uncovers new motifs for 9 alleles that up to now had less than five known ligands and provides a scalable framework to incorporate additional HLA peptidomics studies in the future. The refined motifs improve neo-antigen and cancer testis antigen predictions, indicating that unbiased HLA peptidomics data are ideal for &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; predictions of neo-antigens from tumor exome sequencing data. The new motifs further reveal distant modulation of the binding specificity at P2 for some HLA-I alleles by residues in the HLA-I binding site but outside of the B-pocket and we unravel the underlying mechanisms by protein structure analysis, mutagenesis and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; binding assays.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PyX3xsSmxSk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Distortion Distribution of Neural Spike Train Sequence Matching with Optogenetics. (arXiv:1708.06641v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06641</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper uses a simple optogenetic model to compare the timing distortion
between a randomly-generated target spike sequence and an externally-stimulated
neuron spike sequence. Optogenetics is an emerging field of neuroscience where
neurons are genetically modified to express light-sensitive receptors that
enable external control over when the neurons fire. Given the prominence of
neuronal signaling within the brain and throughout the body, optogenetics has
significant potential to improve the understanding of the nervous system and to
develop treatments for neurological diseases. This paper primarily considers
two different distortion measures. The first measure is the delay in
externally-stimulated spikes. The second measure is the root mean square error
between the filtered outputs of the target and stimulated spike sequences. The
mean and the distribution of the distortion is derived in closed form when the
target sequence generation rate is sufficiently low. All derived results are
supported with simulations. This work is a step towards an analytical model to
predict whether different spike trains were observed from the same stimulus,
and the broader goal of understanding the quantity and reliability of
information that can be carried by neurons.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Correlated disorder in myelinated axons orientational geometry and structure. (arXiv:1708.06597v2 [q-bio.QM] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While the ultrastructure of the myelin has been considered to be a
quasi-crystalline stable system, nowadays its multiscale complex dynamics
appears to play a key role for its functionality, degeneration and repair
processes following neurological diseases and trauma. In this work, we have
investigated the axons interactions associated to the nerve functionality,
measuring the spatial distribution of the orientational fluctuations of axons
in a Xenopus Laevis sciatic nerve. At this aim, we have used Scanning micro
X-ray Diffraction (SmXRD), a non-invasive already applied to other
heterogeneous systems presenting complex geometries from microscale to
nanoscale. We have found that the orientational spatial fluctuations of fresh
axons show a correlated disorder described by Levy flight distribution. Thus,
we have studied how this correlated disorder evolves during the degeneration of
the nerve. Our results show that the spatial distribution of axons
orientational fluctuations in unfresh, aged nerve loose the correlated disorder
assuming a randomly disordered behaviour. This work allows a deeper
understanding of nerve states and paves the way to study other materials and
biomaterials with the same technique to detect and to characterize their states
and supramolecular structure, associated with dynamic structural changes at the
nanoscale and mesoscale.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: EEG-based Intention Recognition from Spatio-Temporal Representations via Cascade and Parallel Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks. (arXiv:1708.06578v1 [cs.HC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06578</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a system empowering humans to communicate
with or control the outside world with exclusively brain intentions.
Electroencephalography (EEG) based BCIs are promising solutions due to their
convenient and portable instruments. Motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG) is a kind of
most widely focused EEG signals, which reveals a subjects movement intentions
without actual actions. Despite the extensive research of MI-EEG in recent
years, it is still challenging to interpret EEG signals effectively due to the
massive noises in EEG signals (e.g., low signal noise ratio and incomplete EEG
signals), and difficulties in capturing the inconspicuous relationships between
EEG signals and certain brain activities. Most existing works either only
consider EEG as chain-like sequences neglecting complex dependencies between
adjacent signals or performing simple temporal averaging over EEG sequences. In
this paper, we introduce both cascade and parallel convolutional recurrent
neural network models for precisely identifying human intended movements by
effectively learning compositional spatio-temporal representations of raw EEG
streams. The proposed models grasp the spatial correlations between physically
neighboring EEG signals by converting the chain like EEG sequences into a 2D
mesh like hierarchy. An LSTM based recurrent network is able to extract the
subtle temporal dependencies of EEG data streams. Extensive experiments on a
large-scale MI-EEG dataset (108 subjects, 3,145,160 EEG records) have
demonstrated that both models achieve high accuracy near 98.3% and outperform a
set of baseline methods and most recent deep learning based EEG recognition
models, yielding a significant accuracy increase of 18% in the cross-subject
validation scenario.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Based on the visceral theory of sleep by I.N. Pigarev, we hypothesize that
mental illnesses are caused due to errors in the commutation of external and
internal information flows in the brain. As a consequence of these errors,
visceral information is constantly present in the cerebral cortex and during
wakefulness, on the one hand, is misinterpreted as coming from the outside
world, and on the other hand creates a persistent noise overload in
exteroceptive (visual and auditory) and proprioceptive channels leading in a
long run to the over-strain and malfunction of the adaptive mechanisms of the
brain.

	<description>Amputees who wish to rid themselves of a phantom limb must weaken the neural representation of the absent limb. Conversely, amputees who wish to replace a lost limb must assimilate a neuroprosthetic with the existing neural representation. Whether we wish to remove a phantom limb or assimilate a synthetic one, we will benefit from knowing more about the developmental process that enables embodiment. A potentially critical contributor to that process is the spontaneous activity – in the form of limb twitches – that occurs exclusively and abundantly during active (REM) sleep, a particularly prominent state in early development.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Temperature manipulation of neuronal dynamics in a forebrain motor control nucleus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005699</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Matías A. Goldin, Gabriel B. Mindlin&lt;/p&gt;

Different neuronal types within brain motor areas contribute to the generation of complex motor behaviors. A widely studied songbird forebrain nucleus (HVC) has been recognized as fundamental in shaping the precise timing characteristics of birdsong. This is based, among other evidence, on the stretching and the “breaking” of song structure when HVC is cooled. However, little is known about the temperature effects that take place in its neurons. To address this, we investigated the dynamics of HVC both experimentally and computationally. We developed a technique where simultaneous electrophysiological recordings were performed during temperature manipulation of HVC. We recorded spontaneous activity and found three effects: widening of the spike shape, decrease of the firing rate and change in the interspike interval distribution. All these effects could be explained with a detailed conductance based model of all the neurons present in HVC. Temperature dependence of the ionic channel time constants explained the first effect, while the second was based in the changes of the maximal conductance using single synaptic excitatory inputs. The last phenomenon, only emerged after introducing a more realistic synaptic input to the inhibitory interneurons. Two timescales were present in the interspike distributions. The behavior of one timescale was reproduced with different input balances received form the excitatory neurons, whereas the other, which disappears with cooling, could not be found assuming poissonian synaptic inputs. Furthermore, the computational model shows that the bursting of the excitatory neurons arises naturally at normal brain temperature and that they have an intrinsic delay at low temperatures. The same effect occurs at single synapses, which may explain song stretching. These findings shed light on the temperature dependence of neuronal dynamics and present a comprehensive framework to study neuronal connectivity. This study, which is based on intrinsic neuronal characteristics, may help to understand emergent behavioral changes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mXYitYBBMvs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dopamine transporter imaging deficit predicts early transition to synucleinopathy in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25026</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25026</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To determine the usefulness of dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging to identify idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (IRBD) patients at risk for short-term development of clinically-defined synucleinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Eighty-seven patients with polysomnography-confirmed IRBD underwent &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I-FP-CIT DAT-SPECT. Results were compared with 20 matched controls without RBD who underwent DAT-SPECT. In patients, FP-CIT uptake was considered abnormal when values were two standard deviations below controls' mean uptake. After DAT-SPECT, patients were followed-up during 5.7 ± 2.2 (range, 2.6-9.9) years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Baseline DAT deficit was found in 51 (58.6%) patients. During follow-up 25 (28.7%) subjects developed clinically-defined synucleinopathy (Parkinson disease in 11, dementia with Lewy bodies in 13, multiple system atrophy in one) with mean latency of 3.2 ± 1.9 years from imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed increased risk of incident synucleinopathy in patients with abnormal DAT-SPECT than with normal DAT-SPECT (20% vs. 6% at three years, 33% vs. 18% at five years; log rank test, p=0.006).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Receiver operating characteristics curve revealed that reduction of FP-CIT uptake in putamen greater than 25% discriminated patients with DAT deficit who developed synucleinopathy from patients with DAT deficit that remained disease-free after three years of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 5-year follow-up, DAT-SPECT had 75% sensitivity, 51% specificity, 44% positive predictive value, 80% negative predictive value, and like-hood ratio 1.54 to predict synucleinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: DAT-SPECT identifies IRBD patients at short-term risk for synucleinopathy. Decreased FP-CIT putamen uptake greater than 25% predicts synucleinopathy after three years follow-up. These observations may be useful to select candidates for disease-modification trials in IRBD.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25006-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present study, we aimed to investigate depth electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in a large cohort of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and to focus on interictal very high-frequency oscillations (VHFOs) between 500Hz and 2kHz. We hypothesized that interictal VHFOs are more specific biomarkers for epileptogenic zone compared to traditional HFOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25006-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty patients with focal epilepsy who underwent presurgical stereo-EEG (SEEG) were included in the study. SEEG data were recorded with a sampling rate of 25kHz, and a 30-minute resting period was analyzed for each patient. Ten patients met selected criteria for analyses of correlations with surgical outcome: detection of interictal ripples (Rs), fast ripples (FRs), and VHFOs; resective surgery; and at least 1 year of postoperative follow-up. Using power envelope computation and visual inspection of power distribution matrixes, electrode contacts with HFOs and VHFOs were detected and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25006-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interictal very fast ripples (VFRs; 500–1,000Hz) were detected in 23 of 40 patients and ultrafast ripples (UFRs; 1,000–2,000Hz) in almost half of investigated subjects (n = 19). VFRs and UFRs were observed only in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and were recorded exclusively from mesiotemporal structures. The UFRs were more spatially restricted in the brain than lower-frequency HFOs. When compared to R oscillations, significantly better outcomes were observed in patients with a higher percentage of removed contacts containing FRs, VFRs, and UFRs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25006-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interictal VHFOs are relatively frequent abnormal phenomena in patients with epilepsy, and appear to be more specific biomarkers for epileptogenic zone when compared to traditional HFOs.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Body weight is a robust predictor of clinical progression in Huntington disease</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unintended weight loss is a hallmark of Huntington disease (HD), but it is unknown to what extent weight loss impacts the rate of disease progression. Therefore, using longitudinal data from the Enroll-HD study, we assessed the association between baseline body mass index (BMI) and the rate of clinical progression in 5,821 HD mutation carriers. We found that high baseline BMI was associated with a significantly slower rate of functional, motor, and cognitive deterioration (all &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), independent of mutant &lt;em&gt;HTT&lt;/em&gt; CAG repeat size. Our findings provide strong rationale for exploration of systemic metabolism as a therapeutic target in HD. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Opto-magnetic imaging of neural network activity in brain slices at high resolution using color centers in diamond. (arXiv:1708.06158v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06158</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06158</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We suggest a novel approach for wide-field imaging of the neural network
dynamics of brain slices that uses highly sensitivity magnetometry based on
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. In-vitro recordings in brain slices
is a proven method for the characterization of electrical neural activity and
has strongly contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms that govern
neural information processing. However, traditional recordings can only acquire
signals from a few positions simultaneously, which severely limits their
ability to characterize the dynamics of the underlying neural networks. We
suggest to radically extend the scope of this method using the wide-field
imaging of the neural magnetic fields across the slice by means of NV
magnetometry. Employing comprehensive computational simulations and theoretical
analyses, we characterize the spatiotemporal characteristics of the neural
magnetic fields and derive the required key performance parameters of an
imaging setup based on NV magnetometry. In particular, we determine how the
technical parameters determine the achievable spatial resolution for an optimal
reconstruction of the neural currents from the measured field distributions.
Finally, we compare the imaging of neural slice activity with that of a single
planar pyramidal cell. Our results suggest that imaging of neural slice
activity will be possible with the upcoming generation of NV magnetic field
sensors, while imaging of the activity of a single planar cell remains more
challenging.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Innovations orthogonalization: a solution to the major pitfalls of EEG/MEG &quot;leakage correction&quot;. (arXiv:1708.05931v2 [stat.ME] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05931</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05931</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The problem of interest here is the study of brain functional and effective
connectivity based on non-invasive EEG-MEG inverse solution time series. These
signals generally have low spatial resolution, such that an estimated signal at
any one site is an instantaneous linear mixture of the true, actual, unobserved
signals across all cortical sites. False connectivity can result from analysis
of these low-resolution signals. Recent efforts toward &quot;unmixing&quot; have been
developed, under the name of &quot;leakage correction&quot;. One recent noteworthy
approach is that by Colclough et al (2015 NeuroImage, 117:439-448), which
forces the inverse solution signals to have zero cross-correlation at lag zero.
One goal is to show that Colclough's method produces false human connectomes
under very broad conditions. The second major goal is to develop a new
solution, that appropriately &quot;unmixes&quot; the inverse solution signals, based on
innovations orthogonalization. The new method first fits a multivariate
autoregression to the inverse solution signals, giving the mixed innovations.
Second, the mixed innovations are orthogonalized. Third, the mixed and
orthogonalized innovations allow the estimation of the &quot;unmixing&quot; matrix, which
is then finally used to &quot;unmix&quot; the inverse solution signals. It is shown that
under very broad conditions, the new method produces proper human connectomes,
even when the signals are not generated by an autoregressive model.

	<description>To date, studies have demonstrated the dynamic influence of exogenous environmental stimuli on multiple regions of the brain. This environmental influence positively and negatively impacts programs governing myelination, and acts on myelinating oligodendrocyte (OL) cells across the human lifespan. Developmentally, environmental manipulation of OL progenitor cells (OPCs) has profound effects on the establishment of functional cognitive, sensory, and motor programs. Furthermore, central nervous system (CNS) myelin remains an adaptive entity in adulthood, sensitive to environmentally induced structural changes.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Remo Monti, Iros Barozzi, Marco Osterwalder, Elizabeth Lee, Momoe Kato, Tyler H. Garvin, Ingrid Plajzer-Frick, Catherine S. Pickle, Jennifer A. Akiyama, Veena Afzal, Niko Beerenwinkel, Diane E. Dickel, Axel Visel, Len A. Pennacchio&lt;/p&gt;

Epigenomic mapping of enhancer-associated chromatin modifications facilitates the genome-wide discovery of tissue-specific enhancers &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. However, reliance on single chromatin marks leads to high rates of false-positive predictions. More sophisticated, integrative methods have been described, but commonly suffer from limited accessibility to the resulting predictions and reduced biological interpretability. Here we present the Limb Enhancer Genie (LEG), a collection of highly accurate, genome-wide predictions of enhancers in the developing limb, available through a user-friendly online interface. We predict limb enhancers using a combination of &amp;gt;50 published limb-specific datasets and clusters of evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding sites, taking advantage of the patterns observed at previously &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; validated elements. By combining different statistical models, our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and provides interpretable measures of feature importance. Our results indicate that including a previously unappreciated score that quantifies tissue-specific nuclease accessibility significantly improves prediction performance. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; validation of newly predicted elements. Moreover, we describe general features that can guide the type of datasets to include when predicting tissue-specific enhancers genome-wide, while providing an accessible resource to the general biological community and facilitating the functional interpretation of genetic studies of limb malformations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Tbw5zd-eLMc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Type 1 Serine/Threonine Kinase Receptors (STKR1) transduce a wide spectrum of biological signals mediated by TGF-β superfamily members. The STKR1 activity is tightly controlled by their regulatory glycine-serine rich (GS) domain adjacent to the kinase domain. Despite decades of studies, it remains unknown how physiological or pathological GS domain modifications are coupled to STKR1 kinase activity. Here, by performing molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculation of Activin-Like Kinase 2 (ALK2), we found that GS domain phosphorylation, FKBP12 dissociation, and disease mutations all destabilize a D354-R375 salt-bridge, which normally acts as an electrostatic lock to prevent coordination of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the catalytic site. We developed a WAFEX-guided principal analysis and unraveled how phosphorylation destabilizes this highly conserved salt-bridge in temporal and physical space. Using current-flow betweenness scores, we identified an allosteric network of residue-residue contacts between the GS domain and the catalytic site that controls the formation and disruption of this salt bridge. Importantly, our novel network analysis approach revealed how certain disease-causing mutations bypass FKBP12-mediated kinase inhibition to produce leaky signaling in the absence of ligand. We further provide experimental evidence that this salt-bridge lock exists in other STKR1s, and acts as a general safety mechanism in STKR1 to prevent pathological leaky signaling. In summary, our study provides a compelling and unifying allosteric activation mechanism in STKR1 kinases that reconciles a large number of experimental studies and sheds light on a novel therapeutic avenue to target disease-related STKR1 mutants.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KkneVn381dc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Host population structure impedes reversion to drug sensitivity after discontinuation of treatment</title>

Intense use of antibiotics for the treatment of diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; or gonorrhea has led to rapidly increasing population levels of drug resistance. This has generally necessitated a switch to new drugs and the discontinuation of older ones, after which resistance often only declines slowly or even persists indefinitely. These long-term effects are usually ascribed to low fitness costs of resistance in absence of the drug. Here we show that structure in the host population, in particular heterogeneity in number of contacts, also plays an important role in the reversion dynamics. Host contact structure acts both during the phase of intense treatment, leading to non-random distributions of the resistant strain among the infected population, and after the discontinuation of the drug, by affecting the competition dynamics resulting in a mitigation of fitness advantages. As a consequence, we observe both a lower rate of reversion and a lower probability that reversion to sensitivity on the population level occurs after treatment is stopped. Our simulations show that the impact of heterogeneity in the host structure is maximal in the biologically most plausible parameter range, namely when fitness costs of resistance are small.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aEDhdmGO1Us&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A major force contributing to the emergence of novelty in nature is the presence of cooperative interactions, where two or more components of a system act in synergy, sometimes leading to higher-order, emergent phenomena. Within molecular evolution, the so called &lt;i&gt;hypercycle&lt;/i&gt; defines the simplest model of an autocatalytic cycle, providing major theoretical insights on the evolution of cooperation in the early biosphere. These closed cooperative loops have also inspired our understanding of how catalytic loops appear in ecological systems. In both cases, hypercycle and ecological cooperative loops, the role played by space seems to be crucial for their stability and resilience against parasites. However, it is difficult to test these ideas in natural ecosystems, where time and spatial scales introduce considerable limitations. Here, we use engineered bacteria as a model system to a variety of environmental scenarios identifying trends that transcend the specific model system, such an enhanced genetic diversity in environments requiring mutualistic interactions. Interestingly, we show that improved environments can slow down mutualistic range expansions as a result of genetic drift effects preceding local resource depletion. Moreover, we show that a parasitic strain is excluded from the population during range expansions (which acknowledges a classical prediction). Nevertheless, environmental deterioration can reshape population interactions, this same strain becoming part of a three-species mutualistic web in scenarios in which the two-strain mutualism becomes non functional. The evolutionary and ecological implications for the design of synthetic ecosystems are outlined.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-lmZyb2t8MA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Neuron’s eye view: Inferring features of complex stimuli from neural responses</title>

Experiments that study neural encoding of stimuli at the level of individual neurons typically choose a small set of features present in the world—contrast and luminance for vision, pitch and intensity for sound—and assemble a stimulus set that systematically varies along these dimensions. Subsequent analysis of neural responses to these stimuli typically focuses on regression models, with experimenter-controlled features as predictors and spike counts or firing rates as responses. Unfortunately, this approach requires knowledge in advance about the relevant features coded by a given population of neurons. For domains as complex as social interaction or natural movement, however, the relevant feature space is poorly understood, and an arbitrary &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; choice of features may give rise to confirmation bias. Here, we present a Bayesian model for exploratory data analysis that is capable of automatically identifying the features present in unstructured stimuli based solely on neuronal responses. Our approach is unique within the class of latent state space models of neural activity in that it assumes that firing rates of neurons are sensitive to multiple discrete time-varying features tied to the &lt;i&gt;stimulus&lt;/i&gt;, each of which has Markov (or semi-Markov) dynamics. That is, we are modeling neural activity as driven by multiple simultaneous stimulus features rather than intrinsic neural dynamics. We derive a fast variational Bayesian inference algorithm and show that it correctly recovers hidden features in synthetic data, as well as ground-truth stimulus features in a prototypical neural dataset. To demonstrate the utility of the algorithm, we also apply it to cluster neural responses and demonstrate successful recovery of features corresponding to monkeys and faces in the image set.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/y_WuW3DO4Dw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Insufficient sleep: Enhanced risk-seeking relates to low local sleep intensity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25023</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Chronic sleep restriction is highly prevalent in modern society and is in its clinical form, insufficient sleep syndrome, one of the most prevalent diagnoses in clinical sleep laboratories, with substantial negative impact on health and community burden. It reflects every-day sleep loss better than acute sleep deprivation, but its effects and particularly the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown for a variety of critical cognitive domains, as for example risky decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We assessed financial risk-taking behavior after 7 consecutive nights of sleep restriction and after one night of acute sleep deprivation compared to a regular sleep condition in a within-subject design. We further investigated potential underlying mechanisms of sleep loss induced changes in behavior by high-density electroencephalography recordings during restricted sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We show that chronic sleep restriction increases risk-seeking, while this was not observed after acute sleep deprivation. This increase was subjectively not noticed and was related to locally lower values of slow wave energy during preceding sleep, an electrophysiological marker of sleep intensity and restoration, in electrodes over the right prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: This study provides for the first time evidence that insufficient sleep restoration over circumscribed cortical areas leads to aberrant behavior. In chronically sleep restricted subjects, low slow wave sleep intensity over the right prefrontal cortex - which has been shown to be linked to risk behavior – may lead to increased and subjectively unnoticed risk-seeking.

CSF tau levels were compared between groups and correlated with digital histology measurement of postmortem tau pathology averaged from three cerebral regions (angular gyrus, mid-frontal cortex, and anterior cingulate gyrus). Multivariate linear regression tested the association of ante mortem CSF tau levels with postmortem tau pathology adjusting for demographics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

After excluding patients with coincident AD-associated tau pathology accompanying sporadic FTLD, we found lower CSF phosphorylated tau levels in the TDP-43 group (median = 7.4pg/ml; interquartile range [IQR] = 6.0, 12.3; n = 26) compared to the tauopathy group (median = 12.5pg/ml; IQR = 10.7, 15.0; n = 23; Z = 2.6; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In vivo detection of AD copathology in sporadic FTLD patients may help stratify clinical cohorts with pure neuropathology in which low CSF phosphorylated-tau levels may have diagnostic utility to distinguish TDP-43 proteinopathy from tauopathy. Autopsy-confirmed samples are critical for FTLD biomarker development and validation. Ann Neurol 2017;82:247–258&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Our work focuses on the stability, resilience, and response to perturbation of the bacterial communities in the human gut. Informative flash flood-like disturbances that eliminate most gastrointestinal biomass can be induced using a clinically-relevant iso-osmotic agent. We designed and executed such a disturbance in human volunteers using a dense longitudinal sampling scheme extending before and after induced diarrhea. This experiment has enabled a careful multidomain analysis of a controlled perturbation of the human gut microbiota with a new level of resolution. These new longitudinal multidomain data were analyzed using recently developed statistical methods that demonstrate improvements over current practices. By imposing sparsity constraints we have enhanced the interpretability of the analyses and by employing a new adaptive generalized principal components analysis, incorporated modulated phylogenetic information and enhanced interpretation through scoring of the portions of the tree most influenced by the perturbation. Our analyses leverage the taxa-sample duality in the data to show how the gut microbiota recovers following this perturbation. Through a holistic approach that integrates phylogenetic, metagenomic and abundance information, we elucidate patterns of taxonomic and functional change that characterize the community recovery process across individuals. We provide complete code and illustrations of new sparse statistical methods for high-dimensional, longitudinal multidomain data that provide greater interpretability than existing methods.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bi_0OACHraE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Efficient and accurate causal inference with hidden confounders from genome-transcriptome variation data</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Lingfei Wang, Tom Michoel&lt;/p&gt;

Mapping gene expression as a quantitative trait using whole genome-sequencing and transcriptome analysis allows to discover the functional consequences of genetic variation. We developed a novel method and ultra-fast software Findr for higly accurate causal inference between gene expression traits using cis-regulatory DNA variations as causal anchors, which improves current methods by taking into consideration hidden confounders and weak regulations. Findr outperformed existing methods on the DREAM5 Systems Genetics challenge and on the prediction of microRNA and transcription factor targets in human lymphoblastoid cells, while being nearly a million times faster. Findr is publicly available at https://github.com/lingfeiwang/findr.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jwKwMNrRg0w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Extracting replicable associations across multiple studies: Empirical Bayes algorithms for controlling the false discovery rate</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005700</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/YRu4NDFR8Wk/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by David Amar, Ron Shamir, Daniel Yekutieli&lt;/p&gt;

In almost every field in genomics, large-scale biomedical datasets are used to report associations. Extracting associations that recur across multiple studies while controlling the false discovery rate is a fundamental challenge. Here, we propose a new method to allow joint analysis of multiple studies. Given a set of p-values obtained from each study, the goal is to identify associations that recur in at least &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 1 studies while controlling the false discovery rate. We propose several new algorithms that differ in how the study dependencies are modeled, and compare them and extant methods under various simulated scenarios. The top algorithm, SCREEN (Scalable Cluster-based REplicability ENhancement), is our new algorithm that works in three stages: (1) clustering an estimated correlation network of the studies, (2) learning replicability (e.g., of genes) within clusters, and (3) merging the results across the clusters. When we applied SCREEN to two real datasets it greatly outperformed the results obtained via standard meta-analysis. First, on a collection of 29 case-control gene expression cancer studies, we detected a large set of consistently up-regulated genes related to proliferation and cell cycle regulation. These genes are both consistently up-regulated across many cancer studies, and are well connected in known gene networks. Second, on a recent pan-cancer study that examined the expression profiles of patients with and without mutations in the HLA complex, we detected a large active module of up-regulated genes that are both related to immune responses and are well connected in known gene networks. This module covers thrice more genes as compared to the original study at a similar false discovery rate, demonstrating the high power of SCREEN. An implementation of SCREEN is available in the supplement.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YRu4NDFR8Wk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>In physiological conditions, adult neurons have low intracellular Cl− [(Cl−)I] levels underlying the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibitory drive. In contrast, neurons have high (Cl−)I levels and excitatory GABA actions in a wide range of pathological conditions including spinal cord lesions, chronic pain, brain trauma, cerebrovascular infarcts, autism, Rett and Down syndrome, various types of epilepsies, and other genetic or environmental insults. The diuretic highly specific NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist bumetanide (PubChem CID: 2461) efficiently restores low (Cl−)I levels and attenuates many disorders in experimental conditions and in some clinical trials.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Seizing Control of KCC2: A New Therapeutic Target for Epilepsy</title>

	<description>Deficits in GABAergic inhibition result in the abnormal neuronal activation and synchronization that underlies seizures. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for transforming a normal brain into an epileptic one remain largely unknown. Hyperpolarizing inhibition mediated by type A GABA (GABAA) receptors is dependent on chloride extrusion by the neuron-specific type 2K+–Cl− cotransporter (KCC2). Loss-of-function mutations in KCC2 are a known cause of infantile epilepsy in humans and KCC2 dysfunction is present in patients with both idiopathic and acquired epilepsy.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Neurons have diverse molecular, morphological, connectional and functional properties. We believe that the only realistic way to manage this complexity — and thereby pave the way for understanding the structure, function and development of brain circuits — is to group neurons into types, which can &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used antidepressants; however, their mechanism of action is elusive. The authors here show that activation of serotonin 5-HT1B receptors on cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons (CCK neurons) in the dentate gyrus underlies the effects of acute SSRI treatment on &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuronal loss is a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD), but the mechanisms through which the neurons die are unclear. Here, the authors described evidence for the activation of necroptosis — a programmed form of necrosis that has been implicated in multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functional connectivity analyses of group data have revealed several large-scale distributed brain networks, including the default network (DN), frontoparietal control network (FPN) and dorsal attention network (dATN); however, few studies have examined network organization within individual subjects. The authors performed multiple functional MRI scans in &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuropathic pain is a common adverse effect of chemotherapeutic agents, such as oxaliplatin. The authors here showed that antibiotic-mediated eradication of the gut microbiota protects mice against both oxaliplatin-induced inflammation in the dorsal root ganglia and mechanical hyperalgesia. The permissive effect of the gut microbiota &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The likelihood of winning a bout of competitive behaviour is increased by past wins, and the neural circuitry underlying this crucial determinant of social rank in a group of mice is identified as a projection from the mediodorsal thalamus to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Acute or Chronic? A Stressful Question</title>

	<description>Stress is a primary risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders; at times, even a single trauma can trigger psychopathology. Many rodent models of neuropsychiatric disorders use chronic stress, measuring readouts at the end of long protocols. In a way, traditional chronic models overlook a crucial question: how does the physiological response to stressor(s) turn into a maladaptive pathway that may verge towards psychopathology? Recent evidence suggests that studying the long-term consequences of acute stress would provide critical information on the role of stress in psychopathology.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is associated with neurological disorders of both the CNS and peripheral nervous systems (PNS), yet few studies have directly examined PNS infection. Here we show that intraperitoneally or intraventricularly injected ZIKV in the mouse can infect and impact peripheral neurons in vivo. Moreover, ZIKV productively infects stem-cell-derived human neural crest cells and peripheral neurons in vitro, leading to increased cell death, transcriptional dysregulation and cell-type-specific molecular pathology.&lt;/p&gt;
