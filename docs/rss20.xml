	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States carries a substantial fiscal burden resulting from the nearly 100 million Americans with neurological disease. The combined annual costs of Alzheimer's and other dementias, low back pain, stroke, traumatic brain injury, migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury and Parkinson's disease totals nearly 800 billion dollars and is rapidly rising due to the aging of the U.S. population. We provide a summary overview of the substantial current and future economic impact of neurological disease, and provide an action plan for reducing this burden through neurological research and enhanced clinical management of neurological disorders in the United States.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Depth-dependent flow and pressure characteristics in cortical microvascular networks</title>

A better knowledge of the flow and pressure distribution in realistic microvascular networks is needed for improving our understanding of neurovascular coupling mechanisms and the related measurement techniques. Here, numerical simulations with discrete tracking of red blood cells (RBCs) are performed in three realistic microvascular networks from the mouse cerebral cortex. Our analysis is based on trajectories of individual RBCs and focuses on layer-specific flow phenomena until a cortical depth of 1 mm. The individual RBC trajectories reveal that in the capillary bed RBCs preferentially move in plane. Hence, the capillary flow field shows laminar patterns and a layer-specific analysis is valid. We demonstrate that for RBCs entering the capillary bed close to the cortical surface (&amp;lt; 400 μm) the largest pressure drop takes place in the capillaries (37%), while for deeper regions arterioles are responsible for 61% of the total pressure drop. Further flow characteristics, such as capillary transit time or RBC velocity, also vary significantly over cortical depth. Comparison of purely topological characteristics with flow-based ones shows that a combined interpretation of topology and flow is indispensable. Our results provide evidence that it is crucial to consider layer-specific differences for all investigations related to the flow and pressure distribution in the cortical vasculature. These findings support the hypothesis that for an efficient oxygen up-regulation at least two regulation mechanisms must be playing hand in hand, namely cerebral blood flow increase and microvascular flow homogenization. However, the contribution of both regulation mechanisms to oxygen up-regulation likely varies over depth.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IVRfueS8eW0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mathematical models of tissue stem and transit target cell divisions and the risk of radiation- or smoking-associated cancer</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005391</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/4OwAkAkyDh8/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Mark P. Little, Jolyon H. Hendry&lt;/p&gt;

There is compelling biological data to suggest that cancer arises from a series of mutations in single target cells, resulting in defects in cell renewal and differentiation processes which lead to malignancy. Because much mutagenic damage is expressed following cell division, more-rapidly renewing tissues could be at higher risk because of the larger number of cell replications. Cairns suggested that renewing tissues may reduce cancer risk by partitioning the dividing cell populations into lineages comprising infrequently-dividing long-lived stem cells and frequently-dividing short-lived daughter transit cells. We develop generalizations of three recent cancer-induction models that account for the joint maintenance and renewal of stem and transit cells, also competing processes of partially transformed cell proliferation and differentiation/apoptosis. We are particularly interested in using these models to separately assess the probabilities of mutation and development of cancer associated with “spontaneous” processes and with those linked to a specific environmental mutagen, specifically ionizing radiation or cigarette smoking. All three models demonstrate substantial variation in cancer risks, by at least 20 orders of magnitude, depending on the assumed number of critical mutations required for cancer, and the stem-cell and transition-cell mutation rates. However, in most cases the conditional probabilities of cancer being mutagen-induced range between 7–96%. The relative risks associated with mutagen exposure compared to background rates are also stable, ranging from 1.0–16.0. Very few cancers, generally &amp;lt;0.5%, arise from mutations occurring solely in stem cells rather than in a combination of stem and transit cells. However, for cancers with 2 or 3 critical mutations, a substantial proportion of cancers, in some cases 100%, have at least one mutation derived from a mutated stem cell. Little difference is made to relative risks if competing processes of proliferation and differentiation in the partially transformed stem and transit cell population are allowed for, nor is any difference made if one assumes that transit cells require an extra mutation to confer malignancy from the number required by stem cells. The probability of a cancer being mutagen-induced correlates across cancer sites with the estimated cumulative number of stem cell divisions in the associated tissue (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), although in some cases there is sensitivity of findings to removal of high-leverage outliers and in some cases only modest variation in probability, but these issues do not affect the validity of the findings. There are no significant correlations (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;0.3) between lifetime cancer-site specific radiation risk and the probability of that cancer being mutagen-induced. These results do not depend on the assumed critical number of mutations leading to cancer, or on the assumed mutagen-associated mutation rate, within the generally-accepted ranges tested. However, there are borderline significant negative correlations (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.08) between the smoking-associated mortality rate difference (current vs former smokers) and the probability of cancer being mutagen-induced. This is only the case where values of the critical number of mutations leading to cancer, &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;, is 3 or 4 and not for smaller values (1 or 2), but does not strongly depend on the assumed mutagen-associated mutation rate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4OwAkAkyDh8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Class-switch recombination (CSR) alters the Ig isotype to diversify antibody effector functions. IgD CSR is a rare event, and its regulation is poorly understood. We report that deficiency of 53BP1, a DNA damage-response protein, caused age-dependent overproduction of secreted IgD resulting from increased IgD CSR exclusively within B cells of...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/M-Wj1WEf7mk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>The genital mucosa is a barrier that is constantly exposed to a variety of pathogens, allergens, and external stimuli. Although both allergen exposure and parasite infections frequently occur in the genital area, the mechanism by which immune responses—particularly type 2 immunity—are induced has rarely been studied in the genital mucosa....&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/L-EGpD-hWyA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Memory CD8+ T cells confer long-term immunity against tumors, and anticancer vaccines therefore should maximize their generation. Multiple memory CD8+ T-cell subsets with distinct functional and homing characteristics exist, but the signaling pathways that regulate their development are ill defined. Here we examined the role of the serine/threonine kinase Akt...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/jZX-kxjidQs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24883-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We enrolled 33 patients with a referral diagnosis of Ohtahara syndrome or early myoclonic encephalopathy without malformations of cortical development. We performed detailed phenotypic assessment including seizure presentation, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging. We confirmed burst suppression in 28 of 33 patients. Research-based exome sequencing was performed for patients without a previously identified molecular diagnosis from clinical evaluation or a research-based epilepsy gene panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In 3 of 5 (60%) patients without confirmed early burst suppression, we identified variants predicted to be pathogenic in &lt;em&gt;STXBP1&lt;/em&gt; (n = 2) and &lt;em&gt;SCN2A&lt;/em&gt; (n = 1). The patient with the homozygous &lt;em&gt;PNPO&lt;/em&gt; variant had a low cerebrospinal fluid pyridoxal-5-phosphate level. Otherwise, no early laboratory or clinical features distinguished the cases associated with pathogenic variants in specific genes from each other or from those with no prior genetic cause identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e22177</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Memories for recent experiences are rich in incidental detail, but with time the brain is thought to extract latent rules and structures common across past experiences. We show that over weeks following the acquisition of two distinct associative memories, neuron firing in the rat prelimbic prefrontal cortex (mPFC) became less selective for perceptual features unique to each association and, with an apparently different time-course, became more selective for common relational features. We further found that during exposure to a novel experimental context, memory expression and neuron selectivity for relational features immediately generalized to the new situation. These neural patterns offer a window into the network-level processes by which the mPFC develops a knowledge structure of the world that can be adaptively applied to new experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Speed and segmentation control mechanisms characterized in rhythmically-active circuits created from spinal neurons produced from genetically-tagged embryonic stem cells</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Flexible neural networks, such as the interconnected spinal neurons that control distinct motor actions, can switch their activity to produce different behaviors. Both excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) spinal neurons are necessary for motor behavior, but the influence of recruiting different ratios of E-to-I cells remains unclear. We constructed synthetic microphysical neural networks, called circuitoids, using precise combinations of spinal neuron subtypes derived from mouse stem cells. Circuitoids of purified excitatory interneurons were sufficient to generate oscillatory bursts with properties similar to in vivo central pattern generators. Inhibitory V1 neurons provided dual layers of regulation within excitatory rhythmogenic networks - they increased the rhythmic burst frequency of excitatory V3 neurons, and segmented excitatory motor neuron activity into sub-networks. Accordingly, the speed and pattern of spinal circuits that underlie complex motor behaviors may be regulated by quantitatively gating the intra-network cellular activity ratio of E-to-I neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: A conformational switch regulates the ubiquitin ligase HUWE1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21036</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21036</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 has key roles in tumorigenesis, yet it is unkown how its activity is regulated. We present the crystal structure of a C-terminal part of HUWE1, including the catalytic domain, and reveal an asymmetric auto-inhibited dimer. We show that HUWE1 dimerizes in solution and self-associates in cells, and that both occurs through the crystallographic dimer interface. We demonstrate that HUWE1 is inhibited in cells and that it can be activated by disruption of the dimer interface. We identify a conserved segment in HUWE1 that counteracts dimer formation by associating with the dimerization region intramolecularly. Our studies reveal, intriguingly, that the tumor suppressor p14ARF binds to this segment and may thus shift the conformational equilibrium of HUWE1 toward the inactive state. We propose a model, in which the activity of HUWE1 underlies conformational control in response to physiological cues—a mechanism that may be exploited for cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Transient inhibition and long-term facilitation of locomotion by phasic optogenetic activation of serotonin neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20975</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5-HT) is associated with mood and motivation but the function of endogenous 5-HT remains controversial. Here, we studied the impact of phasic optogenetic activation of 5-HT neurons in mice over time scales from seconds to weeks. We found that activating dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-HT neurons induced a strong suppression of spontaneous locomotor behavior in the open field with rapid kinetics (onset ≤1 s). Inhibition of locomotion was independent of measures of anxiety or motor impairment and could be overcome by strong motivational drive. Repetitive place-contingent pairing of activation caused neither place preference nor aversion. However, repeated 15 min daily stimulation caused a persistent increase in spontaneous locomotion to emerge over three weeks. These results show that 5-HT transients have strong and opposing short and long-term effects on motor behavior that appear to arise from effects on the underlying factors that motivate actions.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: An oscillopathic approach to developmental dyslexia: from genes to speech processing</title>

	<description>Developmental dyslexia is a heterogeneous condition entailing problems with reading and spelling. Several genes have been linked or associated to the disease, many of which contribute to the development and function of brain areas that are important for auditory and phonological processing. Nonetheless, a clear link between genes, the brain, and the symptoms of dyslexia is still pending. The goal of this paper is contributing to bridge this gap. With this aim, we have focused on how the dyslexic brain fails to process speech sounds and reading cues. We have adopted an oscillatory perspective, according to which dyslexia results from a deficient integration of different brain rhythms during reading/spellings tasks. Moreover, we show that some candidates for this condition are related to brain rhythms. This approach should help gain a better understanding of the aetiology and the clinical presentation of developmental dyslexia, but also achieve an earlier and more accurate diagnosis of the disease.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Systematic changes in temporal summation across human visual cortex</title>

	<description>The visual system analyzes image properties across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Population receptive field (&quot;pRF&quot;) models have successfully characterized spatial representations across the human visual pathways. Here, we studied temporal representations, measuring fMRI and electrocorticographic (&quot;ECoG&quot;) responses in posterior, lateral, ventral, and dorsal visual areas to briefly viewed contrast patterns. We built a temporal pRF model employing linear summation and time-varying divisive normalization. Our model accurately predicts the fMRI amplitude and ECoG broadband time-course, accounting for two phenomena - accumulation of stimulus information over time (summation), and response reduction with prolonged or repeated exposure (adaptation). We find systematic differences in these properties: summation periods are increasingly long and adaptation more pronounced in higher compared to earlier visual areas. We propose that several features of temporal responses - adaptation, summation, and the timescale of temporal dynamics - can be understood as resulting from a small number of canonical neuronal computations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Identification of the primary peptide inhibitor contaminant of fibrillation and toxicity in synthetic Amyloid-{beta}42</title>

	<description>Understanding the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease has relied upon the use of amyloid peptides from a variety of sources, but most predominantly synthetic peptides produced using t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) or 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry. These synthetic methods can lead to minor impurities which can have profound effects on the biological activity of amyloid peptides. Here we used a combination of cytotoxicity assays, fibrillation assays and high resolution mass spectrometry (MS) to identify impurities in synthetic amyloid preparations that inhibit both cytotoxicity and aggregation. We identify the A{beta}42{Delta}39 species as the major peptide contaminant responsible for limiting both cytotoxicity and fibrillation of the amyloid peptide. In addition, we demonstrate that the presence of this minor impurity inhibits the formation of a stable A{beta}42 dimer observable by MS in very pure peptide samples. These results highlight the critical importance of purity and provenance of amyloid peptides in Alzheimer's research in particular, and biological research in general.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: NoRMCorre: An online algorithm for piecewise rigid motion correction of calcium imaging data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/108514v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/108514v1?rss=1&quot;</link>
	<description>Motion correction is a challenging pre-processing problem that arises early in the analysis pipeline of calcium imaging data sequences. Here we introduce an algorithm for fast Non-Rigid Motion Correction (NoRMCorre) based on template matching. norm operates by splitting the field of view into overlapping spatial patches that are registered for rigid translation against a continuously updated template. The estimated alignments are subsequently up-sampled to create a smooth motion field for each frame that can efficiently approximate non-rigid motion in a piecewise-rigid manner. norm allows for subpixel registration and can be run in an online mode resulting in comparable to or even faster than real time motion registration on streaming data. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method with simple yet intuitive metrics and compare against other non-rigid registration methods on two-photon calcium imaging datasets. Open source Matlab and Python code is also made available.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Sparse synaptic connectivity is required for decorrelation and pattern separation in feedforward networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/108431v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/108431v1?rss=1&quot;</link>
	<description>Pattern separation is a fundamental function of the brain. Divergent feedforward networks separate overlapping activity patterns by mapping them onto larger numbers of neurons, aiding learning in downstream circuits. However, the relationship between the synaptic connectivity within these circuits and their ability to separate patterns is poorly understood. To investigate this we built simplified and biologically detailed models of the cerebellar input layer and systematically varied the spatial correlation of their inputs and their synaptic connectivity. Performance was quantified by the learning speed of a classifier trained on either the mossy fiber input or granule cell output patterns. Our results establish that the extent of synaptic connectivity governs the pattern separation performance of feedforward networks by counteracting the beneficial effects of expanding coding space and threshold-mediated decorrelation. The sparse synaptic connectivity in the cerebellar input layer provides an optimal solution to this trade-off, enabling efficient pattern separation and faster learning.</description>

	<description>INTRODUCTION We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) literature to examine consistency of functional connectivity alterations in AD dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). METHODS Studies were screened using a standardized procedure. Multiresolution statistics were performed to assess the spatial consistency of findings across studies. RESULTS Thirty-four studies were included (1,363 participants, average 40 per study). Consistent alterations in connectivity were found in the default-mode, salience and limbic networks in patients with AD dementia, MCI, or in both groups. We also identified a bias in the literature towards specific examination of the default-mode network. DISCUSSION Convergent evidence across the literature supports the use of resting-state connectivity as a biomarker of AD. The locations of consistent alterations suggest that metabolically expensive hub regions in the brain might be an early target of AD.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Conformational diversity analysis reveals three functional mechanisms in proteins</title>

Protein motions are a key feature to understand biological function. Recently, a large-scale analysis of protein conformational diversity showed a positively skewed distribution with a peak at 0.5 Å C-alpha root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD). To understand this distribution in terms of structure-function relationships, we studied a well curated and large dataset of ~5,000 proteins with experimentally determined conformational diversity. We searched for global behaviour patterns studying how structure-based features change among the available conformer population for each protein. This procedure allowed us to describe the RMSD distribution in terms of three main protein classes sharing given properties. The largest of these protein subsets (~60%), which we call “rigid” (average RMSD = 0.83 Å), has no disordered regions, shows low conformational diversity, the largest tunnels and smaller and buried cavities. The two additional subsets contain disordered regions, but with differential sequence composition and behaviour. Partially disordered proteins have on average 67% of their conformers with disordered regions, average RMSD = 1.1 Å, the highest number of hinges and the longest disordered regions. In contrast, malleable proteins have on average only 25% of disordered conformers and average RMSD = 1.3 Å, flexible cavities affected in size by the presence of disordered regions and show the highest diversity of cognate ligands. Proteins in each set are mostly non-homologous to each other, share no given fold class, nor functional similarity but do share features derived from their conformer population. These shared features could represent conformational mechanisms related with biological functions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_HoBMRKlJf4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The coordinated behaviour of populations of cells plays a central role in tissue growth and renewal. Cells react to their microenvironment by modulating processes such as movement, growth and proliferation, and signalling. Alongside experimental studies, computational models offer a useful means by which to investigate these processes. To this end a variety of cell-based modelling approaches have been developed, ranging from lattice-based cellular automata to lattice-free models that treat cells as point-like particles or extended shapes. However, it remains unclear how these approaches compare when applied to the same biological problem, and what differences in behaviour are due to different model assumptions and abstractions. Here, we exploit the availability of an implementation of five popular cell-based modelling approaches within a consistent computational framework, Chaste (http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste). This framework allows one to easily change constitutive assumptions within these models. In each case we provide full details of all technical aspects of our model implementations. We compare model implementations using four case studies, chosen to reflect the key cellular processes of proliferation, adhesion, and short- and long-range signalling. These case studies demonstrate the applicability of each model and provide a guide for model usage.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aC_4z6Wo2U8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Co-emergence of multi-scale cortical activities of irregular firing, oscillations and avalanches achieves cost-efficient information capacity</title>

The brain is highly energy consuming, therefore is under strong selective pressure to achieve cost-efficiency in both cortical connectivities and activities. However, cost-efficiency as a design principle for cortical activities has been rarely studied. Especially it is not clear how cost-efficiency is related to ubiquitously observed multi-scale properties: irregular firing, oscillations and neuronal avalanches. Here we demonstrate that these prominent properties can be simultaneously observed in a generic, biologically plausible neural circuit model that captures excitation-inhibition balance and realistic dynamics of synaptic conductance. Their co-emergence achieves minimal energy cost as well as maximal energy efficiency on information capacity, when neuronal firing are coordinated and shaped by moderate synchrony to reduce otherwise redundant spikes, and the dynamical clusterings are maintained in the form of neuronal avalanches. Such cost-efficient neural dynamics can be employed as a foundation for further efficient information processing under energy constraint.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JKS1_70ZB20&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Didac Santesmasses, Marco Mariotti, Roderic Guigó&lt;/p&gt;

Selenocysteine (Sec) is known as the 21st amino acid, a cysteine analogue with selenium replacing sulphur. Sec is inserted co-translationally in a small fraction of proteins called selenoproteins. In selenoprotein genes, the Sec specific tRNA (tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Sec&lt;/sup&gt;) drives the recoding of highly specific UGA codons from stop signals to Sec. Although found in organisms from the three domains of life, Sec is not universal. Many species are completely devoid of selenoprotein genes and lack the ability to synthesize Sec. Since tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Sec&lt;/sup&gt; is a key component in selenoprotein biosynthesis, its efficient identification in genomes is instrumental to characterize the utilization of Sec across lineages. Available tRNA prediction methods fail to accurately predict tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Sec&lt;/sup&gt;, due to its unusual structural fold. Here, we present Secmarker, a method based on manually curated covariance models capturing the specific tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Sec&lt;/sup&gt; structure in archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes. We exploited the non-universality of Sec to build a proper benchmark set for tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Sec&lt;/sup&gt; predictions, which is not possible for the predictions of other tRNAs. We show that Secmarker greatly improves the accuracy of previously existing methods constituting a valuable tool to identify tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Sec&lt;/sup&gt; genes, and to efficiently determine whether a genome contains selenoproteins. We used Secmarker to analyze a large set of fully sequenced genomes, and the results revealed new insights in the biology of tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Sec&lt;/sup&gt;, led to the discovery of a novel bacterial selenoprotein family, and shed additional light on the phylogenetic distribution of selenoprotein containing genomes. Secmarker is freely accessible for download, or online analysis through a web server at http://secmarker.crg.cat.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rGii86KmsZg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Spatial separation of two different pathways accounting for the generation of calcium signals in astrocytes</title>

Astrocytes integrate and process synaptic information and exhibit calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) signals in response to incoming information from neighboring synapses. The generation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals is mostly attributed to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release from internal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; stores evoked by an elevated metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activity. Different experimental results associated the generation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals to the activity of the glutamate transporter (GluT). The GluT itself does not influence the intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration, but it indirectly activates Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry over the membrane. A closer look into Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in different astrocytic compartments revealed a spatial separation of those two pathways. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals in the soma are mainly generated by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release from internal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; stores (mGluR-dependent pathway). In astrocytic compartments close to the synapse most Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals are evoked by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry over the plasma membrane (GluT-dependent pathway). This assumption is supported by the finding, that the volume ratio between the internal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; store and the intracellular space decreases from the soma towards the synapse. We extended a model for mGluR-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals in astrocytes with the GluT-dependent pathway. Additionally, we included the volume ratio between the internal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; store and the intracellular compartment into the model in order to analyze Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals either in the soma or close to the synapse. Our model results confirm the spatial separation of the mGluR- and GluT-dependent pathways along the astrocytic process. The model allows to study the binary Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; response during a block of either of both pathways. Moreover, the model contributes to a better understanding of the impact of channel densities on the interaction of both pathways and on the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signal.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CHZDUz5wGrg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Elucidation of molecular kinetic schemes from macroscopic traces using system identification</title>

Overall cellular responses to biologically-relevant stimuli are mediated by networks of simpler lower-level processes. Although information about some of these processes can now be obtained by visualizing and recording events at the molecular level, this is still possible only in especially favorable cases. Therefore the development of methods to extract the dynamics and relationships between the different lower-level (microscopic) processes from the overall (macroscopic) response remains a crucial challenge in the understanding of many aspects of physiology. Here we have devised a hybrid computational-analytical method to accomplish this task, the SYStems-based MOLecular kinetic scheme Extractor (SYSMOLE). SYSMOLE utilizes system-identification input-output analysis to obtain a transfer function between the stimulus and the overall cellular response in the Laplace-transformed domain. It then derives a Markov-chain state molecular kinetic scheme uniquely associated with the transfer function by means of a classification procedure and an analytical step that imposes general biological constraints. We first tested SYSMOLE with synthetic data and evaluated its performance in terms of its rate of convergence to the correct molecular kinetic scheme and its robustness to noise. We then examined its performance on real experimental traces by analyzing macroscopic calcium-current traces elicited by membrane depolarization. SYSMOLE derived the correct, previously known molecular kinetic scheme describing the activation and inactivation of the underlying calcium channels and correctly identified the accepted mechanism of action of nifedipine, a calcium-channel blocker clinically used in patients with cardiovascular disease. Finally, we applied SYSMOLE to study the pharmacology of a new class of glutamate antipsychotic drugs and their crosstalk mechanism through a heteromeric complex of G protein-coupled receptors. Our results indicate that our methodology can be successfully applied to accurately derive molecular kinetic schemes from experimental macroscopic traces, and we anticipate that it may be useful in the study of a wide variety of biological systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pH320dHrfwU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Blood-Brain Barrier Breakdown in Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome: implications for pathophysiology and diagnosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24891</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Diagnosis of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is currently based on luminographic findings of vasoconstriction. In addition to vasoconstriction, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown has been postulated as a central mechanism of RCVS. Our aim was to document BBB breakdown in patients with RCVS and its role for the pathophysiology-based diagnosis of RCVS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We prospectively recruited 72 consecutive patients with thunderclap headache who did not have aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage from April 2015 to July 2016 at the Samsung Medical Center. Based on the International Classification of Headache Disorder-3 beta criteria and neuroimaging, patients were classified as having RCVS (n=41;‘definite' in 29 imaging-proven patients and ‘probable' in 12 imaging-negative patients), other secondary causes (n=7), and thunderclap headache of undetermined cause (n=24). BBB breakdown was evaluated using contrast-enhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance (FLAIR) imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: BBB breakdown was documented in 20 (69.0%) patients with definite RCVS, 3 (25.0%) patients with probable RCVS, and none with other secondary causes. BBB breakdown was present in RCVS patients with (n=4) and without (n=19) concomitant PRES. In patients with RCVS, the extent of BBB breakdown was independently associated with neurological complications (multivariable OR, 1.48 per one territorial increase; 95% CI, 1.04–2.12; adjusted p=0.032). Three (12.5%) patients with thunderclap headache of undetermined cause were newly classified as having RCVS by the presence of BBB breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: This is the first study to show BBB breakdown in patients with RCVS. This finding might broaden our understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical spectrum of RCVS. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>: Distinct modes of SMAD2 chromatin binding and remodeling shape the transcriptional response to NODAL/Activin signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22474</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e22474</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;NODAL/Activin signaling orchestrates key processes during embryonic development via SMAD2. How SMAD2 activates programs of gene expression that are modulated over time however, is not known. Here we delineate the sequence of events that occur from SMAD2 binding to transcriptional activation, and the mechanisms underlying them. NODAL/Activin signaling induces dramatic chromatin landscape changes, and a dynamic transcriptional network regulated by SMAD2, acting via multiple mechanisms. Crucially we have discovered two modes of SMAD2 binding. SMAD2 can bind pre-acetylated nucleosome-depleted sites. However, it also binds to unacetylated, closed chromatin, independently of pioneer factors, where it induces nucleosome displacement and histone acetylation. For a subset of genes, this requires SMARCA4. We find that long term modulation of the transcriptional responses requires continued NODAL/Activin signaling. Thus SMAD2 binding does not linearly equate with transcriptional kinetics, and our data suggest that SMAD2 recruits multiple co-factors during sustained signaling to shape the downstream transcriptional program.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Aberrant corticosteroid metabolism in tumor cells enables GR takeover in enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20183</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e20183</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer is driven by androgen stimulation of the androgen receptor (AR). The next-generation AR antagonist, enzalutamide, prolongs survival, but resistance and lethal disease eventually prevail. Emerging data suggest that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is upregulated in this context, stimulating expression of AR-target genes that permit continued growth despite AR blockade. However, countering this mechanism by administration of GR antagonists is problematic because GR is essential for life. We show that enzalutamide treatment in human models of prostate cancer and patient tissues is accompanied by a ubiquitin E3-ligase, AMFR, mediating loss of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11β-HSD2), which otherwise inactivates cortisol, sustaining tumor cortisol concentrations to stimulate GR and enzalutamide resistance. Remarkably, reinstatement of 11β-HSD2 expression, or AMFR loss, reverses enzalutamide resistance in mouse xenograft tumors. Together, these findings reveal a surprising metabolic mechanism of enzalutamide resistance that may be targeted with a strategy that circumvents a requirement for systemic GR ablation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Dimethyltryptamines are hallucinogenic serotonin-like molecules present in traditional Amerindian medicine (e.g. Ayahuasca, Virola) recently associated with cognitive gains, antidepressant effects and changes in brain areas related to attention, self-referential thought, and internal mentation. Historical and technical restrictions impaired understanding how such substances impact human brain metabolism. Here we used shotgun mass spectrometry to explore proteomic differences induced by dimethyltryptamine (5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, 5-MeO-DMT) on human cerebral organoids. Out of the 6,728 identified proteins, 934 were found differentially expressed in 5-MeO-DMT-treated cerebral organoids. In silico systems biology analyses support 5-MeO-DMT's anti-inflammatory effects and reveal a modulation of proteins associated with the formation of dendritic spines, including proteins involved in cellular protrusion formation, microtubule dynamics and cytoskeletal reorganization. Proteins involved in long-term potentiation were modulated in a complex manner, with significant increases in the levels of NMDAR, CaMKII and CREB, but a reduction of PKA and PKC levels. These results offer possible mechanistic insights into the neuropsychological changes caused by the ingestion of substances rich in dimethyltryptamines.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Ciliomotor circuitry underlying whole-body coordination of ciliary activity in the Platynereis larva</title>

	<description>Ciliated surfaces harbouring synchronously beating cilia can generate fluid flow or drive locomotion. In ciliary swimmers, ciliary beating, arrests, and changes in beat frequency are often coordinated across extended or discontinuous surfaces. To understand how such coordination is achieved, we studied the ciliated larvae of Platynereis dumerilii, a marine annelid. Platynereis larvae have segmental multiciliated cells that regularly display spontaneous coordinated ciliary arrests. We used whole-body connectomics, activity imaging, transgenesis, and neuron ablation to characterize the ciliomotor circuitry. We identified cholinergic, serotonergic, and catecholaminergic ciliomotor neurons. The synchronous rhythmic activation of cholinergic cells drives the coordinated arrests of all cilia. The serotonergic cells are active when cilia are beating. Serotonin inhibits the cholinergic rhythm, and increases ciliary beat frequency. Based on their connectivity and alternating activity, the catecholaminergic cells may generate the rhythm. The ciliomotor circuitry thus constitutes a stop-and-go pacemaker system for the whole-body coordination of ciliary locomotion.</description>

	<description>Studies of neuron-behaviour correlation and causal manipulation have long been used separately to understand the neural basis of perception. Yet these approaches sometimes lead to drastically conflicting conclusions about the functional role of brain areas. Theories that focus only on choice-related neuronal activity cannot reconcile those findings without additional experiments involving large-scale recordings to measure interneuronal correlations. By expanding current theories of neural coding and incorporating results from inactivation experiments, we demonstrate here that it is possible to infer decoding weights of different brain areas without precise knowledge of the correlation structure. We apply this technique to neural data collected from two different cortical areas in macaque monkeys trained to perform a heading discrimination task. We identify two opposing decoding schemes, each consistent with data depending on the nature of correlated noise. Our theory makes specific testable predictions to distinguish these scenarios experimentally without requiring measurement of the underlying noise correlations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Eye-Movement Reinstatement and Neural Reactivation: Testing the Hebbian Theory of Mental Imagery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/107953v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/107953v1?rss=1&quot;</link>
	<description>Half a century ago, Donald Hebb posited that mental imagery is a constructive process that emulates perception. Specifically, Hebb claimed that visual imagery results from the reactivation of neural activity associated with viewing images. He also argued that neural reactivation and imagery benefit from the re-enactment of eye movement patterns that first occurred at viewing (i.e., fixation reinstatement). To investigate these claims, we applied multivariate pattern analyses to functional MRI (fMRI) and eye tracking data collected while healthy participants repeatedly viewed and visualized complex images. We observed that the specificity of neural reactivation correlated positively with vivid imagery and with detailed memory for the stimulus images. Moreover, neural reactivation correlated positively with fixation reinstatement - even when analyses were constrained to fMRI signal from the occipital lobe. These findings support the conception of mental imagery as a simulation of perception, and provide evidence of the supportive role of eye-movement in neural reactivation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neural decoding of visual stimuli varies with fluctuations in global network efficiency</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/107888v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/107888v1?rss=1&quot;</link>
	<description>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that neural activity fluctuates spontaneously between different states of global synchronization over a timescale of several seconds. Such fluctuations generate transient states of high and low correlation across distributed cortical areas. It has been hypothesized that such fluctuations in global efficiency might alter patterns of activity in local neuronal populations elicited by changes in incoming sensory stimuli. To test this prediction, we used a linear decoder to discriminate patterns of neural activity elicited by face and motion stimuli presented periodically while participants underwent time-resolved fMRI. As predicted, decoding was reliably higher during states of high global efficiency than during states of low efficiency, and this difference was evident across both visual and non-visual cortical regions. The results indicate that slow fluctuations in global network efficiency are associated with variations in the pattern of activity across widespread cortical regions responsible for representing distinct categories of visual stimulus. More broadly, the findings highlight the importance of understanding the impact of global fluctuations in functional connectivity on specialised, stimulus driven neural processes.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The effect of smoking on the brain revealed by using electronic cigarettes with concurrent fMRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/107771v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/107771v1?rss=1&quot;</link>
	<description>Cigarette addiction is driven partly by the physiological effects of nicotine, but also by the distinctive sensory and behavioural aspects of smoking, and understanding the neural effects of such processes is vital. There are many practical difficulties associated with subjects smoking in the modern neuroscientific laboratory environment, however electronic cigarettes obviate many of these issues, and provide a close simulation of smoking tobacco cigarettes. We have examined the neural effects of 'smoking' electronic cigarettes with concurrent functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The results demonstrate the feasibility of using these devices in the MRI environment, and show brain activation in a network of cortical (motor cortex, insula, cingulate, amygdala) and sub-cortical (putamen, thalamus, globus pallidus, cerebellum) regions. Concomitant relative deactivations were seen in the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex. These results reveal the brain processes involved in (simulated) smoking for the first time, and validate a novel approach to the study of smoking, and addiction more generally.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Rubin-vase percept is predicted by prestimulus coupling of category-sensitive occipital regions with frontal cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/107714v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Multiple theories of conscious phenomenology have been postulated within neuroscience; here we put evidence towards the &quot;windowsto consciousness&quot; (Win2Con) framework. This framework predicts that high connectivity states between the modular sensory hubs, and the frontalparietal network, before stimulus onset is a crucial factor in guiding the contents of consciousness. We tested this prediction by using the Rubin's vase illusion - an image that evokes a bistable perception that alters between a pair of faces or a vase - while measuring magnetroencephalographic (MEG) response in 18 human subjects. Behavioural results indicated a stochastic trial-by-trial report of the vase or faces, subjects fluctuate between reporting a vase or faces. Sensor analysis revealed pristimulus differences in 12-17Hz low-frequency power, subsequent source projection suggested part of the power effect was present in the right lateral occipital area (LO) an area functionally relevant in object perception. Evoked effects were present in the sensor analysis, with a difference during the 350 - 375 msec time window. Source projection revealed that part of this difference resided in the right face-sensitive occipital face area (OFA). Using these two sources (i.e. LO and OFA) as seeds, we conducted a source space connectivity analysis, revealing variant connectivity to right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG): for the LO seed there was greater connectivity for vase vs. faces reports, conversely, for the OFA seed there was greater connectivity for face vs. vase reports. Our results support the framework of the Win2Con, as well as showing frontal and OFA connectivity effects face perception.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Pattern separation of spiketrains by individual granule cells of the dentate gyrus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/107706v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/107706v1?rss=1&quot;</link>
	<description>Pattern separation is a process that minimizes overlap between patterns of neuronal activity representing similar experiences. Theoretical work suggests that the dentate gyrus (DG) performs this role for memory processing but a direct demonstration is lacking. One limitation is the difficulty to measure DG inputs and outputs simultaneously. To rigorously assess pattern separation by DG circuitry, we used mouse brain slices to stimulate DG afferents and simultaneously record granule cells (GCs). Output spiketrains of GCs are more dissimilar than their input spiketrains, demonstrating for the first time temporal pattern separation at the level of single neurons in DG. This phenomenon occurs from the millisecond to the second timescales through different neural codes and is not explained by simple noise. Pattern separation is cell-type specific and larger in GCs than in fast-spiking interneurons. Finally, different GCs process spiketrains differently, a mechanism that likely helps to separate patterns at the population level.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Model-free reinforcement learning operates over information stored in working-memory to drive human choices</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/107698v1?rss=1&quot;</link>
	<description>Model-free learning creates stimulus-response associations, but are there limits to the types of stimuli it can operate over? Most experiments on reward-learning have used discrete sensory stimuli, but there is no algorithmic reason to restrict model-free learning to external stimuli, and theories suggest that model-free processes may operate over highly abstract concepts and goals. Our study aimed to determine whether model-free learning can operate over environmental states defined by information held in working memory. We compared the data from human participants in two conditions that presented learning cues either simultaneously or as a temporal sequence that required working memory. There was a significant influence of model-free learning in the working memory condition. Moreover, both groups showed greater model-free effects than simulated model-based agents. Thus, we show that model-free learning processes operate not just in parallel, but also in cooperation with canonical executive functions such as working memory to support behavior.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Metabolic regulation is sufficient for global and robust coordination of glucose uptake, catabolism, energy production and growth in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;</title>

The metabolism of microorganisms is regulated through two main mechanisms: changes of enzyme capacities as a consequence of gene expression modulation (“hierarchical control”) and changes of enzyme activities through metabolite-enzyme interactions. An increasing body of evidence indicates that hierarchical control is insufficient to explain metabolic behaviors, but the system-wide impact of metabolic regulation remains largely uncharacterized. To clarify its role, we developed and validated a detailed kinetic model of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; central metabolism that links growth to environment. Metabolic control analyses confirm that the control is widely distributed across the network and highlight strong interconnections between all the pathways. Exploration of the model solution space reveals that several robust properties emerge from metabolic regulation, from the molecular level (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. homeostasis of total metabolite pool) to the overall cellular physiology (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. coordination of carbon uptake, catabolism, energy and redox production, and growth), while allowing a large degree of flexibility at most individual metabolic steps. These properties have important physiological implications for &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; and significantly expand the self-regulating capacities of its metabolism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pRZDDITnOus&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Seasonal influenza epidemics offer unique opportunities to study the invasion and re-invasion waves of a pathogen in a partially immune population. Detailed patterns of spread remain elusive, however, due to lack of granular disease data. Here we model high-volume city-level medical claims data and human mobility proxies to explore the drivers of influenza spread in the US during 2002–2010. Although the speed and pathways of spread varied across seasons, seven of eight epidemics likely originated in the Southern US. Each epidemic was associated with 1–5 early long-range transmission events, half of which sparked onward transmission. Gravity model estimates indicate a sharp decay in influenza transmission with the distance between infectious and susceptible cities, consistent with spread dominated by work commutes rather than air traffic. Two early-onset seasons associated with antigenic novelty had particularly localized modes of spread, suggesting that novel strains may spread in a more localized fashion than previously anticipated.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9OF3aAuqm4U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: An Atlas of Peroxiredoxins Created Using an Active Site Profile-Based Approach to Functionally Relevant Clustering of Proteins</title>

Peroxiredoxins (Prxs or Prdxs) are a large protein superfamily of antioxidant enzymes that rapidly detoxify damaging peroxides and/or affect signal transduction and, thus, have roles in proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Prx superfamily members are widespread across phylogeny and multiple methods have been developed to classify them. Here we present an updated atlas of the Prx superfamily identified using a novel method called MISST (Multi-level Iterative Sequence Searching Technique). MISST is an iterative search process developed to be both agglomerative, to add sequences containing similar functional site features, and divisive, to split groups when functional site features suggest distinct functionally-relevant clusters. Superfamily members need not be identified initially—MISST begins with a minimal representative set of known structures and searches GenBank iteratively. Further, the method’s novelty lies in the manner in which isofunctional groups are selected; rather than use a single or shifting threshold to identify clusters, the groups are deemed isofunctional when they pass a self-identification criterion, such that the group identifies itself and nothing else in a search of GenBank. The method was preliminarily validated on the Prxs, as the Prxs presented challenges of both agglomeration and division. For example, previous sequence analysis clustered the Prx functional families Prx1 and Prx6 into one group. Subsequent expert analysis clearly identified Prx6 as a distinct functionally relevant group. The MISST process distinguishes these two closely related, though functionally distinct, families. Through MISST search iterations, over 38,000 Prx sequences were identified, which the method divided into six isofunctional clusters, consistent with previous expert analysis. The results represent the most complete computational functional analysis of proteins comprising the Prx superfamily. The feasibility of this novel method is demonstrated by the Prx superfamily results, laying the foundation for potential functionally relevant clustering of the universe of protein sequences.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/m-9Uq4ue1i0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>: Spontaneous activation of visual pigments in relation to openness/closedness of chromophore-binding pocket</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18492</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e18492</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual pigments can be spontaneously activated by internal thermal energy, generating noise that interferes with real-light detection. Recently, we developed a physicochemical theory that successfully predicts the rate of spontaneous activity of representative rod and cone pigments from their peak-absorption wavelength (λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;), with pigments having longer λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; being noisier. Interestingly, cone pigments may generally be ~25 fold noisier than rod pigments of the same λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, possibly ascribed to an ‘open’ chromophore-binding pocket in cone pigments defined by the capability of chromophore-exchange in darkness. Here, we show in mice that the λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;-dependence of pigment noise could be extended even to a mutant pigment, E122Q-rhodopsin. Moreover, although E122Q-rhodopsin shows some cone-pigment-like characteristics, its noise remained quantitatively predictable by the ‘non-open’ nature of its chromophore-binding pocket as in wild-type rhodopsin. The openness/closedness of the chromophore-binding pocket is potentially a useful indicator of whether a pigment is intended for detecting dim or bright light.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Inhibition of histone deacetylase 1 or 2 reduces microglia activation through a gene expression independent mechanism.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/107649v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors prevent neural cell death in in vivo models of cerebral ischaemia, brain injury and neurodegenerative disease. One mechanism by which HDAC inhibitors may do this is by suppressing the excessive inflammatory response of chronically activated microglia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this anti-inflammatory effect and the specific HDAC responsible are not fully understood. Recent data from in vivo rodent studies has shown that inhibition of class I HDACs suppresses neuroinflammation and is neuroprotective. In our study we have identified that selective HDAC inhibition with inhibitors apicidin, MS-275 or MI-192, or specific knockdown of HDAC1 or 2 using siRNA, suppresses the expression of cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) in BV2 murine microglia activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, we found that in the absence of HDAC1, HDAC2 is upregulated and these increased levels are compensatory, suggesting these two HDACs have redundancy in regulating the inflammatory response of microglia. Investigating the possible underlying anti-inflammatory mechanisms suggests an increase in protein expression is not important. Taken together, this study supports the idea that inhibitors selective towards HDAC1 or HDAC2, may be therapeutically useful for targeting neuroinflammation in brain injuries and neurodegenerative disease.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Multidimensional encoding of brain connectomes</title>

	<description>The ability to map brain networks at the macroscale in living individuals is fundamental in efforts to chart the relation between human behavior, health and disease. We present a framework to encode structural brain connectomes and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance data into multidimensional arrays (tensors). The framework overcomes current limitations in building connectomes; it prevents information loss by integrating the relation between connectome nodes, edges, fascicles and diffusion data. We demonstrate the utility of the framework for in vivo white matter mapping and anatomical computing. The framework reduces dramatically storage requirements for connectome evaluation methods, with up to 40x compression factors. We apply the framework to evaluate 1,980 connectomes, thirteen tractography methods, and three data sets. We describe a general equation to predicts connector resolution (number of fascicles) given data quality and tractography model parameters. Finally, we provide open source software implementing the method and data to reproduce the results.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Stochastic satisficing account of choice and confidence in uncertain value-based decisions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/107532v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/107532v1?rss=1&quot;</link>
	<description>Every day we make choices under uncertainty; choosing what route to work or which queue in a supermarket to take, for example. It is unclear how outcome variance, e.g. waiting time in a queue, affects decisions when outcome is stochastic and continuous. For example, how does one choose between an option with unreliable but high expected reward, and an option with more certain but lower expected reward? Here we used an experimental design where two choices' payoffs took continuous values, to examine the effect of outcome variance on decisions and confidence. Inconsistent with expected utility predictions, our participants' probability of choosing the good option decreased when both better and worse options' payoffs were more variable. Confidence ratings were affected by outcome variability only when choosing the good option. Inspired by the satisficing heuristic, we propose a &quot;stochastic satisficing&quot; (SSAT) model for choosing between options with continuous uncertain outcomes. In this model, decisions are made by comparing the available options' probability of exceeding an acceptability threshold and confidence reports scale with the chosen option's satisficing probability. The SSAT model best explained choice behaviour and most successfully predicted confidence ratings. We further tested the model's prediction in a second experiment where choice and confidence behaviours were found to be consistent with the SSAT simulations. Our model and experimental results generalize the cognitive heuristic of satisficing to stochastic contexts and thus provide an account of bounded rationality in the face of uncertainty.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A memory of recent oxygen experience switches pheromone valence in C. elegans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/107524v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/107524v1?rss=1&quot;</link>
	<description>Animals adjust their behavioral priorities according to momentary needs and prior experience. We show that C. elegans changes how it processes sensory information according to the oxygen environment it experienced recently. C. elegans acclimated to 7% O2 are aroused by CO2 and repelled by pheromones that attract animals acclimated to 21% O2. This behavioral plasticity arises from prolonged activity differences in a circuit that continuously signals O2 levels. A sustained change in the activity of O2 sensing neurons reprograms the properties of their post-synaptic partners, the RMG hub interneurons. RMG is gap-junctionally coupled to the ASK and ADL pheromone sensors that respectively drive pheromone attraction and repulsion. Prior O2 experience has opposite effects on the pheromone responsiveness of these neurons. These circuit changes provide a physiological correlate of altered pheromone valence. Our results suggest C. elegans stores a memory of recent O2 experience in the RMG circuit and illustrate how a circuit is flexibly sculpted to guide behavioral decisions in a context-dependent manner.</description>

	<description>Gene expression analysis from single cells has become increasingly prominent across biological disciplines; thus, it is important to train students in these approaches. Here, we present an experimental and analysis pipeline that we developed for the Neural Systems &amp;amp; Behavior (NS&amp;amp;B) course at Marine Biological Laboratory. Our approach used the Maxwell(R) 16 LEV simplyRNA Tissue Kit and GoTaq(R) 2-Step RT-qPCR System for gene expression analysis from single neurons of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion, a model system to study the generation of rhythmic motor patterns. We used double-stranded RNA to knockdown expression of a putative neuromodulator-activated sodium channel. We then examined the electrophysiological responses to known neuromodulators and confirmed that the response was reduced. Finally, we measured how mRNA levels of several ion channel genes changed in response. Our results provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the generation and modulation of rhythmic motor patterns.</description>

We evaluated the fraction of variation in HIV-1 set point viral load attributable to viral or human genetic factors by using joint host/pathogen genetic data from 541 HIV infected individuals. We show that viral genetic diversity explains 29% of the variation in viral load while host factors explain 8.4%. Using a joint model including both host and viral effects, we estimate a total of 30% heritability, indicating that most of the host effects are reflected in viral sequence variation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Tf4l0HYh-NM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

High throughput mRNA expression profiling can be used to characterize the response of cell culture models to perturbations such as pharmacologic modulators and genetic perturbations. As profiling campaigns expand in scope, it is important to homogenize, summarize, and analyze the resulting data in a manner that captures significant biological signals in spite of various noise sources such as batch effects and stochastic variation. We used the L1000 platform for large-scale profiling of 978 representative genes across thousands of compound treatments. Here, a method is described that uses deep learning techniques to convert the expression changes of the landmark genes into a perturbation barcode that reveals important features of the underlying data, performing better than the raw data in revealing important biological insights. The barcode captures compound structure and target information, and predicts a compound’s high throughput screening promiscuity, to a higher degree than the original data measurements, indicating that the approach uncovers underlying factors of the expression data that are otherwise entangled or masked by noise. Furthermore, we demonstrate that visualizations derived from the perturbation barcode can be used to more sensitively assign functions to unknown compounds through a guilt-by-association approach, which we use to predict and experimentally validate the activity of compounds on the MAPK pathway. The demonstrated application of deep metric learning to large-scale chemical genetics projects highlights the utility of this and related approaches to the extraction of insights and testable hypotheses from big, sometimes noisy data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hxF_38tGqaQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Predicting Structure-Function Relations and Survival following Surgical and Bronchoscopic Lung Volume Reduction Treatment of Emphysema</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jarred R. Mondoñedo, Béla Suki&lt;/p&gt;

Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) and bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (bLVR) are palliative treatments aimed at reducing hyperinflation in advanced emphysema. Previous work has evaluated functional improvements and survival advantage for these techniques, although their effects on the micromechanical environment in the lung have yet to be determined. Here, we introduce a computational model to simulate a force-based destruction of elastic networks representing emphysema progression, which we use to track the response to lung volume reduction via LVRS and bLVR. We find that (1) LVRS efficacy can be predicted based on pre-surgical network structure; (2) macroscopic functional improvements following bLVR are related to microscopic changes in mechanical force heterogeneity; and (3) both techniques improve aspects of survival and quality of life influenced by lung compliance, albeit while accelerating disease progression. Our model predictions yield unique insights into the microscopic origins underlying emphysema progression before and after lung volume reduction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vFAlgMYGZDg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Neurons affected in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) experience mitochondrial dysfunction and a bioenergetic deficit that occurs early and promotes the disease-defining amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) and Tau pathologies. Emerging findings suggest that the autophagy/lysosome pathway that removes damaged mitochondria (mitophagy) is also compromised in AD, resulting in the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. Results in animal and cellular models of AD and in patients with sporadic late-onset AD suggest that impaired mitophagy contributes to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits by triggering Aβ and Tau accumulation through increases in oxidative damage and cellular energy deficits; these, in turn, impair mitophagy.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A quantitative model for the rate-limiting process of UGA alternative assignments to stop and selenocysteine codons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005367</guid>

Ambiguity in genetic codes exists in cases where certain stop codons are alternatively used to encode non-canonical amino acids. In selenoprotein transcripts, the UGA codon may either represent a translation termination signal or a selenocysteine (Sec) codon. Translating UGA to Sec requires selenium and specialized Sec incorporation machinery such as the interaction between the SECIS element and SBP2 protein, but how these factors quantitatively affect alternative assignments of UGA has not been fully investigated. We developed a model simulating the UGA decoding process. Our model is based on the following assumptions: (1) charged Sec-specific tRNAs (Sec-tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Sec&lt;/sup&gt;) and release factors compete for a UGA site, (2) Sec-tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Sec&lt;/sup&gt; abundance is limited by the concentrations of selenium and Sec-specific tRNA (tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Sec&lt;/sup&gt;) precursors, and (3) all synthesis reactions follow first-order kinetics. We demonstrated that this model captured two prominent characteristics observed from experimental data. First, UGA to Sec decoding increases with elevated selenium availability, but saturates under high selenium supply. Second, the efficiency of Sec incorporation is reduced with increasing selenoprotein synthesis. We measured the expressions of four selenoprotein constructs and estimated their model parameters. Their inferred Sec incorporation efficiencies did not correlate well with their SECIS-SBP2 binding affinities, suggesting the existence of additional factors determining the hierarchy of selenoprotein synthesis under selenium deficiency. This model provides a framework to systematically study the interplay of factors affecting the dual definitions of a genetic codon.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vDCoaw29jB0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Computational investigation of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) and calcium dependent ERK1/2 activation downstream of VEGFR2 in endothelial cells</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Hojjat Bazzazi, Aleksander S. Popel&lt;/p&gt;

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a powerful regulator of neovascularization. VEGF binding to its cognate receptor, VEGFR2, activates a number of signaling pathways including ERK1/2. Activation of ERK1/2 is experimentally shown to involve sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) activation and its calcium-dependent translocation downstream of ERK1/2. Here we construct a rule-based computational model of signaling downstream of VEGFR2, by including SphK1 and calcium positive feedback mechanisms, and investigate their consequences on ERK1/2 activation. The model predicts the existence of VEGF threshold in ERK1/2 activation that can be continuously tuned by cellular concentrations of SphK1 and sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P). The computer model also predicts powerful effects of perturbations in plasma and ER calcium pump rates and the current through the CRAC channels on ERK1/2 activation dynamics, highlighting the critical role of intracellular calcium in shaping the pERK1/2 signal. The model is then utilized to simulate anti-angiogenic therapeutic interventions targeting VEGFR2-ERK1/2 axis. Simulations indicate that monotherapies that exclusively target VEGFR2 phosphorylation, VEGF, or VEGFR2 are ineffective in shutting down signaling to ERK1/2. By simulating therapeutic strategies that target multiple nodes of the pathway such as Raf and SphK1, we conclude that combination therapy should be much more effective in blocking VEGF signaling to EKR1/2. The model has important implications for interventions that target signaling pathways in angiogenesis relevant to cancer, vascular diseases, and wound healing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jO3QFZtF78M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Accuracy Maximization Analysis for Sensory-Perceptual Tasks: Computational Improvements, Filter Robustness, and Coding Advantages for Scaled Additive Noise</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Johannes Burge, Priyank Jaini&lt;/p&gt;

Accuracy Maximization Analysis (AMA) is a recently developed Bayesian ideal observer method for task-specific dimensionality reduction. Given a training set of proximal stimuli (e.g. retinal images), a response noise model, and a cost function, AMA returns the filters (i.e. receptive fields) that extract the most useful stimulus features for estimating a user-specified latent variable from those stimuli. Here, we first contribute two technical advances that significantly reduce AMA’s compute time: we derive gradients of cost functions for which two popular estimators are appropriate, and we implement a stochastic gradient descent (AMA-SGD) routine for filter learning. Next, we show how the method can be used to simultaneously probe the impact on neural encoding of natural stimulus variability, the prior over the latent variable, noise power, and the choice of cost function. Then, we examine the geometry of AMA’s unique combination of properties that distinguish it from better-known statistical methods. Using binocular disparity estimation as a concrete test case, we develop insights that have general implications for understanding neural encoding and decoding in a broad class of fundamental sensory-perceptual tasks connected to the energy model. Specifically, we find that non-orthogonal (partially redundant) filters with scaled additive noise tend to outperform orthogonal filters with constant additive noise; non-orthogonal filters and scaled additive noise can interact to sculpt noise-induced stimulus encoding uncertainty to match task-irrelevant stimulus variability. Thus, we show that some properties of neural response thought to be biophysical nuisances can confer coding advantages to neural systems. Finally, we speculate that, if repurposed for the problem of neural systems identification, AMA may be able to overcome a fundamental limitation of standard subunit model estimation. As natural stimuli become more widely used in the study of psychophysical and neurophysiological performance, we expect that task-specific methods for feature learning like AMA will become increasingly important.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PJx-D8CruVc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: MAP7 Regulates Axon Collateral Branch Development in Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/6/1648?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Collateral branches from axons are key components of functional neural circuits that allow neurons to connect with multiple synaptic targets. Like axon growth and guidance, formation of collateral branches depends on the regulation of microtubules, but how such regulation is coordinated to ensure proper circuit development is not known. Based on microarray analysis, we have identified a role for microtubule-associated protein 7 (MAP7) during collateral branch development of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons. We show that MAP7 is expressed at the onset of collateral branch formation. Perturbation of its expression by overexpression or shRNA knockdown alters axon branching in cultured DRG neurons. Localization and time-lapse imaging analysis reveals that MAP7 is enriched at branch points and colocalizes with stable microtubules, but enters the new branch with a delay, suggesting a role in branch maturation. We have also investigated a spontaneous mutant mouse that expresses a truncated MAP7 and found a gain-of-function phenotype both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Further domain analysis suggests that the amino half of MAP7 is responsible for branch formation, suggesting a mechanism that is independent of its known interaction with kinesin. Moreover, this mouse exhibits increased pain sensitivity, a phenotype that is consistent with increased collateral branch formation. Therefore, our study not only uncovers the first neuronal function of MAP7, but also demonstrates the importance of proper microtubule regulation in neural circuit development. Furthermore, our data provide new insights into microtubule regulation during axonal morphogenesis and may shed light on MAP7 function in neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neurons communicate with multiple targets by forming axonal branches. In search of intrinsic factors that control collateral branch development, we identified a role for microtubule-associated protein 7 (MAP7) in dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons. We show that MAP7 expression is developmentally regulated and perturbation of this expression alters branch formation. Cell biological analysis indicates that MAP7 promotes branch maturation. Analysis of a spontaneous mouse mutant suggests a molecular mechanism for branch regulation and the potential influence of collateral branches on pain sensitivity. Our studies thus establish the first neuronal function of MAP7 and demonstrate its role in branch morphogenesis and neural circuit function. These findings may help in our understanding of the contribution of MAP7 to neurological disorders and nerve regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The present study focuses on the function of cpg15, a neurotrophic factor, in ischemic neuronal recovery using transient global cerebral ischemic (TGI) mouse model and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated primary cultured cells. The results showed that expression of cpg15 proteins in astrocytes, predominantly the soluble form, was significantly increased in mouse hippocampus after TGI and in the cultured astrocytes after OGD. Addition of the medium from the cpg15-overexpressed astrocytic culture into the OGD-treated hippocampal neuronal cultures reduces the neuronal injury, whereas the recovery of neurite outgrowths of OGD-injured neurons was prevented when cpg15 in the OGD-treated astrocytes was knocked down, or the OGD-treated-astrocytic medium was immunoadsorbed by cpg15 antibody. Furthermore, lentivirus-delivered knockdown of cpg15 expression in mouse hippocampal astrocytes diminishes the dendritic branches and exacerbates injury of neurons in CA1 region after TGI. In addition, treatment with inhibitors of MEK1/2, PI3K, and TrkA decreases, whereas overexpression of p-CREB, but not dp-CREB, increases the expression of cpg15 in U118 or primary cultured astrocytes. Also, it is observed that the Flag-tagged soluble cpg15 from the astrocytes transfected with Flag-tagged cpg15-expressing plasmids adheres to the surface of neuronal bodies and the neurites. In conclusion, our results suggest that the soluble cpg15 from astrocytes induced by ischemia could ameliorate the recovery of the ischemic-injured hippocampal neurons via adhering to the surface of neurons. The upregulated expression of cpg15 in astrocytes may be activated via MAPK and PI3K signal pathways, and regulation of CREB phosphorylation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuronal plasticity plays a crucial role in the amelioration of neurological recovery of ischemic injured brain, which remains a challenge for clinic treatment of cerebral ischemia. cpg15 as a synaptic plasticity-related factor may participate in promoting the recovery process; however, the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. The objective of this study is to reveal the function and mechanism of neuronal-specific cpg15 expressed in astrocytes after ischemia induction, in promoting the recovery of injured neurons. Our findings provided new mechanistic insight into the neurological recovery, which might help develop novel therapeutic options for cerebral ischemia via astrocytic-targeting interference of gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Human Exploration of Enclosed Spaces through Echolocation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Some blind humans have developed echolocation, as a method of navigation in space. Echolocation is a truly active sense because subjects analyze echoes of dedicated, self-generated sounds to assess space around them. Using a special virtual space technique, we assess how humans perceive enclosed spaces through echolocation, thereby revealing the interplay between sensory and vocal-motor neural activity while humans perform this task. Sighted subjects were trained to detect small changes in virtual-room size analyzing real-time generated echoes of their vocalizations. Individual differences in performance were related to the type and number of vocalizations produced. We then asked subjects to estimate virtual-room size with either active or passive sounds while measuring their brain activity with fMRI. Subjects were better at estimating room size when actively vocalizing. This was reflected in the hemodynamic activity of vocal-motor cortices, even after individual motor and sensory components were removed. Activity in these areas also varied with perceived room size, although the vocal-motor output was unchanged. In addition, thalamic and auditory-midbrain activity was correlated with perceived room size; a likely result of top-down auditory pathways for human echolocation, comparable with those described in echolocating bats. Our data provide evidence that human echolocation is supported by active sensing, both behaviorally and in terms of brain activity. The neural sensory-motor coupling complements the fundamental acoustic motor-sensory coupling via the environment in echolocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Passive listening is the predominant method for examining brain activity during echolocation, the auditory analysis of self-generated sounds. We show that sighted humans perform better when they actively vocalize than during passive listening. Correspondingly, vocal motor and cerebellar activity is greater during active echolocation than vocalization alone. Motor and subcortical auditory brain activity covaries with the auditory percept, although motor output is unchanged. Our results reveal behaviorally relevant neural sensory-motor coupling during echolocation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cerebellar tDCS Modulates Neural Circuits during Semantic Prediction: A Combined tDCS-fMRI Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/6/1604?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It has been proposed that the cerebellum acquires internal models of mental processes that enable prediction, allowing for the optimization of behavior. In language, semantic prediction speeds speech production and comprehension. Right cerebellar lobules VI and VII (including Crus I/II) are engaged during a variety of language processes and are functionally connected with cerebral cortical language networks. Further, right posterolateral cerebellar neuromodulation modifies behavior during predictive language processing. These data are consistent with a role for the cerebellum in semantic processing and semantic prediction. We combined transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and fMRI to assess the behavioral and neural consequences of cerebellar tDCS during a sentence completion task. Task-based and resting-state fMRI data were acquired in healthy human adults (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 32; μ = 23.1 years) both before and after 20 min of 1.5 mA anodal (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 18) or sham (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 14) tDCS applied to the right posterolateral cerebellum. In the sentence completion task, the first four words of the sentence modulated the predictability of the final target word. In some sentences, the preceding context strongly predicted the target word, whereas other sentences were nonpredictive. Completion of predictive sentences increased activation in right Crus I/II of the cerebellum. Relative to sham tDCS, anodal tDCS increased activation in right Crus I/II during semantic prediction and enhanced resting-state functional connectivity between hubs of the reading/language networks. These results are consistent with a role for the right posterolateral cerebellum beyond motor aspects of language, and suggest that cerebellar internal models of linguistic stimuli support semantic prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cerebellar involvement in language tasks and language networks is now well established, yet the specific cerebellar contribution to language processing remains unclear. It is thought that the cerebellum acquires internal models of mental processes that enable prediction, allowing for the optimization of behavior. Here we combined neuroimaging and neuromodulation to provide evidence that the cerebellum is specifically involved in semantic prediction during sentence processing. We found that activation within right Crus I/II was enhanced when semantic predictions were made, and we show that modulation of this region with transcranial direct current stimulation alters both activation patterns and functional connectivity within whole-brain language networks. For the first time, these data show that cerebellar neuromodulation impacts activation patterns specifically during predictive language processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Posterior {alpha} EEG Dynamics Dissociate Current from Future Goals in Working Memory-Guided Visual Search</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/6/1591?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Current models of visual search assume that search is guided by an active visual working memory representation of what we are currently looking for. This attentional template for currently relevant stimuli can be dissociated from accessory memory representations that are only needed prospectively, for a future task, and that should be prevented from guiding current attention. However, it remains unclear what electrophysiological mechanisms dissociate currently relevant (serving upcoming selection) from prospectively relevant memories (serving future selection). We measured EEG of 20 human subjects while they performed two consecutive visual search tasks. Before the search tasks, a cue instructed observers which item to look for first (current template) and which second (prospective template). During the delay leading up to the first search display, we found clear suppression of α band (8–14 Hz) activity in regions contralateral to remembered items, comprising both local power and interregional phase synchronization within a posterior parietal network. Importantly, these lateralization effects were stronger when the memory item was currently relevant (i.e., for the first search) compared with when it was prospectively relevant (i.e., for the second search), consistent with current templates being prioritized over future templates. In contrast, event-related potential analysis revealed that the contralateral delay activity was similar for all conditions, suggesting no difference in storage. Together, these findings support the idea that posterior α oscillations represent a state of increased processing or excitability in task-relevant cortical regions, and reflect enhanced cortical prioritization of memory representations that serve as a current selection filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our days are filled with looking for relevant objects while ignoring irrelevant visual information. Such visual search activity is thought to be driven by current goals activated in working memory. However, working memory not only serves current goals, but also future goals, with differential impact upon visual selection. Little is known about how the brain differentiates between current and future goals. Here we show, for the first time, that modulations of brain oscillations in the EEG α frequency band in posterior cortex can dissociate current from future search goals in working memory. Moreover, the dynamics of these oscillations uncover how we flexibly switch focus between memory representations. Together, we reveal how the brain assigns priority for selection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dampened Amphetamine-Stimulated Behavior and Altered Dopamine Transporter Function in the Absence of Brain GDNF</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/6/1581?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Midbrain dopamine neuron dysfunction contributes to various psychiatric and neurological diseases, including drug addiction and Parkinson's disease. Because of its well established dopaminotrophic effects, the therapeutic potential of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been studied extensively in various disorders with disturbed dopamine homeostasis. However, the outcomes from preclinical and clinical studies vary, highlighting a need for a better understanding of the physiological role of GDNF on striatal dopaminergic function. Nevertheless, the current lack of appropriate animal models has limited this understanding. Therefore, we have generated novel mouse models to study conditional &lt;i&gt;Gdnf&lt;/i&gt; deletion in the CNS during embryonic development and reduction of striatal GDNF levels in adult mice via AAV-Cre delivery. We found that both of these mice have reduced amphetamine-induced locomotor response and striatal dopamine efflux. Embryonic GDNF deletion in the CNS did not affect striatal dopamine levels or dopamine release, but dopamine reuptake was increased due to increased levels of both total and synaptic membrane-associated dopamine transporters. Collectively, these results suggest that endogenous GDNF plays an important role in regulating the function of dopamine transporters in the striatum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Delivery of ectopic glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) promotes the function, plasticity, and survival of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, the dysfunction of which contributes to various neurological and psychiatric diseases. However, how the deletion or reduction of GDNF in the CNS affects the function of dopaminergic neurons has remained unknown. Using conditional &lt;i&gt;Gdnf&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice, we found that endogenous GDNF affects striatal dopamine homeostasis and regulates amphetamine-induced behaviors by regulating the level and function of dopamine transporters. These data regarding the physiological role of GDNF are relevant in the context of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases that involve changes in dopamine transporter function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Calpain-Mediated Proteolysis of Talin and FAK Regulates Adhesion Dynamics Necessary for Axon Guidance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/6/1568?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Guidance of axons to their proper synaptic target sites requires spatially and temporally precise modulation of biochemical signals within growth cones. Ionic calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) is an essential signal for axon guidance that mediates opposing effects on growth cone motility. The diverse effects of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; arise from the precise localization of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals into microdomains containing specific Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; effectors. For example, differences in the mechanical and chemical composition of the underlying substrata elicit local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals within growth cone filopodia that regulate axon guidance through activation of the protease calpain. However, how calpain regulates growth cone motility remains unclear. Here, we identify the adhesion proteins talin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) as proteolytic targets of calpain in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; spinal cord neurons both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Inhibition of calpain increases the localization of endogenous adhesion signaling to growth cone filopodia. Using live cell microscopy and specific calpain-resistant point-mutants of talin (L432G) and FAK (V744G), we find that calpain inhibits paxillin-based adhesion assembly through cleavage of talin and FAK, and adhesion disassembly through cleavage of FAK. Blocking calpain cleavage of talin and FAK inhibits repulsive turning from focal uncaging of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; within filopodia. In addition, blocking calpain cleavage of talin and FAK &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; promotes Rohon–Beard peripheral axon extension into the skin. These data demonstrate that filopodial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals regulate axon outgrowth and guidance through calpain regulation of adhesion dynamics through specific cleavage of talin and FAK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The proper formation of neuronal networks requires accurate guidance of axons and dendrites during development by motile structures known as growth cones. Understanding the intracellular signaling mechanisms that govern growth cone motility will clarify how the nervous system develops and regenerates, and may identify areas of therapeutic intervention in disease or injury. One important signal that controls growth cones is that of local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, which control the rate and direction of axon outgrowth. We demonstrate here that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent inhibition axon outgrowth and guidance is mediated by calpain proteolysis of the adhesion proteins talin and focal adhesion kinase. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calpain regulation of growth cone motility and axon guidance during neuronal development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Visual Stimulus Speed Does Not Influence the Rapid Emergence of Direction Selectivity in Ferret Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/6/1557?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory experience is necessary for the development of some receptive field properties of neurons in primary sensory cortical areas. However, it remains unclear whether the parameters of an individual animal's experience play an instructive role and influence the tuning parameters of cortical sensory neurons as selectivity emerges, or rather whether experience merely permits the completion of processes that are fully seeded at the onset of experience. Here we have examined whether the speed of visual stimuli that are presented to visually naive ferrets can influence the parameters of speed tuning and direction selectivity in cortical neurons. Visual experience is necessary for the development of direction selectivity in carnivores. If, during development, cortical neurons had the flexibility to choose from among different inputs with a range of spatial positions and temporal delays, then correlation-based plasticity mechanisms could instruct the precise spatiotemporal selectivity that underlies speed tuning and direction selectivity, and the parameters of an individual animal's experience would influence the tuning that emerges. Alternatively, the tuning parameters of these neurons may already be established at the onset of visual experience, and experience may merely permit the expression of this tuning. We found that providing different groups of animals with either slow (12.5 deg/s) or fast (50 deg/s) visual stimuli resulted in emergence of direction selectivity, but that speed tuning and direction selectivity were similar in the two groups. These results are more consistent with a permissive role for experience in the development of direction selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The proper development of brain circuits and neural response properties depends on both nature (factors independent of experience) and nurture (factors dependent on experience). In this study, we examined whether the quality of visual experience of an individual animal influences the development of basic sensory detectors in primary visual cortex. We found that, although visual experience is required for the development of direction selectivity, tuning for stimulus speed could not be altered by specific experience with slow or fast stimuli. These results suggest that the tuning parameters for direction selectivity are specified independently of an animal's sensory experience, and that a range of experiences can promote the proper mature expression of direction selectivity in primary visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Visual Population Receptive Fields in People with Schizophrenia Have Reduced Inhibitory Surrounds</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;People with schizophrenia (SZ) experience abnormal visual perception on a range of visual tasks, which have been linked to abnormal synaptic transmission and an imbalance between cortical excitation and inhibition. However, differences in the underlying architecture of visual cortex neurons, which might explain these visual anomalies, have yet to be reported &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we probed the neural basis of these deficits using fMRI and population receptive field (pRF) mapping to infer properties of visually responsive neurons in people with SZ. We employed a difference-of-Gaussian model to capture the center-surround configuration of the pRF, providing critical information about the spatial scale of the pRFs inhibitory surround. Our analysis reveals that SZ is associated with reduced pRF size in early retinotopic visual cortex, as well as a reduction in size and depth of the inhibitory surround in V1, V2, and V4. We consider how reduced inhibition might explain the diverse range of visual deficits reported in SZ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; People with schizophrenia (SZ) experience abnormal perception on a range of visual tasks, which has been linked to abnormal synaptic transmission and an imbalance between cortical excitation/inhibition. However, associated differences in the functional architecture of visual cortex neurons have yet to be reported &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We used fMRI and population receptive field (pRF) mapping to demonstrate that the fine-grained functional architecture of visual cortex in people with SZ differs from unaffected controls. SZ is associated with reduced pRF size in early retinotopic visual cortex largely due to reduced inhibitory surrounds. An imbalance between cortical excitation and inhibition could drive such a change in the center-surround pRF configuration and ultimately explain the range of visual deficits experienced in SZ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sex-Dependent Regulation of Aromatase-Mediated Synaptic Plasticity in the Basolateral Amygdala</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/6/1532?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/6/1532?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The basolateral amygdala (BLA) integrates sensory input from cortical and subcortical regions, a function that requires marked synaptic plasticity. Here we provide evidence that cytochrome P450 aromatase (AROM), the enzyme converting testosterone to 17β-estradiol (E2), contributes to the regulation of this plasticity in a sex-specific manner. We show that AROM is expressed in the BLA, particularly in the basolateral nucleus (BL), in male and female rodents. Systemic administration of the AROM inhibitor letrozole reduced spine synapse density in the BL of adult female mice but not in the BL of male mice. Similarly, in organotypic corticoamygdalar slice cultures from immature rats, treatment with letrozole significantly reduced spine synapses in the BL only in cultures derived from females. In addition, letrozole sex-specifically altered synaptic properties in the BL: in acute slices from juvenile (prepubertal) female rats, wash-in of letrozole virtually abolished long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas it did not prevent the generation of LTP in the slices from males. Together, these data indicate that neuron-derived E2 modulates synaptic plasticity in rodent BLA sex-dependently. As protein expression levels of AROM, estrogen and androgen receptors did not differ between males and females and were not sex-specifically altered by letrozole, the findings suggest sex-specific mechanisms of E2 signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key structure of the fear circuit. This research reveals a sexually dimorphic regulation of synaptic plasticity in the BLA involving neuronal aromatase, which produces the neurosteroid 17β-estradiol (E2). As male and female neurons in rodent BLA responded differently to aromatase inhibition both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, our findings suggest that E2 signaling in BLA neurons is regulated sex-dependently, presumably via mechanisms that have been established during sexual determination. These findings could be relevant for the understanding of sex differences in mood disorders and of the side effects of cytochrome P450 aromatase inhibitors, which are frequently used for breast cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Impact of Altered Cholinergic Tones on the Neurovascular Coupling Response to Whisker Stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/6/1518?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging techniques that use vascular signals to map changes in neuronal activity rely on the coupling between electrophysiology and hemodynamics, a phenomenon referred to as &quot;neurovascular coupling&quot; (NVC). It is unknown whether this relationship remains reliable under altered brain states associated with acetylcholine (ACh) levels, such as attention and arousal and in pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. We therefore assessed the effects of varying ACh tone on whisker-evoked NVC responses in rat barrel cortex, measured by cerebral blood flow (CBF) and neurophysiological recordings (local field potentials, LFPs). We found that acutely enhanced ACh tone significantly potentiated whisker-evoked CBF responses through muscarinic ACh receptors and concurrently facilitated neuronal responses, as illustrated by increases in the amplitude and power in high frequencies of the evoked LFPs. However, the cellular identity of the activated neuronal network within the responsive barrel was unchanged, as characterized by c-Fos upregulation in pyramidal cells and GABA interneurons coexpressing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. In contrast, chronic ACh deprivation hindered whisker-evoked CBF responses and the amplitude and power in most frequency bands of the evoked LFPs and reduced the rostrocaudal extent and area of the activated barrel without altering its identity. Correlations between LFP power and CBF, used to estimate NVC, were enhanced under high ACh tone and disturbed significantly by ACh depletion. We conclude that ACh is not only a facilitator but also a prerequisite for the full expression of sensory-evoked NVC responses, indicating that ACh may alter the fidelity of hemodynamic signals in assessing changes in evoked neuronal activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neurovascular coupling, defined as the tight relationship between activated neurons and hemodynamic responses, is a fundamental brain function that underlies hemodynamic-based functional brain imaging techniques. However, the impact of altered brain states on this relationship is largely unknown. We therefore investigated how acetylcholine (ACh), known to drive brain states of attention and arousal and to be deficient in pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, would alter neurovascular coupling responses to sensory stimulation. Whereas acutely increased ACh enhanced neuronal responses and the resulting hemodynamic signals, chronic loss of cholinergic input resulted in dramatic impairments in both types of sensory-evoked signals. We conclude that ACh is not only a potent modulator but also a requirement for the full expression of sensory-evoked neurovascular coupling responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Functional Organization of Cutaneous and Muscle Afferent Synapses onto Immature Spinal Lamina I Projection Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/6/1505?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is well established that sensory afferents innervating muscle are more effective at inducing hyperexcitability within spinal cord circuits compared with skin afferents, which likely contributes to the higher prevalence of chronic musculoskeletal pain compared with pain of cutaneous origin. However, the mechanisms underlying these differences in central nociceptive signaling remain incompletely understood, as nothing is known about how superficial dorsal horn neurons process sensory input from muscle versus skin at the synaptic level. Using a novel &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; spinal cord preparation, here we identify the functional organization of muscle and cutaneous afferent synapses onto immature rat lamina I spino-parabrachial neurons, which serve as a major source of nociceptive transmission to the brain. Stimulation of the gastrocnemius nerve and sural nerve revealed significant convergence of muscle and cutaneous afferent synaptic input onto individual projection neurons. Muscle afferents displayed a higher probability of glutamate release, although short-term synaptic plasticity was similar between the groups. Importantly, muscle afferent synapses exhibited greater relative expression of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable AMPARs compared with cutaneous inputs. In addition, the prevalence and magnitude of spike timing-dependent long-term potentiation were significantly higher at muscle afferent synapses, where it required Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable AMPAR activation. Collectively, these results provide the first evidence for afferent-specific properties of glutamatergic transmission within the superficial dorsal horn. A larger propensity for activity-dependent strengthening at muscle afferent synapses onto developing spinal projection neurons could contribute to the enhanced ability of these sensory inputs to sensitize central nociceptive networks and thereby evoke persistent pain in children following injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the high prevalence of chronic musculoskeletal pain remain poorly understood, in part because little is known about why sensory neurons innervating muscle appear more capable of sensitizing nociceptive pathways in the CNS compared with skin afferents. The present study identifies, for the first time, the functional properties of muscle and cutaneous afferent synapses onto immature lamina I projection neurons, which convey nociceptive information to the brain. Despite many similarities, an enhanced relative expression of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable AMPA receptors at muscle afferent synapses drives greater LTP following repetitive stimulation.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dopamine Modulates the Functional Organization of the Orbitofrontal Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulators such as dopamine can alter the intrinsic firing properties of neurons and may thereby change the configuration of larger functional circuits. The primate orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) receives dopaminergic input from midbrain nuclei, but the role of dopamine in the OFC is still unclear. Here we tested the idea that dopaminergic activity changes the pattern of connectivity between the OFC and the rest of the brain and thereby reconfigures functional networks in the OFC. To this end, we combined double-blind, placebo-controlled pharmacology [D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (D2R) antagonist amisulpride] in humans with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and clustering methods. In the placebo group, we replicated previously observed parcellations of the OFC into two and six subregions based on connectivity patterns with the rest of the brain. Most importantly, while the twofold clustering did not differ significantly between groups, blocking D2Rs significantly changed the composition of the sixfold parcellation, suggesting a dopamine-dependent reconfiguration of functional OFC subregions. Moreover, multivariate decoding analyses revealed that amisulpride changed the whole-brain connectivity patterns of individual OFC subregions. In particular, D2R blockade shifted the balance of OFC connectivity from associative areas in the temporal and parietal lobe toward functional connectivity with the frontal cortex. In summary, our results suggest that dopamine alters the composition of functional OFC circuits, possibly indicating a broader role for neuromodulators in the dynamic reconfiguration of functional brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A key role of any neuromodulator may be the reconfiguration of functional brain circuits. Here we test this idea with regard to dopamine and the organization of functional networks in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). We show that blockade of dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors has profound effects on the functional connectivity patterns of the OFC, yielding altered connectivity-based subdivisions of this region. Our results suggest that dopamine changes the connectional configuration of the OFC, possibly leading to transitions between different operating modes that favor either sensory input or recurrent processing in the prefrontal cortex. More generally, our findings support a broader role for neuromodulators in the dynamic reconfiguration of functional brain networks and may have clinical implications for understanding the actions of antipsychotic agents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Creatine Enhances Mitochondrial-Mediated Oligodendrocyte Survival After Demyelinating Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/6/1479?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic oligodendrocyte loss, which occurs in the demyelinating disorder multiple sclerosis (MS), contributes to axonal dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Current therapies are able to reduce MS severity, but do not prevent transition into the progressive phase of the disease, which is characterized by chronic neurodegeneration. Therefore, pharmacological compounds that promote oligodendrocyte survival could be beneficial for neuroprotection in MS. Here, we investigated the role of creatine, an organic acid involved in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) buffering, in oligodendrocyte function. We found that creatine increased mitochondrial ATP production directly in oligodendrocyte lineage cell cultures and exerted robust protection on oligodendrocytes by preventing cell death in both naive and lipopolysaccharide-treated mixed glia. Moreover, lysolecithin-mediated demyelination in mice deficient in the creatine-synthesizing enzyme guanidinoacetate-methyltransferase (&lt;i&gt;Gamt&lt;/i&gt;) did not affect oligodendrocyte precursor cell recruitment, but resulted in exacerbated apoptosis of regenerated oligodendrocytes in central nervous system (CNS) lesions. Remarkably, creatine administration into &lt;i&gt;Gamt&lt;/i&gt;-deficient and wild-type mice with demyelinating injury reduced oligodendrocyte apoptosis, thereby increasing oligodendrocyte density and myelin basic protein staining in CNS lesions. We found that creatine did not affect the recruitment of macrophages/microglia into lesions, suggesting that creatine affects oligodendrocyte survival independently of inflammation. Together, our results demonstrate a novel function for creatine in promoting oligodendrocyte viability during CNS remyelination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We report that creatine enhances oligodendrocyte mitochondrial function and protects against caspase-dependent oligodendrocyte apoptosis during CNS remyelination. This work has important implications for the development of therapeutic targets for diseases characterized by oligodendrocyte death, including multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Mammalian Retinal Ganglion Cell Implements a Neuronal Computation That Maximizes the SNR of Its Postsynaptic Currents</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/6/1468?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons perform computations by integrating excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Yet, it is rarely understood what computation is being performed, or how much excitation or inhibition this computation requires. Here we present evidence for a neuronal computation that maximizes the signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR). We recorded from OFF delta retinal ganglion cells in the guinea pig retina and monitored synaptic currents that were evoked by visual stimulation (flashing dark spots). These synaptic currents were mediated by a decrease in an outward current from inhibitory synapses (disinhibition) combined with an increase in an inward current from excitatory synapses. We found that the SNR of combined excitatory and disinhibitory currents was voltage sensitive, peaking at membrane potentials near resting potential. At the membrane potential for maximal SNR, the amplitude of each current, either excitatory or disinhibitory, was proportional to its SNR. Such proportionate scaling is the theoretically best strategy for combining excitatory and disinhibitory currents to maximize the SNR of their combined current. Moreover, as spot size or contrast changed, the amplitudes of excitatory and disinhibitory currents also changed but remained in proportion to their SNRs, indicating a dynamic rebalancing of excitatory and inhibitory currents to maximize SNR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We present evidence that the balance of excitatory and disinhibitory inputs to a type of retinal ganglion cell maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio power ratio (SNR) of its postsynaptic currents. This is significant because chemical synapses on a retinal ganglion cell require the probabilistic release of transmitter. Consequently, when the same visual stimulus is presented repeatedly, postsynaptic currents vary in amplitude. Thus, maximizing SNR may be a strategy for producing the most reliable signal possible given the inherent unreliability of synaptic transmission.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Model of the Superior Colliculus Predicts Fixation Locations during Scene Viewing and Visual Search</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/6/1453?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modern computational models of attention predict fixations using saliency maps and target maps, which prioritize locations for fixation based on feature contrast and target goals, respectively. But whereas many such models are biologically plausible, none have looked to the oculomotor system for design constraints or parameter specification. Conversely, although most models of saccade programming are tightly coupled to underlying neurophysiology, none have been tested using real-world stimuli and tasks. We combined the strengths of these two approaches in MASC, a model of attention in the superior colliculus (SC) that captures known neurophysiological constraints on saccade programming. We show that MASC predicted the fixation locations of humans freely viewing naturalistic scenes and performing exemplar and categorical search tasks, a breadth achieved by no other existing model. Moreover, it did this as well or better than its more specialized state-of-the-art competitors. MASC's predictive success stems from its inclusion of high-level but core principles of SC organization: an over-representation of foveal information, size-invariant population codes, cascaded population averaging over distorted visual and motor maps, and competition between motor point images for saccade programming, all of which cause further modulation of priority (attention) after projection of saliency and target maps to the SC. Only by incorporating these organizing brain principles into our models can we fully understand the transformation of complex visual information into the saccade programs underlying movements of overt attention. With MASC, a theoretical footing now exists to generate and test computationally explicit predictions of behavioral and neural responses in visually complex real-world contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The superior colliculus (SC) performs a visual-to-motor transformation vital to overt attention, but existing SC models cannot predict saccades to visually complex real-world stimuli. We introduce a brain-inspired SC model that outperforms state-of-the-art image-based competitors in predicting the sequences of fixations made by humans performing a range of everyday tasks (scene viewing and exemplar and categorical search), making clear the value of looking to the brain for model design. This work is significant in that it will drive new research by making computationally explicit predictions of SC neural population activity in response to naturalistic stimuli and tasks. It will also serve as a blueprint for the construction of other brain-inspired models, helping to usher in the next generation of truly intelligent autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Adenosine Shifts Plasticity Regimes between Associative and Homeostatic by Modulating Heterosynaptic Changes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/6/1439?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Endogenous extracellular adenosine level fluctuates in an activity-dependent manner and with sleep–wake cycle, modulating synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity. Hebbian-type long-term plasticity introduces intrinsic positive feedback on synaptic weight changes, making them prone to runaway dynamics. We previously demonstrated that co-occurring, weight-dependent heterosynaptic plasticity can robustly prevent runaway dynamics. Here we show that at neocortical synapses in slices from rat visual cortex, adenosine modulates the weight dependence of heterosynaptic plasticity: blockade of adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors abolished weight dependence, while increased adenosine level strengthened it. Using model simulations, we found that the strength of weight dependence determines the ability of heterosynaptic plasticity to prevent runaway dynamics of synaptic weights imposed by Hebbian-type learning. Changing the weight dependence of heterosynaptic plasticity within an experimentally observed range gradually shifted the operating point of neurons between an unbalancing regime dominated by associative plasticity and a homeostatic regime of tightly constrained synaptic changes. Because adenosine tone is a natural correlate of activity level (activity increases adenosine tone) and brain state (elevated adenosine tone increases sleep pressure), modulation of heterosynaptic plasticity by adenosine represents an endogenous mechanism that translates changes of the brain state into a shift of the regime of synaptic plasticity and learning. We speculate that adenosine modulation may provide a mechanism for fine-tuning of plasticity and learning according to brain state and activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Associative learning depends on brain state and is impaired when the subject is sleepy or tired. However, the link between changes of brain state and modulation of synaptic plasticity and learning remains elusive. Here we show that adenosine regulates weight dependence of heterosynaptic plasticity: adenosine strengthened weight dependence of heterosynaptic plasticity; blockade of adenosine A1 receptors abolished it. In model neurons, such changes of the weight dependence of heterosynaptic plasticity shifted their operating point between regimes dominated by associative plasticity or by synaptic homeostasis. Because adenosine tone is a natural correlate of activity level and brain state, modulation of plasticity by adenosine represents an endogenous mechanism for translation of brain state changes into a shift of the regime of synaptic plasticity and learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Differences in Glomerular-Layer-Mediated Feedforward Inhibition onto Mitral and Tufted Cells Lead to Distinct Modes of Intensity Coding</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/6/1428?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding how each of the many interneuron subtypes affects brain network activity is critical. In the mouse olfactory system, mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs) comprise parallel pathways of olfactory bulb output that are thought to play distinct functional roles in odor coding. Here, in acute mouse olfactory bulb slices, we test how the two major classes of olfactory bulb interneurons differentially contribute to differences in MC versus TC response properties. We show that, whereas TCs respond to olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) stimulation with short latencies regardless of stimulation intensity, MC latencies correlate negatively with stimulation intensity. These differences between MCs and TCs are caused in part by weaker excitatory and stronger inhibitory currents onto MCs than onto TCs. These differences in inhibition between MCs and TCs are most pronounced during the first 150 ms after stimulation and are mediated by glomerular layer circuits. Therefore, blocking inhibition originating in the glomerular layer, but not granule-cell-mediated inhibition, reduces MC spike latency at weak stimulation intensities and distinct temporal patterns of odor-evoked responses in MCs and TCs emerge in part due to differences in glomerular-layer-mediated inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Olfactory bulb mitral and tufted cells display different odor-evoked responses and are thought to form parallel channels of olfactory bulb output. Therefore, determining the circuit-level causes that drive these differences is vital. Here, we find that longer-latency responses in mitral cells, compared with tufted cells, are due to weaker excitation and stronger glomerular-layer-mediated inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Targeting Extracellular Cyclophilin A Reduces Neuroinflammation and Extends Survival in a Mouse Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/6/1413?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation is a major hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is currently untreatable. Several anti-inflammatory compounds have been evaluated in patients and in animal models of ALS, but have been proven disappointing in part because effective targets have not yet been identified. Cyclophilin A, also known as peptidylprolyl cis-/trans-isomerase A (PPIA), as a foldase is beneficial intracellularly, but extracellularly has detrimental functions. We found that extracellular PPIA is a mediator of neuroinflammation in ALS. It is a major inducer of matrix metalloproteinase 9 and is selectively toxic for motor neurons. High levels of PPIA were found in the CSF of SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mice and rats and sporadic ALS patients, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for familial and sporadic cases. A specific inhibitor of extracellular PPIA, MM218, given at symptom onset, rescued motor neurons and extended survival in the SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mouse model of familial ALS by 11 d. The treatment resulted in the polarization of glia toward a prohealing phenotype associated with reduced NF-B activation, proinflammatory markers, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and insoluble phosphorylated TDP-43. Our results indicates that extracellular PPIA is a promising druggable target for ALS and support further studies to develop a therapy to arrest or slow the progression of the disease in patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We provide evidence that extracellular cyclophilin A, also known as peptidylprolyl cis-/trans-isomerase A (PPIA), is a mediator of the neuroinflammatory reaction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and is toxic for motor neurons. Supporting this, a specific extracellular PPIA inhibitor reduced neuroinflammation, rescued motor neurons, and extended survival in the SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mouse model of familial ALS. Our findings suggest selective pharmacological inhibition of extracellular PPIA as a novel therapeutic strategy, not only for SOD1-linked ALS, but possibly also for sporadic ALS. This approach aims to address the neuroinflammatory reaction that is a major hallmark of ALS. However, given the complexity of the disease, a combination of therapeutic approaches may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>: Cap-proximal nucleotides via differential eIF4E binding and alternative promoter usage mediate translational response to energy stress</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21907</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21907</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcription start-site (TSS) selection and alternative promoter (AP) usage contribute to gene expression complexity but little is known about their impact on translation. Here we performed TSS mapping of the translatome following energy stress. Assessing the contribution of cap-proximal TSS nucleotides, we found dramatic effect on translation only upon stress. As eIF4E levels were reduced, we determined its binding to capped-RNAs with different initiating nucleotides and found the lowest affinity to 5'cytidine in correlation with the translational stress-response. In addition, the number of differentially translated APs was elevated following stress. These include novel glucose starvation-induced downstream transcripts for the translation regulators eIF4A and Pabp, which are also translationally-induced despite general translational inhibition. The resultant eIF4A protein is N-terminally truncated and acts as eIF4A inhibitor. The induced Pabp isoform has shorter 5'UTR removing an auto-inhibitory element. Our findings uncovered several levels of coordination of transcription and translation responses to energy stress.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>In this issue of Neuron, Ashrafi et al. show that the insulin-regulated glucose transporter GLUT4 translocates to the plasma membrane where it sustains the ATP production required for synaptic vesicle cycling. However, translocation occurs from presynaptic membranes other than synaptic vesicles and involves a distinct molecular mechanism.</description>

	<description>Three studies by Danielson et al., GoodSmith et al., and Sensai and Buzsáki distinguish in vivo firing properties of dentate mossy cells from granule cells during behavior. Robust spatial remapping of mossy cells, in contrast to sparse firing of granule cells, suggests differential involvement in pattern separation.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Bayesian phylogeography of influenza A/H3N2 for the 2014-15 season in the United States using three frameworks of ancestral state reconstruction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005389</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/lHENvrwCCBI/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Magee, Marc A. Suchard, Matthew Scotch&lt;/p&gt;

Ancestral state reconstruction in Bayesian phylogeography of virus pandemics have been improved by utilizing a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) framework. Recently, this framework has been extended to model the transition rate matrix between discrete states as a generalized linear model (GLM) of genetic, geographic, demographic, and environmental predictors of interest to the virus and incorporating BSSVS to estimate the posterior inclusion probabilities of each predictor. Although the latter appears to enhance the biological validity of ancestral state reconstruction, there has yet to be a comparison of phylogenies created by the two methods. In this paper, we compare these two methods, while also using a primitive method without BSSVS, and highlight the differences in phylogenies created by each. We test six coalescent priors and six random sequence samples of H3N2 influenza during the 2014–15 flu season in the U.S. We show that the GLMs yield significantly greater root state posterior probabilities than the two alternative methods under five of the six priors, and significantly greater Kullback-Leibler divergence values than the two alternative methods under all priors. Furthermore, the GLMs strongly implicate temperature and precipitation as driving forces of this flu season and nearly unanimously identified a single root state, which exhibits the most tropical climate during a typical flu season in the U.S. The GLM, however, appears to be highly susceptible to sampling bias compared with the other methods, which casts doubt on whether its reconstructions should be favored over those created by alternate methods. We report that a BSSVS approach with a Poisson prior demonstrates less bias toward sample size under certain conditions than the GLMs or primitive models, and believe that the connection between reconstruction method and sampling bias warrants further investigation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lHENvrwCCBI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>: ERG-28 controls BK channel trafficking in the ER to regulate synaptic function and alcohol response in C. elegans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24733</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e24733</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Voltage- and calcium-dependent BK channels regulate calcium-dependent cellular events such as neurotransmitter release by limiting calcium influx. Their plasma membrane abundance is an important factor in determining BK current and thus regulation of calcium-dependent events. In &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;, we show that ERG-28, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein, promotes the trafficking of SLO-1 BK channels from the ER to the plasma membrane by shielding them from premature degradation. In the absence of ERG-28, SLO-1 channels undergo aspartic protease DDI-1-dependent degradation, resulting in markedly reduced expression at presynaptic terminals. Loss of &lt;em&gt;erg-28&lt;/em&gt; suppressed phenotypic defects of &lt;em&gt;slo-1&lt;/em&gt; gain-of-function mutants in locomotion, neurotransmitter release, and calcium-mediated asymmetric differentiation of the AWC olfactory neuron pair, and conferred significant ethanol-resistant locomotory behavior, resembling &lt;em&gt;slo-1&lt;/em&gt; loss-of-function mutants, albeit to a lesser extent. Our study thus indicates that the control of BK channel trafficking is a critical regulatory mechanism for synaptic transmission and neural function.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Genetic control of encoding strategy in a food-sensing neural circuit</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24040</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroendocrine circuits encode environmental information via changes in gene expression and other biochemical activities to regulate physiological responses. Previously, we showed that &lt;em&gt;daf-7&lt;/em&gt; TGF&lt;span class=&quot;inline-formula&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mathjax mml-math&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mi&gt;β&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;em&gt;tph-1&lt;/em&gt; tryptophan hydroxylase expression in specific neurons encode food abundance to modulate lifespan in &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;, and uncovered cross- and self-regulation among these genes (&lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/#bib11&quot;&gt;Entchev et al., 2015&lt;/a&gt;). Here, we now extend these findings by showing that these interactions between &lt;em&gt;daf-7&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;tph-1&lt;/em&gt; regulate redundancy and synergy among neurons in food encoding through coordinated control of circuit-level signal and noise properties. Our analysis further shows that &lt;em&gt;daf-7&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;tph-1&lt;/em&gt; contribute to most of the food-responsiveness in the modulation of lifespan. We applied a computational model to capture the general coding features of this system. This model agrees with our previous genetic analysis and highlights the consequences of redundancy and synergy during information transmission, suggesting a rationale for the regulation of these information processing features.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: The golden mimicry complex uses a wide spectrum of defence to deter a community of predators</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22089</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e22089</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mimicry complexes typically consist of multiple species that deter predators using similar anti-predatory signals. Mimics in these complexes are assumed to vary in their level of defence from highly defended through to moderately defended, or not defended at all. Here, we report a new multi-order mimicry complex that includes at least 140 different putative mimics from four arthropod orders including ants, wasps, bugs, tree hoppers and spiders. All members of this mimicry complex are characterised by a conspicuous golden body and an ant &lt;em&gt;Gestalt&lt;/em&gt;, but vary substantially in their defensive traits. However, they were similarly effective at deterring predators - even mildly defended mimics were rarely eaten by a community of invertebrate and vertebrate predators both in the wild and during staged trials. We propose that despite the predominance of less defended mimics the three predatory guilds avoid the mimics because of the additive influence of the various defensive traits.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Functional double dissociation within the entorhinal cortex for visual scene-dependent choice behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21543</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21543</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;How visual scene memory is processed differentially by the upstream structures of the hippocampus is largely unknown. We sought to dissociate functionally the lateral and medial subdivisions of the entorhinal cortex (LEC and MEC, respectively) in visual scene-dependent tasks by temporarily inactivating the LEC and MEC in the same rat. When the rat made spatial choices in a T-maze using visual scenes displayed on LCD screens, the inactivation of the MEC but not the LEC produced severe deficits in performance. However, when the task required the animal to push a jar or to dig in the sand in the jar using the same scene stimuli, the LEC but not the MEC became important. Our findings suggest that the entorhinal cortex is critical for scene-dependent mnemonic behavior, and the response modality may interact with a sensory modality to determine the involvement of the LEC and MEC in scene-based memory tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Generation of shape complexity through tissue conflict resolution</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20156</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e20156</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Out-of-plane tissue deformations are key morphogenetic events during plant and animal development that generate 3D shapes, such as flowers or limbs. However, the mechanisms by which spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression modify cellular behaviours to generate such deformations remain to be established. We use the Snapdragon flower as a model system to address this problem. Combining cellular analysis with tissue-level modelling, we show that an orthogonal pattern of growth orientations plays a key role in generating out-of-plane deformations. This growth pattern is most likely oriented by a polarity field, highlighted by PIN1 protein localisation, and is modulated by dorsoventral gene activity. The orthogonal growth pattern interacts with other patterns of differential growth to create tissue conflicts that shape the flower. Similar shape changes can be generated by contraction as well as growth, suggesting tissue conflict resolution provides a flexible morphogenetic mechanism for generating shape diversity in plants and animals.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: A long-term epigenetic memory switch controls bacterial virulence bimodality</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19599</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e19599</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When pathogens enter the host, sensing of environmental cues activates the expression of virulence genes. Opposite transition of pathogens from activating to non-activating conditions is poorly understood. Interestingly, variability in the expression of virulence genes upon infection enhances colonization. In order to systematically detect the role of phenotypic variability in enteropathogenic &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; (EPEC), an important human pathogen, both in virulence activating and non-activating conditions, we employed the ScanLag methodology. The analysis revealed a bimodal growth rate. Mathematical modeling combined with experimental analysis showed that this bimodality is mediated by a hysteretic memory-switch that results in the stable co-existence of non-virulent and hyper-virulent subpopulations, even after many generations of growth in non-activating conditions. We identified the &lt;em&gt;per&lt;/em&gt; operon as the key component of the hysteretic switch. This unique hysteretic memory switch may result in persistent infection and enhanced host-to-host spreading.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are ion channels activated by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and are essential to all aspects of brain function, including learning and memory formation. Missense mutations distributed throughout NMDAR subunits have been associated with an array of neurological disorders. Recent structural, functional, and computational studies have generated many insights into the activation process connecting glutamate binding to ion-channel opening, which is central to NMDAR physiology and pathophysiology.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pharmacogenetics of Antiepileptic Drug Efficacy in Childhood Absence Epilepsy</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Determine if common polymorphisms in CACNA1G, CACNA1H, CACNA1I, and ABCB1 are associated with differential short term seizure outcome in Childhood Absence Epilepsy (CAE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: 446 CAE children in a randomized double blind trial of ethosuximide, lamotrigine and valproate had short term seizure outcome determined. Associations between polymorphisms (minor allele frequency ≥15%) in four genes and seizure outcomes were assessed. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; electrophysiology on transfected CACNA1H channels determined impact of one variant on T-type calcium channel responsiveness to ethosuximide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: 80% (357/446) of subjects had informative short term seizure status (242 seizure free, 115 not seizure free). In ethosuximide subjects, two polymorphisms (CACNA1H rs61734410/P640L, CACNA1I rs3747178) appeared more commonly among not seizure free participants (p=0.011; Odds Ratio (OR):2.63; 95% Confidence limits (CL):1.25-5.56, p=0.026; OR:2.38; 95%CL:1.11-5.00). In lamotrigine subjects, one ABCB1 missense polymorphism (rs2032582/S893A, p=0.015; OR:2.22; 95%CL:1.16-4.17) was more common in not seizure free participants, two CACNA1H polymorphisms (rs2753326, rs2753325) were more common in seizure free participants (p=0.038; OR:0.52; 95%CL:0.28-0.96). In valproate subjects, no common polymorphisms associated with seizure status. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; electrophysiological studies showed no effect of the P640L polymorphism on channel physiology in ethosuximide's absence. Ethosuximide's effect on rate of decay of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.2 was significantly less for P640L channel compared to wild type channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Four T-type calcium channel variants and one ABCB1 transporter variant were associated with differential drug response in CAE. The &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; P640L variant's ethosuximide effect was confirmed by &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; electrophysiological studies. This suggests genetic variation plays a role in differential CAE drug response. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>: Role of Tim17 in coupling the import motor to the translocation channel of the mitochondrial presequence translocase</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22696</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e22696</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The majority of mitochondrial proteins use N-terminal presequences for targeting to mitochondria and are translocated by the presequence translocase. During translocation, proteins, threaded through the channel in the inner membrane, are handed over to the import motor at the matrix face. Tim17 is an essential, membrane-embedded subunit of the translocase; however, its function is only poorly understood. Here, we functionally dissected its four predicted transmembrane (TM) segments. Mutations in TM1 and TM2 impaired the interaction of Tim17 with Tim23, component of the translocation channel, whereas mutations in TM3 compromised binding of the import motor. We identified residues in the matrix-facing region of Tim17 involved in binding of the import motor. Our results reveal functionally distinct roles of different regions of Tim17 and suggest how they may be involved in handing over the proteins, during their translocation into mitochondria, from the channel to the import motor of the presequence translocase.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Elucidation of a four-site allosteric network in fibroblast growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21137</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21137</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling is tightly regulated by protein allostery within the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains. Yet the molecular determinants of allosteric connectivity in tyrosine kinase domain are incompletely understood. By means of structural (X-ray and NMR) and functional characterization of pathogenic gain-of-function mutations affecting the FGF receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase domain, we elucidated a long-distance allosteric network composed of four interconnected sites termed the ‘molecular brake’, ‘DFG latch’, ‘A-loop plug’, and ‘αC tether’. The first three sites repress the kinase from adopting an active conformation, whereas the αC tether promotes the active conformation. The skewed design of this four-site allosteric network imposes tight autoinhibition and accounts for the incomplete mimicry of the activated conformation by pathogenic mutations targeting a single site. Based on the structural similarity shared among RTKs, we propose that this allosteric model for FGFR kinases is applicable to other RTKs.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Disordered clusters of Bak dimers rupture mitochondria during apoptosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19944</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e19944</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;During apoptosis, Bak and Bax undergo major conformational change and form symmetric dimers that coalesce to perforate the mitochondrial outer membrane via an unknown mechanism. We have employed cysteine labelling and linkage analysis to the full length of Bak in mitochondria. This comprehensive survey showed that in each Bak dimer the N-termini are fully solvent-exposed and mobile, the core is highly structured, and the C-termini are flexible but restrained by their contact with the membrane. Dimer-dimer interactions were more labile than the BH3:groove interaction within dimers, suggesting there is no extensive protein interface between dimers. In addition, linkage in the mobile Bak N-terminus (V61C) specifically quantified association between dimers, allowing mathematical simulations of dimer arrangement. Together, our data show that Bak dimers form disordered clusters to generate lipidic pores. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the observed structural heterogeneity of the apoptotic pore.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>de Juan-Sanz et al. have developed novel, genetically encoded ER-targeted Ca2+ sensors to study ER Ca2+ fluxes in nerve terminals during electrical activity. Using these tools they demonstrate that ER Ca2+ content is critical for synaptic function and show that ER Ca2+ drives a STIM1-based feedback loop that controls Ca2+ influx and exocytosis.</description>

	<description>Yang et al. reveal that non-secretory FGF13 in mechanoheat nociceptors selectively regulates heat nociception by interacting with Nav1.7. The heat-facilitated FGF13/Nav1.7 interaction promotes the current density and cell membrane localization of Nav1.7, enabling the heat-evoked neuronal firing and nociceptive behaviors.</description>

	<title>: Epigenetic regulation of lateralized fetal spinal gene expression underlies hemispheric asymmetries</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22784</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e22784</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Lateralization is a fundamental principle of nervous system organization but its molecular determinants are mostly unknown. In humans, asymmetric gene expression in the fetal cortex has been suggested as the molecular basis of handedness. However, human fetuses already show considerable asymmetries in arm movements before the motor cortex is functionally linked to the spinal cord, making it more likely that spinal gene expression asymmetries form the molecular basis of handedness. We analyzed genome-wide mRNA expression and DNA methylation in cervical and anterior thoracal spinal cord segments of five human fetuses and show development-dependent gene expression asymmetries. These gene expression asymmetries were epigenetically regulated by miRNA expression asymmetries in the TGF-β signaling pathway and lateralized methylation of CpG islands. Our findings suggest that molecular mechanisms for epigenetic regulation within the spinal cord constitute the starting point for handedness, implying a fundamental shift in our understanding of the ontogenesis of hemispheric asymmetries in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: KEAP1 loss modulates sensitivity to kinase targeted therapy in lung cancer</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18970</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e18970</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inhibitors that target the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway have led to clinical responses in lung and other cancers, but some patients fail to respond and in those that do resistance inevitably occurs (&lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/#bib2&quot;&gt;Balak et al., 2006&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/#bib30&quot;&gt;Kosaka et al., 2006&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/#bib37&quot;&gt;Rudin et al., 2013&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/#bib45&quot;&gt;Wagle et al., 2011&lt;/a&gt;). To understand intrinsic and acquired resistance to inhibition of MAPK signaling, we performed CRISPR-Cas9 gene deletion screens in the setting of BRAF, MEK, EGFR, and ALK inhibition. Loss of &lt;em&gt;KEAP1&lt;/em&gt;, a negative regulator of NFE2L2/NRF2, modulated the response to BRAF, MEK, EGFR, and ALK inhibition in BRAF-, NRAS-, KRAS-, EGFR-, and ALK-mutant lung cancer cells. Treatment with inhibitors targeting the RTK/MAPK pathway increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells with intact KEAP1, and loss of KEAP1 abrogated this increase. In addition, loss of KEAP1 altered cell metabolism to allow cells to proliferate in the absence of MAPK signaling. These observations suggest that alterations in the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway may promote survival in the presence of multiple inhibitors targeting the RTK/Ras/MAPK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Distinct mechanisms mediate speed-accuracy adjustments in cortico-subthalamic networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21481</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21481</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Optimal decision-making requires balancing fast but error-prone and more accurate but slower decisions through adjustments of decision thresholds. Here, we demonstrate two distinct correlates of such speed-accuracy adjustments by recording subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity and electroencephalography in 11 Parkinson’s disease patients during a perceptual decision-making task; STN low-frequency oscillatory (LFO) activity (2–8 Hz), coupled to activity at prefrontal electrode Fz, and STN beta activity (13–30 Hz) coupled to electrodes C3/C4 close to motor cortex. These two correlates differed not only in their cortical topography and spectral characteristics but also in the relative timing of recruitment and in their precise relationship with decision thresholds. Increases of STN LFO power preceding the response predicted increased thresholds only after accuracy instructions, while cue-induced reductions of STN beta power decreased thresholds irrespective of instructions. These findings indicate that distinct neural mechanisms determine whether a decision will be made in haste or with caution.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: The LIM protein complex establishes a retinal circuitry of visual adaptation by regulating Pax6 α-enhancer activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21303</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21303</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The visual responses of vertebrates are sensitive to the overall composition of retinal interneurons including amacrine cells, which tune the activity of the retinal circuitry. The expression of &lt;em&gt;Paired-homeobox 6 (PAX6)&lt;/em&gt; is regulated by multiple cis-DNA elements including the intronic α-enhancer, which is active in GABAergic amacrine cell subsets. Here, we report that the transforming growth factor ß1-induced transcript 1 protein (Tgfb1i1) interacts with the LIM domain transcription factors Lhx3 and Isl1 to inhibit the α-enhancer in the post-natal mouse retina. &lt;em&gt;Tgfb1i1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice show elevated α-enhancer activity leading to overproduction of Pax6ΔPD isoform that supports the GABAergic amacrine cell fate maintenance. Consequently, the &lt;em&gt;Tgfb1i1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mouse retinas show a sustained light response, which becomes more transient in mice with the auto-stimulation-defective &lt;em&gt;Pax6&lt;sup&gt;ΔPBS/ΔPBS&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mutation. Together, we show the antagonistic regulation of the α-enhancer activity by Pax6 and the LIM protein complex is necessary for the establishment of an inner retinal circuitry, which controls visual adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Pharmacological targeting of the transcription factor SOX18 delays breast cancer in mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pharmacological targeting of transcription factors holds great promise for the development of new therapeutics, but strategies based on blockade of DNA binding, nuclear shuttling, or individual protein partner recruitment have yielded limited success to date. Transcription factors typically engage in complex interaction networks, likely masking the effects of specifically inhibiting single protein-protein interactions. Here, we used a combination of genomic, proteomic and biophysical methods to discover a suite of protein-protein interactions involving the SOX18 transcription factor, a known regulator of vascular development and disease. We describe a small-molecule that is able to disrupt a discrete subset of SOX18-dependent interactions. This compound selectively suppressed SOX18 transcriptional outputs in vitro and interfered with vascular development in zebrafish larvae. In a mouse pre-clinical model of breast cancer, treatment with this inhibitor significantly improved survival by reducing tumour vascular density and metastatic spread. Our studies validate an interactome-based molecular strategy to interfere with transcription factor activity, for the development of novel disease therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Desmoplasia, a fibrotic mass including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and self-sustaining extracellular matrix (D-ECM), is a puzzling feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDACs). Conflicting studies have identified tumor-restricting and tumor-promoting roles of PDAC-associated desmoplasia, suggesting that individual CAF/D-ECM protein constituents have distinguishable tumorigenic and tumor-repressive functions. Using 3D culture of normal pancreatic versus PDAC-associated human fibroblasts, we identified a CAF/D-ECM phenotype that correlates with improved patient outcomes, and that includes CAFs enriched in plasma membrane-localized, active α&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-integrin. Mechanistically, we established that TGFβ is required for D-ECM production but dispensable for D-ECM-induced naïve fibroblast-to-CAF activation, which depends on α&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-integrin redistribution of pFAK-independent active α&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-integrin to assorted endosomes. Importantly, the development of a simultaneous multi-channel immunofluorescence approach and new algorithms for computational batch-analysis and their application to a human PDAC panel, indicated that stromal localization and levels of active SMAD2/3 and α&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-integrin distinguish patient-protective from patient-detrimental desmoplasia and foretell tumor recurrences, suggesting a useful new prognostic tool.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Habitat and social factors shape individual decisions and emergent group structure during baboon collective movement</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19505</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;For group-living animals traveling through heterogeneous landscapes, collective movement can be influenced by both habitat structure and social interactions. Yet research in collective behavior has largely neglected habitat influences on movement. Here we integrate simultaneous, high-resolution, tracking of wild baboons within a troop with a 3-dimensional reconstruction of their habitat to identify key drivers of baboon movement. A previously unexplored social influence – baboons’ preference for locations that other troop members have recently traversed – is the most important predictor of individual movement decisions. Habitat is shown to influence movement over multiple spatial scales, from long-range attraction and repulsion from the troop’s sleeping site, to relatively local influences including road-following and a short-range avoidance of dense vegetation. Scaling to the collective level reveals a clear association between habitat features and the emergent structure of the group, highlighting the importance of habitat heterogeneity in shaping group coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Oxytocin improves behavioral and electrophysiological deficits in a novel Shank3-deficient rat</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18904</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in the synaptic gene &lt;em&gt;SHANK3&lt;/em&gt; lead to a neurodevelopmental disorder known as Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS). PMS is a relatively common monogenic and highly penetrant cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID), and frequently presents with attention deficits. The underlying neurobiology of PMS is not fully known and pharmacological treatments for core symptoms do not exist. Here, we report the production and characterization of a &lt;em&gt;Shank3&lt;/em&gt;-deficient rat model of PMS, with a genetic alteration similar to a human SHANK3 mutation. We show that &lt;em&gt;Shank3&lt;/em&gt;-deficient rats exhibit impaired long-term social recognition memory and attention, and reduced synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal-medial prefrontal cortex pathway. These deficits were attenuated with oxytocin treatment. The effect of oxytocin on reversing non-social attention deficits is a particularly novel finding, and the results implicate an oxytocinergic contribution in this genetically defined subtype of ASD and ID, suggesting an individualized therapeutic approach for PMS.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Typical and atypical pathology in primary progressive aphasia variants</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective.&lt;/b&gt; To characterize &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; signatures of pathological diagnosis in a large cohort of patients with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) variants defined by current diagnostic classification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods.&lt;/b&gt; Extensive clinical, cognitive, neuroimaging, and neuropathological data were collected from 69 patients with sporadic PPA, divided into 29 semantic (svPPA), 25 non-fluent (nfvPPA), 11 logopenic (lvPPA), and 4 mixed PPA. Patterns of grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) atrophy at presentation were assessed and tested as predictors of pathological diagnosis using support vector machine (SVM) algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results.&lt;/b&gt; A clinical diagnosis of PPA was associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP inclusions in 40.5%, FTLD-tau in 40.5%, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in 19% of cases. Each variant was associated with one typical pathology: 24/29 (83%) svPPA showed FTLD-TDP type C, 22/25 (88%) nfvPPA showed FTLD-tau, and all 11 lvPPA had AD. Within FTLD-tau, 4R-tau pathology was commonly associated with nfvPPA, whereas Pick's disease was observed in a minority of subjects across all variants except for lvPPA. Compared with pathologically typical cases, svPPA-tau showed significant extrapyramidal signs, greater executive impairment, and severe striatal and frontal GM and WM atrophy. nfvPPA-TDP patients lacked general motor symptoms or significant WM atrophy. Combining GM and WM volumes, SVM analysis showed 92.7% accuracy to distinguish FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP pathologies across variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation.&lt;/b&gt; Each PPA clinical variant is associated with a typical and most frequent cognitive, neuroimaging, and neuropathological profile. Specific clinical and early anatomical features may suggest rare and atypical pathological diagnosis &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>: The paranodal cytoskeleton clusters Na+ channels at nodes of Ranvier</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21392</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A high density of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels at nodes of Ranvier is necessary for rapid and efficient action potential propagation in myelinated axons. Na+ channel clustering is thought to depend on two axonal cell adhesion molecules that mediate interactions between the axon and myelinating glia at the nodal gap (i.e., NF186) and the paranodal junction (i.e., Caspr). Here we show that while Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels cluster at nodes in the absence of NF186, they fail to do so in double conditional knockout mice lacking both NF186 and the paranodal cell adhesion molecule Caspr, demonstrating that a paranodal junction-dependent mechanism can cluster Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels at nodes. Furthermore, we show that paranode-dependent clustering of nodal Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels requires axonal βII spectrin which is concentrated at paranodes. Our results reveal that the paranodal junction-dependent mechanism of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;channel clustering is mediated by the spectrin-based paranodal axonal cytoskeleton.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Direct measurement of TRPV4 and PIEZO1 activity reveals multiple mechanotransduction pathways in chondrocytes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21074</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The joints of mammals are lined with cartilage, comprised of individual chondrocytes embedded in a specialized extracellular matrix. Chondrocytes experience a complex mechanical environment and respond to changing mechanical loads in order to maintain cartilage homeostasis. It has been proposed that mechanically gated ion channels are of functional importance in chondrocyte mechanotransduction; however, direct evidence of mechanical current activation in these cells has been lacking. We have used high-speed pressure clamp and elastomeric pillar arrays to apply distinct mechanical stimuli to primary murine chondrocytes, stretch of the membrane and deflection of cell-substrate contacts points, respectively. Both TRPV4 and PIEZO1 channels contribute to currents activated by stimuli applied at cell-substrate contacts but only PIEZO1 mediates stretch-activated currents. These data demonstrate that there are separate, but overlapping, mechanoelectrical transduction pathways in chondrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Adult-born neurons modify excitatory synaptic transmission to existing neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19886</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e19886</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adult-born neurons are continually produced in the dentate gyrus but it is unclear whether synaptic integration of new neurons affects the pre-existing circuit. Here we investigated how manipulating neurogenesis in adult mice alters excitatory synaptic transmission to mature dentate neurons. Enhancing neurogenesis by conditional deletion of the pro-apoptotic gene &lt;em&gt;Bax&lt;/em&gt; in stem cells reduced excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and spine density in mature neurons, whereas genetic ablation of neurogenesis increased EPSCs in mature neurons. Unexpectedly, we found that &lt;em&gt;Bax&lt;/em&gt; deletion in developing and mature dentate neurons increased EPSCs and prevented neurogenesis-induced synaptic suppression. Together these results show that neurogenesis modifies synaptic transmission to mature neurons in a manner consistent with a redistribution of pre-existing synapses to newly integrating neurons and that a non-apoptotic function of the Bax signaling pathway contributes to ongoing synaptic refinement within the dentate circuit.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Pathogenic PS1 phosphorylation at Ser367</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19720</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e19720</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The high levels of serine (S) and threonine (T) residues within the Presenilin 1 (PS1) N-terminus and in the large hydrophilic loop region suggest that the enzymatic function of PS1/γ-secretase can be modulated by its ‘phosphorylated’ and ‘dephosphorylated’ states. However, the functional outcome of PS1 phosphorylation and its significance for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, comprehensive analysis using FRET-based imaging reveals that activity-driven and Protein Kinase A-mediated PS1 phosphorylation at three domains (domain 1: T74, domain 2: S310 and S313, domain 3: S365, S366, and S367), with S367 being critical, is responsible for the PS1 pathogenic ‘closed’ conformation, and resulting increase in the Aβ42/40 ratio. Moreover, we have established novel imaging assays for monitoring PS1 conformation in vivo, and report that PS1 phosphorylation induces the pathogenic conformational shift in the living mouse brain. These phosphorylation sites represent potential new targets for AD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Modeling susceptibility to drug-induced long QT with a panel of subject-specific induced pluripotent stem cells</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A large number of drugs can induce prolongation of cardiac repolarization and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The prediction of this side effect is however challenging as it usually develops in some genetically predisposed individuals with normal cardiac repolarization at baseline. Here, we describe a platform based on a genetically diverse panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that reproduces susceptibility to develop a cardiotoxic drug response. We generated iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from patients presenting in vivo with extremely low or high changes in cardiac repolarization in response to a pharmacological challenge with sotalol. In vitro, the responses to sotalol were highly variable but strongly correlated to the inter-individual differences observed in vivo. Transcriptomic profiling identified dysregulation of genes (&lt;em&gt;DLG2, KCNE4, PTRF, HTR2C&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;CAMKV&lt;/em&gt;) involved in downstream regulation of cardiac repolarization machinery as underlying high sensitivity to sotalol. Our findings offer novel insights for the development of iPSC-based screening assays for testing individual drug reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intraneural perineuriomas are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors that cause progressive debilitating focal extremity weakness. The etiology of perineuriomas is largely unknown. We utilized whole exome sequencing, copy number algorithm evaluation, and high-resolution whole genome microarray to investigate for a genetic causal link to intraneural perineuriomas. Ten of 16 (60%) tumor cases had mutations in the WD40 domain &lt;em&gt;of TRAF7&lt;/em&gt;, the same location for causal mutations of meningiomas. Two additional perineurioma cases had large chromosomal abnormalities in multiple chromosomes, including chromosome 22q. This study identifies a common cause for intraneural perineuriomas and an unexpected shared pathogenesis with intracranial meningiomas. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central nervous system infratentorial superficial siderosis (iSS) is increasingly detected by blood-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. Despite this, there are no standardized diagnostic criteria, and the clinical–radiological spectrum, causes, and optimum investigation strategy are not established. We reviewed clinical and radiological details of patients with iSS assessed at a specialist neurological center during 2004–2016 using predefined standardized radiological criteria. All imaging findings were rated blinded to clinical details. We identified 65 patients with iSS, whom we classified into 2 groups: type 1 (classical) and type 2 (secondary) iSS. Type 1 (classical) iSS included 48 patients without any potentially causal radiologically confirmed single spontaneous or traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, of whom 39 (83%) had hearing loss, ataxia, or myelopathy; type 2 (secondary) iSS included 17 patients with a potentially causal radiologically confirmed spontaneous or traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, of whom none had hearing loss, ataxia, or myelopathy. Of the patients with type 1 (classical) iSS, 40 (83%) had a potentially causal cranial or spinal dural abnormality, 5 (11%) had an alternative cause, and 3 (6%) had no cause identified. Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography did not identify any underlying causal lesions for type 1 iSS. Type 1 (classical) iSS, defined using simple radiological criteria, is associated with a characteristic neurological syndrome. Rational investigation, including spinal MRI, nearly always reveals a potential cause, most often a dural abnormality. Catheter angiography appears to be unhelpful, suggesting that classical iSS is not associated with macrovascular arterial pathology. Recognition of type 1 (classical) iSS should allow timely diagnosis and early consideration of treatment. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>: Stimulus relevance modulates contrast adaptation in visual cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21589</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21589</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A general principle of sensory processing is that neurons adapt to sustained stimuli by reducing their response over time. Most of our knowledge on adaptation in single cells is based on experiments in anesthetized animals. How responses adapt in awake animals, when stimuli may be behaviorally relevant or not, remains unclear. Here we show that contrast adaptation in mouse primary visual cortex depends on the behavioral relevance of the stimulus. Cells that adapted to contrast under anesthesia maintained or even increased their activity in awake naïve mice. When engaged in a visually guided task, contrast adaptation re-occurred for stimuli that were irrelevant for solving the task. However, contrast adaptation was reversed when stimuli acquired behavioral relevance. Regulation of cortical adaptation by task demand may allow dynamic control of sensory-evoked signal flow in the neocortex.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Proteomics of rimmed vacuoles define new risk allele in inclusion body myositis</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24847-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) pathogenesis is unknown; however, rimmed vacuoles (RVs) are a constant feature. We propose to identify proteins that accumulate within RVs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24847-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;RVs and intact myofibers were laser microdissected from skeletal muscle of 18 sIBM patients and analyzed by a sensitive mass spectrometry approach using label-free spectral count-based relative protein quantification. Whole exome sequencing was performed on 62 sIBM patients. Immunofluorescence was performed on patient and mouse skeletal muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24847-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 213 proteins were enriched by &amp;gt;1.5 -fold in RVs compared to controls and included proteins previously reported to accumulate in sIBM tissue or when mutated cause myopathies with RVs. Proteins associated with protein folding and autophagy were the largest group represented. One autophagic adaptor protein not previously identified in sIBM was FYCO1. Rare missense coding &lt;em&gt;FYCO1&lt;/em&gt; variants were present in 11.3% of sIBM patients compared with 2.6% of controls (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003). FYCO1 colocalized at RVs with autophagic proteins such as MAP1LC3 and SQSTM1 in sIBM and other RV myopathies. One &lt;em&gt;FYCO1&lt;/em&gt; variant protein had reduced colocalization with MAP1LC3 when expressed in mouse muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24847-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study used an unbiased proteomic approach to identify RV proteins in sIBM that included a novel protein involved in sIBM pathogenesis. FYCO1 accumulates at RVs, and rare missense variants in &lt;em&gt;FYCO1&lt;/em&gt; are overrepresented in sIBM patients. These &lt;em&gt;FYCO1&lt;/em&gt; variants may impair autophagic function, leading to RV formation in sIBM patient muscle. FYCO1 functionally connects autophagic and endocytic pathways, supporting the hypothesis that impaired endolysosomal degradation underlies the pathogenesis of sIBM.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Developmental changes in neuromagnetic rhythms and network synchrony in autism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24836</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24836-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is gathering consensus that altered connectivity is a hallmark of the autistic brain. This includes atypical neural oscillations and their coordination across brain regions, which are understood to mediate information processing and integration. It remains unclear whether and how connectivity in various neurophysiological frequency ranges develops atypically in autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24836-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this in a cross-sectional sample, we recorded resting-state magnetoencephalography from 134 children and adolescents with and without ASD, and calculated resting spectral power and inter-regional synchrony (functional connectivity).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24836-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although no overall group differences were observed, significant alterations in linear and nonlinear age-related changes in resting oscillatory power and network synchrony were found. These differences were frequency- and region-specific and implicated brain systems thought to play a prominent role in ASD, such as the frontal cortex and cerebellum. We also found correlations between Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule scores and the degree to which connectivity in cerebellar networks is “idiosyncratic” in an individual with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24836-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We provide the first evidence that it is the curvatures of maturational changes in neurophysiological oscillations and synchrony, rather than disturbances in a particular direction, that characterize the brain function in individuals with ASD. Moreover, the patterns of idiosyncratic distortions of network synchrony relative to the group curve are associated with behavioral symptoms of ASD.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is strongly associated with HLA-DR7 and HLA-DRB4</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leucine-rich glioma-inactivated1 (LGI1) encephalitis is an antibody-associated inflammation of the limbic area. An autoimmune etiology is suspected but not yet proven. We performed human leukocyte antigen (HLA) analysis in 25 nontumor anti-LGI1 patients and discovered a remarkably strong HLA association. HLA-DR7 was present in 88% compared to 19.6% in healthy controls (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 4.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;). HLA-DRB4 was present in all patients and in 46.5% controls (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 1.19 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;). These findings support the autoimmune hypothesis. An exploratory analysis was performed in a small group of 4 tumor-LGI1 patients. The strong HLA association seems not applicable in these patients. Therefore, the absence of HLA-DR7 or HLA-DRB4 could raise tumor suspicion in anti-LGI1 patients. Ann Neurol 2016&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>: YAP/TAZ initiate and maintain Schwann cell myelination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20982</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e20982</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nuclear exclusion of the transcriptional regulators and potent oncoproteins, YAP/TAZ, is considered necessary for adult tissue homeostasis. Here we show that nuclear YAP/TAZ are essential regulators of peripheral nerve development and myelin maintenance. To proliferate, developing Schwann cells (SCs) require YAP/TAZ to enter S-phase and, without them, fail to generate sufficient SCs for timely axon sorting. To differentiate, SCs require YAP/TAZ to upregulate Krox20 and, without them, completely fail to myelinate, resulting in severe peripheral neuropathy. Remarkably, in adulthood, nuclear YAP/TAZ are selectively expressed by myelinating SCs, and conditional ablation results in severe peripheral demyelination and mouse death. YAP/TAZ regulate both developmental and adult myelination by driving TEAD1 to activate Krox20. Therefore, YAP/TAZ are crucial for SCs to myelinate developing nerve and to maintain myelinated nerve in adulthood. Our study also provides a new insight into the role of nuclear YAP/TAZ in homeostatic maintenance of an adult tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the mechanisms that regulate cell type-specific transcriptional programs requires developing a lexicon of their genomic regulatory elements. We developed a lineage-selective method to map transcriptional enhancers, regulatory genomic regions that activate transcription, in mice. Since most tissue-specific enhancers are bound by the transcriptional co-activator Ep300, we used Cre-directed, lineage-specific Ep300 biotinylation and pulldown on immobilized streptavidin followed by next generation sequencing of co-precipitated DNA to identify lineage-specific enhancers. By driving this system with lineage-specific Cre transgenes, we mapped enhancers active in embryonic endothelial cells/blood or skeletal muscle. Analysis of these enhancers identified new transcription factor heterodimer motifs that likely regulate transcription in these lineages. Furthermore, we identified candidate enhancers that regulate adult heart- or lung- specific endothelial cell specialization. Our strategy for tissue-specific protein biotinylation opens new avenues for studying lineage-specific protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: A general method for determining secondary active transporter substrate stoichiometry</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21016</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The number of ions required to drive substrate transport through a secondary active transporter determines the protein’s ability to create a substrate gradient, a feature essential to its physiological function, and places fundamental constraints on the transporter’s mechanism. Stoichiometry is known for a wide array of mammalian transporters, but, due to a lack of readily available tools, not for most of the prokaryotic transporters for which high-resolution structures are available. Here, we describe a general method for using radiolabeled substrate flux assays to determine coupling stoichiometries of electrogenic secondary active transporters reconstituted in proteoliposomes by measuring transporter equilibrium potentials. We demonstrate the utility of this method by determining the coupling stoichiometry of VcINDY, a bacterial Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-coupled succinate transporter, and further validate it by confirming the coupling stoichiometry of vSGLT, a bacterial sugar transporter. This robust thermodynamic method should be especially useful in probing the mechanisms of transporters with available structures.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Frontal beta-theta network during REM sleep</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18894</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e18894</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We lack detailed knowledge about the spatio-temporal physiological signatures of REM sleep, especially in humans. By analyzing intracranial electrode data from humans, we demonstrate for the first time that there are prominent beta (15–35 Hz) and theta (4–8 Hz) oscillations in both the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the DLPFC during REM sleep. We further show that these theta and beta activities in the ACC and the DLPFC, two relatively distant but reciprocally connected regions, are coherent. These findings suggest that, counter to current prevailing thought, the DLPFC is active during REM sleep and likely interacting with other areas. Since the DLPFC and the ACC are implicated in memory and emotional regulation, and the ACC has motor areas and is thought to be important for error detection, the dialogue between these two areas could play a role in the regulation of emotions and in procedural motor and emotional memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Multivariate cross-frequency coupling via generalized eigendecomposition</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21792</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21792</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a new framework for analyzing cross-frequency coupling in multichannel electrophysiological recordings. The generalized eigendecomposition-based cross-frequency coupling framework (gedCFC) is inspired by source-separation algorithms combined with dynamics of mesoscopic neurophysiological processes. It is unaffected by factors that confound traditional CFC methods—such as non-stationarities, non-sinusoidality, and non-uniform phase angle distributions—attractive properties considering that brain activity is neither stationary nor perfectly sinusoidal. The gedCFC framework opens new opportunities for conceptualizing CFC as network interactions with diverse spatial/topographical distributions. Five specific methods within the gedCFC framework are detailed, these are validated in simulated data and applied in several empirical datasets. gedCFC accurately recovers physiologically plausible CFC patterns embedded in noise that causes traditional CFC methods to perform poorly. The paper also demonstrates that spike-field coherence in multichannel local field potential data can be analyzed using the gedCFC framework, which provides significant advantages over traditional spike-field coherence analyses. Null-hypothesis testing is also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Extensive cargo identification reveals distinct biological roles of the 12 importin pathways</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21184</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21184</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vast numbers of proteins are transported into and out of the nuclei by approximately 20 species of importin-β family nucleocytoplasmic transport receptors. However, the significance of the multiple parallel transport pathways that the receptors constitute is poorly understood because only limited numbers of cargo proteins have been reported. Here, we identified cargo proteins specific to the 12 species of human import receptors with a high-throughput method that employs stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture, an in vitro reconstituted transport system, and quantitative mass spectrometry. The identified cargoes illuminated the manner of cargo allocation to the receptors. The redundancies of the receptors vary widely depending on the cargo protein. Cargoes of the same receptor are functionally related to one another, and the predominant protein groups in the cargo cohorts differ among the receptors. Thus, the receptors are linked to distinct biological processes by the nature of their cargoes.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Sexually dimorphic control of gene expression in sensory neurons regulates decision-making behavior in C. elegans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21166</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Animal behavior is directed by the integration of sensory information from internal states and the environment. Neuroendocrine regulation of diverse behaviors of &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt; is under the control of the DAF-7/TGF-β ligand that is secreted from sensory neurons. Here, we show that &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; males exhibit an altered, male-specific expression pattern of &lt;em&gt;daf-7&lt;/em&gt; in the ASJ sensory neuron pair with the onset of reproductive maturity, which functions to promote male-specific mate-searching behavior. Molecular genetic analysis of the switch-like regulation of &lt;em&gt;daf-7&lt;/em&gt; expression in the ASJ neuron pair reveals a hierarchy of regulation among multiple inputs—sex, age, nutritional status, and microbial environment—which function in the modulation of behavior. Our results suggest that regulation of gene expression in sensory neurons can function in the integration of a wide array of sensory information and facilitate decision-making behaviors in &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Coincident postsynaptic activity gates presynaptic dopamine release to induce plasticity in Drosophila mushroom bodies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21076</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21076</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Simultaneous stimulation of the antennal lobes (ALs) and the ascending fibers of the ventral nerve cord (AFV), two sensory inputs to the mushroom bodies (MBs), induces long-term enhancement (LTE) of subsequent AL-evoked MB responses. LTE induction requires activation of at least three signaling pathways to the MBs, mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), NMDA receptors (NRs), and D1 dopamine receptors (D1Rs). Here, we demonstrate that inputs from the AL are transmitted to the MBs through nAChRs, and inputs from the AFV are transmitted by NRs. Dopamine signaling occurs downstream of both nAChR and NR activation, and requires simultaneous stimulation of both pathways. Dopamine release requires the activity of the rutabaga adenylyl cyclase in postsynaptic MB neurons, and release is restricted to MB neurons that receive coincident stimulation. Our results indicate that postsynaptic activity can gate presynaptic dopamine release to regulate plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Novel adverse outcome pathways revealed by chemical genetics in a developing marine fish</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20707</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Crude oil spills are a worldwide ocean conservation threat. Fish are particularly vulnerable to the oiling of spawning habitats, and crude oil causes severe abnormalities in embryos and larvae. However, the underlying mechanisms for these developmental defects are not well understood. Here, we explore the transcriptional basis for four discrete crude oil injury phenotypes in the early life stages of the commercially important Atlantic haddock (&lt;em&gt;Melanogrammus aeglefinus&lt;/em&gt;). These include defects in (1) cardiac form and function, (2) craniofacial development, (3) ionoregulation and fluid balance, and (4) cholesterol synthesis and homeostasis. Our findings suggest a key role for intracellular calcium cycling and excitation-transcription coupling in the dysregulation of heart and jaw morphogenesis. Moreover, the disruption of ionoregulatory pathways sheds new light on buoyancy control in marine fish embryos. Overall, our chemical-genetic approach identifies initiating events for distinct adverse outcome pathways and novel roles for individual genes in fundamental developmental processes.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Dyslexics’ faster decay of implicit memory for sounds and words is manifested in their shorter neural adaptation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20557</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dyslexia is a prevalent reading disability whose underlying mechanisms are still disputed. We studied the neural mechanisms underlying dyslexia using a simple frequency-discrimination task. Though participants were asked to compare the two tones in each trial, implicit memory of previous trials affected their responses. We hypothesized that implicit memory decays faster among dyslexics. We tested this by increasing the temporal intervals between consecutive trials, and by measuring the behavioral impact and ERP responses from the auditory cortex. Dyslexics showed a faster decay of implicit memory effects on both measures, with similar time constants. Finally, faster decay of implicit memory also characterized the impact of sound regularities in benefitting dyslexics' oral reading rate. Their benefit decreased faster as a function of the time interval from the previous reading of the same non-word. We propose that dyslexics’ shorter neural adaptation paradoxically accounts for their longer reading times, since it reduces their temporal window of integration of past stimuli, resulting in noisier and less reliable predictions for both simple and complex stimuli. Less reliable predictions limit their acquisition of reading expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Direct assessment of substrate binding to the Neurotransmitter:Sodium Symporter LeuT by solid state NMR</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19314</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e19314</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Neurotransmitter:Sodium Symporters (NSSs) represent an important class of proteins mediating sodium-dependent uptake of neurotransmitters from the extracellular space. The substrate binding stoichiometry of the bacterial NSS protein, LeuT, and thus the principal transport mechanism, has been heavily debated. Here we used solid state NMR to specifically characterize the bound leucine ligand and probe the number of binding sites in LeuT. We were able to produce high-quality NMR spectra of substrate bound to microcrystalline LeuT samples and identify one set of sodium-dependent substrate-specific chemical shifts. Furthermore, our data show that the binding site mutants F253A and L400S, which probe the major S1 binding site and the proposed S2 binding site, respectively, retain sodium-dependent substrate binding in the S1 site similar to the wild-type protein. We conclude that under our experimental conditions there is only one detectable leucine molecule bound to LeuT.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Motility precedes egress of malaria parasites from oocysts</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19157</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e19157</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Malaria is transmitted when an infected &lt;em&gt;Anopheles&lt;/em&gt; mosquito deposits &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt; sporozoites in the skin during a bite. Sporozoites are formed within oocysts at the mosquito midgut wall and are released into the hemolymph, from where they invade the salivary glands and are subsequently transmitted to the vertebrate host. We found that a thrombospondin-repeat containing sporozoite-specific protein named thrombospondin-releated protein 1 (TRP1) is important for oocyst egress and salivary gland invasion, and hence for the transmission of malaria. We imaged the release of sporozoites from oocysts in situ, which was preceded by active motility. Parasites lacking TRP1 failed to migrate within oocysts and did not egress, suggesting that TRP1 is a vital component of the events that precede intra-oocyst motility and subsequently sporozoite egress and salivary gland invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Ten to twenty percent of postpartum women experience anxiety or depressive disorders, which can have detrimental effects on the mother, child, and family. Little is known about the neural correlates of these affective disorders when they occur in mothers, but they do have unique neural profiles during the postpartum period compared with when they occur at other times in a woman's life. Given that the neural systems affected by postpartum anxiety and depression overlap and interact with the systems involved in maternal caregiving behaviors, mother–infant interactions are highly susceptible to disruption.</description>

	<title>: Structure of the active form of human origin recognition complex and its ATPase motor module</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20818</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e20818</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Binding of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) to origins of replication marks the first step in the initiation of replication of the genome in all eukaryotic cells. Here, we report the structure of the active form of human ORC determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. The complex is composed of an ORC1/4/5 motor module lobe in an organization reminiscent of the DNA polymerase clamp loader complexes. A second lobe contains the ORC2/3 subunits. The complex is organized as a double-layered shallow corkscrew, with the AAA+ and AAA+-like domains forming one layer, and the winged-helix domains (WHDs) forming a top layer. CDC6 fits easily between ORC1 and ORC2, completing the ring and the DNA-binding channel, forming an additional ATP hydrolysis site. Analysis of the ATPase activity of the complex provides a basis for understanding ORC activity as well as molecular defects observed in Meier-Gorlin Syndrome mutations.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Like art, science affords an individualistic career. However, increasingly, complexity necessitates increased interdependency and specialization. Despite this change, many institutions, funding agencies, and publishers insist on an exclusively individualistic model of science. This hinders scientific progress by imposing a range of inefficiencies in the planning and execution of research plans.</description>

	<title>: Using the Volta phase plate with defocus for cryo-EM single particle analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23006</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e23006</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previously, we reported an in-focus data acquisition method for cryo-EM single-particle analysis with the Volta phase plate (Danev and Baumeister, 2016). Here, we extend the technique to include a small amount of defocus which enables contrast transfer function measurement and correction. This hybrid approach simplifies the experiment and increases the data acquisition speed. It also removes the resolution limit inherent to the in-focus method thus allowing 3D reconstructions with resolutions better than 3 Å.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Activity-dependent regulation of T-type calcium channels by submembrane calcium ions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22331</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e22331</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels are involved in numerous physiological functions and various mechanisms finely tune their activity, including the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion itself. This is well exemplified by the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent inactivation of L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, whose alteration contributes to the dramatic disease Timothy Syndrome. For T-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, a long-held view is that they are not regulated by intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Here we challenge this notion by using dedicated electrophysiological protocols on both native and expressed T-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. We demonstrate that a rise in submembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; induces a large decrease in T-type current amplitude due to a hyperpolarizing shift in the steady-state inactivation. Activation of most representative Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable ionotropic receptors similarly regulate T-type current properties. Altogether, our data clearly establish that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry exerts a feedback control on T-type channel activity, by modulating the channel availability, a mechanism that critically links cellular properties of T-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels to their physiological roles.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Concerted regulation of ISWI by an autoinhibitory domain and the H4 N-terminal tail</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21477</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21477</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;ISWI-family nucleosome remodeling enzymes need the histone H4 N-terminal tail to mobilize nucleosomes. Here we mapped the H4-tail binding pocket of ISWI. Surprisingly the binding site was adjacent to but not overlapping with the docking site of an auto-regulatory motif, AutoN, in the N-terminal region (NTR) of ISWI, indicating that AutoN does not act as a simple pseudosubstrate as suggested previously. Rather, AutoN cooperated with a hitherto uncharacterized motif, termed AcidicN, to confer H4-tail sensitivity and discriminate between DNA and nucleosomes. A third motif in the NTR, ppHSA, was functionally required in vivo and provided structural stability by clamping the NTR to Lobe 2 of the ATPase domain. This configuration is reminiscent of Chd1 even though Chd1 contains an unrelated NTR. Our results shed light on the intricate structural and functional regulation of ISWI by the NTR and uncover surprising parallels with Chd1.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: High throughput in vivo functional validation of candidate congenital heart disease genes in Drosophila</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e22617</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Genomic sequencing has implicated large numbers of genes and de novo mutations as potential disease risk factors. A high throughput in vivo model system is needed to validate gene associations with pathology. We developed a &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt;-based functional system to screen candidate disease genes identified from Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) patients. 134 genes were tested in the &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; heart using RNAi-based gene silencing. Quantitative analyses of multiple cardiac phenotypes demonstrated essential structural, functional, and developmental roles for more than 70 genes, including a subgroup encoding histone H3K4 modifying proteins. We also demonstrated the use of &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; to evaluate cardiac phenotypes resulting from specific, patient-derived alleles of candidate disease genes. We describe the first high throughput in vivo validation system to screen candidate disease genes identified from patients. This approach has the potential to facilitate development of precision medicine approaches for CHD and other diseases associated with genetic factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rodents, postnatal neurogenesis is restricted to certain brain areas including the olfactory bulb. It has been shown that blocking this neurogenesis disrupts olfactory learning, but the techniques used lacked specificity. Here, designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) were used to inactivate newborn &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depression is characterized by a range of symptoms that can be experienced in different combinations and to different extents depending on the individual. Efforts to categorize depression by matching symptoms to physiological changes have had limited success. Here, functional MRI was used to compare whole-brain &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intracellular α-synuclein (α-syn)-rich protein aggregates called Lewy pathology (LP) and neuronal death are commonly found in the brains of patients with clinical Parkinson disease (cPD). It is widely believed that LP appears early in the disease and spreads in synaptically coupled brain networks, driving neuronal &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: What the success of brain imaging implies about the neural code</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21397</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21397</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The success of fMRI places constraints on the nature of the neural code. The fact that researchers can infer similarities between neural representations, despite fMRI’s limitations, implies that certain neural coding schemes are more likely than others. For fMRI to succeed given its low temporal and spatial resolution, the neural code must be smooth at the voxel and functional level such that similar stimuli engender similar internal representations. Through proof and simulation, we determine which coding schemes are plausible given both fMRI’s successes and its limitations in measuring neural activity. Deep neural network approaches, which have been forwarded as computational accounts of the ventral stream, are consistent with the success of fMRI, though functional smoothness breaks down in the later network layers. These results have implications for the nature of the neural code and ventral stream, as well as what can be successfully investigated with fMRI.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>The GluD1 and GluD2 receptors form the GluD ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) subfamily. Without known endogenous ligands, they have long been referred to as ‘orphan’ and remained enigmatic functionally. Recent progress has, however, radically changed this view. Both GluD receptors are expressed in wider brain regions than originally thought. Human genetic studies and analyses of knockout mice have revealed their involvement in multiple neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. The discovery of endogenous ligands, together with structural investigations, has opened the way towards a mechanistic understanding of GluD signaling at central nervous system synapses.</description>

	<title>: Length-dependent flagellar growth of Vibrio alginolyticus revealed by real time fluorescent imaging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22140</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Bacterial ﬂagella are extracellular ﬁlaments that drive swimming in bacteria. During motor assembly, ﬂagellins are transported unfolded through the central channel in the ﬂagellum to the growing tip. Here, we applied in vivo ﬂuorescent imaging to monitor in real time the &lt;em&gt;Vibrio alginolyticus&lt;/em&gt; polar ﬂagella growth. The ﬂagellar growth rate is found to be highly length-dependent. Initially, the ﬂagellum grows at a constant rate (50 nm/min) when shorter than 1500 nm. The growth rate decays sharply when the ﬂagellum grows longer, which decreases to ~9 nm/min at 7500 nm. We modeled ﬂagellin transport inside the channel as a one-dimensional diffusive process with an injection force at its base. When the ﬂagellum is short, its growth rate is determined by the loading speed at the base. Only when the ﬂagellum grows longer does diffusion of ﬂagellin become the rate-limiting step, dramatically reducing the growth rate. Our results shed new light on the dynamic building process of this complex extracellular structure.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Mitochondrial respiratory gene expression is suppressed in many cancers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21592</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The fundamental metabolic decision of a cell, the balance between respiration and fermentation, rests in part on expression of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) and coordination with expression of the nuclear genome (nuDNA). Previously we described mtDNA copy number depletion across many solid tumor types (Reznik et al., 2016). Here, we use orthogonal RNA-sequencing data to quantify mtDNA expression (mtRNA), and report analogously lower expression of mtRNA in tumors (relative to normal tissue) across a majority of cancer types. Several cancers exhibit a trio of mutually consistent evidence suggesting a drop in respiratory activity: depletion of mtDNA copy number, decreases in mtRNA levels, and decreases in expression of nuDNA-encoded respiratory proteins. Intriguingly, a minority of cancer types exhibit a drop in mtDNA expression but an increase in nuDNA expression of respiratory proteins, with unknown implications for respiratory activity. Our results indicate suppression of respiratory gene expression across many cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: RAGE deficiency predisposes mice to virus-induced paucigranulocytic asthma</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21199</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21199</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease. Although many patients with asthma develop type-2 dominated eosinophilic inflammation, a number of individuals develop paucigranulocytic asthma, which occurs in the absence of eosinophilia or neutrophilia. The aetiology of paucigranulocytic asthma is unknown. However, both respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and mutations in the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (&lt;em&gt;RAGE&lt;/em&gt;) are risk factors for asthma development. Here, we show that RAGE deficiency impairs anti-viral immunity during an early-life infection with pneumonia virus of mice (PVM; a murine analogue of RSV). The elevated viral load was associated with the release of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) which triggered airway smooth muscle remodelling in early-life. Re-infection with PVM in later-life induced many of the cardinal features of asthma in the absence of eosinophilic or neutrophilic inflammation. Anti-HMGB1 mitigated both early-life viral disease and asthma-like features, highlighting HMGB1 as a possible novel therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling directs cardiomyocyte movement toward the midline during heart tube assembly</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21172</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21172</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Communication between neighboring tissues plays a central role in guiding organ morphogenesis. During heart tube assembly, interactions with the adjacent endoderm control the medial movement of cardiomyocytes, a process referred to as cardiac fusion. However, the molecular underpinnings of this endodermal-myocardial relationship remain unclear. Here, we show an essential role for platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra) in directing cardiac fusion. Mutation of &lt;em&gt;pdgfra&lt;/em&gt; disrupts heart tube assembly in both zebrafish and mouse. Timelapse analysis of individual cardiomyocyte trajectories reveals misdirected cells in zebrafish &lt;em&gt;pdgfra&lt;/em&gt; mutants, suggesting that PDGF signaling steers cardiomyocytes toward the midline during cardiac fusion. Intriguingly, the ligand &lt;em&gt;pdgfaa&lt;/em&gt; is expressed in the endoderm medial to the &lt;em&gt;pdgfra&lt;/em&gt;-expressing myocardial precursors. Ectopic expression of &lt;em&gt;pdgfaa&lt;/em&gt; interferes with cardiac fusion, consistent with an instructive role for PDGF signaling. Together, these data uncover a novel mechanism through which endodermal-myocardial communication can guide the cell movements that initiate cardiac morphogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Genetic defects in β-spectrin and tau sensitize C. elegans axons to movement-induced damage via torque-tension coupling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20172</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Our bodies are in constant motion and so are the neurons that invade each tissue. Motion-induced neuron deformation and damage are associated with several neurodegenerative conditions. Here, we investigated the question of how the neuronal cytoskeleton protects axons and dendrites from mechanical stress, exploiting mutations in UNC-70 β-spectrin, PTL-1 tau/MAP2-like and MEC-7 β-tubulin proteins in &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans.&lt;/em&gt; We found that mechanical stress induces supercoils and plectonemes in the sensory axons of spectrin and tau double mutants. Biophysical measurements, super-resolution, and electron microscopy, as well as numerical simulations of neurons as discrete, elastic rods provide evidence that a balance of torque, tension, and elasticity stabilizes neurons against mechanical deformation. We conclude that the spectrin and microtubule cytoskeletons work in combination to protect axons and dendrites from mechanical stress and propose that defects in β-spectrin and tau may sensitize neurons to damage.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Nematophagous fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora mimics olfactory cues of sex and food to lure its nematode prey</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20023</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e20023</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;To study the molecular basis for predator-prey coevolution, we investigated how &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt; responds to the predatory fungus &lt;em&gt;Arthrobotrys oligospora&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; and other nematodes were attracted to volatile compounds produced by &lt;em&gt;A. oligospora&lt;/em&gt;. Gas-chromatographic mass-spectral analyses of &lt;em&gt;A. oligospora&lt;/em&gt;-derived volatile metabolites identified several odors mimicking food cues attractive to nematodes. One compound, methyl 3-methyl-2-butenoate (MMB) additionally triggered strong sex- and stage-specific attraction in several &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis&lt;/em&gt; species. Furthermore, when MMB is present, it interferes with nematode mating, suggesting that MMB might mimic sex pheromone in &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis&lt;/em&gt; species. Forward genetic screening suggests that multiple receptors are involved in sensing MMB. Response to fungal odors involves the olfactory neuron AWCs. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed the GPCRs expressed in AWC. We propose that &lt;em&gt;A. oligospora&lt;/em&gt; likely evolved the means to use olfactory mimicry to attract its nematode prey through the olfactory neurons in &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; and related species.&lt;/p&gt;
