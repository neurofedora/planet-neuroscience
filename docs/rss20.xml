	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Relationships Between Characteristic Path Length, Efficiency, Clustering Coefficients, and Graph Density. (arXiv:1702.02621v2 [math.CO] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The graph theoretic properties of the clustering coefficient, characteristic
(or average) path length, global and local efficiency, provide valuable
information regarding the structure of a graph. These four properties have
applications to biological and social networks and have dominated much of the
the literature in these fields. While much work has done in applied settings,
there has yet to be a mathematical comparison of these metrics from a
theoretical standpoint. Motivated by networks appearing in neuroscience, we
show in this paper that these properties can be linked together using a single
property - graph density.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autonomous randomly coupled neural networks display a transition to chaos at
a critical coupling strength. We here investigate the effect of a time-varying
input on the onset of chaos and the resulting consequences for information
processing. Dynamic mean-field theory yields the statistics of the activity,
the maximum Lyapunov exponent, and the memory capacity of the network. We find
an exact condition that determines the transition from stable to chaotic
dynamics and the sequential memory capacity in closed form. The input
suppresses chaos by a dynamic mechanism, shifting the transition to
significantly larger coupling strengths than predicted by local stability
analysis. Beyond linear stability, a regime of coexistent locally expansive,
but non-chaotic dynamics emerges that optimizes the capacity of the network to
store sequential input.

	<description>Variance in spatial abilities are thought to be determined by in utero levels of testosterone and oestrogen, measurable in adults by the length ratio of the 2nd and 4th digit (2D:4D). We confirmed the relationship between 2D:4D and spatial performance using rats in two different tasks (paired-associate task and watermaze) and replicated this in humans. We further clarified anatomical and functional brain correlates of the association between 2D:4D and spatial performance in humans.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Adaptation to a Space-variant Visuomotor Delay can Cause Neglect-like Effects on Drawing Symmetry</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/193334v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/193334v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In daily interactions, our sensorimotor system accounts for spatial and temporal discrepancies between the senses. Functional lateralization between hemispheres causes differences in attention and control of action. In addition, differences in transmission delays between modalities affects motor control. Studies on hemispatial neglect syndrome suggest a link between temporal processing and lateral spatial biases. To understand this link, we studied participants who performed lateral reaching, and adapted to delayed visual feedback in either left, right, or both workspaces. We tested transfer of adaptation to blind drawing, and found that adaptation to left or both delay caused selective leftward elongation. In contrast, adaptation to right delay caused elongation in both directions. Arm dynamics alone cannot explain these findings, but a model of a combined attentional-motor asymmetry across the hemispheres explains our observations. This suggests a possible connection between laterality in delay processing and motor performances observed in cases of hemispatial neglect.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Predictive orientation remapping maintains a stable retinal percept</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/193250v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/193250v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Despite motion on the retina with every saccade, we perceive the world as stable. But whether this stability is a result of neurons constructing a spatial map or continually remapping a retinal representation is unclear. Previous work has focused on the perceptual consequences of shifts in the horizontal and vertical dimensions, but torsion is another key component in ocular orienting that - unlike horizontal and vertical movements - produces a natural misalignment between spatial and retinal coordinates. Here we took advantage of oblique eye orientation-induced retinal torsion to examine perisaccadic orientation perception. We found that orientation perception was largely predicted by the retinal image throughout each trial. Surprisingly however, we observed a significant presaccadic remapping of the percept consistent with maintaining a stable (but spatially inaccurate) retinotopic perception throughout the saccade. These findings strongly suggest that our seamless perceptual stability relies on retinotopic signals that are remapped with each saccade.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Daily activity and visual discrimination reflects the eye organization of weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Formicidae)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/193243v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/193243v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The currently studied ant Oecophylla smaragdina is arboreal in nature. It shows unique property in terms of its nest building behavior using leaves of the tree. The ant uses its eye to locate the food and nest. Eye types vary among ants living in the different habitat. In this context, the structure of the eye, daily activity and the foraging behaviour of O. smaragdina are missing from the literature. For the first time, the current study discovers: (1) the ant O. smaragdina forage in fully lighted condition. (2)The eye structure shows that the eye is adapted to a diurnal lifestyle. (3) The daily activity is proportional to the temperature of the surroundings. The study significantly correlates the role of vision in the foraging behaviour of O. smaragdina. The daily activity is further associated with the surrounding light and ambient temperature. The current study uncovers the structure of the eye and eye-related behaviour of the animal not described in earlier studies.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Effector-dependent response deterioration by stochastic transformations reveals mixed reference frames for decisions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/193235v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/193235v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Recent psychophysical and modeling studies have revealed that sensorimotor reference frame transformations (RFTs) add variability to motor output by decreasing the fidelity of sensory signals. How RFT stochasticity affects the sensory input underlying perceptual decisions, if at all, is unknown. To investigate this, we asked participants to perform a simple two-alternative motion direction discrimination task under varying conditions of head roll and/or stimulus rotation while responding either with a saccade or button press, allowing us to attribute behavioral effects to eye-, head- and shoulder-centered reference frames. We observed a rotation-induced, increase in reaction time and decrease in accuracy, indicating a degradation of motion evidence commensurate with a decrease in motion strength. Inter-participant differences in performance were best explained by a continuum of eye-head-shoulder representations of accumulated decision evidence, with eye- and shoulder-centered preferences during saccades and button presses, respectively. We argue that perceptual decision making and stochastic RFTs are inseparable, consistent with electrophysiological recordings in neural areas thought to be encoding sensorimotor signals for perceptual decisions. Furthermore, transformational stochasticity appears to be a generalized phenomenon, applicable throughout the perceptual and motor systems. We show for the first time that, by simply rolling one's head, perceptual decision making is impaired in a way that is captured by stochastic RFTs.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Electrophysiological correlates of semantic dissimilarity reflect the comprehension of natural, narrative speech.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/193201v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/193201v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Understanding natural speech requires that the human brain convert complex spectrotemporal patterns of acoustic input into meaning in a rapid manner that is reasonably tightly time-locked to the incoming speech signal. However, neural evidence for such a time-locked process has been lacking. Here, we sought such evidence by using a computational model to quantify the meaning carried by each word based on how semantically dissimilar it was to its preceding context and then regressing this quantity against electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded from subjects as they listened to narrative speech. This produced a prominent negativity at a time-lag of 200-600 ms on centro-parietal EEG electrodes. Subsequent EEG experiments involving time-reversed speech, cocktail party attention and audiovisual speech-in-noise demonstrated that this response was exquisitely sensitive to whether or not subjects were understanding the speech they heard. These findings demonstrate that, when successfully comprehending natural speech, the human brain encodes meaning as a function of the amount of new information carried by each word in a relatively time-locked fashion.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Perimenstrual Symptom Exacerbation in Borderline Personality Disorder: Evidence from Multilevel Models and the Carolina Premenstrual Assessment Scoring System</title>

	<description>Background. Individuals with BPD suffer from a constellation of rapidly shifting emotional, interpersonal, and behavioral symptoms. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones across the menstrual cycle may contribute to symptom expression and instability among females with this disorder. Method. 15 healthy, unmedicated females without dysmenorrhea meeting criteria for BPD reported daily emotional and behavioral symptoms across 35 days. Urine LH surge and salivary progesterone were used to confirm ovulation and verify cycle phase. Cyclical worsening of symptoms was evaluated using (1) phase contrasts in multilevel models and (2) the Carolina Premenstrual Assessment Scoring System (C-PASS), a standardized tool for evaluating clinically significant cycle effects on symptoms. Results. Despite low retrospective perceptions of perimenstrual symptom change, all symptoms showed marked perimenstrual worsening in prospective ratings, with secondary worsening of certain symptoms in the midluteal and follicular phases. The ovulatory phase was associated with the lowest symptoms. 11 of 15 females met C-PASS criteria for significant premenstrual symptom worsening. Conclusions. Females with BPD may be at elevated risk for perimenstrual worsening of emotional symptoms. Experimental work is needed to determine the pathophysiology of perimenstrual exacerbation in BPD.</description>

	<description>Dysregulation in immune responses during pregnancy increase the risk of a having a child with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases among pregnant women, and symptoms often worsen during pregnancy. We recently developed a mouse model of maternal allergic asthma (MAA) that induces changes in sociability, repetitive and perseverative behaviors in the offspring. Since epigenetic changes help a static genome adapt to the maternal environment, activation of the immune system may epigenetically alter fetal microglia, the brain's resident immune cells. We therefore tested the hypothesis that epigenomic alterations to microglia may be involved in behavioral abnormalities observed in MAA offspring. We used the genome-wide approaches of whole genome bisulfite sequencing to examine DNA methylation and RNA sequencing to examine gene expression in microglia from juvenile MAA offspring. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were enriched for immune signaling pathways and important microglial developmental transcription factor binding motifs. Differential expression analysis identified genes involved in controlling microglial sensitivity to the environment and shaping neuronal connections in the developing brain. Differentially expressed associated genes significantly overlapped genes with altered expression in human ASD cortex, supporting a role for microglia in the pathogenesis of ASD.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Effective reserve: a latent variable to improve outcome prediction in stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/192823v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/192823v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Prediction of functional outcome after stroke based on initial presentation remains an open challenge, suggesting that an important aspect is missing from these prediction models. There exists the notion of a protective mechanism called brain reserve, which may be utilized to understand variations in disease outcome. In this work we expand the concept of brain reserve (effective reserve) to improve prediction models of functional outcome after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Methods: Consecutive AIS patients with acute brain MRI (&amp;lt;48 hours) were eligible for this study. White matter hyperintensity and acute infarct volume were determined on T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion weighted images, respectively. Modified Rankin Scale scores (mRS) were obtained at 90 days post-stroke. Effective reserve (eR) was defined as a latent variable using structural equation modeling by including age, systolic blood pressure, and intracranial volume measurements. Results: Of 453 AIS patients (mean age 66.6{+/-}14.7 years), 36% were male and 311 hypertensive. There was inverse association between eR and 90-day mRS (path coefficient -0.18{+/-}0.01, p&amp;lt;0.01). As compared to a model without eR, correlation between predicted mRS and observed mRS improved in the eR-based model (Spearman's {rho}; 0.29{+/-}0.18 versus 0.15{+/-}0.17, p&amp;lt;0.001). Furthermore, hypertensive patients exhibited lower eR (p&amp;lt;10-6). Conclusion: Using eR in prediction models of stroke outcome is feasible and leads to better model performance. Furthermore, higher eR is associated with more favorable functional post-stoke outcome and might correspond to an overall better vascular health.</description>

	<description>Previous experience within an environment can influence subsequent behavior; however, what makes one strive for social dominance or capitulate to subordinance in a novel environment?

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Limited synapse overproduction can speed development but sometimes with long-term energy and discrimination penalties</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Harang Ju, Costa M. Colbert, William B. Levy&lt;/p&gt;

Neural circuit development requires that synapses be formed between appropriate neurons. In addition, for a hierarchical network, successful development involves a sequencing of developmental events. It has been suggested that one mechanism that helps speed up development of proper connections is an early overproduction of synapses. Using a computational model of synapse development, such as adaptive synaptogenesis, it is possible to study such overproduction and its role in speeding up development; it is also possible to study other outcomes of synapse overproduction that are seemingly new to the literature. With a fixed number of neurons, adaptive synaptogenesis can control the speed of synaptic development in two ways: by altering the rate constants of the adaptive processes or by altering the initial number of rapidly but non-selectively accrued synapses. Using either mechanism, the simulations reveal that synapse overproduction appears as an unavoidable concomitant of rapid adaptive synaptogenesis. However, the shortest development times, which always produces the greatest amount of synapse overproduction, reduce adult performance by three measures: energy-use, discrimination-error-rates, and proportional neuron allocation. Thus, the results here lead to the hypothesis that the observed speed of neural network development represents a particular inter-generational compromise, quick development benefits parental fecundity while slow development benefits offspring fecundity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5zD9wZtP8lg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Neuronal hyperactivity and hyperexcitability of the cerebral cortex and hippocampal region is an increasingly observed phenomenon in preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In later stages, oscillatory slowing and loss of functional connectivity are ubiquitous. Recent evidence suggests that neuronal dynamics have a prominent role in AD pathophysiology, making it a potentially interesting therapeutic target. However, although neuronal activity can be manipulated by various (non-)pharmacological means, intervening in a highly integrated system that depends on complex dynamics can produce counterintuitive and adverse effects. Computational dynamic network modeling may serve as a virtual test ground for developing effective interventions. To explore this approach, a previously introduced large-scale neural mass network with human brain topology was used to simulate the temporal evolution of AD-like, activity-dependent network degeneration. In addition, six defense strategies that either enhanced or diminished neuronal excitability were tested against the degeneration process, targeting excitatory and inhibitory neurons combined or separately. Outcome measures described oscillatory, connectivity and topological features of the damaged networks. Over time, the various interventions produced diverse large-scale network effects. Contrary to our hypothesis, the most successful strategy was a selective stimulation of all excitatory neurons in the network; it substantially prolonged the preservation of network integrity. The results of this study imply that functional network damage due to pathological neuronal activity can be opposed by targeted adjustment of neuronal excitability levels. The present approach may help to explore therapeutic effects aimed at preserving or restoring neuronal network integrity and contribute to better-informed intervention choices in future clinical trials in AD.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eyAjQb9AL8A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In the brain, the postsynaptic response of a neuron to time-varying inputs is determined by the interaction of presynaptic spike times with the short-term dynamics of each synapse. For a neuron driven by stochastic synapses, synaptic depression results in a quite different postsynaptic response to a large population input depending on how correlated in time the spikes across individual synapses are. Here we show using both simulations and mathematical analysis that not only the rate but the phase of the postsynaptic response to a rhythmic population input varies as a function of synaptic dynamics and synaptic configuration. Resultant phase leads may compensate for transmission delays and be predictive of rhythmic changes. This could be particularly important for sensory processing and motor rhythm generation in the nervous system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8BiXmlcj-cg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25009-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two hundred six (103 female) participants aged 3 to 20 years enrolled in the Inherited Neuropathies Consortium were assessed at baseline and 2 years. Demographic, anthropometric, and diagnostic information were collected. Disease progression was assessed with the CMT Pediatric Scale (CMTPedS), a reliable Rasch-built linearly weighted disability scale evaluating fine and gross motor function, strength, sensation, and balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25009-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, CMTPedS Total scores progressed at a rate of 2.4 ± 4.9 over 2 years (14% change from baseline; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). There was no difference between males and females (mean difference, 0.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.9 to 1.9; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.49). The most responsive CMTPedS items were dorsiflexion strength (z-score change, −0.3; 95% CI, −0.6 to −0.05; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02), balance (z-score change, −1.0; 95% CI, −1.9 to −0.09; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03), and long jump (z-score change, −0.4; 95% CI, −0.7 to −0.02; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04). Of the most common genetic subtypes, 111 participants with CMT1A/&lt;em&gt;PMP22&lt;/em&gt; duplication progressed by 1.8 ± 4.2 (12% change from baseline; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), 9 participants with CMT1B/&lt;em&gt;MPZ&lt;/em&gt; mutation progressed by 2.2 ± 5.1 (11% change), 6 participants with CMT2A/&lt;em&gt;MFN2&lt;/em&gt; mutation progressed by 6.2 ± 7.9 (23% change), and 7 participants with CMT4C/&lt;em&gt;SH3TC2&lt;/em&gt; mutations progressed by 3.0 ± 4.5 (12% change). Participants with CMT2A progressed faster than CMT1A (mean difference, −4.4; 95% CI, −8.1 to −0.8; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02). Children with CMT1A progressed consistently through early childhood (3–10 years) and adolescence (11–20 years; mean difference, 1.1; 95% CI, −0.6 to 2.7; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.19), whereas CMT2A appeared to progress faster during early childhood than adolescence (mean difference, 10.0; 95% CI, −2.2 to 22.2; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.08).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Understanding the rate at which children with CMT deteriorate is essential for adequately powering trials of disease-modifying interventions.

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25031-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study included singleton liveborn infants born to women enrolled in the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry between 1997 and 2016. Data were collected prospectively through telephone interviews. The prevalence of preterm birth (&amp;lt;37 weeks) and small for gestational age status (SGA) among infants exposed prenatally to AEDs when used by women with epilepsy (WWE) or women without epilepsy (WWOE) was compared with that among infants unexposed to AEDs and born to WWOE. Multivariate log-binomial regression models were used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25031-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study population included infants born to 6,777 AED-WWE, 696 AED-WWOE, and 486 no-AED-WWOE. The risk of prematurity was 6.2% for no-AED-WWOE, 9.3% for AED-WWE (RR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0–2.1), and 10.5% for AED-WWOE (RR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0–2.4). Prenatal exposure to AEDs in WWE and WWOE was associated with a mean lower birth weight of 110 and 136g, respectively, as compared to no-AED-WWOE. The prevalence of SGA was 5.0% for no-AED-WWOE, 10.9% for AED-WWE (RR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.3–3.0), and 11.0% for AED-WWOE (RR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2–2.9). Within users of AEDs in monotherapy, the prevalence of SGA ranged from 7.3% for lamotrigine to 18.5% for topiramate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25032-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rett syndrome (RTT) and epileptic encephalopathy (EE) are devastating neurodevelopmental disorders with distinct diagnostic criteria. However, highly heterogeneous and overlapping clinical features often allocate patients into the boundary of the two conditions, complicating accurate diagnosis and appropriate medical interventions. Therefore, we investigated the specific molecular mechanism that allows an understanding of the pathogenesis and relationship of these two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25032-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We screened novel genetic factors from 34 RTT-like patients without &lt;em&gt;MECP2&lt;/em&gt; mutations, which account for ∼90% of RTT cases, by whole-exome sequencing. The biological function of the discovered variants was assessed in cell culture and &lt;em&gt;Xenopus tropicalis&lt;/em&gt; models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25032-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified a recurring de novo variant in GABAB receptor R2 (&lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt;) that reduces the receptor function, whereas different &lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt; variants in EE patients possess a more profound effect in reducing receptor activity and are more responsive to agonist rescue in an animal model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25032-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt; is a genetic factor that determines RTT- or EE-like phenotype expression depending on the variant positions. &lt;em&gt;GABBR2&lt;/em&gt;-mediated γ-aminobutyric acid signaling is a crucial factor in determining the severity and nature of neurodevelopmental phenotypes.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Insufficient sleep: Enhanced risk-seeking relates to low local sleep intensity</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25023-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objectives&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic sleep restriction is highly prevalent in modern society and is, in its clinical form, insufficient sleep syndrome, one of the most prevalent diagnoses in clinical sleep laboratories, with substantial negative impact on health and community burden. It reflects every-day sleep loss better than acute sleep deprivation, but its effects and particularly the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown for a variety of critical cognitive domains, as, for example, risky decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25023-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assessed financial risk-taking behavior after 7 consecutive nights of sleep restriction and after 1 night of acute sleep deprivation compared to a regular sleep condition in a within-subject design. We further investigated potential underlying mechanisms of sleep-loss–induced changes in behavior by high-density electroencephalography recordings during restricted sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25023-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that chronic sleep restriction increases risk-seeking, whereas this was not observed after acute sleep deprivation. This increase was subjectively not noticed and was related to locally lower values of slow-wave energy during preceding sleep, an electrophysiological marker of sleep intensity and restoration, in electrodes over the right prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25023-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides, for the first time, evidence that insufficient sleep restoration over circumscribed cortical areas leads to aberrant behavior. In chronically sleep restricted subjects, low slow-wave sleep intensity over the right prefrontal cortex—which has been shown to be linked to risk behavior—may lead to increased and subjectively unnoticed risk-seeking.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying asymptomatic older individuals at elevated risk for developing Alzheimer disease (AD) is of clinical importance. Among 1,081 asymptomatic older adults, a recently validated polygenic hazard score (PHS) significantly predicted time to AD dementia and steeper longitudinal cognitive decline, even after controlling for &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; ɛ4 carrier status. Older individuals in the highest PHS percentiles showed the highest AD incidence rates. PHS predicted longitudinal clinical decline among older individuals with moderate to high Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (amyloid) and Braak (tau) scores at autopsy, even among &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; ɛ4 noncarriers. Beyond &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt;, PHS may help identify asymptomatic individuals at highest risk for developing Alzheimer neurodegeneration.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dysregulation of LIMK-1/cofilin-1 pathway: A possible basis for alteration of neuronal morphology in experimental cerebral malaria</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25028-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loss of cognition even after survival is the salient feature of cerebral malaria (CM). Currently, the fate of neuronal morphology is not studied at the ultrastructural level in CM. Recent studies suggest that maintenance of neuronal morphology and dendritic spine density (actin dynamics in particular) are essential for proper cognitive function. LIMK-1/cofilin-1 signaling pathway is known to be involved in the maintenance of actin dynamics through regulation of cofilin-1, and in executing learning and memory functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25028-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an experimental mouse model, we analyzed the behavioral parameters of asymptomatic mice with CM by performing a rapid murine coma and behavior scale experiment. We performed Golgi–Cox staining to assess neuronal morphology, dendritic spine density, and arborization in brain cortex subjected to &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium berghei ANKA&lt;/em&gt; infection compared to asymptomatic, anemic, and control groups. We studied the neural gene expression pattern of LIMK-1, cofilin-1, and β-actin in all the experimental groups by semiquantitative and quantitative polymerase chain reaction followed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25028-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observed significant loss of dendritic spine density, abnormal spine morphology, reduced dendritic arborization, and extensive dendritic varicosities in the cortical neurons of CM-infected brain. Furthermore, these observations correlated with diminished protein levels of LIMK-1, cofilin-1, phospho-cofilin-1, and β-actin in the whole brain lysates as well as formation of actin–cofilin rods in the brain sections of symptomatic mice with CM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25028-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, our findings suggest that the altered neuronal morphology and dysregulation of LIMK-1/cofilin-1 pathway could affect the cognitive outcome after experimental CM. Therefore, this study could help to establish newer therapeutic strategies addressing long-term cognitive impairment after CM.

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25026-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighty-seven patients with polysomnography-confirmed IRBD underwent &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I-FP-CIT DAT-SPECT. Results were compared to 20 matched controls without RBD who underwent DAT-SPECT. In patients, FP-CIT uptake was considered abnormal when values were two standard deviations below controls’ mean uptake. After DAT-SPECT, patients were followed up during 5.7 ± 2.2 (range, 2.6-9.9) years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25026-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baseline DAT deficit was found in 51 (58.6%) patients. During follow-up, 25 (28.7%) subjects developed clinically defined synucleinopathy (Parkinson's disease in 11, dementia with Lewy bodies in 13, and multiple system atrophy in 1) with mean latency of 3.2 ± 1.9 years from imaging. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed increased risk of incident synucleinopathy in patients with abnormal DAT-SPECT than with normal DAT-SPECT (20% vs 6% at 3 years, 33% vs 18% at 5 years; log rank test, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.006). Receiver operating characteristics curve revealed that reduction of FP-CIT uptake in putamen greater than 25% discriminated patients with DAT deficit who developed synucleinopathy from patients with DAT deficit that remained disease free after 3 years of follow-up. At 5-year follow-up, DAT-SPECT had 75% sensitivity, 51% specificity, 44% positive predictive value, 80% negative predictive value, and likelihood ratio 1.54 to predict synucleinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25026-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAT-SPECT identifies IRBD patients at short-term risk for synucleinopathy. Decreased FP-CIT putamen uptake greater than 25% predicts synucleinopathy after 3 years’ follow-up. These observations may be useful to select candidates for disease modification trials in IRBD.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Degeneration of serotonin neurons triggers spasticity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25030-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spasticity occurs in a wide range of neurological diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, after trauma, and after stroke, and is characterized by increased reflexes leading to muscle hypertonia. Spasticity is a painful symptom and can severely restrict everyday life, but might also participate in maintaining a low level of motor function in severely impaired patients. Constitutive activity of the serotonin receptors 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/C&lt;/sub&gt; is required for the development of spasticity after spinal cord injury and during amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We sought here to provide direct evidence for a role of brainstem serotonin neurons in spasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25030-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SOD1&lt;/em&gt;(G37R) mice expressing a conditional allele of an ALS-linked &lt;em&gt;SOD1&lt;/em&gt; mutation were crossed with Tph2-Cre mice expressing Cre in serotonergic neurons. Measurement of long-lasting reflex using electromyography, behavioral follow-up, and histological techniques was used to characterize spasticity and motor phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25030-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deleting mutant SOD1 expression selectively in brainstem serotonin neurons was sufficient to rescue loss of TPH2 immunoreactivity and largely preserve serotonin innervation of motor neurons in the spinal cord. Furthermore, this abrogated constitutive activity of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/C&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and abolished spasticity in end-stage mice. Consistent with spasticity mitigating motor symptoms, selective deletion worsened motor function and accelerated the onset of paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25030-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Degeneration of serotonin neurons is necessary to trigger spasticity through the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/C&lt;/sub&gt; receptor. The wide range of drugs targeting the serotonergic system could be useful to treat spasticity in neurological diseases. Ann Neurol 2017;82:444–456&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Blood-based metabolic signatures in Alzheimer's disease. (arXiv:1709.07285v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07285</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07285</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Identification of blood-based metabolic changes might provide
early and easy-to-obtain biomarkers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods: We included 127 AD patients and 121 controls with
CSF-biomarker-confirmed diagnosis (cut-off tau/A$\beta_{42}$: 0.52). Mass
spectrometry platforms determined the concentrations of 53 amine, 22 organic
acid, 120 lipid, and 40 oxidative stress compounds. Multiple signatures were
assessed: differential expression (nested linear models), classification
(logistic regression), and regulatory (network extraction).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: Twenty-six metabolites were differentially expressed. Metabolites
improved the classification performance of clinical variables from 74% to 79%.
Network models identified 5 hubs of metabolic dysregulation: Tyrosine,
glycylglycine, glutamine, lysophosphatic acid C18:2 and platelet activating
factor C16:0. The metabolite network for APOE $\epsilon$4 negative AD patients
was less cohesive compared to the network for APOE $\epsilon$4 positive AD
patients.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussion: Multiple signatures point to various promising peripheral markers
for further validation. The network differences in AD patients according to
APOE genotype may reflect different pathways to AD.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Yet Another ADNI Machine Learning Paper? Paving The Way Towards Fully-reproducible Research on Classification of Alzheimer's Disease. (arXiv:1709.07267v1 [stat.ML])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07267</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the number of papers on Alzheimer's disease classification
has increased dramatically, generating interesting methodological ideas on the
use machine learning and feature extraction methods. However, practical impact
is much more limited and, eventually, one could not tell which of these
approaches are the most efficient. While over 90\% of these works make use of
ADNI an objective comparison between approaches is impossible due to variations
in the subjects included, image pre-processing, performance metrics and
cross-validation procedures. In this paper, we propose a framework for
reproducible classification experiments using multimodal MRI and PET data from
ADNI. The core components are: 1) code to automatically convert the full ADNI
database into BIDS format; 2) a modular architecture based on Nipype in order
to easily plug-in different classification and feature extraction tools; 3)
feature extraction pipelines for MRI and PET data; 4) baseline classification
approaches for unimodal and multimodal features. This provides a flexible
framework for benchmarking different feature extraction and classification
tools in a reproducible manner. We demonstrate its use on all (1519) baseline
T1 MR images and all (1102) baseline FDG PET images from ADNI 1, GO and 2 with
SPM-based feature extraction pipelines and three different classification
techniques (linear SVM, anatomically regularized SVM and multiple kernel
learning SVM). The highest accuracies achieved were: 91% for AD vs CN, 83% for
MCIc vs CN, 75% for MCIc vs MCInc, 94% for AD-A$\beta$+ vs CN-A$\beta$- and 72%
for MCIc-A$\beta$+ vs MCInc-A$\beta$+. The code is publicly available at
https://gitlab.icm-institute.org/aramislab/AD-ML (depends on the Clinica
software platform, publicly available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clinica.run&quot;&gt;this http URL&lt;/a&gt;).

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: SimiNet: a Novel Method for Quantifying Brain Network Similarity. (arXiv:1709.07211v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07211</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Quantifying the similarity between two networks is critical in many
applications. A number of algorithms have been proposed to compute graph
similarity, mainly based on the properties of nodes and edges. Interestingly,
most of these algorithms ignore the physical location of the nodes, which is a
key factor in the context of brain networks involving spatially defined
functional areas. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm called &quot;SimiNet&quot;
for measuring similarity between two graphs whose nodes are defined a priori
within a 3D coordinate system. SimiNet provides a quantified index (ranging
from 0 to 1) that accounts for node, edge and spatiality features. Complex
graphs were simulated to evaluate the performance of SimiNet that is compared
with eight state-of-art methods. Results show that SimiNet is able to detect
weak spatial variations in compared graphs in addition to computing similarity
using both nodes and edges. SimiNet was also applied to real brain networks
obtained during a visual recognition task. The algorithm shows high performance
to detect spatial variation of brain networks obtained during a naming task of
two categories of visual stimuli: animals and tools. A perspective to this work
is a better understanding of object categorization in the human brain.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Done in 100 ms: Path-dependent visuomotor transformation in the human upper limb</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/192880v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/192880v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>A core assumption underlying mental chronometry is that more complex tasks increase cortical processing, prolonging reaction times. Here we show that increases in task complexity alter the magnitude, rather than the latency, of the output for a circuit that rapidly transforms visual information into motor actions. We quantified visual stimulus-locked responses (SLRs), which are changes in upper limb muscle recruitment that evolve at a fixed latency ~100 ms after novel visual stimulus onset. First, we studied the underlying reference frame of the SLR, by dissociating initial eye and hand position. Despite its quick latency, we found that the SLR was expressed in a hand-centric reference frame, suggesting that the circuit mediating the SLR integrated retinotopic visual information with body configuration. Next, we studied the influence of planned movement trajectory, requiring participants to prepare and generate curved or straight reaches in the presence of obstacles to attain the same visual stimulus. We found that SLR magnitude reflected the initial planned movement trajectory, regardless of the ensuing movement curvature. Based on these results, we suggest that the circuit mediating the SLR lies in parallel to other well-studied corticospinal pathways. Although the fixed latency of the SLR precludes extensive cortical processing, inputs conveying information relating to task complexity, such as body configuration and planned movement trajectory, can pre-set nodes within the circuit underlying to the SLR to modulate its magnitude.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dysconnection of right parietal and frontal cortex in neglect syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/192583v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/192583v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>A lesion to the right hemisphere of the brain often leads to perceptual neglect of the left side of the sensorium. The fact that lesions to different cortical regions lead to the same symptoms points to neglect as a dysconnection syndrome that may result from the dysconnection of a distributed network, rather than a disruption of computation in any particular brain region. To test this hypothesis, we used Bayesian analysis of effective connectivity based on electroencephalographic recordings in patients with left-sided neglect after a right-hemisphere lesion. While age-matched healthy controls showed a contralateral increase in connection strength between parietal and frontal cortex with respect to the laterality of the stimuli, neglect patients showed a dysconnection between parietal and frontal cortex in the right hemisphere when stimuli appeared on their neglected side, but preserved connectivity in the left hemisphere when stimuli appeared on their right. Crucially, this parieto-frontal feedback connectivity was aggravated in patients with more severe symptoms. In contrast, patients and controls did not show differences in the local connectivity within regions. These findings suggest that the aetiology of neglect may lie in the dysconnection of a distributed network, rather than the disruption of any particular brain region.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Stimulus familiarity and expectation jointly modulate neural activity in the visual ventral stream</title>

	<description>Prior knowledge about the visual world can change how a visual stimulus is processed. Two forms of prior knowledge are often distinguished: stimulus familiarity (i.e., whether a stimulus has been seen before) and stimulus expectation (i.e., whether a stimulus is expected to occur, based on the context). Neurophysiological studies in monkeys have shown suppression of spiking activity both for expected and for familiar items in object-selective inferotemporal cortex (IT). It is an open question, however, if and how these types of knowledge interact in their modulatory effects on the sensory response. In order to address this issue and to examine whether previous findings generalize to non-invasively measured neural activity in humans of both sexes, we separately manipulated stimulus familiarity and expectation, while non-invasively recording human brain activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We observed independent suppression of neural activity by familiarity and expectation, specifically in the lateral occipital complex (LOC), the putative human homologue of monkey IT. Familiarity also led to sharpened response dynamics, which was predominantly observed in early visual cortex. Together, these results show that distinct types of sensory knowledge jointly determine the amount of neural resources dedicated to object processing in the visual ventral stream.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Effects of tDCS Dosage on Working Memory in Healthy Participants</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/192419v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/192419v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been found to improve working memory (WM) performance in healthy participants following a single session. However, results are mixed and the overall effect size is small. Interpretation of these results is confounded by heterogeneous study designs, including differences in tDCS dose (current intensity) and sham conditions used. Aims: We systematically investigated the effect of tDCS dose on working memory using behavioural and neurophysiological outcomes. Methods: In a single-blind parallel group design, 100 participants were randomised across five groups to receive 15 minutes of bifrontal tDCS at different current intensities (2mA, 1mA, and three sham tDCS conditions at 0.034mA, 0.016mA, or 0mA). EEG activity was acquired while participants performed a WM task prior to, during, and following tDCS. Response time, accuracy and an event-related EEG component (P3) were evaluated. Results: We found no significant differences in response time or performance accuracy between current intensities. The P3 amplitude was significantly lower in the 0mA condition compared to the 0.034mA, 1mA and 2mA tDCS conditions. Changes in WM accuracy were moderately correlated with changes in the P3 amplitude following tDCS compared to baseline levels (r = 0.34). Conclusions: Working memory was not significantly altered by tDCS, regardless of dose. The P3 amplitude showed that stimulation at 1mA, 2mA and a sham condition (0.034mA) had biological effects, with the largest effect size for 1mA stimulation. These findings indicate higher sensitivity of neurophysiological outcomes to tDCS and suggests that sham stimulation previously considered inactive may alter neuronal function.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The neurobiology of agrammatic sentence comprehension: a lesion study</title>

	<description>Broca's area has long been implicated in sentence comprehension. Damage to this region is thought to be the central source of agrammatic comprehension in which performance is substantially worse (and near chance) on sentences with noncanonical word orders compared to canonical word order sentences (in English). This claim is supported by functional neuroimaging studies demonstrating greater activation in Broca's area for noncanonical versus canonical sentences. However, functional neuroimaging studies also have frequently implicated the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) in sentence processing more broadly, and recent lesion-symptom mapping studies have implicated the ATL and mid temporal regions in agrammatic comprehension. The present study investigates these seemingly conflicting findings in 66 left hemisphere patients with chronic focal cerebral damage. Patients completed two sentence comprehension measures, sentence-picture matching and plausibility judgments. Patients with damage including Broca's area (but excluding the temporal lobe; n=11) on average did not exhibit the expected agrammatic comprehension pattern, e.g. their performance was &amp;gt; 80% on noncanonical sentences in the sentence-picture matching task. Patients with ATL damage (n=18) also did not exhibit an agrammatic comprehension pattern. Across our entire patient sample, the lesions of patients with agrammatic comprehension patterns in either task had maximal overlap in posterior superior temporal and inferior parietal regions. Using voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM), we find that lower performances on canonical and noncanonical sentences in each task are both associated with damage to a large left superior temporal-inferior parietal network including portions of the ATL, but not Broca's area. Notably however, response bias in plausibility judgments was significantly associated with damage to inferior frontal cortex, including gray and white matter in Broca's area, suggesting that the contribution of Broca's area to sentence comprehension may be related to task-related cognitive demands.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Auditory brainstem responses to continuous natural speech in human listeners</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/192070v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Speech is an ecologically essential signal whose processing begins in the subcortical nuclei of the auditory brainstem, but there are few experimental options for studying these early responses under natural conditions. While encoding of continuous natural speech has been successfully probed in the cortex with neurophysiological tools such as electro- and magnetoencephalography, the rapidity of subcortical response components combined with unfavorable signal to noise ratios has prevented application of those methods to the brainstem. Instead, experiments have used thousands of repetitions of simple stimuli such as clicks, tonebursts, or brief spoken syllables, with deviations from those paradigms leading to ambiguity in the neural origins of measured responses. In this study we developed and tested a new way to measure the auditory brainstem response to ongoing, naturally uttered speech. We found a high degree of morphological similarity between the speech-evoked auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and the standard click-evoked ABR, notably a preserved wave V, the most prominent voltage peak in the standard click-evoked ABR. Because this method yields distinct peaks at latencies too short to originate from the cortex, the responses measured can be unambiguously determined to be subcortical in origin. The use of naturally uttered speech to evoke the ABR allows the design of engaging behavioral tasks, facilitating new investigations of the effects of cognitive processes like language processing and attention on brainstem processing.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dynamical modulation of theta-gamma coupling during REM sleep</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/169656v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/169656v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Theta phase modulates gamma amplitude during spatial navigation and rapid eye movement sleep (REMs). Although the REMs theta rhythm has been linked to spatial memory consolidation, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We investigate dynamics of theta-gamma interactions across multiple frequency and temporal scales in simultaneous recordings from hippocampal CA3, CA1, subiculum, and cortical EEG. We show that theta phase significantly modulates three distinct gamma bands during REMs, dynamically. Interestingly, we further show that theta-gamma coupling swings between different hippocampal and cortical sites during REMs and tends to increase over a single REMs episode. Comparing to active wake, theta-gamma coupling during REMs is significantly increased for subicular and cortical, but not for CA3 and CA1, recordings. Finally, we show that optogenetic silencing of septohippocampal GABAergic projections significantly impedes both theta-gamma coupling and theta coherence, two neural mechanisms of working and long-term memory. We hypothesize that theta-gamma coupling provides a predominant mechanism for information processing within each brain region, while the switching of coupling activity between regions establishes a specific phase-space coding of information during memory processes and sleep.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Spatiotemporal network coding of physiological mossy fiber inputs by the cerebellar granular layer</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Shyam Kumar Sudhakar, Sungho Hong, Ivan Raikov, Rodrigo Publio, Claus Lang, Thomas Close, Daqing Guo, Mario Negrello, Erik De Schutter&lt;/p&gt;

The granular layer, which mainly consists of granule and Golgi cells, is the first stage of the cerebellar cortex and processes spatiotemporal information transmitted by mossy fiber inputs with a wide variety of firing patterns. To study its dynamics at multiple time scales in response to inputs approximating real spatiotemporal patterns, we constructed a large-scale 3D network model of the granular layer. Patterned mossy fiber activity induces rhythmic Golgi cell activity that is synchronized by shared parallel fiber input and by gap junctions. This leads to long distance synchrony of Golgi cells along the transverse axis, powerfully regulating granule cell firing by imposing inhibition during a specific time window. The essential network mechanisms, including tunable Golgi cell oscillations, on-beam inhibition and NMDA receptors causing first winner keeps winning of granule cells, illustrate how fundamental properties of the granule layer operate in tandem to produce (1) well timed and spatially bound output, (2) a wide dynamic range of granule cell firing and (3) transient and coherent gating oscillations. These results substantially enrich our understanding of granule cell layer processing, which seems to promote spatial group selection of granule cell activity as a function of timing of mossy fiber input.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jyKqxhhCuFs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: T1-/T2-weighted ratio differs in demyelinated cortex in multiple sclerosis</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detecting cortical demyelination in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is difficult. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ratio maps of T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) images may be sensitive to cortical myelin levels. In this MRI–histological study, postmortem in situ scans were acquired from 6 cadavers with MS on a 3T MRI machine. Immunocytochemistry was used to correlate myelin status and cortical T1w/T2w measures. The results showed that the T1w/T2w values significantly differed between demyelinated and myelinated cortex (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). The T1w/T2w ratio maps may be a relatively simple, clinically feasible method to assess cortical demyelination. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Some recent papers relate the criticality of complex systems to their maximal
capacity of information processing. In the present paper, we consider high
dimensional point processes, known as age-dependent Hawkes processes, which
have been used to model spiking neural networks. Using mean-field
approximation, the response of the network to a stimulus is computed and we
provide a notion of stimulus sensitivity. It appears that the maximal
sensitivity is achieved in the sub-critical regime, yet almost critical for a
range of biologically relevant parameters.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06950</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have proposed that the diffusion of messenger molecules, such
as monoamines, can mediate the plastic adaptation of synapses in supervised
learning of neural networks. Based on these findings we developed a model for
neural learning, where the signal for plastic adaptation is assumed to
propagate through the extracellular space. We investigate the conditions
allowing learning of Boolean rules in a neural network. Even fully excitatory
networks show very good learning performances. Moreover, the investigation of
the plastic adaptation features optimizing the performance suggests that
learning is very sensitive to the extent of the plastic adaptation and the
spatial range of synaptic connections.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;By controlling the state of neuronal populations, neuromodulators ultimately
affect behaviour. A key neuromodulation mechanism is the alteration of neuronal
excitability via the modulation of ion channel expression. This type of
neuromodulation is normally studied via conductance-based models, but those
models are computationally challenging for large-scale network simulations
needed in population studies. This paper studies the modulation properties of
the Multi-Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (MQIF) model, a generalisation of the
classical Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) model. The model is shown to
combine the computational economy of integrate-and-fire modelling and the
physiological interpretability of conductance-based modelling. It is therefore
a good candidate for affordable computational studies of neuromodulation in
large networks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to make timely and accurate decisions is critical for cancer
detection in diagnostic pathology. We describe a joint experimental and
computational modeling approach for determining the impact of three factors on
the identification of peripheral blood blast cells (cancer indicators) versus
normal white blood cells in microscopy images of clinical samples: (1) image
difficulty, (2) time pressure, and (3) externally imposed bias. Our study also
examines how performance on accurate identification of blast cell images is
related to general object recognition ability (as measured using the Novel
Object Memory Test (NOMT) (Richler et al., 2017). For this study we collected a
bank of hundreds of digital images that were identified by cell type and
classified by difficulty by a panel of expert hematopathologists. Participants
in this study were a non-expert, student population. The Diffusion Decision
Model was fit to choice and response time results of this experiment to
determine how these factors influence decision processes. Results indicate that
external time pressure leads to a reduction in caution in participants while
external bias has a small but detectable influence on choices. Comparison of
cancer image identification results with NOMT results indicates participants
with stronger general object recognition ability perform better on the cell
identification task, but only on easier images. This indicates that general
object recognition ability carries over to this diagnostic task to a limited
extent.

	<description>Online experiments using visual stimuli have become increasingly common in recent years, but many frequently-used stimuli in visual psychophysical experiments have yet to be developed for web-based platforms. Here, we introduce the first open-access random-dot kinematogram (RDK) for use in web browsers. This fully-customizable RDK offers options to implement several different types of noise (random position, random walk, random direction) and parameters to control aperture shape, coherence level, the number of dots, and many other features. We include links to commented JavaScript code for easy implementation in online experiments, as well as an example of how this stimulus can be integrated as a plugin with an online experimental library (jsPsych).</description>

	<description>There is a severe limitation in the number of items that can be held in working memory. However, the neurophysiological limits remain unknown. We asked whether the capacity limit might be explained by differences in neuronal coupling. We developed a theoretical model based on Predictive Coding and used it to analyze Cross Spectral Density data from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), frontal eye fields (FEF) and lateral intraparietal area (LIP). Monkeys performed a change detection task (Buschman et al., 2011). The number of objects that had to be remembered (memory load) was varied (1-3 objects in the same visual hemifield). Changes in memory load changed the connectivity in the PFC-FEF-LIP network. Feedback (top-down) coupling broke down when the number of objects exceeded cognitive capacity. This provides new insights into the neuronal underpinnings of cognitive capacity and how coupling in a distributed working memory network is affected by memory load.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Salient Experiences are Represented by Unique Transcriptional Signatures in the Brain</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/192278v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Inducible transcription is essential for consolidation of salient experiences into long-term memory. However, the question of whether inducible transcription relays information representing the identity of the experience being encoded, has not been explored. To this end, we have analyzed transcription across multiple brain regions, induced by a variety of rewarding and aversive experiences. Our results define robust transcriptional signatures uniquely characterizing individual salient experiences. A subset of these induced transcriptional markers suffice for near-perfect decoding of the identity of recent experiences at the level of individual mice. Furthermore, experiences with shared attributes display commonalities in their transcriptional representation, exemplified in the representation of valence, habituation and reinforcement. Taken together, our results demonstrate the existence of a neural transcriptional code that represents the encoding of experiences in the mouse brain. This code is comprised of distinct transcriptional signatures that correlate to the affective attributes of the experiences that are being encoded.</description>

Much laboratory work has been carried out to determine the gene regulatory network (GRN) that results in plant cells becoming flowers instead of leaves. However, this also involves the spatial distribution of different cell types, and poses the question of whether alternative networks could produce the same set of observed results. This issue has been addressed here through a survey of the published intercellular distribution of expressed regulatory genes and techniques both developed and applied to Boolean network models. This has uncovered a large number of models which are compatible with the currently available data. An exhaustive exploration had some success but proved to be unfeasible due to the massive number of alternative models, so genetic programming algorithms have also been employed. This approach allows exploration on the basis of both data-fitting criteria and parsimony of the regulatory processes, ruling out biologically unrealistic mechanisms. One of the conclusions is that, despite the multiplicity of acceptable models, an overall structure dominates, with differences mostly in alternative fine-grained regulatory interactions. The overall structure confirms the known interactions, including some that were not present in the training set, showing that current data are sufficient to determine the overall structure of the GRN. The model stresses the importance of relative spatial location, through explicit references to this aspect. This approach also provides a quantitative indication of how likely some regulatory interactions might be, and can be applied to the study of other developmental transitions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qVKpUDdy8tQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: NF-{kappa}B Activation Protects Oligodendrocytes against Inflammation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/38/9332?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/38/9332?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;NF-B is a key player in inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, the effects of NF-B activation on oligodendrocytes in MS and EAE remain unknown. We generated a mouse model that expresses IBαN, a super-suppressor of NF-B, specifically in oligodendrocytes and demonstrated that IBαN expression had no effect on oligodendrocytes under normal conditions (both sexes). Interestingly, we showed that oligodendrocyte-specific expression of IBαN blocked NF-B activation in oligodendrocytes and resulted in exacerbated oligodendrocyte death and hypomyelination in young, developing mice that express IFN- ectopically in the CNS (both sexes). We also showed that NF-B inactivation in oligodendrocytes aggravated IFN--induced remyelinating oligodendrocyte death and remyelination failure in the cuprizone model (male mice). Moreover, we found that NF-B inactivation in oligodendrocytes increased the susceptibility of mice to EAE (female mice). These findings imply the cytoprotective effects of NF-B activation on oligodendrocytes in MS and EAE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS. NF-B is a major player in inflammatory diseases that acts by regulating inflammation and cell viability. Data indicate that NF-B activation in inflammatory cells facilitates the development of MS. However, to date, attempts to understand the role of NF-B activation in oligodendrocytes in MS have been unsuccessful. Herein, we generated a mouse model that allows for inactivation of NF-B specifically in oligodendrocytes and then used this model to determine the precise role of NF-B activation in oligodendrocytes in models of MS. The results presented in this study represent the first demonstration that NF-B activation acts cell autonomously to protect oligodendrocytes against inflammation in animal models of MS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Location of the Mesopontine Neurons Responsible for Maintenance of Anesthetic Loss of Consciousness</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/38/9320?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/38/9320?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The transition from wakefulness to general anesthesia is widely attributed to suppressive actions of anesthetic molecules distributed by the systemic circulation to the cerebral cortex (for amnesia and loss of consciousness) and to the spinal cord (for atonia and antinociception). An alternative hypothesis proposes that anesthetics act on one or more brainstem or diencephalic nuclei, with suppression of cortex and spinal cord mediated by dedicated axonal pathways. Previously, we documented induction of an anesthesia-like state in rats by microinjection of small amounts of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;-receptor agonists into an upper brainstem region named the mesopontine tegmental anesthesia area (MPTA). Correspondingly, lesioning this area rendered animals resistant to systemically delivered anesthetics. Here, using rats of both sexes, we applied a modified microinjection method that permitted localization of the anesthetic-sensitive neurons with much improved spatial resolution. Microinjected at the MPTA hotspot identified, exposure of 1900 or fewer neurons to muscimol was sufficient to sustain whole-body general anesthesia; microinjection as little as 0.5 mm off-target did not. The GABAergic anesthetics pentobarbital and propofol were also effective. The GABA-sensitive cell cluster is centered on a tegmental (reticular) field traversed by fibers of the superior cerebellar peduncle. It has no specific nuclear designation and has not previously been implicated in brain-state transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; General anesthesia permits pain-free surgery. Furthermore, because anesthetic agents have the unique ability to reversibly switch the brain from wakefulness to a state of unconsciousness, knowing how and where they work is a potential route to unraveling the neural mechanisms that underlie awareness itself. Using a novel method, we have located a small, and apparently one of a kind, cluster of neurons in the mesopontine tegmentum that are capable of effecting brain-state switching when exposed to GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;-receptor agonists. This action appears to be mediated by a network of dedicated axonal pathways that project directly and/or indirectly to nearby arousal nuclei of the brainstem and to more distant targets in the forebrain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Imaging Voltage in Genetically Defined Neuronal Subpopulations with a Cre Recombinase-Targeted Hybrid Voltage Sensor</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Genetically encoded voltage indicators create an opportunity to monitor electrical activity in defined sets of neurons as they participate in the complex patterns of coordinated electrical activity that underlie nervous system function. Taking full advantage of genetically encoded voltage indicators requires a generalized strategy for targeting the probe to genetically defined populations of cells. To this end, we have generated a mouse line with an optimized hybrid voltage sensor (hVOS) probe within a locus designed for efficient Cre recombinase-dependent expression. Crossing this mouse with Cre drivers generated double transgenics expressing hVOS probe in GABAergic, parvalbumin, and calretinin interneurons, as well as hilar mossy cells, new adult-born neurons, and recently active neurons. In each case, imaging in brain slices from male or female animals revealed electrically evoked optical signals from multiple individual neurons in single trials. These imaging experiments revealed action potentials, dynamic aspects of dendritic integration, and trial-to-trial fluctuations in response latency. The rapid time response of hVOS imaging revealed action potentials with high temporal fidelity, and enabled accurate measurements of spike half-widths characteristic of each cell type. Simultaneous recording of rapid voltage changes in multiple neurons with a common genetic signature offers a powerful approach to the study of neural circuit function and the investigation of how neural networks encode, process, and store information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Genetically encoded voltage indicators hold great promise in the study of neural circuitry, but realizing their full potential depends on targeting the sensor to distinct cell types. Here we present a new mouse line that expresses a hybrid optical voltage sensor under the control of Cre recombinase. Crossing this line with Cre drivers generated double-transgenic mice, which express this sensor in targeted cell types. In brain slices from these animals, single-trial hybrid optical voltage sensor recordings revealed voltage changes with submillisecond resolution in multiple neurons simultaneously. This imaging tool will allow for the study of the emergent properties of neural circuits and permit experimental tests of the roles of specific types of neurons in complex circuit activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Atypical MAP Kinase SWIP-13/ERK8 Regulates Dopamine Transporters through a Rho-Dependent Mechanism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/38/9288?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/38/9288?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) regulates multiple behaviors across phylogeny, with disrupted DA signaling in humans associated with addiction, attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease. The DA transporter (DAT) imposes spatial and temporal limits on DA action, and provides for presynaptic DA recycling to replenish neurotransmitter pools. Molecular mechanisms that regulate DAT expression, trafficking, and function, particularly &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, remain poorly understood, though recent studies have implicated rho-linked pathways in psychostimulant action. To identify genes that dictate the ability of DAT to sustain normal levels of DA clearance, we pursued a forward genetic screen in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; based on the phenotype swimming-induced paralysis (Swip), a paralytic behavior observed in hermaphrodite worms with loss-of-function &lt;i&gt;dat-1&lt;/i&gt; mutations. Here, we report the identity of &lt;i&gt;swip-13&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes a highly conserved ortholog of the human atypical MAP kinase ERK8. We present evidence that SWIP-13 acts presynaptically to insure adequate levels of surface DAT expression and DA clearance. Moreover, we provide &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; evidence supporting a conserved pathway involving SWIP-13/ERK8 activation of Rho GTPases that dictates DAT surface expression and function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Signaling by the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) is tightly regulated by the DA transporter (DAT), insuring efficient DA clearance after release. Molecular networks that regulate DAT are poorly understood, particularly &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Using a forward genetic screen in the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, we implicate the atypical mitogen activated protein kinase, SWIP-13, in DAT regulation. Moreover, we provide &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; evidence that SWIP-13, as well as its human counterpart ERK8, regulate DAT surface availability via the activation of Rho proteins. Our findings implicate a novel pathway that regulates DA synaptic availability and that may contribute to risk for disorders linked to perturbed DA signaling. Targeting this pathway may be of value in the development of therapeutics in such disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Systemic Neutrophil Depletion Modulates the Migration and Fate of Transplanted Human Neural Stem Cells to Rescue Functional Repair</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The interaction of transplanted stem cells with local cellular and molecular cues in the host CNS microenvironment may affect the potential for repair by therapeutic cell populations. In this regard, spinal cord injury (SCI), Alzheimer's disease, and other neurological injuries and diseases all exhibit dramatic and dynamic changes to the host microenvironment over time. Previously, we reported that delayed transplantation of human CNS-derived neural stem cells (hCNS-SCns) at 9 or 30 d post-SCI (dpi) resulted in extensive donor cell migration, predominantly neuronal and oligodendrocytic donor cell differentiation, and functional locomotor improvements. Here, we report that acute transplantation of hCNS-SCns at 0 dpi resulted in localized astroglial differentiation of donor cells near the lesion epicenter and failure to produce functional improvement in an all-female immunodeficient mouse model. Critically, specific immunodepletion of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) blocked hCNS-SCns astroglial differentiation near the lesion epicenter and rescued the capacity of these cells to restore function. These data represent novel evidence that a host immune cell population can block the potential for functional repair derived from a therapeutic donor cell population, and support targeting the inflammatory microenvironment in combination with cell transplantation after SCI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The interaction of transplanted cells with local cellular and molecular cues in the host microenvironment is a key variable that may shape the translation of neurotransplantation research to the clinical spinal cord injury (SCI) human population, and few studies have investigated these events. We show that the specific immunodepletion of polymorphonuclear leukocyte neutrophils using anti-Ly6G inhibits donor cell astrogliosis and rescues the capacity of a donor cell population to promote locomotor improvement after SCI. Critically, our data demonstrate novel evidence that a specific host immune cell population can block the potential for functional repair derived from a therapeutic donor cell population.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Although intensive studies have been focused on the excitatory synaptic system, much less is known concerning the mechanisms mediating inhibitory synaptic dysfunction in AD. We reported previously that protocadherin-C5 (Pcdh-C5), a member of clustered Pcdh- subfamily of cadherin-type synaptic adhesion proteins, functions to promote GABAergic synaptic transmission. We reveal here that Pcdh-C5 is enriched in vesicular GABA transporter-positive synaptic puncta and its expression levels are increased in neuronal hyperexcitation conditions, upon β-amyloid (Aβ) treatment, and in amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1)-transgenic mice of both sexes. This is associated with elevated levels of GABAergic proteins and enhanced synaptic inhibition. Genetic knock-down experiments showed that Pcdh-C5 modulates spontaneous synaptic currents and Aβ-induced synaptic alterations directly. Our results support a model in which Pcdh-C5 senses neuronal hyperexcitation to augment GABAergic inhibition. This adaptive mechanism may be dysregulated under chronic excitation conditions such as AD, leading to aberrant Pcdh-C5 expression and associated synaptic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Synaptic dysfunction is causal for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we reveal a novel pathway that contributes GABAergic synaptic dysfunction in AD mediated by protocadherin-C5. Our study not only identifies a new mechanism mediating excitatory/inhibitory balance in AD, but may also offer a new target for potential therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Impaired Feedforward Control and Enhanced Feedback Control of Speech in Patients with Cerebellar Degeneration</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cerebellum has been hypothesized to form a crucial part of the speech motor control network. Evidence for this comes from patients with cerebellar damage, who exhibit a variety of speech deficits, as well as imaging studies showing cerebellar activation during speech production in healthy individuals. To date, the precise role of the cerebellum in speech motor control remains unclear, as it has been implicated in both anticipatory (feedforward) and reactive (feedback) control. Here, we assess both anticipatory and reactive aspects of speech motor control, comparing the performance of patients with cerebellar degeneration and matched controls. Experiment 1 tested feedforward control by examining speech adaptation across trials in response to a consistent perturbation of auditory feedback. Experiment 2 tested feedback control, examining online corrections in response to inconsistent perturbations of auditory feedback. Both male and female patients and controls were tested. The patients were impaired in adapting their feedforward control system relative to controls, exhibiting an attenuated anticipatory response to the perturbation. In contrast, the patients produced even larger compensatory responses than controls, suggesting an increased reliance on sensory feedback to guide speech articulation in this population. Together, these results suggest that the cerebellum is crucial for maintaining accurate feedforward control of speech, but relatively uninvolved in feedback control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Speech motor control is a complex activity that is thought to rely on both predictive, feedforward control as well as reactive, feedback control. While the cerebellum has been shown to be part of the speech motor control network, its functional contribution to feedback and feedforward control remains controversial. Here, we use real-time auditory perturbations of speech to show that patients with cerebellar degeneration are impaired in adapting feedforward control of speech but retain the ability to make online feedback corrections; indeed, the patients show an increased sensitivity to feedback. These results indicate that the cerebellum forms a crucial part of the feedforward control system for speech but is not essential for online, feedback control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Synaptic Excitation in Spinal Motoneurons Alternates with Synaptic Inhibition and Is Balanced by Outward Rectification during Rhythmic Motor Network Activity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Regular firing in spinal motoneurons of red-eared turtles (&lt;i&gt;Trachemys scripta elegans&lt;/i&gt;, either sex) evoked by steady depolarization at rest is replaced by irregular firing during functional network activity. The transition caused by increased input conductance and synaptic fluctuations in membrane potential was suggested to originate from intense concurrent inhibition and excitation. We show that the conductance increase in motoneurons during functional network activity is mainly caused by intrinsic outward rectification near threshold for action potentials by activation of voltage and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; gated K channels. Intrinsic outward rectification facilitates spiking by focusing synaptic depolarization near threshold for action potentials. By direct recording of synaptic currents, we also show that motoneurons are activated by out-of-phase peaks in excitation and inhibition during network activity, whereas continuous low-level concurrent inhibition and excitation may contribute to irregular firing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neurons embedded in active neural networks can enter a high-conductance state. High-conductance states were observed in spinal motoneurons during rhythmic motor behavior. Assuming no change in intrinsic conductance, it was suggested that the high-conductance state in motoneurons originated from balanced inhibition and excitation. In this study, we demonstrate that intrinsic outward rectification significantly contributes to the high-conductance state. Outward rectification balances synaptic excitation and maintains membrane potential near spike threshold. In addition, direct synaptic current recordings show out-of-phase excitation and inhibition in motoneurons during rhythmic network activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dedicated Hippocampal Inhibitory Networks for Locomotion and Immobility</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/38/9222?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/38/9222?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Network activity is strongly tied to animal movement; however, hippocampal circuits selectively engaged during locomotion or immobility remain poorly characterized. Here we examined whether distinct locomotor states are encoded differentially in genetically defined classes of hippocampal interneurons. To characterize the relationship between interneuron activity and movement, we used &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, two-photon calcium imaging in CA1 of male and female mice, as animals performed a virtual-reality (VR) track running task. We found that activity in most somatostatin-expressing and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons positively correlated with locomotion. Surprisingly, nearly one in five somatostatin or one in seven parvalbumin interneurons were inhibited during locomotion and activated during periods of immobility. Anatomically, the somata of somatostatin immobility-activated neurons were smaller than those of movement-activated neurons. Furthermore, immobility-activated interneurons were distributed across cell layers, with somatostatin-expressing cells predominantly in stratum oriens and parvalbumin-expressing cells mostly in stratum pyramidale. Importantly, each cell's correlation between activity and movement was stable both over time and across VR environments. Our findings suggest that hippocampal interneuronal microcircuits are preferentially active during either movement or immobility periods. These inhibitory networks may regulate information flow in &quot;labeled lines&quot; within the hippocampus to process information during distinct behavioral states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The hippocampus is required for learning and memory. Movement controls network activity in the hippocampus but it's unclear how hippocampal neurons encode movement state. We investigated neural circuits active during locomotion and immobility and found interneurons were selectively active during movement or stopped periods, but not both. Each cell's response to locomotion was consistent across time and environments, suggesting there are separate dedicated circuits for processing information during locomotion and immobility. Understanding how the hippocampus switches between different network configurations may lead to therapeutic approaches to hippocampal-dependent dysfunctions, such as Alzheimer's disease or cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Conditional Deletion of Prnp Rescues Behavioral and Synaptic Deficits after Disease Onset in Transgenic Alzheimer's Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Biochemical and genetic evidence implicate soluble oligomeric amyloid-β (Aβo) in triggering Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. Moreover, constitutive deletion of the Aβo-binding cellular prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) prevents development of memory deficits in APP&lt;sub&gt;swe&lt;/sub&gt;/PS1E9 mice, a model of familial AD. Here, we define the role of PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; to rescue or halt established AD endophenotypes in a therapeutic disease-modifying time window after symptom onset. Deletion of &lt;i&gt;Prnp&lt;/i&gt; at either 12 or 16 months of age fully reverses hippocampal synapse loss and completely rescues preexisting behavioral deficits by 17 months. In contrast, but consistent with a neuronal function for Aβo/PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; signaling, plaque density, microgliosis, and astrocytosis are not altered. Degeneration of catecholaminergic neurons remains unchanged by PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; reduction after disease onset. These results define the potential of targeting PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; as a disease-modifying therapy for certain AD-related phenotypes after disease onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The study presented here further elucidates our understanding of the soluble oligomeric amyloid-β–Aβo-binding cellular prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) signaling pathway in a familial form of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by implicating PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; as a potential therapeutic target for AD. In particular, genetic deletion of &lt;i&gt;Prnp&lt;/i&gt; rescued several familial AD (FAD)-associated phenotypes after disease onset in a mouse model of FAD. This study underscores the therapeutic potential of PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; deletion given that patients already present symptoms at the time of diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Disruption of M1 Activity during Performance Plateau Impairs Consolidation of Motor Memories</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/38/9197?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Upon exposure to a new sensorimotor relationship, motor behaviors iteratively change early in adaptation but eventually stabilize as adaptation proceeds. Behavioral work suggests that motor memory consolidation is initiated upon the attainment of asymptotic levels of performance. Separate lines of evidence point to a critical role of the primary motor cortex (M1) in consolidation. However, a causal relationship between M1 activity during asymptote and consolidation has yet to be demonstrated. The present study investigated this issue in male and female participants using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to interfere with postmovement activity in M1 in two behavioral phases of a ramp-and-hold visuomotor adaptation paradigm. TMS was either provided after each trial of the ramp phase of adaptation when a gradual increase in the visuomotor rotation caused movements to be changing, or after each trial of the hold phase of adaptation when the rotation was held constant and movements tended to stabilize. Consolidation was assessed by measuring performance on the same task 24 h later. Results revealed that TMS did not influence adaptation to the new visuomotor relationship in either condition. Critically, however, TMS disruption of M1 activity selectively impaired consolidation of motor memories when it was provided during the hold phase of adaptation. This effect did not take place when TMS was delivered over adjacent dorsal premotor cortex or when motor behaviors in late adaptation were prevented from plateauing. Together, these data suggest that the impaired consolidation stemmed from interference with mechanisms of repetition-dependent plasticity in M1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The present work demonstrates that TMS disruption of M1 activity impairs the consolidation of motor memories selectively when performance reaches asymptotic levels during sensorimotor adaptation. These findings provide evidence for a causal contribution of M1 to motor memory formation when movements tend to repeat, likely through mechanisms of repetition-dependent plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to parse a complex auditory scene into perceptual objects is facilitated by a hierarchical auditory system. Successive stages in the hierarchy transform an auditory scene of multiple overlapping sources, from peripheral tonotopically based representations in the auditory nerve, into perceptually distinct auditory-object-based representations in the auditory cortex. Here, using magnetoencephalography recordings from men and women, we investigate how a complex acoustic scene consisting of multiple speech sources is represented in distinct hierarchical stages of the auditory cortex. Using systems-theoretic methods of stimulus reconstruction, we show that the primary-like areas in the auditory cortex contain dominantly spectrotemporal-based representations of the entire auditory scene. Here, both attended and ignored speech streams are represented with almost equal fidelity, and a global representation of the full auditory scene with all its streams is a better candidate neural representation than that of individual streams being represented separately. We also show that higher-order auditory cortical areas, by contrast, represent the attended stream separately and with significantly higher fidelity than unattended streams. Furthermore, the unattended background streams are more faithfully represented as a single unsegregated background object rather than as separated objects. Together, these findings demonstrate the progression of the representations and processing of a complex acoustic scene up through the hierarchy of the human auditory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Using magnetoencephalography recordings from human listeners in a simulated cocktail party environment, we investigate how a complex acoustic scene consisting of multiple speech sources is represented in separate hierarchical stages of the auditory cortex. We show that the primary-like areas in the auditory cortex use a dominantly spectrotemporal-based representation of the entire auditory scene, with both attended and unattended speech streams represented with almost equal fidelity. We also show that higher-order auditory cortical areas, by contrast, represent an attended speech stream separately from, and with significantly higher fidelity than, unattended speech streams. Furthermore, the unattended background streams are represented as a single undivided background object rather than as distinct background objects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Effects of Selective Deafferentation on the Discharge Characteristics of Medial Rectus Motoneurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/38/9172?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/38/9172?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Medial rectus motoneurons receive two main pontine inputs: abducens internuclear neurons, whose axons course through the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), and neurons in the lateral vestibular nucleus, whose axons project through the ascending tract of Deiters (ATD). Abducens internuclear neurons are responsible for conjugate gaze in the horizontal plane, whereas ATD neurons provide medial rectus motoneurons with a vestibular input comprising mainly head velocity. To reveal the relative contribution of each input to the oculomotor physiology, single-unit recordings from medial rectus motoneurons were obtained in the control situation and after selective deafferentation from cats with unilateral transection of either the MLF or the ATD. Both MLF and ATD transection produced similar short-term alterations in medial rectus motoneuron firing pattern, which were more drastic in MLF of animals. However, long-term recordings revealed important differences between the two types of lesion. Thus, while the effects of the MLF section were permanent, 2 months after ATD lesioning all motoneuronal firing parameters were similar to the control. These findings indicated a more relevant role of the MLF pathway in driving motoneuronal firing and evidenced compensatory mechanisms following the ATD lesion. Confocal immunocytochemistry revealed that MLF transection produced also a higher loss of synaptic boutons, mainly at the dendritic level. Moreover, 2 months after ATD transection, we observed an increase in synaptic coverage around motoneuron cell bodies compared with short-term data, which is indicative of a synaptogenic compensatory mechanism of the abducens internuclear pathway that could lead to the observed firing and morphological recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Eye movements rely on multiple neuronal circuits for appropriate performance. The abducens internuclear pathway through the medial longitudinal fascicle (MLF) and the vestibular neurons through the ascending tract of Deiters (ATD) are a dual system that supports the firing of medial rectus motoneurons. We report the effect of sectioning the MLF or the ATD pathway on the firing of medial rectus motoneurons, as well as the plastic mechanisms by which one input compensates for the lack of the other. This work shows that while the effects of MLF transection are permanent, the ATD section produces transitory effects. A mechanism based on axonal sprouting and occupancy of the vacant synaptic space due to deafferentation is the base for the mechanism of compensation on the medial rectus motoneuron.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Effect of Threat on Right dlPFC Activity during Behavioral Pattern Separation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It has long been established that individuals with anxiety disorders tend to overgeneralize attributes of fearful stimuli to nonfearful stimuli, but there is little mechanistic understanding of the neural system that supports overgeneralization. To address this gap in our knowledge, this study examined effect of experimentally induced anxiety in humans on generalization using the behavioral pattern separation (BPS) paradigm. Healthy subjects of both sexes encoded and retrieved novel objects during periods of safety and threat of unpredictable shocks while we recorded brain activity with fMRI. During retrieval, subjects were instructed to differentiate among new, old, and altered images. We hypothesized that the hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) would play a key role in the effect of anxiety on BPS. The dlPFC, but not the hippocampus, showed increased activity for altered images compared with old images when retrieval occurred during periods of threat compared with safety. In addition, accuracy for altered items retrieved during threat was correlated with dlPFC activity. Together, these results suggest that overgeneralization in anxiety patients may be mediated by an inability to recruit the dlPFC, which mediates the cognitive control needed to overcome anxiety and differentiate between old and altered items during periods of threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder patients generalize fear to nonfearful fear stimuli, making it difficult to regulate anxiety. Understanding how anxiety affects generalization is key to understanding the overgeneralization experienced by these patients. We examined this relationship in healthy subjects by studying how threat of shock affects neural responses to previously encountered stimuli. Although previous studies point to hippocampal involvement, we found that threat affected activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), rather than the hippocampus, when subjects encountered slightly altered versions of the previously encountered items. Importantly, this dlPFC activity predicted performance for these items. Together, these results suggest that the dlPFC is important for discrimination during elevated anxiety and that overgeneralization may reflect a deficit in dlPFC-mediated cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Feedback Signal from Motoneurons Influences a Rhythmic Pattern Generator</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/38/9149?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Motoneurons are not mere output units of neuronal circuits that control motor behavior but participate in pattern generation. Research on the circuit that controls the crawling motor behavior in leeches indicated that motoneurons participate as modulators of this rhythmic motor pattern. Crawling results from successive bouts of elongation and contraction of the whole leech body. In the isolated segmental ganglia, dopamine can induce a rhythmic antiphasic activity of the motoneurons that control contraction (DE-3 motoneurons) and elongation (CV motoneurons). The study was performed in isolated ganglia where manipulation of the activity of specific motoneurons was performed in the course of fictive crawling (&lt;i&gt;crawling&lt;/i&gt;). In this study, the membrane potential of CV was manipulated while &lt;i&gt;crawling&lt;/i&gt; was monitored through the rhythmic activity of DE-3. Matching behavioral observations that show that elongation dominates the rhythmic pattern, the electrophysiological activity of CV motoneurons dominates the cycle. Brief excitation of CV motoneurons during &lt;i&gt;crawling&lt;/i&gt; episodes resets the rhythmic activity of DE-3, indicating that CV feeds back to the rhythmic pattern generator. CV hyperpolarization accelerated the rhythm to an extent that depended on the magnitude of the cycle period, suggesting that CV exerted a positive feedback on the unit(s) of the pattern generator that controls the elongation phase. A simple computational model was implemented to test the consequences of such feedback. The simulations indicate that the duty cycle of CV depended on the strength of the positive feedback between CV and the pattern generator circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Rhythmic movements of animals are controlled by neuronal networks that have been conceived as hierarchical structures. At the basis of this hierarchy, we find the motoneurons, few neurons at the top control global aspects of the behavior (e.g., onset, duration); and within these two ends, specific neuronal circuits control the actual rhythmic pattern of movements. We have investigated whether motoneurons are limited to function as output units. Analysis of the network that controls crawling behavior in the leech has clearly indicated that motoneurons, in addition to controlling muscle activity, send signals to the pattern generator. Physiological and modeling studies on the role of specific motoneurons suggest that these feedback signals modulate the phase relationship of the rhythmic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Role of Somatostatin-Positive Cortical Interneurons in the Generation of Sleep Slow Waves</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;During non-rapid eye-movement (NREM) sleep, cortical and thalamic neurons oscillate every second or so between ON periods, characterized by membrane depolarization and wake-like tonic firing, and OFF periods, characterized by membrane hyperpolarization and neuronal silence. Cortical slow waves, the hallmark of NREM sleep, reflect near-synchronous OFF periods in cortical neurons. However, the mechanisms triggering such OFF periods are unclear, as there is little evidence for somatic inhibition. We studied cortical inhibitory interneurons that express somatostatin (SOM), because ~70% of them are Martinotti cells that target diffusely layer I and can block excitatory transmission presynaptically, at glutamatergic terminals, and postsynaptically, at apical dendrites, without inhibiting the soma. In freely moving male mice, we show that SOM+ cells can fire immediately before slow waves and their optogenetic stimulation during ON periods of NREM sleep triggers long OFF periods. Next, we show that chemogenetic activation of SOM+ cells increases slow-wave activity (SWA), slope of individual slow waves, and NREM sleep duration; whereas their chemogenetic inhibition decreases SWA and slow-wave incidence without changing time spent in NREM sleep. By contrast, activation of parvalbumin+ (PV+) cells, the most numerous population of cortical inhibitory neurons, greatly decreases SWA and cortical firing, triggers short OFF periods in NREM sleep, and increases NREM sleep duration. Thus SOM+ cells, but not PV+ cells, are involved in the generation of sleep slow waves. Whether Martinotti cells are solely responsible for this effect, or are complemented by other classes of inhibitory neurons, remains to be investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cortical slow waves are a defining feature of non-rapid eye-movement (NREM) sleep and are thought to be important for many of its restorative benefits. Yet, the mechanism by which cortical neurons abruptly and synchronously cease firing, the neuronal basis of the slow wave, remains unknown. Using chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches, we provide the first evidence that links a specific class of inhibitory interneurons—somatostatin-positive cells—to the generation of slow waves during NREM sleep in freely moving mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: UPF1 Governs Synaptic Plasticity through Association with a STAU2 RNA Granule</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal mRNAs can be packaged in reversibly stalled polysome granules before their transport to distant synaptic locales. Stimulation of synaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) reactivates translation of these particular mRNAs to produce plasticity-related protein; a phenomenon exhibited during mGluR-mediated LTD. This form of plasticity is deregulated in Fragile X Syndrome, a monogenic form of autism in humans, and understanding the stalling and reactivation mechanism could reveal new approaches to therapies. Here, we demonstrate that UPF1, known to stall peptide release during nonsense-mediated RNA decay, is critical for assembly of stalled polysomes in rat hippocampal neurons derived from embryos of either sex. Moreover, UPF1 and its interaction with the RNA binding protein STAU2 are necessary for proper transport and local translation from a prototypical RNA granule substrate and for mGluR-LTD in hippocampal neurons. These data highlight a new, neuronal role for UPF1, distinct from its RNA decay functions, in regulating transport and/or translation of mRNAs that are critical for synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The elongation and/or termination steps of mRNA translation are emerging as important control points in mGluR-LTD, a form of synaptic plasticity that is compromised in a severe monogenic form of autism, Fragile X Syndrome. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms controlling this type of plasticity may thus open new therapeutic opportunities. Here, we describe a new role for the ATP-dependent helicase UPF1 and its interaction with the RNA localization protein STAU2 in mediating mGluR-LTD through the regulation of mRNA translation complexes stalled at the level of elongation and/or termination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Multi-modal analysis of genetically-related subjects using SIFT descriptors in brain MRI. (arXiv:1709.06151v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06151</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06151</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;So far, fingerprinting studies have focused on identifying features from
single-modality MRI data, which capture individual characteristics in terms of
brain structure, function, or white matter microstructure. However, due to the
lack of a framework for comparing across multiple modalities, studies based on
multi-modal data remain elusive. This paper presents a multi-modal analysis of
genetically-related subjects to compare and contrast the information provided
by various MRI modalities. The proposed framework represents MRI scans as bags
of SIFT features, and uses these features in a nearest-neighbor graph to
measure subject similarity. Experiments using the T1/T2-weighted MRI and
diffusion MRI data of 861 Human Connectome Project subjects demonstrate strong
links between the proposed similarity measure and genetic proximity.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The extraction of fibers from dMRI data typically produces a large number of
fibers, it is common to group fibers into bundles. To this end, many
specialized distance measures, such as MCP, have been used for fiber
similarity. However, these distance based approaches require point-wise
correspondence and focus only on the geometry of the fibers. Recent
publications have highlighted that using microstructure measures along fibers
improves tractography analysis. Also, many neurodegenerative diseases impacting
white matter require the study of microstructure measures as well as the white
matter geometry. Motivated by these, we propose to use a novel computational
model for fibers, called functional varifolds, characterized by a metric that
considers both the geometry and microstructure measure (e.g. GFA) along the
fiber pathway. We use it to cluster fibers with a dictionary learning and
sparse coding-based framework, and present a preliminary analysis using HCP
data.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper explores the discrete Dynamic Causal Modeling (DDCM) and its
relationship with Directed Information (DI). We prove the conditional
equivalence between DDCM and DI in characterizing the causal relationship
between two brain regions. The theoretical results are demonstrated using fMRI
data obtained under both resting state and stimulus based state. Our numerical
analysis is consistent with that reported in previous study.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Evaluation of the training objectives with surface electromyography. (arXiv:1404.4336v4 [physics.data-an] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4336</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4336</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this work the multifractal analysis of the kinesiological surface
electromyographic signal is proposed. The goal was to investigate the level of
neuromuscular activation during complex movements on the laparoscopic trainer.
The basic issue of this work concerns the changes observed in the signal
obtained from the complete beginner in the field of using laparoscopic tools
and the same person subjected to the series of training. To quantify the
complexity of the kinesiological sEMG, the nonlinear analysis technique, namely
the MultiFractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis was adopted. The analysis was
based on the parameters describing the multifractal spectrum -- Hurst exponent
and the spectrum width. The statistically significant differences for a
selected group of muscles at the different states (before and after training)
are presented. Additionally, as the base case, the relaxation state was
considered and compared with the working states.

Recent studies have shown that the summed activity of all neurons strongly shapes the population response. A separate recent finding has been that neural populations also exhibit criticality, an anomalously large dynamic range for the probabilities of different population activity patterns. Motivated by these two observations, we introduce a class of probabilistic models which takes into account the prior knowledge that the neural population could be globally coupled and close to critical. These models consist of an energy function which parametrizes interactions between small groups of neurons, and an arbitrary positive, strictly increasing, and twice differentiable function which maps the energy of a population pattern to its probability. We show that: 1) augmenting a pairwise Ising model with a nonlinearity yields an accurate description of the activity of retinal ganglion cells which outperforms previous models based on the summed activity of neurons; 2) prior knowledge that the population is critical translates to prior expectations about the shape of the nonlinearity; 3) the nonlinearity admits an interpretation in terms of a continuous latent variable globally coupling the system whose distribution we can infer from data. Our method is independent of the underlying system’s state space; hence, it can be applied to other systems such as natural scenes or amino acid sequences of proteins which are also known to exhibit criticality.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oFjGr9t7pTE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Developing useful interfaces between brains and machines is a grand challenge
of neuroengineering. An effective interface has the capacity to not only
interpret neural signals, but predict the intentions of the human to perform an
action in the near future; prediction is made even more challenging outside
well-controlled laboratory experiments. This paper describes our approach to
detect and to predict natural human arm movements in the future, a key
challenge in brain computer interfacing that has never before been attempted.
We introduce the novel Annotated Joints in Long-term ECoG (AJILE) dataset;
AJILE includes automatically annotated poses of 7 upper body joints for four
human subjects over 670 total hours (more than 72 million frames), along with
the corresponding simultaneously acquired intracranial neural recordings. The
size and scope of AJILE greatly exceeds all previous datasets with movements
and electrocorticography (ECoG), making it possible to take a deep learning
approach to movement prediction. We propose a multimodal model that combines
deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM)
blocks, leveraging both ECoG and video modalities. We demonstrate that our
models are able to detect movements and predict future movements up to 800 msec
before movement initiation. Further, our multimodal movement prediction models
exhibit resilience to simulated ablation of input neural signals. We believe a
multimodal approach to natural neural decoding that takes context into account
is critical in advancing bioelectronic technologies and human neuroscience.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since the enormous breakthroughs in machine learning over the last decade,
functional neural network models are of growing interest for many researchers
in the field of computational neuroscience. One major branch of research is
concerned with biologically plausible implementations of reinforcement
learning, with a variety of different models developed over the recent years.
However, most studies in this area are conducted with custom simulation scripts
and manually implemented tasks. This makes it hard for other researchers to
reproduce and build upon previous work and nearly impossible to compare the
performance of different learning architectures. In this work, we present a
novel approach to solve this problem, connecting benchmark tools from the field
of machine learning and state-of-the-art neural network simulators from
computational neuroscience. This toolchain enables researchers in both fields
to make use of well-tested high-performance simulation software supporting
biologically plausible neuron, synapse and network models and allows them to
evaluate and compare their approach on the basis of standardized environments
of varying complexity. We demonstrate the functionality of the toolchain by
implementing a neuronal actor-critic architecture for reinforcement learning in
the NEST simulator and successfully training it on two different environments
from the OpenAI Gym.

&lt;p&gt;Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) represses the transcription of many target genes, including genes that encode chromatin-associated proteins. Loss of FMRP leads to fragile X syndrome (FXS); however, whether misregulation of chromatin-associated proteins contributes to FXS is unclear. Korb et al. showed that &lt;/p&gt;

Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations in the blood are associated with acute and chronic infections and inflammation. Nevertheless, the functional role of increased CRP in multiple bacterial and viral infections as well as in chronic inflammatory diseases remains unclear. Here, we studied the relationship between CRP and gene expression levels in the blood in 491 individuals from the Estonian Biobank cohort, to elucidate the role of CRP in these inflammatory mechanisms. As a result, we identified a set of 1,614 genes associated with changes in CRP levels with a high proportion of interferon-stimulated genes. Further, we performed likelihood-based causality model selection and Mendelian randomization analysis to discover causal links between CRP and the expression of CRP-associated genes. Strikingly, our computational analysis and cell culture stimulation assays revealed increased CRP levels to drive the expression of complement regulatory protein &lt;i&gt;CD59&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting CRP to have a critical role in protecting blood cells from the adverse effects of the immune defence system. Our results show the benefit of integrative analysis approaches in hypothesis-free uncovering of causal relationships between traits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GGnikhoj_Ok&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Dynamical processes in biology are studied using an ever-increasing number of techniques, each of which brings out unique features of the system. One of the current challenges is to develop systematic approaches for fusing heterogeneous datasets into an integrated view of multivariable dynamics. We demonstrate that heterogeneous data fusion can be successfully implemented within a semi-supervised learning framework that exploits the intrinsic geometry of high-dimensional datasets. We illustrate our approach using a dataset from studies of pattern formation in Drosophila. The result is a continuous trajectory that reveals the joint dynamics of gene expression, subcellular protein localization, protein phosphorylation, and tissue morphogenesis. Our approach can be readily adapted to other imaging modalities and forms a starting point for further steps of data analytics and modeling of biological dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hVbjiutPHkE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Translation of mRNAs through Internal Ribosome Entry Sites (IRESs) has emerged as a prominent mechanism of cellular and viral initiation. It supports cap-independent translation of select cellular genes under normal conditions, and in conditions when cap-dependent translation is inhibited. IRES structure and sequence are believed to be involved in this process. However due to the small number of IRESs known, there have been no systematic investigations of the determinants of IRES activity. With the recent discovery of thousands of novel IRESs in human and viruses, the next challenge is to decipher the sequence determinants of IRES activity. We present the first in-depth computational analysis of a large body of IRESs, exploring RNA sequence features predictive of IRES activity. We identified predictive &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mer features resembling IRES &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-acting factor (ITAF) binding motifs across human and viral IRESs, and found that their effect on expression depends on their sequence, number and position. Our results also suggest that the architecture of retroviral IRESs differs from that of other viruses, presumably due to their exposure to the nuclear environment. Finally, we measured IRES activity of synthetically designed sequences to confirm our prediction of increasing activity as a function of the number of short IRES elements.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FpSjb2fNv-w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Gag, as the major structural protein of HIV-1, is necessary for the assembly of the HIV-1 sphere shell. An in-depth understanding of its trafficking and polymerization is important for gaining further insights into the mechanisms of HIV-1 replication and the design of antiviral drugs. We developed a mathematical model to simulate two biophysical processes, specifically Gag monomer and dimer transport in the cytoplasm and the polymerization of monomers to form a hexamer underneath the plasma membrane. Using experimental data, an optimization approach was utilized to identify the model parameters, and the identifiability and sensitivity of these parameters were then analyzed. Using our model, we analyzed the weight of the pathways involved in the polymerization reactions and concluded that the predominant pathways for the formation of a hexamer might be the polymerization of two monomers to form a dimer, the polymerization of a dimer and a monomer to form a trimer, and the polymerization of two trimers to form a hexamer. We then deduced that the dimer and trimer intermediates might be crucial in hexamer formation. We also explored four theoretical combined methods for Gag suppression, and hypothesized that the N-terminal glycine residue of the MA domain of Gag might be a promising drug target.

The bacterial Lux system is used as a gene expression reporter. It is fast, sensitive and non-destructive, enabling high frequency measurements. Originally developed for bacterial cells, it has also been adapted for eukaryotic cells, and can be used for whole cell biosensors, or in real time with live animals without the need for euthanasia. However, correct interpretation of bioluminescent data is limited: the bioluminescence is different from gene expression because of nonlinear molecular and enzyme dynamics of the Lux system. We have developed a computational approach that, for the first time, allows users of Lux assays to infer gene transcription levels from the light output. This approach is based upon a new mathematical model for Lux activity, that includes the actions of LuxAB, LuxEC and Fre, with improved mechanisms for all reactions, as well as synthesis and turn-over of Lux proteins. The model is calibrated with new experimental data for the LuxAB and Fre reactions from &lt;i&gt;Photorhabdus luminescens&lt;/i&gt;—the source of modern Lux reporters—while literature data has been used for LuxEC. Importantly, the data show clear evidence for previously unreported product inhibition for the LuxAB reaction. Model simulations show that predicted bioluminescent profiles can be very different from changes in gene expression, with transient peaks of light output, very similar to light output seen in some experimental data sets. By incorporating the calibrated model into a Bayesian inference scheme, we can reverse engineer promoter activity from the bioluminescence. We show examples where a decrease in bioluminescence would be better interpreted as a switching off of the promoter, or where an increase in bioluminescence would be better interpreted as a longer period of gene expression. This approach could benefit all users of Lux technology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OD83Pe1_mRg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cell mechanics has proven to be important in many biological processes. Although there is a number of experimental techniques which allow us to study mechanical properties of cell, there is still a lack of understanding of the role each sub-cellular components plays during cell deformations. We present a new mesoscopic particle-based eukaryotic cell model which explicitly describes cell membrane, nucleus and cytoskeleton. We employ Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) method that provides us with the unified framework for modeling of a cell and its interactions in the flow. Data from micropipette aspiration experiments were used to define model parameters. The model was validated using data from microfluidic experiments. The validated model was then applied to study the impact of the sub-cellular components on the cell viscoelastic response in micropipette aspiration and microfluidic experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iuIJrlcAA6o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Quantifying the effects of antiangiogenic and chemotherapy drug combinations on drug delivery and treatment efficacy</title>

Tumor-induced angiogenesis leads to the development of leaky tumor vessels devoid of structural and morphological integrity. Due to angiogenesis, elevated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) and low blood perfusion emerge as common properties of the tumor microenvironment that act as barriers for drug delivery. In order to overcome these barriers, normalization of vasculature is considered to be a viable option. However, insight is needed into the phenomenon of normalization and in which conditions it can realize its promise. In order to explore the effect of microenvironmental conditions and drug scheduling on normalization benefit, we build a mathematical model that incorporates tumor growth, angiogenesis and IFP. We administer various theoretical combinations of antiangiogenic agents and cytotoxic nanoparticles through heterogeneous vasculature that displays a similar morphology to tumor vasculature. We observe differences in drug extravasation that depend on the scheduling of combined therapy; for concurrent therapy, total drug extravasation is increased but in adjuvant therapy, drugs can penetrate into deeper regions of tumor.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5DhiN_Ok8Xk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Inhibiting persistent inward sodium currents prevents myotonia</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25017-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with myotonia congenita have muscle hyperexcitability due to loss-of-function mutations in the ClC-1 chloride channel in skeletal muscle, which causes involuntary firing of muscle action potentials (myotonia), producing muscle stiffness. The excitatory events that trigger myotonic action potentials in the absence of stabilizing ClC-1 current are not fully understood. Our goal was to identify currents that trigger spontaneous firing of muscle in the setting of reduced ClC-1 current.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25017-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; intracellular current clamp and voltage clamp recordings were performed in muscle from a mouse model of myotonia congenita.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25017-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intracellular recordings revealed a slow afterdepolarization (AfD) that triggers myotonic action potentials. The AfD is well explained by a tetrodotoxin-sensitive and voltage-dependent Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; persistent inward current (NaPIC). Notably, this NaPIC undergoes slow inactivation over seconds, suggesting this may contribute to the end of myotonic runs. Highlighting the significance of this mechanism, we found that ranolazine and elevated serum divalent cations eliminate myotonia by inhibiting AfD and NaPIC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25017-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work significantly changes our understanding of the mechanisms triggering myotonia. Our work suggests that the current focus of treating myotonia, blocking the transient Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current underlying action potentials, is an inefficient approach. We show that inhibiting NaPIC is paralleled by elimination of myotonia. We suggest the ideal myotonia therapy would selectively block NaPIC and spare the transient Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Network Controllability in the IFG Relates to Controlled Language Variability and Susceptibility to TMS. (arXiv:1709.05022v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In language production, humans are confronted with considerable word
selection demands. Often, we must select a word from among similar, acceptable,
and competing alternative words in order to construct a sentence that conveys
an intended meaning. In recent years, the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) has
been identified as critical to this ability. Despite a recent emphasis on
network approaches to understanding language, how the left IFG interacts with
the brain's complex networks to facilitate controlled language performance
remains unknown. Here, we take a novel approach to understand word selection as
a network control process in the brain. Using anatomical brain network derived
from high-resolution diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), we compute network
controllability underlying the site of transcranial magnetic stimulation in the
IFG between administrations of two word selection tasks. We find that a
statistic that quantifies the IFG's control of difficult to reach states
explains vulnerability to TMS in a number control task and two language control
tasks. Moreover, we find that a statistic that quantifies the IFG's control of
intermodular integration and segregation across the human connectome explains
changes in language task performance following TMS.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Comparing Advanced Graph-Theoretical Parameters of the Connectomes of the Lobes of the Human Brain. (arXiv:1709.04974v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04974</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04974</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep, classical graph-theoretical parameters, like the size of the minimum
vertex cover, the chromatic number, or the eigengap of the adjacency matrix of
the graph were studied widely by mathematicians in the last century. Most
researchers today study much simpler parameters of braingraphs or connectomes
which were defined in the last twenty years for enormous networks -- like the
graph of the World Wide Web -- with hundreds of millions of nodes. Since the
connectomes, describing the connections of the human brain, typically contain
several hundred vertices today, one can compute and analyze the much deeper,
harder-to-compute classical graph parameters for these, relatively small graphs
of the brain. This deeper approach has proven to be very successful in the
comparison of the connectomes of the sexes in our earlier works: we have shown
that graph parameters, deeply characterizing the graph connectivity are
significantly better in women's connectomes than in men's. In the present
contribution we compare numerous graph parameters in the three largest lobes
--- frontal, parietal, temporal --- and in both hemispheres of the brain. We
apply the diffusion weighted imaging data of 423 subjects of the NIH-funded
Human Connectome Project, and present some findings, never described before,
including that the right parietal lobe contains significantly more edges, has
higher average degree, density, larger minimum vertex cover and Hoffman bound
than the left parietal lobe. Similar advantages in the deep graph connectivity
properties are hold for the left frontal vs. the right frontal and for the
right temporal vs. the left temporal lobes.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dendritic spines provide cognitive resilience against Alzheimer's disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25049</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Neuroimaging and other biomarker assays suggest that the pathological processes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) initiate years prior to clinical dementia onset. However some 30%-50% of older individuals that harbor AD pathology do not become symptomatic in their lifetime. It is hypothesized that such individuals exhibit cognitive resilience that protects against AD dementia. We hypothesized that in cases with AD pathology structural changes in dendritic spines would distinguish individuals that had or did not have clinical dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We compared dendritic spines within layers II and III pyramidal neuron dendrites in Brodmann Area 46 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using the Golgi-Cox technique in 12 age-matched pathology-free controls, 8 controls with AD pathology (CAD), and 21 AD cases. We used highly optimized methods to trace impregnated dendrites from brightfield microscopy images which enabled accurate three-dimensional digital reconstruction of dendritic structure for morphologic analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Spine density was similar among control and CAD cases but reduced significantly in AD. Thin and mushroom spines were reduced significantly in AD compared to CAD brains, whereas stubby spine density was decreased significantly in CAD and AD compared to controls. Increased spine extent distinguished CAD cases from controls and AD. Linear regression analysis of all cases indicated that spine density was not associated with neuritic plaque score but did display negative correlation with Braak staging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: These observations provide cellular evidence to support the hypothesis that dendritic spine plasticity is a mechanism of cognitive resilience that protects older individuals with AD pathology from developing dementia.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling antibiotic treatment in hospitals: A systematic approach shows benefits of combination therapy over cycling, mixing, and mono-drug therapies</title>

Multiple treatment strategies are available for empiric antibiotic therapy in hospitals, but neither clinical studies nor theoretical investigations have yielded a clear picture when which strategy is optimal and why. Extending earlier work of others and us, we present a mathematical model capturing treatment strategies using two drugs, i.e the multi-drug therapies referred to as cycling, mixing, and combination therapy, as well as monotherapy with either drug. We randomly sample a large parameter space to determine the conditions determining success or failure of these strategies. We find that combination therapy tends to outperform the other treatment strategies. By using linear discriminant analysis and particle swarm optimization, we find that the most important parameters determining success or failure of combination therapy relative to the other treatment strategies are the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; rate of emergence of double resistance in patients infected with sensitive bacteria and the fitness costs associated with double resistance. The rate at which double resistance is imported into the hospital via patients admitted from the outside community has little influence, as all treatment strategies are affected equally. The parameter sets for which combination therapy fails tend to fall into areas with low biological plausibility as they are characterised by very high rates of &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; emergence of resistance to both drugs compared to a single drug, and the cost of double resistance is considerably smaller than the sum of the costs of single resistance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BpDkFaeaRVs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Deep Predictive Learning: A Comprehensive Model of Three Visual Streams. (arXiv:1709.04654v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04654</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;How does the neocortex learn and develop the foundations of all our
high-level cognitive abilities? We present a comprehensive framework spanning
biological, computational, and cognitive levels, with a clear theoretical
continuity between levels, providing a coherent answer directly supported by
extensive data at each level. Learning is based on making predictions about
what the senses will report at 100 msec (alpha frequency) intervals, and
adapting synaptic weights to improve prediction accuracy. The pulvinar nucleus
of the thalamus serves as a projection screen upon which predictions are
generated, through deep-layer 6 corticothalamic inputs from multiple brain
areas and levels of abstraction. The sparse driving inputs from layer 5
intrinsic bursting neurons provide the target signal, and the temporal
difference between it and the prediction reverberates throughout the cortex,
driving synaptic changes that approximate error backpropagation, using only
local activation signals in equations derived directly from a detailed
biophysical model. In vision, predictive learning requires a
carefully-organized developmental progression and anatomical organization of
three pathways (What, Where, and What * Where), according to two central
principles: top-down input from compact, high-level, abstract representations
is essential for accurate prediction of low-level sensory inputs; and the
collective, low-level prediction error must be progressively and
opportunistically partitioned to enable extraction of separable factors that
drive the learning of further high-level abstractions. Our model self-organized
systematic invariant object representations of 100 different objects from
simple movies, accounts for a wide range of data, and makes many testable
predictions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Computational Model of Afterimages based on Simultaneous and Successive Contrasts. (arXiv:1709.04550v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04550</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04550</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Negative afterimage appears in our vision when we shift our gaze from an over
stimulated original image to a new area with a uniform color. The colors of
negative afterimages differ from the old stimulating colors in the original
image when the color in the new area is either neutral or chromatic. The
interaction between stimulating colors in the test and inducing field in the
original image changes our color perception due to simultaneous contrast, and
the interaction between changed colors perceived in the previously-viewed field
and the color in the currently-viewed field also affects our perception of
colors in negative afterimages due to successive contrast. Based on these
observations we propose a computational model to estimate colors of negative
afterimages in more general cases where the original stimulating color in the
test field is chromatic, and the original stimulating color in the inducing
field and the new stimulating color can be either neutral or chromatic. We
validate our model with human experiments.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Stochastic principles governing alternative splicing of RNA</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005761</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jianfei Hu, Eli Boritz, William Wylie, Daniel C. Douek&lt;/p&gt;

The dominance of the major transcript isoform relative to other isoforms from the same gene generated by alternative splicing (AS) is essential to the maintenance of normal cellular physiology. However, the underlying principles that determine such dominance remain unknown. Here, we analyzed the physical AS process and found that it can be modeled by a stochastic minimization process, which causes the scaled expression levels of all transcript isoforms to follow the same Weibull extreme value distribution. Surprisingly, we also found a simple equation to describe the median frequency of transcript isoforms of different dominance. This two-parameter Weibull model provides the statistical distribution of all isoforms of all transcribed genes, and reveals that previously unexplained observations concerning relative isoform expression derive from these principles.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vx5zFApiVZY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Is Smaller Better: A Proposal To Consider Bacteria For Biologically Inspired Modeling. (arXiv:1709.04300v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04300</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04300</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Bacteria are easily characterizable model organisms with an impressively
complicated set of capabilities. Among their capabilities is quorum sensing, a
detailed cell-cell signaling system that may have a common origin with
eukaryotic cell-cell signaling. Not only are the two phenomena similar, but
quorum sensing, as is the case with any bacterial phenomenon when compared to
eukaryotes, is also easier to study in depth than eukaryotic cell-cell
signaling. This ease of study is a contrast to the only partially understood
cellular dynamics of neurons. Here we review the literature on the strikingly
neuron-like qualities of bacterial colonies and biofilms, including ion-based
and hormonal signaling, and action potential-like behavior. This allows them to
feasibly act as an analog for neurons that could produce more detailed and more
accurate biologically-based computational models. Using bacteria as the basis
for biologically feasible computational models may allow models to better
harness the tremendous ability of biological organisms to make decisions and
process information. Additionally, principles gleaned from bacterial function
have the potential to influence computational efforts divorced from biology,
just as neuronal function has in the abstract influenced countless machine
learning efforts.

	<description>Glutamate receptors that normally participate in rapid synaptic signaling can also create ultra-slow signals. Lu et al. show that slow signals require TARP accessory subunits to glutamate receptors as well as tight control of glutamate time course mediated by transporters.</description>

	<description>Stress is a major trigger of seizures in people with epilepsy. Exposure to stress results in the release of several stress mediators throughout the brain, including the hippocampus, a region sensitive to stress and prone to seizures. Stress mediators interact with their respective receptors to produce distinct effects on the excitability of hippocampal neurons and networks. Crucially, these stress mediators and their actions exhibit unique spatiotemporal profiles, generating a complex combinatorial output with time- and space-dependent effects on hippocampal network excitability and seizure generation.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Cell-specific gain modulation by synaptically released zinc in cortical circuits of audition</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/29893</link>
	<description>In many excitatory synapses, mobile zinc is found within glutamatergic vesicles and is coreleased with glutamate. &lt;i&gt;Ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies established that synaptically released (synaptic) zinc inhibits excitatory neurotransmission at lower frequencies of synaptic activity but enhances steady state synaptic responses during higher frequencies of activity. However, it remains unknown how synaptic zinc affects neuronal processing &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we imaged the sound-evoked neuronal activity of the primary auditory cortex in awake mice. We discovered that synaptic zinc enhanced the gain of sound-evoked responses in CaMKII-expressing principal neurons, but it reduced the gain of parvalbumin- and somatostatin-expressing interneurons. This modulation was sound intensity-dependent and, in part, NMDA receptor-independent. By establishing a previously unknown link between synaptic zinc and gain control of auditory cortical processing, our findings advance understanding about cortical synaptic mechanisms and create a new framework for approaching and interpreting the role of the auditory cortex in sound processing.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Epidemiological and ecological determinants of Zika virus transmission in an urban setting</title>

	<description>The Zika virus has emerged as a global public health concern. Its rapid geographic expansion is attributed to the success of &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; mosquito vectors, but local epidemiological drivers are still poorly understood. Feira de Santana played a pivotal role in the Chikungunya epidemic in Brazil and was one of the first urban centres to report Zika infections. Using a climate-driven transmission model and notified Zika case data, we show that a low observation rate and high vectorial capacity translated into a significant attack rate during the 2015 outbreak, with a subsequent decline in 2016 and fade-out in 2017 due to herd-immunity. We find a potential Zika-related, low risk for microcephaly per pregnancy, but with significant public health impact given high attack rates. The balance between the loss of herd-immunity and viral re-importation will dictate future transmission potential of in this urban setting.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Simultaneous activation of parallel sensory pathways promotes a grooming sequence in Drosophila</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28804</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/28804</link>
	<description>A central model that describes how behavioral sequences are produced features a neural architecture that readies different movements simultaneously, and a mechanism where prioritized suppression between the movements determines their sequential performance. We previously described a model whereby suppression drives a &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; grooming sequence that is induced by simultaneous activation of different sensory pathways that each elicit a distinct movement (Seeds et al. 2014). Here, we confirm this model using transgenic expression to identify and optogenetically activate sensory neurons that elicit specific grooming movements. Simultaneous activation of different sensory pathways elicits a grooming sequence that resembles the naturally induced sequence. Moreover, the sequence proceeds after the sensory excitation is terminated, indicating that a persistent trace of this excitation induces the next grooming movement once the previous one is performed. This reveals a mechanism whereby parallel sensory inputs can be integrated and stored to elicit a delayed and sequential grooming response.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: The Brain Is Needed to Cure Spinal Cord Injury</title>

	<description>Damage to corticospinal fibers in the cervical spinal cord is known to impair dexterous hand movements. However, accumulating evidence has shown that precision grip can recover considerably through rehabilitative training. Recent multidisciplinary studies have revealed that, at the spinal level, this recovery is possible due to an indirect neural pathway through propriospinal neurons (PNs), which relay cortical commands to hand motoneurons. Although this indirect spinal pathway is heavily involved in recovery, its role is dwarfed by a simultaneous large-scale network reorganization spanning motor-related cortices and mesolimbic structures.</description>

	<description>Addressing how neural circuits underlie behavior is routinely done by measuring electrical activity from single neurons in experimental sessions. While such recordings yield snapshots of neural dynamics during specified tasks, they are ill-suited for tracking single-unit activity over longer timescales relevant for most developmental and learning processes, or for capturing neural dynamics across different behavioral states. Here we describe an automated platform for continuous long-term recordings of neural activity and behavior in freely moving rodents. An unsupervised algorithm identifies and tracks the activity of single units over weeks of recording, dramatically simplifying the analysis of large datasets. Months-long recordings from motor cortex and striatum made and analyzed with our system revealed remarkable stability in basic neuronal properties, such as firing rates and inter-spike interval distributions. Interneuronal correlations and the representation of different movements and behaviors were similarly stable. This establishes the feasibility of high-throughput long-term extracellular recordings in behaving animals.</description>

	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27402</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/27402</link>
	<description>We have identified the plant biflavonoid hinokiflavone as an inhibitor of splicing &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and modulator of alternative splicing in cells. Chemical synthesis confirms hinokiflavone is the active molecule. Hinokiflavone inhibits splicing&lt;i&gt; in vitro&lt;/i&gt; by blocking spliceosome assembly, leading to accumulation of the A complex. Cells treated with hinokiflavone show altered subnuclear organization specifically of splicing factors required for A complex formation, which relocalize together with SUMO1 and SUMO2 into enlarged nuclear speckles. Hinokiflavone increases protein SUMOylation levels, both in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; splicing reactions and in cells. Hinokiflavone also inhibited a purified, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; expressed SUMO protease, SENP1, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, indicating the increase in SUMOylated proteins results primarily from inhibition of de-SUMOylation. Using a quantitative proteomics assay we identified many SUMO2 sites whose levels increased in cells following hinokiflavone treatment, with the major targets including 6 proteins that are components of the U2 snRNP and required for A complex formation.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Kinesin superfamily protein Kif26b links Wnt5a-Ror signaling to the control of cell and tissue behaviors in vertebrates</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26509</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/26509</link>
	<description>Wnt5a-Ror signaling constitutes a developmental pathway crucial for embryonic tissue morphogenesis, reproduction and adult tissue regeneration, yet the molecular mechanisms by which the Wnt5a-Ror pathway mediates these processes are largely unknown. Using a proteomic screen, we identify the kinesin superfamily protein Kif26b as a downstream target of the Wnt5a-Ror pathway. Wnt5a-Ror, through a process independent of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin-dependent pathway, regulates the cellular stability of Kif26b by inducing its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Through this mechanism, Kif26b modulates the migratory behavior of cultured mesenchymal cells in a Wnt5a-dependent manner. Genetic perturbation of Kif26b function in vivo caused embryonic axis malformations and depletion of primordial germ cells in the developing gonad, two phenotypes characteristic of disrupted Wnt5a-Ror signaling. These findings indicate that Kif26b links Wnt5a-Ror signaling to the control of morphogenetic cell and tissue behaviors in vertebrates and reveal a new role for regulated proteolysis in noncanonical Wnt5a-Ror signal transduction.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/26014</link>
	<description>Phenomics, which ideally involves in-depth phenotyping at the whole-organism scale, may enhance our functional understanding of genetic variation. Here, we demonstrate methods to profile hundreds of phenotypic measures comprised of morphological and densitometric traits at a large number of sites within the axial skeleton of adult zebrafish. We show the potential for vertebral patterns to confer heightened sensitivity, with similar specificity, in discriminating mutant populations compared to analyzing individual vertebrae in isolation. We identify phenotypes associated with human brittle bone disease and thyroid stimulating hormone receptor hyperactivity. Finally, we develop allometric models and show their potential to aid in the discrimination of mutant phenotypes masked by alterations in growth. Our studies demonstrate virtues of deep phenotyping in a spatially distributed organ system. Analyzing phenotypic patterns may increase productivity in genetic screens, and facilitate the study of genetic variants associated with smaller effect sizes, such as those that underlie complex diseases.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Sonic Hedgehog switches on Wnt/planar cell polarity signaling in commissural axon growth cones by reducing levels of Shisa2</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25269</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/25269</link>
	<description>Commissural axons switch on responsiveness to Wnt attraction during midline crossing to turn anteriorly after exiting the floor plate. We report here Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) downregulates Shisa2, which inhibits glycosylation and cell surface presentation of Frizzled3 in rodent commissural axon growth cones. Constitutive Shisa2 expression causes randomized turning of post-crossing commissural axons along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis. Loss of Shisa2 lead to precocious anterior turning of commissural axons before or during midline crossing. Post-crossing commissural axon turning is completely randomized along the A-P axis when &lt;i&gt;Wntless&lt;/i&gt;, essential for Wnt secretion, is conditionally knocked out in the floor plate. The regulatory link between Shh and PCP signaling may also occur in other developmental processes.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Inhibition of DYRK1A disrupts neural lineage specification in human pluripotent stem cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24502</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/24502</link>
	<description>Genetic analysis has revealed that the dual specificity protein kinase DYRK1A has multiple roles in the development of the central nervous system. Increased &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; gene dosage, such as occurs in Down syndrome, affects neural progenitor cell differentiation, while haploinsufficiency of &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; is associated with severe microcephaly. Using a set of known and newly synthesized DYRK1A inhibitors, along with CRISPR-mediated gene activation and shRNA knockdown of &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt;, we show that chemical inhibition or genetic knockdown of &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; interferes with neural specification of human pluripotent stem cells, a process equating to the earliest stage of human brain development. DYRK1A inhibition insulates the self-renewing subpopulation of human pluripotent stem cells from powerful signals that drive neural induction. Our results suggest a novel mechanism for the disruptive effects of loss of &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; during early mammalian development, and reveal a requirement for &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; in the acquisition of competence for differentiation in human pluripotent stem cells.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Standardized mean differences cause funnel plot distortion in publication bias assessments</title>

	<description>Meta-analyses are increasingly used for synthesis of evidence, and often include an assessment of publication bias based on detection of asymmetry in funnel plots. We studied the influence of different normalisation approaches, sample size and intervention effects on funnel plot asymmetry, using empirical datasets and illustrative simulations. We found that funnel plots of the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) plotted against the standard error (SE) are susceptible to distortion, leading to overestimation of the existence and extent of publication bias. Distortion was more severe when the primary studies had a small sample size and when an intervention effect was present. We show that using the Normalised Mean Difference (when possible), or plotting the SMD against a sample size-based precision estimate, are more reliable alternatives. We conclude that funnel plots using the SMD in combination with the SE are unsuitable for publication bias assessments and can lead to false-positive results.</description>

	<description>Tool use has allowed humans to become one of the most successful species. However, tool-assisted foraging has also pushed many of our prey species to extinction or endangerment, a technology-driven process thought to be uniquely human. Here, we demonstrate that tool-assisted foraging on shellfish by long-tailed macaques (&lt;i&gt;Macaca fascicularis&lt;/i&gt;) in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, Thailand, reduces prey size and prey abundance, with more pronounced effects where the macaque population size is larger. We compared availability, sizes and maturation stages of shellfish between two adjacent islands inhabited by different-sized macaque populations and demonstrate potential effects on the prey reproductive biology. We provide evidence that once technological macaques reach a large enough group size, they enter a feedback loop – driving shellfish prey size down with attendant changes in the tool sizes used by the monkeys. If this pattern continues, prey populations could be reduced to a point where tool-assisted foraging is no longer beneficial to the macaques, which in return may lessen or extinguish the remarkable foraging technology employed by these primates.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/30286</link>
	<description>Neurotransmitter release depends on the SNARE complex formed by syntaxin-1, synaptobrevin and SNAP-25, as well as on complexins, which bind to the SNARE complex and play active and inhibitory roles. A crystal structure of a Complexin-I fragment bearing a so-called 'superclamp' mutation bound to a truncated SNARE complex lacking the C-terminus of the synaptobrevin SNARE motif (SNAREΔ60) suggested that an 'accessory' α-helix of Complexin-I inhibits release by inserting into the C-terminus of the SNARE complex. Previously, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments performed in different laboratories yielded apparently discrepant results in support or against the existence of such binding mode in solution (Trimbuch et al., 2014; Krishnakumar et al., 2015). Here, ITC experiments performed to solve these discrepancies now show that the region containing the Complexin-I accessory helix and preceding N-terminal sequences does interact with SNAREΔ60, but the interaction requires the polybasic juxtamembrane region of syntaxin-1 and is not affected by the superclamp mutation within the experimental error of these experiments.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/29241</link>
	<description>Myelination is a biosynthetically demanding process in which mTORC1, the gatekeeper of anabolism, occupies a privileged regulatory position. We have shown previously that loss of mTORC1 function in Schwann cells (SCs) hampers myelination. Here, we genetically disrupted key inhibitory components upstream of mTORC1, TSC1 or PTEN, in mouse SC development, adult homeostasis, and nerve injury. Surprisingly, the resulting mTORC1 hyperactivity led to markedly delayed onset of both developmental myelination and remyelination after injury. However, if mTORC1 was hyperactivated after myelination onset, radial hypermyelination was observed. At early developmental stages, physiologically high PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 signaling suppresses expression of Krox20 (Egr2), the master regulator of PNS myelination. This effect is mediated by S6K and contributes to control mechanisms that keep SCs in a not-fully differentiated state to ensure proper timing of myelination initiation. An ensuing decline in mTORC1 activity is crucial to allow myelination to start, while remaining mTORC1 activity drives myelin growth.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/29218</link>
	<description>Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR), found in strictly anaerobic methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea, catalyzes the reversible production and consumption of the potent greenhouse gas methane. The α subunit of MCR (McrA) contains several unusual post-translational modifications, including a rare thioamidation of glycine. Based on the presumed function of homologous genes involved in the biosynthesis of thioviridamide, a thioamide-containing natural product, we hypothesized that the archaeal &lt;i&gt;tfuA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ycaO&lt;/i&gt; genes would be responsible for post-translational installation of thioglycine into McrA. Mass spectrometric characterization of McrA from the methanogenic archaeon &lt;i&gt;Methanosarcina acetivorans&lt;/i&gt; lacking &lt;i&gt;tfuA&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;i&gt;/&lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;ycaO&lt;/i&gt; revealed the presence of glycine, rather than thioglycine, supporting this hypothesis. Phenotypic characterization of the ∆&lt;i&gt;ycaO-tfuA&lt;/i&gt; mutant revealed a severe growth rate defect on substrates with low free energy yields and at elevated temperatures (39°C - 45°C). Our analyses support a role for thioglycine in stabilizing the protein secondary structure near the active site.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/27109</link>
	<description>Transmissible amyloid particles called prions are associated with infectious prion diseases in mammals and inherited phenotypes in yeast. All amyloid aggregates can give rise to potentially infectious seeds that accelerate their growth. Why some amyloid seeds are highly infectious prion particles while others are less infectious or even inert, is currently not understood. To address this question, we analyzed the suprastructure and dimensions of synthetic amyloid fibrils assembled from the yeast (&lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;) prion protein Sup35NM. We then quantified the ability of these particles to induce the [&lt;i&gt;PSI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;] prion phenotype in cells. Our results show a striking relationship between the length distribution of the amyloid fibrils and their ability to induce the heritable [&lt;i&gt;PSI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;] prion phenotype. Using a simple particle size threshold model to describe transfection activity, we explain how dimensions of amyloid fibrils are able to modulate their infectious potential as prions.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Fundamental bound on the persistence and capacity of short-term memory stored as graded persistent activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22225</guid>

	<description>It is widely believed that persistent neural activity underlies short-term memory. Yet, as we show, temporal degradation in such networks behaves differently from human short-term memory performance. We build a more general framework where the memory is viewed as a problem of passing information through noisy channels that represent analog persistent activity networks. Rather than directly storing information, such memory networks might hold information encoded to achieve robustness against noise. We derive a fundamental lower-bound on memory recall precision, which declines with storage duration and number of stored items. We show that human performance, though inconsistent with models involving direct (uncoded) storage in persistent activity networks, can be well-fit by the theoretical bound. This finding is consistent with the view that if the brain stores information in patterns of persistent activity, it might use codes that minimize the effects of noise, motivating the search for such codes in the brain.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the development and dysfunction of the human brain is a major goal of neurobiology. Much of our current understanding of human brain development has been derived from the examination of post-mortem and pathological specimens, bolstered by observations of developing non-human primates and experimental studies &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Although modified rabies viruses have emerged as a powerful tool for tracing the inputs to genetically defined populations of neurons, the toxicity of the virus has limited its utility. A recent study employed a self-inactivating rabies (SiR) virus that enables recording or manipulation of targeted neurons for months.</description>

	<description>In mammals, acoustic information arises in the cochlea and is transmitted to the ventral cochlear nuclei (VCN). Three groups of VCN neurons extract different features from the firing of auditory nerve fibers and convey that information along separate pathways through the brainstem. Two of these pathways process temporal information: octopus cells detect coincident firing among auditory nerve fibers and transmit signals along monaural pathways, and bushy cells sharpen the encoding of fine structure and feed binaural pathways.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Neurons are akin to modern cities in that both are dependent on robust transport mechanisms. Like the best mass transit systems, trafficking in neurons must be tailored to respond to local requirements. Neurons depend on both high-speed, long-distance transport and localized dynamics to correctly deliver &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors: Themasap A. Khan &amp;amp; Sergiu P. Paşca&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zika virus infection is associated with birth defects, including microcephaly, but also with disorders of peripheral nerves. Oh et al. use rodent and human cell models to explore how the virus affects the peripheral nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authors: Karl Herrup, Kai-Hei Tse &amp;amp; Hei-Man Chow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9orf72 gene locus create double jeopardy, first by leading to DNA–RNA R-loops that spawn double-strand breaks and second by the synthesis of dipeptide repeats that hinder DNA repair. This two-pronged mechanism may explain neurodegeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the basis for the feeling that someplace or someone is familiar? Molas et al. have identified brain structures involved in signaling familiarity, a necessary element for the expression of preference for novelty.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Phantom Limbs, Neuroprosthetics, and the Developmental Origins of Embodiment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30141-8?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30141-8?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Amputees who wish to rid themselves of a phantom limb must weaken the neural representation of the absent limb. Conversely, amputees who wish to replace a lost limb must assimilate a neuroprosthetic with the existing neural representation. Whether we wish to remove a phantom limb or assimilate a synthetic one, we will benefit from knowing more about the developmental process that enables embodiment. A potentially critical contributor to that process is the spontaneous activity – in the form of limb twitches – that occurs exclusively and abundantly during active (REM) sleep, a particularly prominent state in early development.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: All Wrapped Up: Environmental Effects on Myelination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30124-8?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30124-8?rss=yes</link>
	<description>To date, studies have demonstrated the dynamic influence of exogenous environmental stimuli on multiple regions of the brain. This environmental influence positively and negatively impacts programs governing myelination, and acts on myelinating oligodendrocyte (OL) cells across the human lifespan. Developmentally, environmental manipulation of OL progenitor cells (OPCs) has profound effects on the establishment of functional cognitive, sensory, and motor programs. Furthermore, central nervous system (CNS) myelin remains an adaptive entity in adulthood, sensitive to environmentally induced structural changes.</description>
