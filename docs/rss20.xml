	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Relaxing the Constraints on Predictive Coding Models. (arXiv:2010.01047v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Predictive coding is an influential theory of cortical function which posits
that the principal computation the brain performs, which underlies both
perception and learning, is the minimization of prediction errors. While
motivated by high-level notions of variational inference, detailed
neurophysiological models of cortical microcircuits which can implements its
computations have been developed. Moreover, under certain conditions,
predictive coding has been shown to approximate the backpropagation of error
algorithm, and thus provides a relatively biologically plausible
credit-assignment mechanism for training deep networks. However, standard
implementations of the algorithm still involve potentially neurally implausible
features such as identical forward and backward weights, backward nonlinear
derivatives, and 1-1 error unit connectivity. In this paper, we show that these
features are not integral to the algorithm and can be removed either directly
or through learning additional sets of parameters with Hebbian update rules
without noticeable harm to learning performance. Our work thus relaxes current
constraints on potential microcircuit designs and hopefully opens up new
regions of the design-space for neuromorphic implementations of predictive
coding.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modern machine learning models are typically highly accurate but have been
shown to be vulnerable to small, adversarially-chosen perturbations of the
input. There are two main models of attacks considered in the literature:
black-box and white-box. We consider these threat models as two ends of a
fine-grained spectrum, indexed by the number of queries the adversary can ask.
Using this point of view we investigate how many queries the adversary needs to
make to design an attack that is comparable to the best possible attack in the
white-box model. We analyze two classical learning algorithms on two synthetic
tasks for which we prove meaningful security guarantees. The obtained bounds
suggest that some learning algorithms are inherently more robust against
query-bounded adversaries than others.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Reviewing and Benchmarking Parameter Control Methods in Differential Evolution. (arXiv:2010.01035v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many Differential Evolution (DE) algorithms with various parameter control
methods (PCMs) have been proposed. However, previous studies usually considered
PCMs to be an integral component of a complex DE algorithm. Thus the
characteristics and performance of each method are poorly understood. We
present an in-depth review of 24 PCMs for the scale factor and crossover rate
in DE and a large scale benchmarking study. We carefully extract the 24 PCMs
from their original, complex algorithms and describe them according to a
systematic manner. Our review facilitates the understanding of similarities and
differences between existing, representative PCMs. The performance of DEs with
the 24 PCMs and 16 variation operators is investigated on 24 black-box
benchmark functions. Our benchmarking results reveal which methods exhibit high
performance when embedded in a standardized framework under 16 different
conditions, independent from their original, complex algorithms. We also
investigate how much room there is for further improvement of PCMs by comparing
the 24 methods with an oracle-based model, which can be considered to be a
conservative lower bound on the performance of an optimal method.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: How Far Are We From an Optimal, Adaptive DE?. (arXiv:2010.01032v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01032</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider how an (almost) optimal parameter adaptation process for an
adaptive DE might behave, and compare the behavior and performance of this
approximately optimal process to that of existing, adaptive mechanisms for DE.
An optimal parameter adaptation process is an useful notion for analyzing the
parameter adaptation methods in adaptive DE as well as other adaptive
evolutionary algorithms, but it cannot be known generally. Thus, we propose a
Greedy Approximate Oracle method (GAO) which approximates an optimal parameter
adaptation process. We compare the behavior of GAODE, a DE algorithm with GAO,
to typical adaptive DEs on six benchmark functions and the BBOB benchmarks, and
show that GAO can be used to (1) explore how much room for improvement there is
in the performance of the adaptive DEs, and (2) obtain hints for developing
future, effective parameter adaptation methods for adaptive DEs.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multimodality is one of the biggest difficulties for optimization as local
optima are often preventing algorithms from making progress. This does not only
challenge local strategies that can get stuck. It also hinders meta-heuristics
like evolutionary algorithms in convergence to the global optimum. In this
paper we present a new concept of gradient descent, which is able to escape
local traps. It relies on multiobjectivization of the original problem and
applies the recently proposed and here slightly modified multi-objective local
search mechanism MOGSA. We use a sophisticated visualization technique for
multi-objective problems to prove the working principle of our idea. As such,
this work highlights the transfer of new insights from the multi-objective to
the single-objective domain and provides first visual evidence that
multiobjectivization can link single-objective local optima in multimodal
landscapes.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Circuits of biological neurons, such as in the functional parts of the brain
can be modeled as networks of coupled oscillators. Inspired by the ability of
these systems to express a rich set of outputs while keeping (gradients of)
state variables bounded, we propose a novel architecture for recurrent neural
networks. Our proposed RNN is based on a time-discretization of a system of
second-order ordinary differential equations, modeling networks of controlled
nonlinear oscillators. We prove precise bounds on the gradients of the hidden
states, leading to the mitigation of the exploding and vanishing gradient
problem for this RNN. Experiments show that the proposed RNN is comparable in
performance to the state of the art on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating
the potential of this architecture to provide stable and accurate RNNs for
processing complex sequential data.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Identifying causal relationships is a challenging yet a crucial problem in
many fields of science like epidemiology, climatology, ecology, genomics,
economics and neuroscience, to mention only a few. Recent studies have
demonstrated that ordinal partition transition networks (OPTNs) allow to infer
the coupling direction between two dynamical systems. In this work, we
generalize this concept to the interaction between multiple dynamical systems
and propose a new method to detect causality in multivariate observational
data. We demonstrate that our approach can reliably identify the direction of
interaction and the corresponding delays with numerical simulations using
linear stochastic systems as well as nonlinear dynamical systems such as a
network of neural mass models. Finally, we apply our method to real-world
observational microelectrode array data from rodent brain slices to study the
causal effect networks underlying epileptic activity. Our results from
simulations as well as real-world data suggest that OPTNs can provide a
complementary approach to reliably infer causal effect networks from
multivariate observational data.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The significant role of dendritic processing within neuronal networks has
become increasingly clear. This letter explores the effects of including a
simple dendrite-inspired mechanism into neuroevolution. The phenomenon of
separate dendrite activation thresholds on connections is allowed to emerge
under an evolutionary process. It is shown how such processing can be
positively selected for, particularly for connections between the hidden and
output layer, and increases performance.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00826</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Evaluating solutions to optimization problems is arguably the most important
step for heuristic algorithms, as it is used to guide the algorithms towards
the optimal solution in the solution search space. Research has shown
evaluation functions to some optimization problems to be impractical to compute
and have thus found surrogate less expensive evaluation functions to those
problems. This study investigates the extent to which supervised learning
algorithms can be used to find approximations to evaluation functions for the
university course timetabling problem. Up to 97 percent of the time, the
traditional evaluation function agreed with the supervised learning regression
model on the result of comparison of the quality of pair of solutions to the
university course timetabling problem, suggesting that supervised learning
regression models can be suitable alternatives for optimization problems'
evaluation functions.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: An Analysis of Control Parameters of MOEA/D Under Two Different Optimization Scenarios. (arXiv:2010.00818v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An unbounded external archive (UEA), which stores all nondominated solutions
found during the search process, is frequently used to evaluate the performance
of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) in recent studies. A recent
benchmarking study also shows that decomposition-based MOEA (MOEA/D) is
competitive with state-of-the-art MOEAs when the UEA is incorporated into
MOEA/D. However, a parameter study of MOEA/D using the UEA has not yet been
performed. Thus, it is unclear how control parameter settings influence the
performance of MOEA/D with the UEA. In this paper, we present an analysis of
control parameters of MOEA/D under two performance evaluation scenarios. One is
a final population scenario where the performance assessment of MOEAs is
performed based on all nondominated solutions in the final population, and the
other is a reduced UEA scenario where it is based on a pre-specified number of
selected nondominated solutions from the UEA. Control parameters of MOEA/D
investigated in this paper include the population size, scalarizing functions,
and the penalty parameter of the penalty-based boundary intersection (PBI)
function. Experimental results indicate that suitable settings of the three
control parameters significantly depend on the choice of an optimization
scenario. We also analyze the reason why the best parameter setting is totally
different for each scenario.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Effective Regularization Through Loss-Function Metalearning. (arXiv:2010.00788v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00788</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00788</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Loss-function metalearning can be used to discover novel, customized loss
functions for deep neural networks, resulting in improved performance, faster
training, and improved data utilization. A likely explanation is that such
functions discourage overfitting, leading to effective regularization. This
paper theoretically demonstrates that this is indeed the case: decomposition of
learning rules makes it possible to characterize the training dynamics and show
that loss functions evolved through TaylorGLO regularize both in the beginning
and end of learning, and maintain an invariant in between. The invariant can be
utilized to make the metalearning process more efficient in practice, and the
regularization can train networks that are robust against adversarial attacks.
Loss-function optimization can thus be seen as a well-founded new aspect of
metalearning in neural networks.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Network controllability in transmodal cortex predicts psychosis spectrum symptoms. (arXiv:2010.00659v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00659</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00659</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The psychosis spectrum is associated with structural dysconnectivity
concentrated in transmodal association cortex. However, understanding of this
pathophysiology has been limited by an exclusive focus on the direct
connections to a region. Using Network Control Theory, we measured variation in
both direct and indirect structural connections to a region to gain new
insights into the pathophysiology of the psychosis spectrum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used psychosis symptom data and structural connectivity in 1,068 youths
aged 8 to 22 years from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Applying a
Network Control Theory metric called average controllability, we estimated each
brain region's capacity to leverage its direct and indirect structural
connections to control linear brain dynamics. Next, using non-linear
regression, we determined the accuracy with which average controllability could
predict negative and positive psychosis spectrum symptoms in out-of-sample
testing. We also compared prediction performance for average controllability
versus strength, which indexes only direct connections to a region. Finally, we
assessed how the prediction performance for psychosis spectrum symptoms varied
over the functional hierarchy spanning unimodal to transmodal cortex.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average controllability outperformed strength at predicting positive
psychosis spectrum symptoms, demonstrating that indexing indirect structural
connections to a region improved prediction performance. Critically, improved
prediction was concentrated in association cortex for average controllability,
whereas prediction performance for strength was uniform across the cortex,
suggesting that indexing indirect connections is crucial in association cortex.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examining inter-individual variation in direct and indirect structural
connections to association cortex is crucial for accurate prediction of
positive psychosis spectrum symptoms.

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study aimed to determine the prevalence and mechanism of linear vertigo reported by the patients during the attacks of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). We prospectively evaluated the characteristics (rotational vs. linear) of positional vertigo in 70 patients with posterior and horizontal canal BPPV using a questionnaire allowing multiple choices. In patients with linear vertigo, we further assessed the directionality of linear vertigo. We adopted the velocity-storage model to explain the occurrence and direction of linear vertigo in these patients with BPPV. Patients reported only rotational vertigo in 46 (46/70, 65.7%), only linear vertigo in 10 (14.3%), and both rotational and linear vertigo in 14 (20%). The patients experienced fear from rotational vertigo in 54 (54/70, 77.1%) and from linear vertigo in 20 (20/70, 28.6%). The direction of linear vertigo was concordant with the direction of inertial acceleration predicted by the velocity-storage model. Patients with BPPV may experience linear as well as rotational vertigo during the attacks. This linear vertigo may be ascribed to centrally estimated inertial acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Optogenetic inhibition-mediated activity-dependent modification of CA1 pyramidal-interneuron connections during behavior</title>

	<description>In vitro work revealed that excitatory synaptic inputs to hippocampal inhibitory interneurons could undergo Hebbian, associative or non-associative plasticity. Both behavioral and learning-dependent reorganization of these connections has also been demonstrated by measuring spike transmission probabilities in pyramidal cell-interneuron spike cross-correlations that indicate monosynaptic connections. Here we investigated the activity-dependent modification of these connections during exploratory behavior in rats by optogenetically inhibiting pyramidal cell and interneuron subpopulations. Light application and associated firing alteration of pyramidal and interneuron populations led to lasting changes of pyramidal-interneuron connection weights as indicated by spike transmission changes. Spike transmission alterations were predicted by the light-mediated changes in the number of pre- and postsynaptic spike pairing events and by firing rate changes of interneurons but not pyramidal cells. This work demonstrates the presence of activity-dependent associative and non-associative reorganization of pyramidal-interneuron connections triggered by the optogenetic modification of the firing rate and spike synchrony of cells.</description>

	<title>eLife: Re-assessment of the involvement of Snord115 in the serotonin 2C receptor pathway in a genetically relevant mouse model</title>

	<description>&lt;i&gt;SNORD115&lt;/i&gt; has been proposed to promote the activity of serotonin (HTR2C) receptor via its ability to base-pair with its pre-mRNA and regulate alternative RNA splicing and/or A-to-I RNA editing. Because &lt;i&gt;SNORD115&lt;/i&gt; genes are deleted in most patients with the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), diminished HTR2C receptor activity could contribute to the impaired emotional response and/or compulsive overeating characteristic of this disease. In order to test this appealing but never demonstrated hypothesis &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we created a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated &lt;i&gt;Snord115&lt;/i&gt; knockout mouse. Surprisingly, we uncovered only modest region-specific alterations in &lt;i&gt;Htr2c&lt;/i&gt; RNA editing profiles while &lt;i&gt;Htr2c &lt;/i&gt;alternative RNA splicing was unchanged. These subtle changes, whose functional relevance remains uncertain, were not accompanied by any discernible defects in anxio-depressive-like phenotypes. Energy balance and eating behaviour were also normal, even after exposure to high fat diet. Our study raises questions concerning the physiological role of &lt;i&gt;SNORD115&lt;/i&gt;, notably its involvement in behavioural disturbance associated with PWS.</description>

	<description>Cortical neural activity is coupled to local arterial diameter and blood flow. However, which neurons control the dynamics of cerebral arteries is not well understood. We dissected the cellular mechanisms controlling the basal diameter and evoked dilation in cortical arteries in awake, head-fixed mice. Locomotion drove robust arterial dilation, increases in gamma band power in the local field potential (LFP), and increases calcium signals in pyramidal and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-expressing neurons. Chemogenetic or pharmocological modulation of overall neural activity up or down caused corresponding increases or decreases in basal arterial diameter. Modulation of pyramidal neuron activity alone had little effect on basal or evoked arterial dilation, despite pronounced changes in the LFP. Modulation of the activity of nNOS-expressing neurons drove changes in the basal and evoked arterial diameter without corresponding changes in population neural activity.</description>

	<description>Vitamin B12 is an essential micronutrient that functions in two metabolic pathways: the canonical propionate breakdown pathway and the methionine/S-adenosylmethionine (Met/SAM) cycle. In &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans,&lt;/i&gt; low vitamin B12, or genetic perturbation of the canonical propionate breakdown pathway results in propionate accumulation and the transcriptional activation of a propionate shunt pathway. This propionate-dependent mechanism requires &lt;i&gt;nhr-10&lt;/i&gt; and is referred to as 'B12-mechanism-I'. Here, we report that vitamin B12 represses the expression of Met/SAM cycle genes by a propionate-independent mechanism we refer to as 'B12-mechanism-II'. This mechanism is activated by perturbations in the Met/SAM cycle, genetically or due to low dietary vitamin B12. B12-mechanism-II requires &lt;i&gt;nhr-114&lt;/i&gt; to activate Met/SAM cycle gene expression, the vitamin B12 transporter, &lt;i&gt;pmp-5&lt;/i&gt;, and adjust influx and efflux of the cycle by activating msra-1 and repressing &lt;i&gt;cbs-1&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. Taken together, Met/SAM cycle activity is sensed and transcriptionally adjusted to be in a tight metabolic regime.</description>

	<title>eLife: Ebola and Marburg virus matrix layers are locally ordered assemblies of VP40 dimers</title>

	<description>Filoviruses such as Ebola and Marburg virus bud from the host membrane as enveloped virions. This process is achieved by the matrix protein VP40. When expressed alone, VP40 induces budding of filamentous virus-like particles, suggesting that localization to the plasma membrane, oligomerization into a matrix layer, and generation of membrane curvature are intrinsic properties of VP40. There has been no direct information on the structure of VP40 matrix layers within viruses or virus-like particles. We present structures of Ebola and Marburg VP40 matrix layers in intact virus-like particles, and within intact Marburg viruses. VP40 dimers assemble extended chains via C-terminal domain interactions. These chains stack to form 2D matrix lattices below the membrane surface. These lattices form a patchwork assembly across the membrane and suggesting that assembly may begin at multiple points. Our observations define the structure and arrangement of the matrix protein layer that mediates formation of filovirus particles.</description>

	<title>eLife: Structural insights into mRNA reading frame regulation by tRNA modification and slippery codon-anticodon pairing</title>

	<description>Modifications in the tRNA anticodon loop, adjacent to the three-nucleotide anticodon, influence translation fidelity by stabilizing the tRNA to allow for accurate reading of the mRNA genetic code. One example is the N1-methylguaonosine modification at guanine nucleotide 37 (m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;G37) located in the anticodon loop, immediately adjacent to the anticodon nucleotides 34-36. The absence of m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;G37 in tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Pro&lt;/sup&gt; causes +1 frameshifting on polynucleotide, slippery codons. Here, we report structures of the bacterial ribosome containing tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Pro&lt;/sup&gt; bound to either cognate or slippery codons to determine how the m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;G37 modification prevents mRNA frameshifting. The structures reveal that certain codon-anticodon contexts and m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;G37 destabilize interactions of tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Pro&lt;/sup&gt; with the peptidyl site, causing large conformational changes typically only seen during EF-G mediated translocation of the mRNA-tRNA pairs. These studies provide molecular insights into how m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;G37 stabilizes the interactions of tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Pro&lt;/sup&gt; with the ribosome and the influence of slippery codons on the mRNA reading frame.</description>

	<description>In a traditional view, in social cognition, attention is equated with gaze and people track attention by tracking other people's gaze. Here we used fMRI to test whether the brain represents attention in a richer manner. People read stories describing an agent (either oneself or someone else) directing attention to an object in one of two ways: either internally directed (endogenous) or externally induced (exogenous). We used multivoxel pattern analysis to examine how brain areas within the theory-of-mind network encoded attention type and agent type. Brain activity patterns in the left temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) showed significant decoding of information about endogenous versus exogenous attention. The left TPJ, left superior temporal sulcus (STS), precuneus, and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) significantly decoded agent type (self versus other). These findings show that the brain constructs a rich model of one's own and others' attentional state, possibly aiding theory of mind.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A gradual backward shift of dopamine responses during associative learning</title>

	<description>It has been proposed that the activity of dopamine neurons approximates temporal difference (TD) prediction error, a teaching signal developed in reinforcement learning, a field of machine learning. However, whether this similarity holds true during learning remains elusive. In particular, some TD learning models predict that the error signal gradually shifts backward in time from reward delivery to a reward-predictive cue, but previous experiments failed to observe such a gradual shift in dopamine activity. Here we demonstrate conditions in which such a shift can be detected experimentally. These shared dynamics of TD error and dopamine activity narrow the gap between machine learning theory and biological brains, tightening a long-sought link.</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Update on Cerebellar Ataxia with Neuropathy and Bilateral Vestibular Areflexia Syndrome (CANVAS)</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The syndrome of cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and bilateral vestibular areflexia (CANVAS) has emerged progressively during the last 30 years. It was first outlined by the neurootology/neurophysiology community in the vestibular areflexic patients, through the description of patients slowly developing late-onset cerebellar ataxia and bilateral vestibulopathy. The characteristic deficit of visuo-vestibulo-ocular reflex (VVOR) due to the impaired slow stabilizing eye movements was put forward and a specific disease subtending this syndrome was suggested. The association to a peripheral sensory axonal neuropathy was described later on, with neuropathological studies demonstrating that both sensory neuropathy and vestibular areflexia were diffuse ganglionopathy. Clinical and electrophysiological criteria of CANVAS were then proposed in 2016. Besides the classical triad, frequent chronic cough, signs of dysautonomia and neurogenic pains were frequently observed. From the beginning of published cohorts, sporadic as well as familial cases were reported, the last suggestive of an autosomal recessive mode of transmission. The genetic disorder was discovered in 2019, under the form of abnormal biallelic expansion in the replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) in a population of late-onset ataxia. This pathological expansion was found in 100% of the familial form and 92% of sporadic ones when the triad was complete. But using the genetic criteria, the phenotype of CANVAS seems to expand, for exemple including patients with isolated neuronopathy. We propose here to review the clinical, electrophysiological, anatomical, genetic aspect of CANVAS in light of the recent discovery of the genetic aetiology, and discuss differential diagnosis, neuropathology and physiopathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Peripheral kappa opioid receptor activation drives cold hypersensitivity in mice</title>

	<description>Noxious cold sensation is commonly associated with peripheral neuropathies, however, there has been limited progress in understanding the mechanism of cold pain. Transient receptor potential (TRP) A1 channels facilitate the perception of noxious cold at the level of dorsal root ganglia (DRG), where kappa opioid receptors (KOR) are also expressed but have not previously been implicated in cold sensation. Here we identify a new role for KOR in enhancing cold hypersensitivity. First, we show that systemic KOR agonism (U50,488, KOR agonist), significantly potentiates the latency to jump and the number of jumps on the cold plate compared controls at 3oC. Importantly, NorBNI (KOR antagonist) attenuates U50,488-induced cold hypersensitivity. However, the central administration of NorBNI does not block U50,488-induced cold hypersensitivity suggesting that peripheral KOR likely modulate this effect. Furthermore, the peripherally-restricted KOR agonist, ff(nle)r-NH2 also induces cold hypersensitivity. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization, we show that KOR mRNA colocalizes with the transcripts for the cold-activated TRPA1 and TRPM8 channels in DRG. Finally, using calcium imaging in DRG, we show that intracellular calcium release is potentiated during the simultaneous application of a TRPA1 agonist, mustard oil (MO), and a KOR agonist (U50,488), when compared to MO alone. This potentiated calcium response is absent in TRPA1 KO mice. Together our data suggest that KOR-induces cold hypersensitivity through modulation of peripheral TRPA1 channels. These findings indicate that whether activation of peripheral KOR is protective or not may be dependent on the pain modality.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Role of 5-HT2C receptors in zebrafish alarm reactions and post-exposure behavior</title>

	<description>Serotonin (5-HT) receptors have been implicated in responses to aversive stimuli in mammals and fish, but its precise role is still unknown. Moreover, since at least seven families of 5-HT receptors exist in vertebrates, the role of specific receptors is still debated. Aversive stimuli can be classified as indicators of proximal, distal, or potential threat, initiating responses that are appropriate for each of these threat levels. Responses to potential threat usually involve cautious exploration and increased alertness, while responses to distal and proximal threat involve a fight-flight-freeze reaction. We exposed adult zebrafish to a conspecific alarm substance (CAS) and observed behavior during (distal threat) and after (proximal threat) exposure, and treated with the 5-HT2C receptor agonists MK-212 or WAY-161503 or with the antagonist RS-102221. The agonists blocked CAS-elicited defensive behavior (distal threat), but not post-exposure increases in defensive behavior (potential threat), suggesting a phasic inhibition of responses to distal threat. MK-212 did not block changes in behavior elicited by acute restraint stress, a model of proximal threat, suggesting that the phasic role of the 5-HT2C receptor is specific to distal threat. We also found that RS-10221, a 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, did not change behavior during exposure, but it produced a small effect on behavior after exposure to CAS, suggesting a tonic facilitation of responses to potential threat.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Bayes Estimate of Primary Threshold in Cluster-wise fMRI Inferences</title>

	<description>Cluster-wise statistical inference is the most widely used technique for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analyses. Cluster-wise statistical inference consists of two steps: i) primary thresholding that excludes less significant voxels by a pre-specified cut-off (e.g., p&amp;lt;0.001 ); and ii) cluster-wise thresholding that controls the family-wise error rate (FWER) caused by clusters consisting of false positive supra-threshold voxels. It has been well known that the selection of the primary threshold is critical because it determines both statistical power and false discovery rate. However, in most existing statistical packages, the primary threshold is selected based on prior knowledge (e.g., p&amp;lt;0.001) without taking into account the information in the data. In this manuscript, we propose a data-driven approach to objectively select the optimal primary threshold based on an empirical Bayes framework. We evaluate the proposed model using extensive simulation studies and an fMRI data example. The results show that our method can effectively increase statistical power while effectively controlling the false discovery rate.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Leptin-receptor neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus regulate the timing of circadian rhythms in feeding and metabolism in mice</title>

	<description>Animal behavior and metabolism are tightly coordinated with sleep-wake cycles governed by the brain in harmony with environmental light:dark cycles. Within the brain, the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) has been implicated in the integrative control of feeding, energy homeostasis, and circadian rhythms, but the underlying cell types are unknown. Here, we identify a role for DMH leptin receptor-expressing neurons (DMHLepR) in these effects. Using a viral approach, we show that silencing DMHLepR neurons in adult mice not only increases body weight and adiposity, but also shifts circadian rhythms in feeding and metabolism into the light-cycle. Moreover, DMHLepR silencing abolishes the normal increase in dark-cycle locomotor activity characteristic of nocturnal rodents. Furthermore, DMHLepR-silenced mice fail to entrain to a restrictive change in food availability. Together, these findings identify DMHLepR neurons as critical determinants of the daily time of feeding and associated metabolic rhythms.</description>

	<description>The hippocampal formation is linked to spatial navigation but direct evidence in primates during active, unconstrained navigation is lacking. Combined with accurate behavioral tracking of eye and head, we record neurons across hippocampal regions in rhesus macaques during free foraging in an open arena. We find that neurons encode a broad spectrum of spatial variables beyond place fields. Most neurons show mixed selectivity, with diverse representations covering the entire space. The allocentric representations are dominated by facing location and tilt orientation, and a rather low fraction of neurons shows place or grid fields. Spatial facing selectivity mainly reflects head-, rather than gaze-related, properties. These findings reveal that the macaque hippocampal formation represents space using a multiplexed code, with heading properties dominating over simple place coding during free behavior.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Impaired dynamic profile of brain recurring functional connectivity states in Alzheimers disease</title>

	<description>Up to now, disrupted functional organization of the brain in Alzheimers disease (AD) has mostly been examined by assessing static functional connectivity (FC). However, recent studies have provided clear evidence that brain FC exhibits intrinsic spatiotemporal dynamic organization also being significantly affected in AD. However, inconsistency in former studies is a motivation for further investigation of impaired dynamic profile of brain FC networks in Alzheimers disease. In this work, we identified recurring FC states during rest (eyes-open) in 24 AD patients and 37 healthy controls (HC) by combining sliding window-based method (examining dynamic FC) and k-means clustering algorithm (identifying recurring FC states over time). To define the optimum number of recurring FC states in k-means algorithm, we employed non-supervised validity criteria such as silhouette value and Dunn index over bootstrap samples. Then, we examined differences in dynamic properties of recurring FC states including probability of occurrence, lifetime and switching profile between groups. Afterward, association between impaired dynamic profile of recurring FC states and cognitive performance was assessed in AD patients. Our findings revealed three recurring FC states and among them, FC state with the most significant differences in probability of occurrence (corrected p-value &amp;lt; 0.0001) included brain regions involved in default mode, frontoparietal and salience networks. This recurring FC state occurred significantly less and lasted shorter in patients with AD than in the HC. Further, the probability of occurrence in this recurring FC state significantly correlated positively with cognitive decline in patients with AD. Our findings suggest more decreased in cognitive performance in patients with AD associated with more reduced ability of AD patients to access clinically relevant impaired brain FC networks. Impaired dynamic profile of recurring FC states in AD provide greater understanding of ADs pathophysiology.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: EEG Resting-State and Event-Related Potentials as Markers of Learning Success in Older Adults Following Second Language Training: A Pilot Study</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.03.324640v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In this pilot study, we evaluated the use of electrophysiological measures at rest as paradigm-independent predictors of L2 development for the first time in older adult learners. We then assessed EEG correlates of the learning outcome in a language-switching paradigm after the training, which to date has only been done in younger adults and at intermediate to advanced L2 proficiency. Ten (Swiss) German-speaking adults between 65-74 years of age participated in an intensive three-weeks English training for beginners. A resting-state EEG was recorded before the training to predict the ensuing L2 development (Experiment 1). A language-switching ERP experiment was conducted after the training to assess the learning outcome (Experiment 2). All participants improved their L2 skills but differed noticeably in their individual development. Experiment 1 showed that beta1 oscillations at rest (13-14.5Hz) predicted these individual differences. We interpret resting-state beta1 oscillations as correlates of attentional capacities and semantic working memory that facilitate the extraction and processing of novel forms and meanings from the L2 input. In Experiment 2, we found that language-switching from the L2 into the native language (L1) elicited an N400 component, which was reduced in the more advanced learners. Thus, for learners beginning the acquisition of an L2 in third age, language switching appears to become less effortful with increasing proficiency, suggesting that the lexicons of the L1 and L2 become more closely linked. In sum, our findings indicate that individual differences in L2 development and proficiency in older adults operate through similar electrophysiological mechanisms as those observed in younger adults.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Role for the Na+/K+ ATPase α 3 subunit in folding and lamination of the human neocortex</title>

	<description>Osmotic equilibrium and membrane potential in animal cells depend on concentration gradients of sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) ions across the plasma membrane, a function that is catalyzed by the Na,K-ATPase 3 subunit. In vertebrates, four paralogous genes, ATP1A1-4, encode distinct alpha subunit isoforms ( 1- 4), three of which ( 1,  2,  3; are expressed in the brain, and two ( 1,  3) predominantly in neurons. The  3 isoform, encoded by ATP1A3, is critical to neuronal physiology, and a growing spectrum of neurological diseases are associated with ATP1A3 pathogenic variants, with ages of onset ranging from early childhood to adulthood. Here, we describe ATP1A3 variants encoding dysfunctional 3 subunits in children affected by polymicrogyria, a developmental malformation of the cerebral cortex characterized by abnormal folding and laminar organization. To gain cell-biological insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of prenatal ATP1A3 expression, we established a transcriptional atlas of ATP1A3 expression during cortical development using mRNA in situ hybridization and transcriptomic profiling of ~125,000 individual cells with single-cell RNA sequencing (Drop-Seq) from various areas of the midgestational human neocortex. We find that fetal expression of ATP1A3 is restricted to a subset of excitatory neurons carrying transcriptional signatures of neuronal activity and maturation characteristic of the developing subplate. Furthermore, by performing Drop-Seq on ~52,000 nuclei from four different areas of an infant human neocortex, we show that ATP1A3 expression persists throughout early postnatal development, not only within excitatory neurons across all cortical layers, but also and more predominantly in inhibitory neurons, with specific enrichment in fast-spiking basket cells. In addition, we show that ATP1A3 expression, both in fetal and postnatal neurons, tends to be higher in frontal cortical areas than in occipital areas, in a pattern consistent with the rostro-caudal maturation gradient of the human neocortex. Finally, we discover distinct co-expression patterns linking catalytic  and {beta} ; subunit isoforms (ATP1A1,2,3) and auxiliary isoforms (ATP1B1,2,3), suggesting the ATPase pump may form non-redundant, cell-type specific alpha-beta combinations. Together, the importance of the developmental phenotypes and dynamic expression patterns of ATP1A3 point to a key role for  3 in the development and function of human cortex.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Adenosine modulates extracellular glutamate levels via adenosine A2A receptors in the delayed-ethanol induced headache.</title>

	<description>Identifying the mechanism behind delayed ethanol-induced headache (DEIH), otherwise known as the hangover headache, may provide insight into the mechanisms behind common headache triggers. Acetate was previously shown to be the key ethanol metabolite behind DEIH in the recurrent inflammatory stimulation (IS) rat model of headache. The reversal of trigeminal sensitivity following ethanol exposure with caffeine previously suggested a role of adenosine in DEIH. To characterize this, behavioral analysis and measurement of brainstem adenosine and glutamate with microdialysis and HPLC was performed while pharmacologically manipulating adenosine signaling in the IS and Spontaneous Trigeminal Allodynia (STA) rat models of headache. Blocking adenosine A2A receptor activation with istradefylline or acetate transport into astrocytes with the monocarboxylate transporter competitive inhibitor, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (4-CIN), prevented acetate-induced trigeminal sensitivity. Blocking adenosine A1, A2B, and A3 receptor signaling did not prevent trigeminal sensitivity. Compared to control rats, IS rats had greater increases in extracellular adenosine and glutamate within the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) of the brainstem during local acetate perfusion. Blocking transport of acetate into astrocytes with 4-CIN prevented the increase in adenosine and glutamate. Blocking A2A receptor activation prevented the increase in extracellular glutamate, but not adenosine in the TNC. These data are the first to demonstrate the physiological consequence of acetate on adenosinergic systems within trigeminal pain by suggesting that acetate-induced trigeminal sensitivity in DEIH is mediated by adenosine A2A receptor activation which modulates extracellular glutamate levels in the TNC.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Look where you go: characterizing eye movements toward optic flow</title>

	<description>When we move through our environment, objects in the visual scene create optic flow patterns on the retina. Even though optic flow is ubiquitous in everyday life, it is not well understood how our eyes naturally respond to it. In small groups of human and non-human primates, optic flow triggers intuitive, uninstructed eye movements to the focus of expansion of the pattern (Knoll, Pillow &amp;amp; Huk, 2018). Here we investigate whether such intuitive oculomotor responses to optic flow are generalizable to a larger group of human observers, and how eye movements are affected by motion signal strength and task instructions. Observers (n = 43) viewed expanding or contracting optic flow constructed by a cloud of moving dots radiating from or converging toward a focus of expansion that could randomly shift. Results show that 84% of observers tracked the focus of expansion with their eyes without being explicitly instructed to track. Intuitive tracking was tuned to motion signal strength: saccades landed closer to the focus of expansion and smooth tracking was more accurate when dot contrast, motion coherence, and translational speed were high. Under explicit tracking instruction, the eyes aligned with the focus of expansion more closely than without instruction. Our results highlight the sensitivity of intuitive eye movements as indicators of visual motion processing in dynamic contexts.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Fast recovery of disrupted tip links induced by mechanical displacement of hair bundles</title>

	<description>Hearing and balance rely on the capacity of mechanically sensitive hair bundles to transduce vibrations into electrical signals that are forwarded to the brain. Hair bundles possess tip links that interconnect the mechanosensitive stereocilia and convey force to the transduction channels. A dimer of dimers, each of these links comprises two molecules of protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) joined to two of cadherin 23 (CDH23). The handshake that conjoins the four molecules can be disrupted in vivo by intense stimulation and in vitro by exposure to Ca2+ chelators. Using hair bundles from the rat cochlea and the bullfrog sacculus, we observed that extensive recovery of mechanoelectrical transduction, hair-bundle stiffness, and spontaneous bundle oscillation can occur within seconds after Ca2+ chelation, especially if hair bundles are deflected towards their short edges. Investigating the phenomenon in a two-compartment ionic environment that mimics natural conditions, we combined iontophoretic application of a Ca2+ chelator to selectively disrupt the tip links of individual frog hair bundles with displacement clamping to control hair-bundle motion and measure forces. Our observations suggest that, after the normal Ca2+ concentration has been restored, mechanical stimulation facilitates the reconstitution of functional tip links.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The amygdaloid body of two carnivore species: the feliform banded mongoose and the caniform domestic ferret</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The amygdaloid body of two carnivore species: the feliform banded mongoose and the caniform domestic ferret&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b2c6d6ec-0fe9-4815-b20f-5120940a12f5/cne25046-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low power photomicrographs of myelin staining in the basolateral amygdala of the banded mongoose (left) and domestic ferret (right). Note the overall lower density of myelin in the domestic ferret, which may relate to either a smaller brain mass or be an effect of the domestication process. Scale bars in each image = 1 mm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current study provides an analysis of the cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture and chemoarchitecture of the amygdaloid body of the banded mongoose (&lt;i&gt;Mungos mungo&lt;/i&gt;) and domestic ferret (&lt;i&gt;Mustela putorius furo&lt;/i&gt;). Using architectural and immunohistochemical stains, we observe that the organization of the nuclear and cortical portions of the amygdaloid complex is very similar in both species. The one major difference is the presence of a cortex‐amygdala transition zone observed in the domestic ferret that is absent in the banded mongoose. In addition, the chemoarchitecture is, for the most part, quite similar in the two species, but several variances, such as differing densities of neurons expressing the calcium‐binding proteins in specific nuclei are noted. Despite this, certain aspects of the chemoarchitecture, such as the cholinergic innervation of the magnocellular division of the basal nuclear cluster and the presence of doublecortin expressing neurons in the shell division of the accessory basal nuclear cluster, appear to be consistent features of the Eutherian mammal amygdala. The domestic ferret presented with an overall lower myelin density throughout the amygdaloid body than the banded mongoose, a feature that may reflect artificial selection in the process of domestication for increased juvenile‐like behaviour in the adult domestic ferret, such as a muted fear response. The shared, but temporally distant, ancestry of the banded mongoose and domestic ferret allows us to generate observations relevant to understanding the relative influence that phylogenetic constraints, adaptive evolutionary plasticity, and the domestication process may play in the organization and chemoarchitecture of the amygdaloid body.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The central nervous system of whip spiders (Amblypygi): Large mushroom bodies receive olfactory and visual input</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The central nervous system of whip spiders (Amblypygi): Large mushroom bodies receive olfactory and visual input&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c2f93c09-1b59-4ab4-8732-abe68fd2fd04/cne25045-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front legs in whip spiders are modified into very long feelers (antenniform legs) equipped with sensory structures, including tens of thousands olfactory receptor neurons. Olfactory afferents terminate on hundreds of primary olfactory glomeruli in the first leg neuromere. Projection neurons relay this information to secondary olfactory glomeruli in the brain's exceptionally large mushroom bodies. The mushroom bodies also comprise thousands of considerably smaller glomeruli that receive visual information. Mushroom bodies are supposed to underlie the whip spiders' advanced multimodal navigation abilities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whip spiders (Amblypygi) are known for their nocturnal navigational abilities, which rely on chemosensory and tactile cues and, to a lesser degree, on vision. Unlike true spiders, the first pair of legs in whip spiders is modified into extraordinarily long sensory organs (antenniform legs) covered with thousands of mechanosensory, olfactory, and gustatory sensilla. Olfactory neurons send their axons through the leg nerve into the corresponding neuromere of the central nervous system, where they terminate on a particularly large number (about 460) of primary olfactory glomeruli, suggesting an advanced sense of smell. From the primary glomeruli, olfactory projection neurons ascend to the brain and terminate in the mushroom body calyx on a set of secondary olfactory glomeruli, a feature that is not known from olfactory pathways of other animals. Another part of the calyx receives visual input from the secondary visual neuropil (the medulla). This calyx region is composed of much smaller glomeruli (“microglomeruli”). The bimodal input and the exceptional size of their mushroom bodies may support the navigational capabilities of whip spiders. In addition to input to the mushroom body, we describe other general anatomical features of the whip spiders' central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Biallelic Intronic AAGGG Expansion of RFC1 is Related to Multiple System Atrophy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25902?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25902?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recessive biallelic repeat expansion, (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt;, in the &lt;i&gt;RFC1&lt;/i&gt; gene has been reported to be a frequent cause of late‐onset ataxia. For cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), the recessive biallelic (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; genotype was present in ~92% of cases. This study aimed to examine whether the pentanucleotide repeat (PNR) was related to multiple system atrophy (MSA), which shares a spectrum of symptoms with CANVAS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we screened the pathogenic (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; repeat and 5 other PNRs in 104 Chinese sporadic adult‐onset ataxia of unknown aetiology (SAOA) patients, 282 MSA patients, and 203 unaffected individuals. Multiple molecular genetic tests were used, including long‐range polymerase chain reaction (PCR), repeat‐primed PCR (RP‐PCR), Sanger sequencing, and Southern blot. Comprehensive clinical assessments were conducted, including neurological examination, neuroimaging, nerve electrophysiology, and examination of vestibular function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified biallelic (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; in 1 SAOA patient and 3 MSA patients. Additionally, 1 MSA patient had the (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt;/(AAAGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; genotype with uncertain pathogenicity. We also described the carrier frequency for different PNRs in our cohorts. Furthermore, we summarized the distinct phenotypes of affected patients, suggesting that biallelic (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; in &lt;i&gt;RFC1&lt;/i&gt; could be associated with MSA and should be screened routinely in the MSA diagnostic workflow.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results expanded the clinical phenotypic spectrum of &lt;i&gt;RFC1&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders and raised the possibility that MSA might share the same genetic background as CANVAS, which is crucial for re‐evaluating the current CANVAS and MSA diagnostic criteria.

	<title>The Cerebellum: Neuronal Activity of Pallidal Versus Cerebellar Receiving Thalamus in Patients with Cervical Dystonia</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cervical dystonia (CD) is a movement disorder characterized by a stereotyped pattern of involuntary turning or tilting of the head, often combined with jerky or tremulous movements. Hypotheses for the origin of CD have traditionally focused on the basal ganglia, but the contemporary discussion has considered the potential role of altered cerebellar function. As basal ganglia and the cerebellum largely project to the different thalamic nuclei, alterations in pallidal versus cerebellar output could be reflected in the activity of these thalamic regions. In this study, we analyzed a unique historic database where the single-unit activity of pallidal and cerebellar receiving thalamic nuclei was measured en route to the mesencephalon. We compared the single-unit activity of pallidal and cerebellar receiving thalamic neurons in three groups of CD patients manifesting as pure dystonia, pure jerky head oscillations, and dystonia plus jerky head oscillations. We found that among different CD manifestations, the characteristics of neuronal firing, such as burst versus a single-spike pattern, vary in cerebellar thalamic receiving nuclei. The cerebellar receiving region in patients with jerky oscillations had single-spikes neurons primarily. Wherein the manifestation of CD did not influence pattern distribution in the pallidal receiving thalamic area. We also found increased neuronal firing rate correlated with strength of theta-band neuronal oscillations during muscle contractions associated with dystonia. These results demonstrate that the manifestations of CD, such as pure dystonia, pure jerky head oscillations, or dystonia and jerky head oscillations, determine the thalamic neuronal properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A 50-year-old patient was admitted with symptoms of intracranial hypotension. MRI revealed a cervical myelomalacia caused by engorged epidural veins leading to a stenosis of the spinal canal. This condition is rarely described in patients with hydrocephalus and ventricular shunts suffering from chronic overdrainage. However, the reason in this patient was a CSF leak caused by an intradural disc herniation at T12/L1. After surgery, symptoms resolved and the cervical &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis type-underline&quot;&gt;myelomalacia&lt;/span&gt; and the swollen epidural veins disappeared on postoperative MRI.
      In patients with engorged cervical epidural veins without a ventricular shunt, a CSF leak has to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) has so far been based on retrospective case series. The results of six randomized clinical trials including five different monoclonal antibodies targeting four molecules and three distinct pathophysiological pathways have recently been published.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Literature search on clinical trials and case studies in NMOSD up to July 10. 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We review mechanism of action, efficacy and side effects, and consequences for reproductive health from traditional immunosuppressants and monoclonal antibodies including rituximab, inebilizumab, eculizumab, tocilizumab and satralizumab.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In NMOSD patients with antibodies against aquaporin 4, monoclonal antibodies that deplete B cells (rituximab and inebilizumab) or interfere with interleukin 6 signaling (tocilizumab and satralizumab) or complement activation (eculizumab) have superior efficacy compared to placebo. Tocilizumab and rituximab were also superior to azathioprine in head-to-head studies. Rituximab, tocilizumab and to some extent eculizumab have well-known safety profiles for other inflammatory diseases, and rituximab and azathioprine may be safe during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;There are no effective symptomatic treatments for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Recent studies report benefits of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for freezing of gait (FOG) and gait disorders in Parkinson’s disease and atypical Parkinsonism patients. This is the first study to report therapeutic effects of SCS in Richardson’s syndrome PSP (PSP-RS) patients.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Epidural SCS was implanted in three female PSP-RS participants (3.2 ± 1.3 years with disease). Six programs (300–400 µs/30–130 Hz) were randomly tested at suprathreshold intensity on separate days. The setting that best improved gait/FOG was used daily by each participant in the study. Protokinetics walkway captured spatiotemporal gait measures and FOG episodes (turning on the spot and while walking) and clinical scales including FOG questionnaire, UPDRS-III (OFF-/ON-&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis type-small-caps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-dopa), and participant-perceived global impression of change (GISC) were collected at pre-SCS, and 3, 6, 12 months post-SCS.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Participant #1 demonstrated the highest GISC score (6.5/10) with a consistent reduction of FOGs by 43.8%, UPDRS-III score (− 5 points), and improved step length and stride velocity (33.6%) while maintaining a &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis type-small-caps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-dopa response of ~ 12% over the 12 months. Participant #2, walking FOG frequency and turning duration was reduced by 39.0% (OFF-&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis type-small-caps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-dopa), and ON-&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis type-small-caps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-dopa UPDRS-III score worsened (+ 5 points) at 12 months. Participant #3, FOG frequency reduced by 75% up to 6 months rating a GISC 3/10 score, however disease severity worsened at 12 months. Ambulatory gait parameters universally improved by 29.6% in all participants.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The results support the benefit of SCS for FOG and gait symptoms in PSP-RS and suggests early SCS intervention for dopaminergic-resistant gait should be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Early posterior negativity in humans to pictures of snakes and spiders: effects of proximity</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Snakes have proven to drive early attentional capture due to their evolutionary importance, as reflected by the early posterior negativity (EPN). The EPN snake effect might be partly driven by the proximity of the animal. In this study, by employing full-body (medium shot) and head-focused (close-up) pictures, we investigated whether the relative nearness (proximity) of the animal on the picture affects the snake EPN effect. We presented thirty participants with medium shot and close-up snake, spider and bird pictures in a rapid serial presentation paradigm at a presentation rate of three frames per second. We extracted the mean EPN activity from the 225–330 ms time frame after stimulus onset at the parietal–occipital cluster (PO3, O1, Oz, O2, PO4). The results indicate enhanced EPN for snake pictures as compared to spider and bird pictures. In addition, medium-shot snake pictures elicited higher EPN amplitudes than close-up snake pictures, suggesting that the EPN is higher when local, high spatial frequency attributes are visible. Spatial frequency analysis of the stimuli indicated that medium-shot snake pictures possess more power in the high spatial frequency bands, compared to medium-shot spider and bird pictures.

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Distinct default mode network subsystems show similarities and differences in the effect of task focus across reading and autobiographical memory</title>

	<description>Semantic cognition can be both perceptually-coupled, for example, during reading, and decoupled, such as in daydreams. Mind-wandering, characterised by autobiographical memory retrieval, often interferes with externally-focussed tasks. This study investigated the neural basis of these states, when they occur in isolation and in competition, using fMRI. Participants were asked to read sentences, presented word-by-word, or to recall personal memories, as a proxy for mind-wandering. Task conflict was created by presenting sentences during memory recall, or memory cues before sentences. We found that different subsystems of the default mode network (DMN) do not fully dissociate across internally- and externally-oriented states, and they do not fully separate in terms of the effects of task focus; this depends on the task. The lateral temporal DMN subsystem, associated with semantic cognition, was activated across both tasks, and by sentence inputs even when they were task-irrelevant. In the core DMN subsystem, greater task focus corresponded to a selective pattern of activation during memory recall and deactivation during reading. Both DMN subsystems formed different patterns of functional coupling depending on the task. In this way, DMN supports both access to meaning from perceptual inputs and focussed internal cognitive states in the face of distracting external information.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Individual differences in proprioception predict the extent of implicit sensorimotor adaptation</title>

	<description>Recent studies have revealed an upper bound in motor adaptation, beyond which other learning systems may be recruited. The factors determining this upper bound are poorly understood. The multisensory integration hypothesis states that this limit arises from opposing responses to visual and proprioceptive feedback. As individuals adapt to a visual perturbation, they experience an increasing proprioceptive error in the opposite direction, and the upper bound is the point where these two error signals reach an equilibrium. Assuming that visual and proprioceptive feedback are weighted according to their variability, there should be a correlation between proprioceptive variability and the limits of adaptation. Alternatively, the proprioceptive realignment hypothesis states that the upper bound arises when the (biased) sensed hand position realigns with the target. When a visuo-proprioceptive discrepancy is introduced, the sensed hand position is biased towards the visual cursor and the adaptive system nullifies this discrepancy by driving the hand away from the target. This hypothesis predicts a correlation between the size of the proprioceptive shift and the upper bound of adaptation. We tested these two hypotheses by considering natural variation in proprioception and motor adaptation across individuals. We observed a modest, yet reliable correlation between the upper bound of adaptation with both proprioceptive measures (variability and shift). While these results do not favor one hypothesis over the other, they underscore the critical role of proprioception in sensorimotor adaptation, and moreover, motivate a novel perspective on how these proprioceptive constraints drive implicit changes in motor behavior.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Parametric cognitive load reveals hidden costs in the neural processing of perfectly intelligible degraded speech</title>

	<description>Speech is often degraded by environmental noise or hearing impairment. People can compensate for degradation, but this is subjectively effortful. Previous research has identified frontotemporal networks involved in effortful perception, but so far has been unable to distinguish domain-general involvement in cognitive control from domain-specific involvement in speech perception. We overcame these limitations by measuring brain responses (via fMRI) to clear and degraded spoken sentences matched for intelligibility. On each trial, participants either attended to a sentence, or to a concurrent multiple object tracking task that imposed parametric cognitive load. Whereas the anterior insulae tracked domain-general task demands, anterior temporal cortex was selective to speech, with cognitive load revealing categorically different responses to clear speech and intelligibility-matched degraded speech. The results demonstrate that cognitive control is required to understand even very mildly degraded speech, underscoring the importance of interactions between perceptual and control systems for real-world speech comprehension.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Malignant astrocyte swelling and impaired glutamate clearance drive the expansion of injurious spreading depolarization foci</title>

	<description>Spreading depolarizations (SD) indicate infarct maturation and predict worse clinical outcome in ischemic stroke. We demonstrate here in rodents that brain edema formation upon ischemic stroke impairs astroglial glutamate clearance and increases the tissue area invaded by SD. The cytotoxic glutamate accumulation predisposes an extensive bulk of tissue for a yet undescribed simultaneous depolarization (SiD). We confirm in rat brain slices under hypo-osmotic stress that SiD is the pathological expansion of prior SD foci, is associated with astrocyte swelling and triggers oncotic neuron death. The blockade of astrocytic aquaporin-4 channels and Na+/K+/Cl- co-transporters, or volume-regulated anion channels mitigated slice edema, glutamate accumulation and SiD occurrence. Reversal of slice edema by hyperosmotic treatment counteracted glutamate accumulation and prevented SiD. In contrast, paralysis of astrocyte metabolism or inhibition of astrocyte glutamate uptake reproduced the SiD phenotype. We discuss our results in the light of evidence for SiD in the human cortex. Our results emphasize the need of preventive osmotherapy in ischemic stroke.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The branching code: a model of actin-driven dendrite arborisation</title>

	<description>Dendrites display a striking variety of neuronal type-specific morphologies, but the mechanisms and principles underlying such diversity remain elusive. A major player in defining the morphology of dendrites is the neuronal cytoskeleton, including evolutionarily conserved actin-modulatory proteins (AMPs). Still, we lack a clear understanding of how AMPs might support developmental phenomena such as neuron-type specific dendrite dynamics. To address precisely this level of in vivo specificity, we concentrated on a defined neuronal type, the class III dendritic arborisation (c3da) neuron of Drosophila larvae, displaying actin-enriched short terminal branchlets (STBs). Computational modelling reveals that the main branches of c3da neurons follow a general growth model based on optimal wiring, but the STBs do not. Instead, model STBs are defined by a short reach and a high affinity to grow towards the main branches. We thus concentrated on c3da STBs and developed new methods to quantitatively describe dendrite morphology and dynamics based on in vivo time-lapse imaging of mutants lacking individual AMPs. In this way, we extrapolated the role of these AMPs in defining STB properties. We propose that dendrite diversity is supported by the combination of a common step, refined by a neuron type-specific second level. For c3da neurons, we present a molecular model of how the combined action of multiple AMPs in vivo define the properties of these second level specialisations, the STBs.</description>

	<description>Two types of scalp-recorded event-related potentials have been proposed as neural correlates of perceptual awareness in humans: an early, modality-specific negativity and a late, modality-independent positivity. However, whether these potentials genuinely reflect perception or result from task demands remains controversial. To address this question, we compared results from a classical somatosensory detection task (direct report task) to a somatosensory-visual matching task, in which overt reports were decorrelated from target detection, equated the behavioural relevance of detected and undetected stimuli, and mitigated the influence of attentional processes. By means of Bayesian model selection, we show that the early N140 component was the first to reflect target detection in both tasks, whereas the late P300 component was task dependent, with strong detection effects in the direct report task that were absent in the matching task. We conclude that the P300 is not a genuine correlate of somatosensory awareness but reflects postperceptual processing.</description>

Deep feedforward neural network models of vision dominate in both computational neuroscience and engineering. The primate visual system, by contrast, contains abundant recurrent connections. Recurrent signal flow enables recycling of limited computational resources over time, and so might boost the performance of a physically finite brain or model. Here we show: (1) Recurrent convolutional neural network models outperform feedforward convolutional models matched in their number of parameters in large-scale visual recognition tasks on natural images. (2) Setting a confidence threshold, at which recurrent computations terminate and a decision is made, enables flexible trading of speed for accuracy. At a given confidence threshold, the model expends more time and energy on images that are harder to recognise, without requiring additional parameters for deeper computations. (3) The recurrent model’s reaction time for an image predicts the human reaction time for the same image better than several parameter-matched and state-of-the-art feedforward models. (4) Across confidence thresholds, the recurrent model emulates the behaviour of feedforward control models in that it achieves the same accuracy at approximately the same computational cost (mean number of floating-point operations). However, the recurrent model can be run longer (higher confidence threshold) and then outperforms parameter-matched feedforward comparison models. These results suggest that recurrent connectivity, a hallmark of biological visual systems, may be essential for understanding the accuracy, flexibility, and dynamics of human visual recognition.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O-ZEKwc_nYY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Uncovering the underlying biophysical principles of emergent collective computational abilities, such as working memory, in neural circuits is one of the most essential concerns in modern neuroscience. Working memory system is often desired to be robust against noises. Such systems can be highly flexible for adapting environmental demands. How neural circuits reconfigure themselves according to the cognitive task requirement remains unclear. Previous studies explored the robustness and the flexibility in working memory by tracing individual dynamical trajectories in a limited time scale, where the accuracy of the results depends on the volume of the collected statistical data. Inspired by thermodynamics and statistical mechanics in physical systems, we developed a non-equilibrium landscape and flux framework for studying the neural network dynamics. Applying this approach to a biophysically based working memory model, we investigated how changes in the recurrent excitation mediated by slow NMDA receptors within a selective population and mutual inhibition mediated by GABAergic interneurons between populations affect the robustness against noises. This is realized through quantifying the underlying non-equilibrium potential landscape topography and the kinetics of state switching. We found that an optimal compromise for a working memory circuit between the robustness and the flexibility can be achieved through the emergence of an intermediate state between the working memory states. An optimal combination of both increased self-excitation and inhibition can enhance the flexibility to external signals without significantly reducing the robustness to the random fluctuations. Furthermore, we found that the enhanced performance in working memory is supported by larger energy consumption. Our approach can facilitate the design of new network structure for cognitive functions with the optimal balance between performance and cost. Our work also provides a new paradigm for exploring the underlying mechanisms of many cognitive functions based on non-equilibrium physics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1_XeN3HW1Lw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Modeling the activation of the alternative complement pathway and its effects on hemolysis in health and disease</title>

The complement system is a powerful mechanism of innate immunity poised to eliminate foreign cells and pathogens. It is an intricate network of &amp;gt;35 proteins, which, once activated, leads to the tagging of the surface to be eliminated, produces potent chemoattractants to recruit immune cells, and inserts cytotoxic pores into nearby lipid surfaces. Although it can be triggered via different pathways, its net output is largely based on the direct or indirect activation of the alternative pathway. Complement dysregulation or deficiencies may cause severe pathologies, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), where a lack of complement control proteins leads to hemolysis and life-threatening anemia. The complexity of the system poses a challenge for the interpretation of experimental data and the design of effective pharmacological therapies. To address this issue, we developed a mathematical model of the alternative complement pathway building on previous modelling efforts. The model links complement activation to the hemolytic activity of the terminal alternative pathway, providing an accurate description of pathway activity as observed in vitro and in vivo, in health and disease. Through adjustment of the parameters describing experimental conditions, the model was capable of reproducing the results of an array of standard assays used in complement research. To demonstrate its clinical applicability, we compared model predictions with clinical observations of the recovery of hematological biomarkers in PNH patients treated with the complement inhibiting anti-C5 antibody eculizumab. In conclusion, the model can enhance the understanding of complement biology and its role in disease pathogenesis, help identifying promising targets for pharmacological intervention, and predict the outcome of complement-targeting pharmacological interventions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oAxIvuJpFf8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Metastases are the main reason for cancer-related deaths. Initiation of metastases, where newly seeded tumor cells expand into colonies, presents a tremendous bottleneck to metastasis formation. Despite its importance, a quantitative description of metastasis initiation and its clinical implications is lacking. Here, we set theoretical grounds for the metastatic bottleneck with a simple stochastic model. The model assumes that the proliferation-to-death rate ratio for the initiating metastatic cells increases when they are surrounded by more of their kind. For a total of 159,191 patients across 13 cancer types, we found that a single cell has an extremely low median probability of successful seeding of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;. With increasing colony size, a sharp transition from very unlikely to very likely successful metastasis initiation occurs. The median metastatic bottleneck, defined as the critical colony size that marks this transition, was between 10 and 21 cells. We derived the probability of metastasis occurrence and patient outcome based on primary tumor size at diagnosis and tumor type. The model predicts that the efficacy of patient treatment depends on the primary tumor size but even more so on the severity of the metastatic bottleneck, which is estimated to largely vary between patients. We find that medical interventions aiming at tightening the bottleneck, such as immunotherapy, can be much more efficient than therapies that decrease overall tumor burden, such as chemotherapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-3xBb9QVb78&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Greninger, Sean A. Diehl, David J. Shirley, Debra G. B. Leonard, Christopher D. Huston, Beth D. Kirkpatrick, Julie A. Dragon, Jessica W. Crothers, Keith R. Jerome, Jason W. Botten&lt;/p&gt;

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented need for rapid diagnostic testing. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a standard assay that includes an RNA extraction step from a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab followed by reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to detect the purified SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The current global shortage of RNA extraction kits has caused a severe bottleneck to COVID-19 testing. The goal of this study was to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected from NP samples via a direct RT-qPCR assay that omits the RNA extraction step altogether. The direct RT-qPCR approach correctly identified 92% of a reference set of blinded NP samples (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 155) demonstrated to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by traditional clinical diagnostic RT-qPCR that included an RNA extraction. Importantly, the direct method had sufficient sensitivity to reliably detect those patients with viral loads that correlate with the presence of infectious virus. Thus, this strategy has the potential to ease supply choke points to substantially expand COVID-19 testing and screening capacity and should be applicable throughout the world.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wb1ocz_B5Hc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Clinical Variability in Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type III</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25900?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25900?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report natural history data in a large cohort of 199 patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type III assessed using the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE). The aim of the study was to establish the annual rate and possible patterns of progression according to a number of variables, such as age of onset, age at assessment, &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; copy number, and functional status.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HFMSE longitudinal changes were assessed using piecewise linear mixed‐effects models. The dependency in the data due to repeated measures was accounted for by a random intercept per individual and an unstructured covariance R matrix was used as correlation structure. An additional descriptive analysis was performed for 123 patients, for a total of 375 12‐month assessments.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A break point at age 7 years was set for the whole cohort and for SMA IIIA and IIIB. Age, SMA type, and ambulatory status were significantly associated with changes in mean HFMSE score, whereas gender and &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; copy number were not. The increase in response before the break point of age 7 years is significant only for SMA IIIA (β = 1.79, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). After the break point, the change in the rate of HFMSE score significantly decrease for both SMA IIIA (β = −1.15, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and IIIB (β = −0.69, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings contribute to the understanding of the natural history of SMA type III and will be helpful in the interpretation of the real‐world data of patients treated with commercially available drugs. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Lesion Age Imaging in Acute Stroke: Water Uptake in CT Versus DWI‐FLAIR Mismatch</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25903?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25903?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In acute ischemic stroke with unknown time of onset, magnetic resonance (MR)‐based diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) estimates lesion age to guide intravenous thrombolysis. Computed tomography (CT)‐based quantitative net water uptake (NWU) may be a potential alternative. The purpose of this study was to directly compare CT‐based NWU to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at identifying patients with lesion age &amp;lt; 4.5 hours from symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty patients with acute anterior circulation stroke were analyzed with both imaging modalities at admission between 0.5 and 8.0 hours after known symptom onset. DWI‐FLAIR lesion mismatch was rated and NWU was measured in admission CT. An established NWU threshold (11.5%) was used to classify patients within and beyond 4.5 hours. Multiparametric MRI signal was compared with NWU using logistic regression analyses. The empirical distribution of NWU was analyzed in a consecutive cohort of patients with wake‐up stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The median time between CT and MRI was 35 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] = 24–50). The accuracy of DWI‐FLAIR mismatch was 68.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 53.7–81.3%) with a sensitivity of 58% and specificity of 82%. The accuracy of NWU threshold was 86.0% (95% CI = 73.3–94.2%) with a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 78%. The area under the curve (AUC) of multiparametric MRI signal to classify lesion age &amp;lt;4.5 hours was 0.86 (95% CI = 0.64–0.97), and the AUC of quantitative NWU was 0.91 (95% CI = 0.78–0.98). Among 87 patients with wake‐up stroke, 46 patients (53%) showed low NWU (&amp;lt; 11.5%).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The predictive power of CT‐based lesion water imaging to identify patients within the time window of thrombolysis was comparable to multiparametric DWI‐FLAIR MRI. A significant proportion of patients with wake‐up stroke exhibit low NWU and may therefore be potentially suitable for thrombolysis. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Network Localization of Alien Limb in Patients with Corticobasal Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25901?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25901?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perirolandic atrophy occurs in corticobasal syndrome (CBS) but is not specific versus progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). There is heterogeneity in the locations of atrophy outside the perirolandic cortex and it remains unknown why atrophy in different locations would cause the same CBS‐specific symptoms. In prior work, we used a wiring diagram of the brain called the human connectome to localize lesion‐induced disorders to symptom‐specific brain networks. Here, we use a similar technique termed “atrophy network mapping” to localize single‐subject atrophy maps to symptom‐specific brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single‐subject atrophy maps were generated by comparing cortical thickness in patients with CBS versus controls. Next, we performed seed‐based functional connectivity using a large normative connectome to determine brain regions functionally connected to each patient's atrophied locations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with CBS had perirolandic atrophy versus controls at the group level, but locations of atrophy in CBS were heterogeneous outside of the perirolandic cortex at the single‐subject level (mean spatial correlation = 0.04). In contrast, atrophy occurred in locations functionally connected to the perirolandic cortex in all patients with CBS (spatial correlation = 0.66). Compared with PSP, patients with CBS had atrophy connected to a network of higher‐order sensorimotor regions beyond perirolandic cortex, matching a CBS atrophy network from a recent meta‐analysis. Finally, atrophy network mapping identified a symptom‐specific network for alien limb, matching a lesion‐induced alien limb network and a network associated with agency in healthy subjects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a syndrome‐specific network for CBS and symptom‐specific network for alien limb using single‐subject atrophy maps and the human connectome. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Role of β3‐adrenergic receptor in the modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity in mouse cerebellar cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24712?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Role of β3‐adrenergic receptor in the modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity in mouse cerebellar cortex&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c4aaaad2-75c6-4dcf-a5b4-4e99acaa808b/jnr24712-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study is the first to investigate the localization and function of β3‐adrenoreceptor (AR) in the mouse cerebellum. The immunohistochemical analysis allowed us to demonstrate that β3‐AR is mainly expressed on Purkinje cells. In addition, we found that blocking β3‐AR interfered with motor learning and synaptic plasticity at the parallel fiber–Purkinje cell. The molecular mechanisms underlying the β3‐AR action are likely related to the activation of the PI3K signaling pathway in Purkinje cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convergent lines of evidence have recently highlighted β3‐adrenoreceptors (ARs) as a potentially critical target in the regulation of nervous and behavioral functions, including memory consolidation, anxiety, and depression. Nevertheless, the role of β3‐ARs in the cerebellum has been never investigated. To address this issue, we first examined the effects of pharmacological manipulation of β3‐ARs on motor learning in mice. We found that blockade of β3‐ARs by SR 59230A impaired the acquisition of the rotarod task with no effect on general locomotion. Since the parallel fiber–Purkinje cell (PF–PC) synapse is considered to be the main cerebellar locus of motor learning, we assessed β3‐AR modulatory action on this synapse as well as its expression in cerebellar slices. We demonstrate, for the first time, a strong expression of β3‐ARs on Purkinje cell soma and dendrites. In addition, whole‐cell patch‐clamp recordings revealed that bath application of β3‐AR agonist CL316,243 depressed the PF–PC excitatory postsynaptic currents via a postsynaptic mechanism mediated by the PI3K signaling pathway. Application of CL316,243 also interfered with the expression of PF long‐term potentiation, whereas SR 59230A prevented the induction of LTD at PF–PC synapse. These results underline the critical role of β3‐AR on cerebellar synaptic transmission and plasticity and provide a new mechanism for adrenergic modulation of motor learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Mechanisms underlying the enhancement of γ‐aminobutyric acid responses in the external globus pallidus of R6/2 Huntington’s disease model mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24710?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Mechanisms underlying the enhancement of γ‐aminobutyric acid responses in the external globus pallidus of R6/2 Huntington’s disease model mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f377046c-4556-4d82-b405-6d28b4ef52a9/jnr24710-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses evoked by selective stimulation of indirect pathway striatal neurons are increased in the external globus pallidus (GPe) of R6/2 mice. Using electrophysiology, optogenetics, immunohistochemistry and Western blots we demonstrate that GABA transporter, GAT‐3 function is reduced. This could explain increased decay time of evoked responses in the GPe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Huntington's disease (HD), the output of striatal indirect pathway medium‐sized spiny neurons (MSNs) is altered in its target region, the external globus pallidus (GPe). In a previous study we demonstrated that selective optogenetic stimulation of indirect pathway MSNs induced prolonged decay time of γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses in GPe neurons. Here we identified the mechanism underlying this alteration. Electrophysiological recordings in slices from symptomatic R6/2 and wildtype (WT) mice were used to evaluate, primarily, the effects of GABA transporter (GAT) antagonists on responses evoked by optogenetic activation of indirect pathway MSNs. In addition, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blots (WBs) were used to examine GAT‐3 expression in HD and WT mice. A GAT‐3 blocker (SNAP5114) increased decay time of GABA responses in WT and HD GPe neurons, but the effect was significantly greater in WT neurons. In contrast, a GAT‐1 antagonist (NO‐711) or a GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist (CGP 54626) produced small increases in decay time but no differential effects between genotypes. IHC and WBs showed reduction of GAT‐3 expression in the GPe of HD mice. Thus, reduced expression or dysfunction of GAT‐3 could underlie alterations of GPe responses to GABA inputs from striatum and could be a target for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Role of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptors in stroke prevention and therapy—The best is yet to come?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24709?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Role of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptors (PPARs) in the pathophysiology of stroke and protective effects of PPAR ligands have been widely investigated in the last 20 years. Activation of all three PPAR isoforms, but especially PPAR‐γ, was documented to limit postischemic injury in the numerous &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, as well as in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies. PPARs have been demonstrated to act on multiple mechanisms and were shown to activate multiple protective pathways related to inflammation, apoptosis, BBB protection, neurogenesis, and oxidative stress. The aim of this review was to summarize two decades of PPAR research in stroke with emphasis on &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; animal studies. We focus on each PPAR receptor separately and detail their implication in stroke. This review also discusses recent clinical efforts in the field and the epidemiological data with regard to role of PPAR polymorphisms in susceptibility to stroke, and tries to draw conclusions and describe future perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Melatonin alters neuronal architecture and increases cysteine‐rich protein 1 signaling in the male mouse hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24708?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Melatonin alters neuronal architecture and increases cysteine‐rich protein 1 signaling in the male mouse hippocampus&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0aec9295-07a8-415c-a143-0195472ed973/jnr24708-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exogenous melatonin significantly alters hippocampal neuronal micromorphometry, increases cysteine‐rich protein 1 (crp‐1) expression, and improves memory retention in mice. These findings expand our knowledge about the beneficial effects of melatonin on hippocampal neurons, and implicates alterations of structural neuroplasticity and crp‐1 upregulation as possible key players in this process of cognitive function improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuronal plasticity describes changes in structure, function, and connections of neurons. The hippocampus, in particular, has been shown to exhibit considerable plasticity regarding both physiological and morphological functions. Melatonin, a hormone released by the pineal gland, promotes cell survival and dendrite maturation of neurons in the newborn brain and protects against neurological disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of exogenous melatonin on neuronal architecture and its possible mechanism in the hippocampus of adult male C57BL/6 mice. Melatonin treatment significantly increased the total length and complexity of dendrites in the apical and basal &lt;i&gt;cornu ammonis&lt;/i&gt; (CA) 1 and in the dentate gyrus in mouse hippocampi. Spine density in CA1 apical dendrites was increased, but no significant differences in other subregions were observed. In primary cultured hippocampal neurons, the length and arborization of neurites were significantly augmented by melatonin treatment. Additionally, western blot and immunohistochemical analyses in both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; systems revealed significant increases in the level of cysteine‐rich protein 1 (crp‐1) protein, which is known to be involved in dendritic branching in mouse hippocampal neurons after melatonin treatment. Our results suggest that exogenous melatonin leads to significant alterations of neuronal micromorphometry in the adult hippocampus, possibly via crp‐1 signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Quantification of aromatase binding in the female human brain using [11C]cetrozole positron emission tomography</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Quantification of aromatase binding in the female human brain using [11C]cetrozole positron emission tomography&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f4a4bc0d-59f4-4b35-bfd4-0cdcf58e1084/jnr24707-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantification of the binding of [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole to aromatase in the brain is best done using the two‐tissue reversible compartment model, or the simplified reference tissue model with the cerebellum as reference region. Receptor parametric mapping and Logan reference tissue model are suitable for parametric mapping. One hour of data acquisition is sufficient for the quantification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aromatase, the enzyme that in the brain converts testosterone and androstenedione to estradiol and estrone, respectively, is a putative key factor in psychoneuroendocrinology. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; assessment of aromatase was performed to evaluate tracer kinetic models and optimal scan duration, for quantitative analysis of the aromatase positron emission tomography (PET) ligand [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole. Anatomical magnetic resonance and 90‐min dynamic [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole PET‐CT scans were performed on healthy women. Volume of interest (VOI)‐based analyses with a plasma‐input function were performed using the single‐tissue and two‐tissue (2TCM) reversible compartment models and plasma‐input Logan analysis. Additionally, the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), Logan reference tissue model (LRTM), and standardized uptake volume ratio model, with cerebellum as reference region, were evaluated. Parametric images were generated and regionally averaged voxel values were compared with VOI‐based analyses of the reference tissue models. The optimal reference model was used for evaluation of a decreased scan duration. Differences between the plasma‐input‐ and reference tissue‐based methods and comparisons between scan durations were assessed by linear regression. The [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole time–activity curves were best described by the 2TCM. SRTM nondisplaceable binding potential (BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt;), with cerebellum as reference region, can be used to estimate [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole binding and generated robust and quantitatively accurate results for a reduced scan duration of 60 min. Receptor parametric mapping, a basis function implementation of SRTM, as well as LRTM, produced quantitatively accurate parametric images, showing BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; at the voxel level. As PET tracer, [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole can be employed for relatively short brain scans to measure aromatase binding using a reference tissue‐based approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Reversal by Exendin‐4 treatment&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/950831d0-aede-4425-a43f-45442741700c/jnr24706-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insulin deficiency, rather than insulin resistance, induces AD‐like features in wild type and transgenic mice carrying amyloid β and tau genes. Treatment with Exendin‐4 ameliorates these features in an intervention paradigm when deficits were already present, reflecting the more likely scenario when patients will consult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological studies have pointed at diabetes as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and this has been supported by several studies in animal models of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, side‐by‐side comparison of the two types of diabetes is limited. We investigated the role of insulin deficiency and insulin resistance in the development of memory impairments and the effect of Exendin‐4 (Ex4) treatment in a mouse model of AD. Three–4‐month‐old female wild type (WT) mice and mice overexpressing human tau and amyloid precursor protein (TAPP) were injected with streptozotocin (STZ) or fed a high‐fat diet (HFD). A second study was performed in TAPP‐STZ mice treated with Ex4, a long‐lasting analog of GLP‐1. Plasma and brain were collected at study termination for ELISA, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry analysis. Learning and memory deficits were impaired in TAPP transgenic mice compared with WT mice at the end of the study. Deficits were exaggerated by insulin deficiency in TAPP mice but 12 weeks of insulin resistance did not affect memory performances in either WT or TAPP mice. Levels of phosphorylated tau were increased in the brain of WT‐STZ and TAPP‐STZ mice but not in the brain of WT or TAPP mice on HFD. In the TAPP‐STZ mice, treatment with Ex4 initiated after established cognitive deficits ameliorated learning, but not memory, impairments. This was accompanied by the reduction of amyloid β and phosphorylated tau expression. Theses studies support the role of Ex4 in AD, independently from its actions on diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Investigation of the effect of dietary intake of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on trauma‐induced white matter injury with quantitative diffusion MRI in mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/12ea5afd-5447-47db-be3d-5167b35c05db/jnr24705-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated potential neuroprotective effects of dietary omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on white matter damage following closed‐head injury in mice. While injured animals exhibited reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the optic tract and brachium compared to the uninjured animals, there was no evidence of neuroprotection from dietary omega‐3 PUFAs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies suggest that long‐term supplementation and dietary intake of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may have neuroprotective effects following brain injury. The objective of this study was to investigate potential neuroprotective effects of omega‐3 PUFAs on white matter following closed‐head trauma. The closed‐head injury model of engineered rotational acceleration (CHIMERA) produces a reproducible injury in the optic tract and brachium of the superior colliculus in mice. Damage is detectable using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, particularly fractional anisotropy (FA), with sensitivity comparable to histology. We acquired &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 38) and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 41) DTI data in mice divided into sham and CHIMERA groups with two dietary groups: one deficient in omega‐3 PUFAs and one adequate in omega‐3 PUFAs. We examined injury effects (reduction in FA) and neuroprotection (FA reduction modulated by diet) in the optic tract and brachium. We verified that diet did not affect FA in sham animals. In injured animals, we found significantly reduced FA in the optic tract and brachium (~10% reduction, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and Bayes factor analysis showed strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. However, Bayes factor analysis showed substantial evidence to accept the null hypothesis of no diet‐related FA differences in injured animals in the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; samples. Our results indicate no neuroprotective effect from adequate dietary omega‐3 PUFA intake on white matter damage following traumatic brain injury. Since damage from CHIMERA mainly affects white matter, our results do not necessarily contradict previous findings showing omega‐3 PUFA‐mediated neuroprotection in gray matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Neuroanatomy of transgender persons in a Non‐Western population and improving reliability in clinical neuroimaging</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neuroanatomy of transgender persons in a Non‐Western population and improving reliability in clinical neuroimaging&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9be9bef8-9612-4aeb-a0d6-c59db828e9df/jnr24702-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study assesses the reproducibility of previous neuroanatomical findings in Western transgender persons in a Non‐Western population. It then shows that repeating an anatomical MRI sequence can increase data reliability especially in brain regions that have previously been implicated to differ between transgender and cisgender persons. This &lt;i&gt;scan–rescan&lt;/i&gt; method might enhance the power of studies with small samples due to low prevalence of target population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the neuroanatomy of transgender persons is slowly being charted, findings are presently discrepant. Moreover, the major body of work has focused on Western populations. One important factor is the issue of power and low signal‐to‐noise (SNR) ratio in neuroimaging studies of rare study populations including endocrine or neurological patient groups. The present study focused on the structural neuroanatomy of a Non‐Western (Iranian) sample of 40 transgender men (TM), 40 transgender women (TW), 30 cisgender men (CM), and 30 cisgender women (CW), while assessing whether the reliability of findings across structural anatomical measures including gray matter volume (GMV), cortical surface area (CSA), and cortical thickness (CTh) could be increased by using two back‐to‐back within‐session structural MRI scans. Overall, findings in transgender persons were more consistent with sex assigned at birth in GMV and CSA, while no group differences emerged for CTh. Repeated measures analysis also indicated that having a second scan increased SNR in all regions of interest, most notably bilateral frontal poles, pre‐ and postcentral gyri and putamina. The results suggest that a simple time and cost‐effective measure to improve SNR in rare clinical populations with low prevalence rates is a second anatomical scan when structural MRI is of interest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Quantitative 7 Tesla MRI (susceptibility, relaxation, fractional anisotropy) found differences between ten Friedreich's ataxia patients and matched healthy controls in eight structures of brainstem and cerebellum which correlated with disease characteristics. Voxel‐based morphometry revealed white matter atrophy in partially overlapping volumes of interest (VOI) used for the VOI‐based evaluation. *Statistically significant differences between patients and controls; middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), pontine crossing tract (PCT), corticospinal tract (CS), medial lemniscus (ML), inferior cerebellar peduncle (ICP), superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), cerebral peduncle (CP), posterior thalamic radiation (PTR), sagittal stratum (SS), dentate nuclei (DN), red nuclei (RN), substantia nigra (SN).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a rare genetic disorder leading to degenerative processes. So far, no effective treatment has been found. Therefore, it is important to assist the development of medication with imaging biomarkers reflecting disease status and progress. Ten FRDA patients (mean age 37 ± 14 years; four female) and 10 age‐ and sex‐matched controls were included. Acquisition of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for quantitative susceptibility mapping, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; relaxometry and diffusion imaging was performed at 7 Tesla. Results of volume of interest (VOI)‐based analyses of the quantitative data were compared with a voxel‐based morphometry (VBM) evaluation. Differences between patients and controls were assessed using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) with age and sex as covariates, effect size of group differences, and correlations with disease characteristics with Spearman correlation coefficient. For the VBM analysis, a statistical threshold of 0.001 for uncorrected and 0.05 for corrected &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;‐values was used. Statistically significant differences between FRDA patients and controls were found in five out of twelve investigated structures, and statistically significant correlations with disease characteristics were revealed. Moreover, VBM revealed significant white matter atrophy within regions of the brainstem, and the cerebellum. These regions overlapped partially with brain regions for which significant differences between healthy controls and patients were found in the VOI‐based quantitative MRI evaluation. It was shown that two independent analyses provided overlapping results. Moreover, positive results on correlations with disease characteristics were found, indicating that these quantitative MRI parameters could provide more detailed information and assist the search for effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Central nervous system‐infiltrated immune cells induce calcium increase in astrocytes via astroglial purinergic signaling&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f4d5b155-7dba-48a1-bc0d-01dbf95a13a6/jnr24699-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application of the central nervous system (CNS)‐infiltrated immune cells induces a rapid increase in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in cultured naïve astrocytes through glial purinergic receptor‐mediated signaling. This provides an insight into the astroglial response to the immune cells in their local environment in CNS autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interaction between autoreactive immune cells and astroglia is an important part of the pathologic processes that fuel neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis. In this inflammatory disease, immune cells enter into the central nervous system (CNS) and they spread through CNS parenchyma, but the impact of these autoreactive immune cells on the activity pattern of astrocytes has not been defined. By exploiting naïve astrocytes in culture and CNS‐infiltrated immune cells (CNS IICs) isolated from rat with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), here we demonstrate previously unrecognized properties of immune cell–astrocyte interaction. We show that CNS IICs but not the peripheral immune cell application, evokes a rapid and vigorous intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase in astrocytes by promoting glial release of ATP. ATP propagated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevation through glial purinergic P2X7 receptor activation by the hemichannel‐dependent nucleotide release mechanism. Astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase is specifically triggered by the autoreactive CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cell application and these two cell types exhibit close spatial interaction in EAE. Therefore, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals may mediate a rapid astroglial response to the autoreactive immune cells in their local environment. This property of immune cell–astrocyte interaction may be important to consider in studies interrogating CNS autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The role of nucleus accumbens CREB attenuation in rescuing low voluntary running behavior in female rats&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3e1d9b59-c935-4f2e-9c9f-76ea3bbe3568/jnr24698-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) was evaluated for its role in physical activity motivation of wild‐type (WT) and low voluntary wheel‐running (LVR) rats. Elevated CREB activity has been associated with reward deficits and was found to be higher in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of LVR rats. Reducing NAc activity through Gi‐DREADDs, pharmacology (C646/SR11302), and environmental enrichment increased LVR wheel‐running behavior. These findings highlight a potential molecular pathway important for the motivation to be physically active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the integral role of nucleus accumbens (NAc) cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) activity in motivational processes, the goal of the current study was to determine whether blunting chronic NAc CREB activity could rescue the low physical activity motivation of female, low voluntary running (LVR) rats. NAc CREB phosphorylation is elevated in these rats, a state previously attributed to deficits in reward valuation. It was recently shown that overexpression of the upstream CREB inhibitor, protein kinase inhibitor alpha (PKIα), increased LVR nightly running by ~threefold. Therefore, the current study addresses the extent to which NAc CREB attenuation influences female LVR and wild‐type (WT) wheel‐running behavior. Inducible reductions in NAc neuronal activity using Gi‐coupled hM4Di DREADDs increased running behavior in LVR, but not in WT, rats. Similarly, site‐directed pharmacological inhibition of NAc CREB activity significantly increased LVR nightly running distance and time by ~twofold, with no effect in WT rats. Finally, environmentally enriched LVR rats exhibit higher levels of running compared to socially isolated rats in what appeared to be a CREB‐related manner. Considering the positive outcomes of upstream CREB modulation and environmental enrichment on LVR behavior, we believe that blunting NAc CREB activity has the neuromolecular potential to partially reverse low physical activity motivation, as exemplified by the LVR model. The positive physical activity outcome of early life enrichment adds translatable value to human childhood enrichment and highlights its importance on motivational processes later in life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Our population study found that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of plasma endothelial microvesicles (EMVs) and EMVs‐miR‐155 levels in ischemic stroke (IS) was 0.778 (sensitivity 85.9% and specificity 58%) and 0.851 (sensitivity 75% and specificity 81.2%), respectively, and AUC of their combination was 0.892 (sensitivity 75% and specificity 91.3%). Our study suggests that plasma EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 levels are promising biomarkers for IS. The diagnostic value of EMVs‐miR‐155 is higher and their combination is the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endothelial microvesicles (EMVs) could reflect the status of endothelial cells (ECs) which are involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke (IS). MiR‐155 could regulate EC functions. However, their roles in IS remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the levels of plasma EMVs and EMVs carrying miRNA‐155 (EMVs‐miR‐155) in IS patients to explore their potential roles as biomarkers. Ninety‐three IS patients and 70 controls were recruited in this study. The levels of circulating EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 were detected by fluorescence nanoparticle tracking analysis and quantitative real‐time PCR, respectively. The correlations between level of EMVs/EMVs‐miR‐155 and the onset time, severity, infarct volume, and subtypes of IS were analyzed. The severity and infarct volume were assessed by NIHSS and magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the risk factors of IS. The ROC curve and area under ROC curve (AUC) of EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 were determined. The levels of plasma EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 were increased significantly in acute and subacute stages of IS and remained unchanged in chronic stage, and were positively related to the infarct volume and NIHSS scores and were associated with large artery atherosclerosis and cardioembolism subtypes defined by Trial of Org 10 172 in acute stroke treatment (TOAST) classification. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that plasma EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 were significant and independent risk factors of IS and their AUC were 0.778 and 0.851, respectively, and increased to 0.892 after combination. Our study suggests that plasma EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 are promising biomarkers for IS. The diagnostic value of EMVs‐miR‐155 is higher and their combination is the best.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;CB1R knockout mice showed decreased neuronal dendritic arborization and changes in synaptic structure, as such as lower thickness of postsynaptic density and a reduction in synaptophysin levels in hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) modulates synaptic activity and is widely distributed in brain areas such as the hippocampus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and striatum, among others. CB1R is involved in processes such as memory, learning, motor coordination, and mood. Genetic deletion of CB1R causes behavioral alterations. In this work, we evaluated neuronal morphology and synaptic structure in the hippocampus of adult male CB1R knockout mice (CB1R&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;). Morphological changes in the CB1R&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; hippocampus evidenced a decrease in the expression of cytoskeletal proteins neurofilaments 160 KDa, neurofilaments 200 KDa, and microtubule‐associated protein 2. CA1 neurons showed decreased arborization and changes in synaptic structure such as lower thickness of postsynaptic density and a reduction in synaptophysin levels. Results obtained in the present work provide evidence of the participation of CB1R in the establishment of neuronal structure and networks that could have an important role in neuronal plasticity. In addition, these changes observed in CB1R&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; could be correlated with behavioral alterations reported.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Graphical representation of presented data also showing RhoGTPase regulators that localize to nascent synapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excitatory synapse formation begins in mid‐fetal gestation. However, due to our inability to image fetal synaptogenesis, the initial formation of synapses remains understudied. The recent development of human fetal brain spheroids provides access to this critical period of synapse formation. Using human neurons and brain spheroids, we address how altered actin regulation impacts the formation of excitatory synapses during fetal brain development. Prior to synapse formation, inhibition of RhoA kinase (ROCK) signaling promotes neurite elongation and branching. In addition to increasing neural complexity, ROCK inhibition increases the length of protrusions along the neurite, ultimately promoting excitatory synapse formation in human cortical brain spheroids. A corresponding increase in Rac1‐driven actin polymerization drives this increase in excitatory synaptogenesis. Using STORM super‐resolution microscopy, we demonstrate that actomyosin regulators, including the Rac1 regulator, α‐PIX, and the RhoA regulator, p115‐RhoGEF, localize to nascent excitatory synapses, where they preferentially localize to postsynaptic compartments. These results demonstrate that coordinated RhoGTPase activities underlie the initial formation of excitatory synapses and identify critical cytoskeletal regulators of early synaptogenic events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe and complex psychiatric disorder characterized by intense fear about weight gain and finalized to food‐related control behaviors. Growing interest has been demonstrated about neurobiological processes subtend to AN physiopathology. The present review aimed to collect neurostructural and neurofunctional available data from 2010 to 2019. Results have been organized according to the neuroimaging technique employed, also including a specific section on electroencephalographic results, mostly neglected in previous reviews. Diffuse cerebral vulnerability has been demonstrated and the contribution of several structures has been identified. Insula, cingulate cortex, parietal and frontal areas are primarily involved both by structural and functional perspectives. Moreover, consistent alterations in white matter integrity and brain electrical activity have been reported. Neuroimaging findings give a substantial contribution to AN pathophysiological description, also in order to understand altered but reversible processes in the passage from acute illness phase to disorder's remission, useful also for defining therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The corticostriatal pathway that carries sensory, motor, and limbic information to the striatum plays a critical role in motor control, action selection, and reward. Dysfunction of this pathway is associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Corticostriatal synapses have unique features in their cortical origins and striatal targets. In this review, we first describe axonal growth and synaptogenesis in the corticostriatal pathway during development, and then summarize the current understanding of the molecular bases of synaptic transmission and plasticity at mature corticostriatal synapses. Genes associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been implicated in axonal growth abnormalities, imbalance of the synaptic excitation/inhibition ratio, and altered long‐term synaptic plasticity in the corticostriatal pathway. Here, we review a number of ASD‐associated high‐confidence genes, including &lt;i&gt;FMR1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;KMT2A&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;GRIN2B&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SCN2A&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NLGN1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NLGN3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;MET&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CNTNAP2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;FOXP2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TSHZ3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SHANK3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PTEN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CHD8&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;RELN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;FOXP1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SYNGAP1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;NRXN&lt;/i&gt;, and discuss their relevance to proper corticostriatal function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key developmental milestone events of the human brain, such as neurogenesis, synapse formation, maturation, and plasticity, are determined by a myriad of molecular signaling events, including those mediated by a number of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and their cognate ligands. Aberrant or mistimed brain development and plasticity can lead to maladaptive changes, such as dysregulated synaptic connectivity and breakdown of circuit functions necessary for cognition and adaptive behaviors, which are hypothesized pathophysiologies of many neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we review recent literature that supports autism spectrum disorder as a likely result of aberrant synapse development due to &lt;i&gt;mistimed&lt;/i&gt; maturation and plasticity. We focus on MET RTK, a prominent genetic risk factor for autism, and discuss how a pleiotropic molecular signaling system engaged by MET exemplifies a genetic program that controls cortical circuit development and plasticity by modulating the anatomical and functional connectivity of cortical circuits, thus conferring genetic risk for neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The perceived color of a stimulus depends not only on its spectral
properties, but also on those of its surround. For instance, a patch that looks
gray on an achromatic surround appears reddish when surrounded by green, and
greenish when surrounded by red. Previous studies showed that the effect of the
surround is repulsive: It enhances the perceptual difference between stimulus
and surround. Here, we performed psychophysical experiments to quantify the
repulsion. To report the results, a notion of distance in color space was
required. We therefore proposed an individually tailored metric in color space
that captured the perceptual abilities of each observer. To define the metric,
we determined the minimal chromatic difference between a stimulus and its
surround required by each subject to detect the stimulus. Next, observers
performed discrimination experiments between two spatially localized stimuli
presented on a surround of a different chromaticity. The surround color
affected the discrimination thresholds. Quite remarkably, when these thresholds
were expressed in the color coordinates defined before, the change in
thresholds followed a simple law that only depended on the distance between the
surround and the two compared stimuli. Perceptual coordinates, hence, reveal
the symmetry of the repulsion effect. This finding was confirmed and modeled
with a third experiment, in which subjects were asked to match the color of two
stimuli surrounded by two different chromaticities.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical pyramidal neurons receive inputs from multiple distinct neural
populations and integrate these inputs in separate dendritic compartments. We
explore the possibility that cortical microcircuits implement Canonical
Correlation Analysis (CCA), an unsupervised learning method that projects the
inputs onto a common subspace so as to maximize the correlations between the
projections. To this end, we seek a multi-channel CCA algorithm that can be
implemented in a biologically plausible neural network. For biological
plausibility, we require that the network operates in the online setting and
its synaptic update rules are local. Starting from a novel CCA objective
function, we derive an online optimization algorithm whose optimization steps
can be implemented in a single-layer neural network with multi-compartmental
neurons and local non-Hebbian learning rules. We also derive an extension of
our online CCA algorithm with adaptive output rank and output whitening.
Interestingly, the extension maps onto a neural network whose neural
architecture and synaptic updates resemble neural circuitry and synaptic
plasticity observed experimentally in cortical pyramidal neurons.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual perception is critically influenced by the focus of attention. Due to
limited resources, it is well known that neural representations are biased in
favor of attended locations. Using concurrent eye-tracking and functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) recordings from a large cohort of human
subjects watching movies, we first demonstrate that leveraging gaze
information, in the form of attentional masking, can significantly improve
brain response prediction accuracy in a neural encoding model. Next, we propose
a novel approach to neural encoding by including a trainable soft-attention
module. Using our new approach, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn
visual attention policies by end-to-end learning merely on fMRI response data,
and without relying on any eye-tracking. Interestingly, we find that attention
locations estimated by the model on independent data agree well with the
corresponding eye fixation patterns, despite no explicit supervision to do so.
Together, these findings suggest that attention modules can be instrumental in
neural encoding models of visual stimuli.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, researchers have found time cells in the hippocampus that appear to
contain information about the timing of past events. Some researchers have
argued that time cells are taking a Laplace transform of their input in order
to reconstruct the past stimulus. We argue that stimulus prediction, not
stimulus reconstruction or redundancy reduction, is in better agreement with
observed responses of time cells. In the process, we introduce new analyses of
nonlinear, continuous-time reservoirs that model these time cells.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multi-modal neuroimaging projects are advancing our understanding of human
brain architecture, function, connectivity using high-quality non-invasive data
from many subjects. However, ground truth validation of connectivity using
invasive tracers is not feasible in humans. Our NonHuman Primate Neuroimaging &amp;amp;
Neuroanatomy Project (NHP_NNP) is an international effort (6 laboratories in 5
countries) to: (i) acquire and analyze high-quality multi-modal brain imaging
data of macaque and marmoset monkeys using protocols and methods adapted from
the HCP; (ii) acquire quantitative invasive tract-tracing data for cortical and
subcortical projections to cortical areas; and (iii) map the distributions of
different brain cell types with immunocytochemical stains to better define
brain areal boundaries. We are acquiring high-resolution structural,
functional, and diffusion MRI data together with behavioral measures from over
100 individual macaques and marmosets in order to generate non-invasive
measures of brain architecture such as myelin and cortical thickness maps, as
well as functional and diffusion tractography-based connectomes. We are using
classical and next-generation anatomical tracers to generate quantitative
connectivity maps based on brain-wide counting of labeled cortical and
subcortical neurons, providing ground truth measures of connectivity. Advanced
statistical modeling techniques address the consistency of both kinds of data
across individuals, allowing comparison of tracer-based and non-invasive
MRI-based connectivity measures. We aim to develop improved cortical and
subcortical areal atlases by combining histological and imaging methods.
Finally, we are collecting genetic and sociality-associated behavioral data in
all animals in an effort to understand how genetic variation shapes the
connectome and behavior.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Review and Analysis of Three Components of Differential Evolution Mutation Operator in MOEA/D-DE. (arXiv:2010.00265v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with a
differential evolution variation operator (MOEA/D-DE) shows high performance on
challenging multi-objective problems (MOPs). The DE mutation consists of three
key components: a mutation strategy, an index selection method for parent
individuals, and a bound-handling method. However, the configuration of the DE
mutation operator that should be used for MOEA/D-DE has not been thoroughly
investigated in the literature. This configuration choice confuses researchers
and users of MOEA/D-DE. To address this issue, we present a review of the
existing configurations of the DE mutation operator in MOEA/D-DE and
systematically examine the influence of each component on the performance of
MOEA/D-DE. Our review reveals that the configuration of the DE mutation
operator differs depending on the source code of MOEA/D-DE. In our analysis, a
total of 30 configurations (three index selection methods, two mutation
strategies, and five bound handling methods) are investigated on 16 MOPs with
up to five objectives. Results show that each component significantly affects
the performance of MOEA/D-DE. We also present the most suitable configuration
of the DE mutation operator, which maximizes the effectiveness of MOEA/D-DE.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multi-modal multi-objective optimization is to locate (almost) equivalent
Pareto optimal solutions as many as possible. Some evolutionary algorithms for
multi-modal multi-objective optimization have been proposed in the literature.
However, there is no efficient method for multi-modal many-objective
optimization, where the number of objectives is more than three. To address
this issue, this paper proposes a niching indicator-based multi-modal multi-
and many-objective optimization algorithm. In the proposed method, the fitness
calculation is performed among a child and its closest individuals in the
solution space to maintain the diversity. The performance of the proposed
method is evaluated on multi-modal multi-objective test problems with up to 15
objectives. Results show that the proposed method can handle a large number of
objectives and find a good approximation of multiple equivalent Pareto optimal
solutions. The results also show that the proposed method performs
significantly better than eight multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00041</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we present a supervised machine learning (ML) based
computational framework for designing particulate multifunctional composite
materials for desired thermal conductivity (TC). In this framework, the design
variables are physical descriptors of the material microstructure to link
microstructure to properties for material design. The design of experiment
(DoE) based on Sobol sequence was utilized to generate a sufficiently large
database for training ML models accurately. Microstructures were realized
through an efficient, fast packing algorithm, and the TC of microstructures
were obtained using our previous Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) homogenization
method. Thereafter, the ML methods constituting a reduced-order model (ROM) was
trained over the generated database to establish the complex relationship
between the structure and properties. Finally, the ROM is used for material
design through an optimization algorithm to solve the inverse problem of
finding the material with desired properties represented by its physical
descriptors. The results showed that the surrogate model is accurate in
predicting the behavior of microstructure with respect to high-fidelity FFT
simulations, and inverse design is robust in finding microstructure parameters
according to case studies.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01587</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01587</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, backpropagation through time inspired learning algorithms are
widely introduced into SNNs to improve the performance, which brings the
possibility to attack the models accurately given Spatio-temporal gradient
maps. We propose two approaches to address the challenges of gradient input
incompatibility and gradient vanishing. Specifically, we design a gradient to
spike converter to convert continuous gradients to ternary ones compatible with
spike inputs. Then, we design a gradient trigger to construct ternary gradients
that can randomly flip the spike inputs with a controllable turnover rate, when
meeting all zero gradients. Putting these methods together, we build an
adversarial attack methodology for SNNs trained by supervised algorithms.
Moreover, we analyze the influence of the training loss function and the firing
threshold of the penultimate layer, which indicates a &quot;trap&quot; region under the
cross-entropy loss that can be escaped by threshold tuning. Extensive
experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our solution.
Besides the quantitative analysis of the influence factors, we evidence that
SNNs are more robust against adversarial attack than ANNs. This work can help
reveal what happens in SNN attack and might stimulate more research on the
security of SNN models and neuromorphic devices.

Here, the authors identify insular hotspots of vulnerability to climate change (under RCPs 6.0 and 8.5) in mammals via a trait-based, quantitative vulnerability framework, finding that exposure to climate change is not a reliable proxy to assess species vulnerability, while sensitivity and adaptive capacity are crucial to understand vulnerability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/UX_2EmlBfIE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Intrathecal Injection of SIRT1-modified Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells Alleviates Neuropathic Pain in Rat</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Accumulating evidence has elucidated that human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) exert profound analgesic effects on numerous animal models of neuropathic pain, including drug-induced peripheral nerves, diabetes-induced neuropathy, and chronic constriction injury. We aimed to address whether forcing expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) can enhance the efficacy of hMSCs on alleviation of pain sensation. A rat model of chronic constriction injury (CCI) mimicking peripheral nerve injury was incorporated in the study. Paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and paw withdrawal latency (PWL) testing were used to measure pain-related behavior. Our results demonstrated that SIRT1 was decreased post-CCI surgery. Compared to hMSCs-control implantation, the hMSCs-SIRT1 (hMSCs overexpressing SIRT1) implantation exhibited superior effects on reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in serum and spinal dorsal horn, while ameliorating neuropathic pain in CCI rat. Engineering hMSCs such as overexpressing SIRT1 may serve as a promising strategy for the treatment of patients with neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Computational Neuroscience: A model for the transfer of control from the brain to the spinal cord through synaptic learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10827-020-00767-0</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The spinal cord is essential to the control of locomotion in legged animals and humans. However, the actual circuitry of the spinal controller remains only vaguely understood. Here we approach this problem from the viewpoint of learning. More precisely, we assume the circuitry evolves through the transfer of control from the brain to the spinal cord, propose a specific learning mechanism for this transfer based on the error between the cord and brain contributions to muscle control, and study the resulting structure of the spinal controller in a simplified neuromuscular model of human locomotion. The model focuses on the leg rebound behavior in stance and represents the spinal circuitry with 150 muscle reflexes. We find that after learning a spinal controller has evolved that produces leg rebound motions in the absence of a central brain input with only three structural reflex groups. These groups contain individual reflexes well known from physiological experiments but thought to serve separate purposes in the control of human locomotion. Our results suggest a more holistic interpretation of the role of individual sensory projections in spinal networks than is common. In addition, we discuss potential neural correlates for the proposed learning mechanism that may be probed in experiments. Together with such experiments, neuromuscular models of spinal learning likely will become effective tools for uncovering the structure and development of the spinal control circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: The Synapse Diversity Dilemma: Molecular Heterogeneity Confounds Studies of Synapse Function</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.590403</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.590403</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have shown an unexpectedly high degree of synapse diversity arising from molecular and morphological differences among individual synapses. Diverse synapse types are spatially distributed within individual dendrites, between different neurons, and across and between brain regions, producing the synaptome architecture of the brain. The spatial organization of synapse heterogeneity is important because the physiological activation of heterogeneous excitatory synapses produces a non-uniform spatial output of synaptic potentials, which confounds the interpretation of measurements obtained from population-averaging electrodes, optrodes and biochemical methods that lack single-synapse resolution. Population-averaging measurements cannot distinguish between changes in the composition of populations of synapses and changing synaptic physiology. Here we consider the implications of synapse diversity and its organization into synaptome architecture for studies of synapse physiology, plasticity, development and behavior, and for the interpretation of phenotypes arising from pharmacological and genetic perturbations. We conclude that prevailing models based on population-averaging measurements need reconsideration and that single-synapse resolution physiological recording methods are required to confirm or refute the major synaptic models of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography Reveals Distinct Retinal Structural and Microvascular Abnormalities in Cerebrovascular Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) is one of the leading global causes of death and severe disability. To date, retinal microangiopathy has become a reflection of cerebral microangiopathy, mirroring the vascular pathological modifications in vivo. To evaluate the retinal structure and microvasculature in patients with CeVD, we conducted a cross-sectional study in Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center and Department of Neurology of Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). CeVD patients (n = 121; 238 eyes) and healthy controls (n = 44; 57 eyes) were included in the analysis. The CeVD group showed significant thinning of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness in the temporal and nasal quadrants, and thinning of the macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) in the inferior quadrant, while macular microvasculature reduction was prominent in all nine quadrants. There were significant correlations between OCTA parameters, visual acuity, and transcranial doppler parameters in the CeVD group. The specific structural parameters combining microvasculature indices showed the best diagnostic accuracies (AUC = 0.918) to discriminate CeVD group from healthy controls. To conclude, we proved that OCTA reveals specific patterns of retinal structural changes and extensive macular microvascular changes in CeVD. Additionally, these retinal abnormalities could prove useful disease biomarkers in the management of individuals at high risk of debilitating complications from a cerebrovascular event.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) represents an enormous public health challenge currently and with increasing urgency in the coming decades. Our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of AD is rather incomplete, which is manifested in stagnated therapeutic developments. Apart from the well-established Amyloid Hypothesis of AD, gaining traction in recent years is the Pathogen Hypothesis, which postulates a causal role of infectious agents in the development of AD. Particularly, infection by viruses, among a diverse range of microorganisms, has been implicated. Recently, we described a prominent antiviral immune response in human AD brains as well as murine amyloid beta models, which has consequential effects on neuropathology. Such findings expectedly allude to the question about viral infections and AD. In this Perspective, we would like to discuss the molecular mechanism underlying the antiviral immune response, highlight how such pathway directly promotes AD pathogenesis, and depict a multilayered connection between antiviral immune response and other agents and factors relevant to AD. By tying together these threads of evidence, we provide a cohesive perspective on the uprising of antiviral immune response in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Cell Calcium Imaging as a Reliable Method to Study Neuron–Glial Circuits</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Complex dynamic cellular networks have been studied in physiological and pathological processes under the light of single-cell calcium imaging (SCCI), a method that correlates functional data based on calcium shifts operated by different intracellular and extracellular mechanisms integrated with their cell phenotypes. From the classic synaptic structure to tripartite astrocytic model or the recent quadripartite microglia added ensemble, as well as other physiological tissues, it is possible to follow how cells signal spatiotemporally to cellular patterns. This methodology has been used broadly due to the universal properties of calcium as a second messenger. In general, at least two types of receptor operate through calcium permeation: a fast-acting ionotropic receptor channel and a slow-activating metabotropic receptor, added to exchangers/transporters/pumps and intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release activated by messengers. These prototypes have gained an enormous amount of information in dynamic signaling circuits. SCCI has also been used as a method to associate phenotypic markers during development and stage transitions in progenitors, stem, vascular cells, neuro- and glioblasts, neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia that operate through ion channels, transporters, and receptors. Also, cancer cells or inducible cell lines from human organoids characterized by transition stages are currently being used to model diseases or reconfigure healthy cells in terms of the expression of calcium-binding/permeable molecules and shed light on therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: A Benchmark Dataset for RSVP-Based Brain–Computer Interfaces</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper reports on a benchmark dataset acquired with a brain–computer interface (BCI) system based on the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm. The dataset consists of 64-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 64 healthy subjects (sub1,…, sub64) while they performed a target image detection task. For each subject, the data contained two groups (“A” and “B”). Each group contained two blocks, and each block included 40 trials that corresponded to 40 stimulus sequences. Each sequence contained 100 images presented at 10 Hz (10 images per second). The stimulus images were street-view images of two categories: target images with human and non-target images without human. Target images were presented randomly in the stimulus sequence with a probability of 1∼4%. During the stimulus presentation, subjects were asked to search for the target images and ignore the non-target images in a subjective manner. To keep all original information, the dataset was the raw continuous data without any processing. On one hand, the dataset can be used as a benchmark dataset to compare the algorithms for target identification in RSVP-based BCIs. On the other hand, the dataset can be used to design new system diagrams and evaluate their BCI performance without collecting any new data through offline simulation. Furthermore, the dataset also provides high-quality data for characterizing and modeling event-related potentials (ERPs) and steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) in RSVP-based BCIs. The dataset is freely available from http://bci.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/download.html.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Micro Three-Dimensional Neuronal Cultures Generate Developing Cortex-Like Activity Patterns</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Studies aimed at neurological drug discovery have been carried out both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro cell culture models have showed potential as drug testing platforms characterized by high throughput, low cost, good reproducibility and ease of handling and observation. However, in vitro neuronal culture models are facing challenges in replicating in vivo-like activity patterns. This work reports an in vitro culture technique that is capable of producing micro three-dimensional (μ3D) cultures of only a few tens of neurons. The μ3D cultures generated by this method were uniform in size and density of neurons. These μ3D cultures had complex spontaneous synchronized neuronal activity patterns which were similar to those observed in the developing cortex and in much larger 3D cultures, but not in 2D cultures. Bursts could be reliably evoked by stimulation of single neurons. Synchronized bursts in μ3D cultures were abolished by inhibitors of glutamate receptors, while inhibitors of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors had a more complex effect. This pharmacological profile is similar to bursts in neonatal cortex. Since large numbers of reproducible μ3D cultures can be created and observed in parallel, this model of the developing cortex may find applications in high-throughput drug discovery experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A Novel Method for High-Dimensional Anatomical Mapping of Extra-Axial Cerebrospinal Fluid: Application to the Infant Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.561556</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) plays an essential role in early postnatal brain development. Extra-axial CSF (EA-CSF) volume, which is characterized by CSF in the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain, is a promising marker in the early detection of young children at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Previous studies have focused on global EA-CSF volume across the entire dorsal extent of the brain, and not regionally-specific EA-CSF measurements, because no tools were previously available for extracting local EA-CSF measures suitable for localized cortical surface analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the localized, cortical surface-based analysis of EA-CSF. The proposed processing framework combines probabilistic brain tissue segmentation, cortical surface reconstruction, and streamline-based local EA-CSF quantification. The quantitative analysis of local EA-CSF was applied to a dataset of typically developing infants with longitudinal MRI scans from 6 to 24 months of age. There was a high degree of consistency in the spatial patterns of local EA-CSF across age using the proposed methods. Statistical analysis of local EA-CSF revealed several novel findings: several regions of the cerebral cortex showed reductions in EA-CSF from 6 to 24 months of age, and specific regions showed higher local EA-CSF in males compared to females. These age-, sex-, and anatomically-specific patterns of local EA-CSF would not have been observed if only a global EA-CSF measure were utilized. The proposed methods are integrated into a freely available, open-source, cross-platform, user-friendly software tool, allowing neuroimaging labs to quantify local extra-axial CSF in their neuroimaging studies to investigate its role in typical and atypical brain development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Functional Integration Between the Two Brain Hemispheres: Evidence From the Homotopic Functional Connectivity Under Resting State</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00932</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional integration among neural units is one of the fundamental principles in brain organization that could be examined using resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC). Interhemispheric functional integration plays a critical role in human cognition. Homotopic functional connectivity (HoFC) under resting state provide an avenue to investigate functional integration between the two brain hemispheres, which can improve the present understanding of how interhemispheric interactions affect cognitive processing. In this review, we summarize the progress of HoFC studies under resting state and highlight how these findings have enhanced our understanding of interhemispheric functional organization of the human brain. Future studies are encouraged to address particular methodological issues and to further ascertain behavioral correlates, brain disease’s modulation, task influence, and genetic basis of HoFC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Hemodynamic Scaling of Task-Induced Signal Changes in Tumor Subjects</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.569463</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.569463</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: FMRI signal amplitude can change during stimulus presentation due to underlying neural function and hemodynamic responses limiting the accuracy of fMRI in pre-surgical planning. To account for these changes in fMRI activation signal, we used breath-hold tasks to mimic hemodynamic changes in brain tumor subjects and scaled the activation response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Motor and/or language fMRI was performed in 21 subjects with brain tumor. A breath-hold task was also performed in these subjects to obtain the hemodynamic response changes independent of neural changes. The task activation signals were calibrated on a voxel wise basis for all the subjects. Direct cortical stimulation was used to verify the scaled results of task-based fMRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: After scaling for the hemodynamic response function (HRF) on a voxel wise basis, the spatial extent of the scaled activation was more clustered together and appeared to minimize false positives. Similarly, accounting for the underlying canonical HRF, the percentage increase of active voxels after scaling had lower standard non-deviation suggesting that the activation response across voxels were more similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Although preliminary in nature, this study suggests that the variation in hemodynamic changes can be calibrated using breath-hold in brain tumor subjects and can also be used for other clinical cases where the underlying HRF has been altered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Crosstalk Between Autophagy and Ferroptosis and Its Putative Role in Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.577403</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autophagy is a conserved process to maintains homeostasis via the degradation of toxic cell contents, which can either promote cell survival or accelerate cellular demise. Ferroptosis is a recently discovered iron-dependent cell death pathway associated with the accumulation of lethal reactive lipid species. In the past few years, an increasing number of studies have suggested the crosstalk between autophagy and ferroptosis. Ischemic stroke is a complex brain disease regulated by several cell death pathways, including autophagy and ferroptosis. However, the potential links between autophagy and ferroptosis in ischemic stroke have not yet been explored. In this review, we briefly overview the mechanisms of ferroptosis and autophagy, as well as their possible connections in ischemic stroke. The elucidation of crosstalk between different cell death pathways may provide insight into new future ischemic stroke therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Patient-specific genomics and cross-species functional analysis implicate LRP2 in hypoplastic left heart syndrome</title>

	<description>Congenital heart diseases (CHDs), including hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), are genetically complex and poorly understood. Here, a multi-disciplinary platform was established to functionally evaluate novel CHD gene candidates, based on whole genome and iPSC RNA sequencing of a HLHS family-trio. Filtering for rare variants and altered expression in proband iPSCs prioritized 10 candidates. siRNA/RNAi-mediated knockdown in generic human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) and in developing &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;and zebrafish hearts revealed that LDL receptor-related protein &lt;i&gt;LRP2&lt;/i&gt; is required for cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation. Consistent with hypoplastic heart defects, compared to patents the proband's iPSC-CMs exhibited reduced proliferation. Interestingly, rare, predicted-damaging LRP2 variants were enriched in a HLHS cohort; however, understanding their contribution to HLHS requires further investigation. Collectively, we have established a multi-species high-throughput platform to rapidly evaluate candidate genes and their interactions during heart development, which are crucial first steps towards deciphering oligogenic underpinnings of CHDs, including maladaptive left hearts.</description>

	<title>eLife: GAS5 protects against osteoporosis by targeting UPF1/SMAD7 axis in osteoblast differentiation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.59079</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59079</link>
	<description>Osteoporosis is a common systemic skeletal disorder resulting in bone fragility and increased fracture risk. It is still necessary to explore its detailed mechanisms and identify novel targets for the treatment of osteoporosis. Previously, we found that a lncRNA named &lt;i&gt;GAS5&lt;/i&gt; in human could negatively regulate the lipoblast/adipocyte differentiation. However, it is still unclear whether &lt;i&gt;GAS5&lt;/i&gt; affects osteoblast differentiation and whether&lt;i&gt; GAS5 &lt;/i&gt;is associated with osteoporosis. Our current research found that &lt;i&gt;GAS5 &lt;/i&gt;was decreased in the bones and BMSCs, a major origin of osteoblast, of osteoporosis patients. Mechanistically,&lt;i&gt; GAS5&lt;/i&gt; promotes the osteoblast differentiation by interacting with UPF1 to degrade &lt;i&gt;SMAD7&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. Moreover, a decreased bone mass and impaired bone repair ability were observed in &lt;i&gt;Gas5&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice, manifesting in osteoporosis. The systemic supplement of &lt;i&gt;Gas5&lt;/i&gt;-overexpressing adenoviruses significantly ameliorated bone loss in an osteoporosis mouse model. In conclusion, &lt;i&gt;GAS5&lt;/i&gt; promotes osteoblast differentiation by targeting the UPF1/SMAD7 axis and protects against osteoporosis.</description>

	<title>eLife: Pathway-specific dysregulation of striatal excitatory synapses by LRRK2 mutations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58997</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58997</link>
	<description>LRRK2 is a kinase expressed in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs), cells which lose dopaminergic input in Parkinson’s disease (PD). R1441C and G2019S are the most common pathogenic mutations of LRRK2. How these mutations alter the structure and function of individual synapses on direct and indirect pathway SPNs is unknown and may reveal pre-clinical changes in dopamine-recipient neurons that predispose towards disease. Here, R1441C and G2019S knock-in mice enabled thorough evaluation of dendritic spines and synapses on pathway-identified SPNs. Biochemical synaptic preparations and super-resolution imaging revealed increased levels and altered organization of glutamatergic AMPA receptors in LRRK2 mutants. Relatedly, decreased frequency of miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents accompanied changes in dendritic spine nano-architecture, and single-synapse currents, evaluated using 2-photon glutamate uncaging. Overall, LRRK2 mutations reshaped synaptic structure and function, an effect exaggerated in R1441C dSPNs. These data open the possibility of new neuroprotective therapies aimed at SPN synapse function, prior to disease onset.</description>

	<title>eLife: Gli3 utilizes Hand2 to synergistically regulate tissue-specific transcriptional networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56450</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56450</link>
	<description>Despite a common understanding that Gli TFs are utilized to reiterate a Hh morphogen gradient, genetic analyses suggest craniofacial development does not completely fit this paradigm. Using the mouse model (&lt;i&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/i&gt;), we demonstrated that rather than being driven by a Hh threshold, robust Gli3 transcriptional activity during skeletal and glossal development required interaction with the basic helix-loop-helix TF Hand2. Not only did genetic and expression data support a co-factorial relationship, but genomic analysis revealed that Gli3 and Hand2 were enriched at regulatory elements for genes essential for mandibular patterning and development. Interestingly, motif analysis at sites co-occupied by Gli3 and Hand2 uncovered mandibular-specific, low-affinity, 'divergent' Gli binding motifs (&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;d&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;GBMs). Functional validation revealed these &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;d&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;GBMs conveyed synergistic activation of Gli targets essential for mandibular patterning and development. In summary, this work elucidates a novel, sequence-dependent mechanism for Gli transcriptional activity within the craniofacial complex that is independent of a graded Hh signal.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Interpretable multi-timescale models for predicting fMRI responses to continuous natural speech</title>

	<description>Natural language contains information at multiple timescales. To understand how the human brain represents this information, one approach is to build encoding mod- els that predict fMRI responses to natural language using representations extracted from neural network language models (LMs). However, these LM-derived repre- sentations do not explicitly separate information at different timescales, making it difficult to interpret the encoding models. In this work we construct interpretable multi-timescale representations by forcing individual units in an LSTM LM to integrate information over specific temporal scales. This allows us to explicitly and directly map the timescale of information encoded by each individual fMRI voxel. Further, the standard fMRI encoding procedure does not account for varying temporal properties in the encoding features. We modify the procedure so that it can capture both short- and long-timescale information. This approach outper- forms other encoding models, particularly for voxels that represent long-timescale information. It also provides a finer-grained map of timescale information in the human language pathway. This serves as a framework for future work investigating temporal hierarchies across artificial and biological language systems.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Genetic or toxicant induced disruption of vesicular monoamine storage and global metabolic profiling in  Caenorhabditis elegans</title>

	<description>The proper storage and release of monoamines contributes to a wide range of neuronal activity. Here, we examine the effects of altered vesicular monoamine transport in the nematode C. elegans. The gene cat-1 is responsible for the encoding of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) in C. elegans and is analogous to the mammalian vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). Our laboratory has previously shown that reduced VMAT2 activity confers vulnerability on catecholamine neurons in mice. The purpose of this paper was to determine whether this function is conserved and to determine the impact of reduced VMAT activity in C. elegans. Here we show that deletion of cat-1/VMAT increases sensitivity to the neurotoxicant 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) as measured by enhanced degeneration of dopamine neurons. Reduced cat-1/VMAT also induces changes in dopamine-mediated behaviors. High-resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomics in the whole organism reveals changes in amino acid metabolism, including tyrosine metabolism in the cat-1/VMAT mutants. Treatment with MPP+ disrupted tryptophan metabolism. Both conditions altered glycerophospholipid metabolism, suggesting a convergent pathway of neuronal dysfunction. Our results demonstrate the evolutionarily conserved nature of monoamine function in C. elegans and further suggest that HRMS-based metabolomics can be used in this model to study environmental and genetic contributors to complex human disease</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: White matter microstructural changes in short-term learning of a continuous visuomotor sequence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.324004v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Efficient neural transmission is crucial for optimal brain function, yet the plastic potential of white matter (WM) has long been overlooked. Growing evidence now shows that modifications to axons and myelin occur not only as a result of long-term learning, but also after short training periods. Motor sequence learning (MSL), a common paradigm used to study neuroplasticity, occurs in overlapping learning stages and different neural circuits are involved in each stage. However, most studies investigating short-term WM plasticity have used a pre-post design, in which the temporal dynamics of changes across learning stages cannot be assessed. In this study, we used multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at 7 Tesla to investigate changes in WM in a group learning a complex visuomotor sequence (LRN) and in a control group (SMP) performing a simple sequence, for 5 consecutive days. Consistent with behavioral results, where most improvements occurred between the two first days, structural changes in WM were observed only in the early phase of learning (d1-d2), and in overall learning (d1-d5). In LRNs, WM microstructure was altered in the tracts underlying the primary motor and sensorimotor cortices. Moreover, our structural findings in WM were related to changes in functional connectivity, assessed with resting-state functional MRI data in the same cohort, through analyses in regions of interest (ROIs). Significant changes in WM microstructure were found in a ROI underlying the right supplementary motor area. Together, our findings provide evidence for highly dynamic WM plasticity in the sensorimotor network during short-term MSL.</description>

	<description>Humans can make abstract choices independent of motor actions. However, little is known about the functional role and neural representation of abstract choices. Here, we show that in the human brain choices are represented in an abstract, motor-independent manner, even when they are directly linked to an action. To disentangle sensory, choice, and motor aspects of decision-making, we measured MEG signals while human participants made choices with known and unknown motor response mapping. Using multivariate decoding, we found stimulus, choice and response information with distinct cortical distributions. Choice representations were invariant to whether or not the response mapping was known during stimulus presentation. Furthermore, neuronal choice representations predicted decision confidence and occupied distinct representational spaces from both stimulus and motor signals. Our results uncover abstract neuronal choice signals that generalize to embodied decisions. This suggests a general role of an abstract stage in human decision-making.</description>

	<description>Synaptic incorporation and removal of AMPA receptors is highly regulated to modulate the strength of synaptic transmission for long-term synaptic plasticity during brain development and associative learning. PSD-932 and PSD-95, two paralogs of the DLG-MAGUK protein family of signaling scaffolds govern the synaptic incorporation and stabilization of AMPA receptors opposingly, with PSD-95 promoting and PSD-932 inhibiting it. The associated signaling mechanisms that control the synaptic incorporation and stabilization remain elusive. Here, we used domain swapping between the antagonizing signaling scaffolds to identify the protein motifs responsible for enhancing synaptic AMPA receptors and the associated signaling protein. We narrowed down multiple motifs in the N-terminal domain that are principally responsible for governing the enhancement by Src. Specific activation and inhibiting peptides revealed continuous activity of Src. Together, the results depict a mutual dependence of Src and PSD-95 in enhancing and maintaining synaptic AMPA receptors.</description>

	<description>An essential step toward understanding brain function is to establish a cellular-resolution structural framework upon which multi-scale and multi-modal information spanning molecules, cells, circuits and systems can be integrated and interpreted. Here, through a collaborative effort from the Brain Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN), we derive a comprehensive cell typebased description of one brain structure - the primary motor cortex upper limb area (MOp-ul) of the mouse. Applying state-of-the-art labeling, imaging, computational, and neuroinformatics tools, we delineated the MOp-ul within the Mouse Brain 3D Common Coordinate Framework (CCF). We defined over two dozen MOp-ul projection neuron (PN) types by their anterograde targets; the spatial distribution of their somata defines 11 cortical sublayers, a significant refinement of the classic notion of cortical laminar organization. We further combine multiple complementary tracing methods (classic tract tracing, cell type-based anterograde, retrograde, and transsynaptic viral tracing, high-throughput BARseq, and complete single cell reconstruction) to systematically chart cell type-based MOp input-output streams. As PNs link distant brain regions at synapses as well as host cellular gene expression, our construction of a PN type resolution MOp-ul wiring diagram will facilitate an integrated analysis of motor control circuitry across the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. This work further provides a roadmap towards a cellular resolution description of mammalian brain architecture.</description>

	<description>With training older adults can improve balance control, but the time course and neural mechanisms underlying these improvements are unclear. We studied changes in balance (robustness and performance), as well as in H-reflex gains, paired reflex depression (PRD) and co-contraction duration (CCI) in ankle muscles after short-term (1 session; STT) and long-term (3 weeks; LTT) balance training in 22 older adults. Mediolateral balance robustness during unipedal stance (time to balance loss in unipedal standing on a robotic platform with decreasing rotational stiffness) improved (33%) after STT, with no further improvement after LTT. Balance performance (mean absolute mediolateral center of mass velocity) improved (18.75%) after STT in perturbed unipedal standing and after LTT (18.18%) in unperturbed unipedal standing. CCI of soleus/tibialis anterior did not change after STT but increased (16%) after LTT. H-reflex gain and PRD excitability did not change with training. Cross-correlations showed that H-reflex gains in unipedal stance were lower and CCI was higher in participants with a more robust balance at the last time-point measurement and, CCI was higher in participants with better balance performance at several time-points. However, changes in robustness and performance were uncorrelated with changes in CCI, H-reflex gain, or PRD. Our results indicate that balance robustness improves over a single session, while balance performance improves more gradually over multiple sessions.

	<description>To navigate the social world, humans must represent social entities, and the relationships between those entities, starting with the spatial relationships. Recent research suggests that two bodies are processed with particularly high efficiency in visual perception, when they are in a spatial positioning that cues interaction, i.e. close and face-to-face. Socially relevant spatial relations such as facingness may facilitate visual perception by triggering grouping of bodies into a new integrated percept, which would make the stimuli more visible and easier to process. We used electroencephalography and a frequency-tagging paradigm to measure a neural correlate of grouping (or visual binding), while female and male participants saw images of two bodies face-to-face or back-to-back. The two bodies in a dyad flickered at the frequencies F1 and F2, respectively, and appeared together at a third frequency Fd (dyad frequency). This stimulation should elicit a periodic neural response for each single body at F1 and F2, and a third response at Fd, which would be larger for face-to-face (vs. back-to-back) bodies, if those stimuli yield additional integrative processing. Results showed that responses at F1 and F2 were higher for upright than for inverted bodies, demonstrating that our paradigm could capture body-specific activity. Crucially, the response to dyads at Fd was larger for face-to-face (vs. back-to-back) dyads, suggesting integration mediated by grouping. Thus, spatial relations that recur in social interaction (i.e., facingness) may promote binding of multiple bodies into a new representation. This mechanism can explain how the visual system contributes to integrating and transforming the representation of disconnected individual body-shapes into structured representations of social events.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Aberrant ventral dentate gyrus structure and function in individuals susceptible to post-traumatic stress disorder</title>

	<description>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder vulnerable individuals can develop following a traumatic event, whereas others are resilient. Enhanced insight into the mechanistic underpinnings contributing to these inter-individual differences in PTSD susceptibility is key to improved treatment and prevention. Aberrant function of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) may contribute to its psychopathology, with the dorsal DG potentially encoding trauma memory generalization and the ventral DG anxiety. Using a mouse model, we investigated the association between deviant DG structure and function and susceptibility to develop PTSD-like symptoms following trauma. Mice were exposed to a traumatic event (unpredictable, inescapable foot shocks) and tested for PTSD symptomatology following recovery. In three independent experiments, DG neuronal morphology, synaptic protein gene expression and neuronal activity during trauma encoding and recall were assessed. Behaviorally, PTSD-like animals displayed some increased anxiety-like behavior already prior to trauma, increased novelty-induced freezing, but no clear differences in remote trauma memory recall. Comparison of the ventral DG of PTSD-like vs resilient mice revealed lower spine density, reduced expression of the postsynaptic protein homer 1b/c gene, a larger population of neurons active during trauma encoding and a greater presence of somatostatin neurons to be associated with PTSD susceptibility. In contrast, the dorsal DG of PTSD-like animals did not differ in terms of spine density or gene expression, but displayed more active neurons during trauma encoding and a lower amount of somatostatin neurons. These data propose a critical role for -mainly the ventral- DG in establishing symptomatology addressed in this PTSD model.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Intrusive Experiences In Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: Treatment Response Induces Changes In The Effective Connectivity Of The Anterior Insula</title>

	<description>IntroductionOne of the core features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is reexperiencing the trauma. Th anterior insula (AI) was proposed to play a crucial role in these intrusive experiences. However, the dynamic function of the AI in reexperiencing trauma, as well as its putative modulation by effective therapy, still need to be specified.

MethodsThirty PTSD patients were enrolled and exposed to chemo-facilitated traumatic memory reactivation therapy. Resting-state fMRI scans were acquired before and after treatment. To explore AI directed influences over the rest of the brain, we referred to a mixed-model using pre/post Granger causality analysis seeded on the AI as a within-subject factor and treatment response as a between-subject factor. To further identify correlates of reexperiencing trauma, we investigated how intrusive severity affected : (i) causality maps and (ii) the spatial stability of other intrinsic brain networks.

ResultsWe observed dynamic changes in AI effective connectivity in PTSD patients. Many within- and between-network causal paths were found to be less influenced by the AI after effective therapy. Insular influences were found positively correlated with flashback severity, while reexperiencing was linked with a stronger default mode network (DMN) and more unstable central executive network (CEN) connectivity.

DiscussionWe showed that directed changes in AI signalling to the DMN and CEN at rest may underlie the degree of intrusive symptoms in PTSD. A positive response to treatment further induced changes in network-to-network anticorrelated patterns. Such findings may guide targeted neuromodulation strategies in PTSD patients not suitably improved by conventional treatment.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Differential inhibition of GABA release from mouse hippocampal interneuron subtypesby the volatile anesthetic isoflurane</title>

	<description>General anesthesia is critical to modern medicine and animal research, but the cellular and molecular actions of general anesthetics on the central nervous system remain poorly understood. Volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane disrupt synaptic transmission and inhibit synaptic vesicle release in a neurotransmitter-selective manner. For example, GABA release from interneurons is less sensitive to isoflurane inhibition than are glutamate or dopamine release. Hippocampal and cortical interneuron subpopulations have diverse neurophysiological and synaptic properties, and their individual subtype-specific responses to isoflurane are unknown. We used live-cell optical imaging of exocytosis using fluorescent biosensors expressed in transgenic mouse hippocampal neuron cultures to delineate interneuron subtypespecific effects of isoflurane on synaptic vesicle exocytosis. We found that a clinically relevant concentration of isoflurane (0.5 mM) differentially modulated action potential-mediated exocytosis from GABAergic interneurons: parvalbumin-expressing interneurons were inhibited to 83.1plus-or-minus sign11.7% of control, whereas somatostatin-expressing and interneurons glutamatergic neurons were inhibited to 58.6plus-or-minus sign13.3% and 64.5plus-or-minus sign8.5% of control, respectively. The role of presynaptic voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav) subtype expression in determining isoflurane sensitivity was probed by overexpression or knockdown of specific Nav subtypes, which have distinct sensitivities to isoflurane and are differentially expressed between glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. We found that the sensitivity of exocytosis to isoflurane was determined by the relative expression of Nav1.1 (associated with lower sensitivity) and Nav1.6 (associated with higher sensitivity). Thus the selective effects of isoflurane on synaptic vesicle exocytosis from hippocampal interneuron subtypes is determined by synaptic diversity in the relative expression of Nav1.1 and Nav1.6.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jack Pattee, Wei Pan&lt;/p&gt;

Polygenic scores quantify the genetic risk associated with a given phenotype and are widely used to predict the risk of complex diseases. There has been recent interest in developing methods to construct polygenic risk scores using summary statistic data. We propose a method to construct polygenic risk scores via penalized regression using summary statistic data and publicly available reference data. Our method bears similarity to existing method LassoSum, extending their framework to the Truncated Lasso Penalty (TLP) and the elastic net. We show via simulation and real data application that the TLP improves predictive accuracy as compared to the LASSO while imposing additional sparsity where appropriate. To facilitate model selection in the absence of validation data, we propose methods for estimating model fitting criteria AIC and BIC. These methods approximate the AIC and BIC in the case where we have a polygenic risk score estimated on summary statistic data and no validation data. Additionally, we propose the so-called quasi-correlation metric, which quantifies the predictive accuracy of a polygenic risk score applied to out-of-sample data for which we have only summary statistic information. In total, these methods facilitate estimation and model selection of polygenic risk scores on summary statistic data, and the application of these polygenic risk scores to out-of-sample data for which we have only summary statistic information. We demonstrate the utility of these methods by applying them to GWA studies of lipids, height, and lung cancer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yMeWG-JLNWc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

As continued COVID-19 disruption looks likely across the world, perhaps until 2021, contingency plans are evolving in case of further disruption in the 2020–2021 academic year. This includes delivering face-to-face programs fully online for at least part of the upcoming academic year for new and continuing cohorts. This temporary pivot will necessitate distance teaching and learning across almost every conceivable pedagogy, from fundamental degrees to professionally accredited ones. Each institution, program, and course will have its own myriad of individualized needs; however, there is a common question that unites us all: how do we provide teaching and assessment to students in a manner that is accessible, fair, equitable, and provides the best learning whilst acknowledging the temporary nature of the pivot? No “one size fits all” solution exists, and many of the choices that need to be made will be far from simple; however, this paper provides a starting point and basic principles to facilitate discussions taking place around the globe by balancing what we know from the pedagogy of online learning with the practicalities imposed by this crisis and any future crises.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/e9Z_LqD26FY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Models of SIV rebound after treatment interruption that involve multiple reactivation events</title>

In order to assess the efficacy of novel HIV-1 treatments leading to a functional cure, the time to viral rebound is frequently used as a surrogate endpoint. The longer the time to viral rebound, the more efficacious the therapy. In support of such an approach, mathematical models serve as a connection between the size of the latent reservoir and the time to HIV-1 rebound after treatment interruption. The simplest of such models assumes that a single successful latent cell reactivation event leads to observable viremia after a period of exponential viral growth. Here we consider a generalization developed by Pinkevych &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. and Hill &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. of this simple model in which multiple reactivation events can occur, each contributing to the exponential growth of the viral load. We formalize and improve the previous derivation of the dynamics predicted by this model, and use the model to estimate relevant biological parameters from SIV rebound data. We confirm a previously described effect of very early antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation on the rate of recrudescence and the viral load growth rate after treatment interruption. We find that every day ART initiation is delayed results in a 39% increase in the recrudescence rate (95% credible interval: [18%, 62%]), and a 11% decrease of the viral growth rate (95% credible interval: [4%, 20%]). We show that when viral rebound occurs early relative to the viral load doubling time, a model with multiple successful reactivation events fits the data better than a model with only a single successful reactivation event.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cZno1WDWtqo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The combination of bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing data of the same tumor enables the inference of high-fidelity phylogenies that form the input to many important downstream analyses in cancer genomics. While many studies simultaneously perform bulk and single-cell sequencing, some studies have analyzed initial bulk data to identify which mutations to target in a follow-up single-cell sequencing experiment, thereby decreasing cost. Bulk data provide an additional untapped source of valuable information, composed of candidate phylogenies and associated clonal prevalence. Here, we introduce PhyDOSE, a method that uses this information to strategically optimize the design of follow-up single cell experiments. Underpinning our method is the observation that only a small number of clones uniquely distinguish one candidate tree from all other trees. We incorporate distinguishing features into a probabilistic model that infers the number of cells to sequence so as to confidently reconstruct the phylogeny of the tumor. We validate PhyDOSE using simulations and a retrospective analysis of a leukemia patient, concluding that PhyDOSE’s computed number of cells resolves tree ambiguity even in the presence of typical single-cell sequencing errors. We also conduct a retrospective analysis on an acute myeloid leukemia cohort, demonstrating the potential to achieve similar results with a significant reduction in the number of cells sequenced. In a prospective analysis, we demonstrate the advantage of selecting cells to sequence across multiple biopsies and that only a small number of cells suffice to disambiguate the solution space of trees in a recent lung cancer cohort. In summary, PhyDOSE proposes cost-efficient single-cell sequencing experiments that yield high-fidelity phylogenies, which will improve downstream analyses aimed at deepening our understanding of cancer biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yp0s25yvZoM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Contributing to broader impacts is an important aspect of scientific research. Engaging practicing K–12 teachers as part of a research project can be an effective approach for addressing broader impacts requirements of grants, while also advancing researcher and teacher professional growth. Our focus is on leveraging teachers’ professional expertise to develop science education materials grounded in emerging scientific research. In this paper, we describe ten simple rules for planning, implementing, and evaluating teacher engagement to support the broader impact goals of your research project. These collaborations can lead to the development of instructional materials or activities for students in the classroom or provide science research opportunities for teachers. We share our successes and lessons learned while collaborating with high school biology teachers to create technology-based, instructional materials developed from basic biological research. The rules we describe are applicable across teacher partnerships at any grade level in that they emphasize eliciting and respecting teachers’ professionalism and expertise.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/r-dFiGtlm1Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Demographics of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce and student body in the US and Europe continue to show severe underrepresentation of Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC). Among the documented causes of the persistent lack of diversity in STEM are bias, discrimination, and harassment of members of underrepresented minority groups (URMs). These issues persist due to continued marginalization, power imbalances, and lack of adequate policies against misconduct in academic and other scientific institutions. All scientists can play important roles in reversing this trend by shifting the culture of academic workplaces to intentionally implement equitable and inclusive policies, set norms for acceptable workplace conduct, and provide opportunities for mentorship and networking. As scientists are increasingly acknowledging the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in science, there is a need for clear direction on how to take antiracist action. Here we present 10 rules to help labs develop antiracists policies and action in an effort to promote racial and ethnic diversity, equity, and inclusion in science.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hkcDpMKWOWY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A genotype imputation method for de-identified haplotype reference information by using recurrent neural network</title>

Genotype imputation estimates the genotypes of unobserved variants using the genotype data of other observed variants based on a collection of haplotypes for thousands of individuals, which is known as a haplotype reference panel. In general, more accurate imputation results were obtained using a larger size of haplotype reference panel. Most of the existing genotype imputation methods explicitly require the haplotype reference panel in precise form, but the accessibility of haplotype data is often limited, due to the requirement of agreements from the donors. Since de-identified information such as summary statistics or model parameters can be used publicly, imputation methods using de-identified haplotype reference information might be useful to enhance the quality of imputation results under the condition where the access of the haplotype data is limited. In this study, we proposed a novel imputation method that handles the reference panel as its model parameters by using bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN). The model parameters are presented in the form of de-identified information from which the restoration of the genotype data at the individual-level is almost impossible. We demonstrated that the proposed method provides comparable imputation accuracy when compared with the existing imputation methods using haplotype datasets from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) and the Haplotype Reference Consortium. We also considered a scenario where a subset of haplotypes is made available only in de-identified form for the haplotype reference panel. In the evaluation using the 1KGP dataset under the scenario, the imputation accuracy of the proposed method is much higher than that of the existing imputation methods. We therefore conclude that our RNN-based method is quite promising to further promote the data-sharing of sensitive genome data under the recent movement for the protection of individuals’ privacy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/evfPJ-IpVhw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Metabolic inference from genomic sequence information is a necessary step in determining the capacity of cells to make a living in the world at different levels of biological organization. A common method for determining the metabolic potential encoded in genomes is to map conceptually translated open reading frames onto a database containing known product descriptions. Such gene-centric methods are limited in their capacity to predict pathway presence or absence and do not support standardized rule sets for automated and reproducible research. Pathway-centric methods based on defined rule sets or machine learning algorithms provide an adjunct or alternative inference method that supports hypothesis generation and testing of metabolic relationships within and between cells. Here, we present mlLGPR, &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;ulti-&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;abel based on &lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;ogistic re&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;ression for &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;athway p&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;ediction, a software package that uses supervised multi-label classification and rich pathway features to infer metabolic networks in organismal and multi-organismal datasets. We evaluated mlLGPR performance using a corpora of 12 experimental datasets manifesting diverse multi-label properties, including manually curated organismal genomes, synthetic microbial communities and low complexity microbial communities. Resulting performance metrics equaled or exceeded previous reports for organismal genomes and identify specific challenges associated with features engineering and training data for community-level metabolic inference.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fVk9wRrKtV8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: tACS entrains neural activity while somatosensory input is blocked</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Pedro G. Vieira, Matthew R. Krause, Christopher C. Pack&lt;/p&gt;

Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) modulates brain activity by passing electrical current through electrodes that are attached to the scalp. Because it is safe and noninvasive, tACS holds great promise as a tool for basic research and clinical treatment. However, little is known about how tACS ultimately influences neural activity. One hypothesis is that tACS affects neural responses directly, by producing electrical fields that interact with the brain’s endogenous electrical activity. By controlling the shape and location of these electric fields, one could target brain regions associated with particular behaviors or symptoms. However, an alternative hypothesis is that tACS affects neural activity indirectly, via peripheral sensory afferents. In particular, it has often been hypothesized that tACS acts on sensory fibers in the skin, which in turn provide rhythmic input to central neurons. In this case, there would be little possibility of targeted brain stimulation, as the regions modulated by tACS would depend entirely on the somatosensory pathways originating in the skin around the stimulating electrodes. Here, we directly test these competing hypotheses by recording single-unit activity in the hippocampus and visual cortex of alert monkeys receiving tACS. We find that tACS entrains neuronal activity in both regions, so that cells fire synchronously with the stimulation. Blocking somatosensory input with a topical anesthetic does not significantly alter these neural entrainment effects. These data are therefore consistent with the direct stimulation hypothesis and suggest that peripheral somatosensory stimulation is not required for tACS to entrain neurons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VtB0bViwC7g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine the association between cerebellar hemorrhage (CBH) size and location and preschool‐age neurodevelopment in very preterm neonates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preterm magnetic resonance images of 221 very preterm neonates (median gestational age = 27.9 weeks) were manually segmented for CBH quantification and location. Neurodevelopmental assessments at chronological age 4.5 years included motor (Movement Assessment Battery for Children, 2nd Edition [MABC‐2]), visuomotor integration (Beery‐Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual‐Motor Integration, 6th Edition), cognitive (Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scale of Intelligence, 3rd Edition), and behavioral (Child Behavior Checklist) outcomes. Multivariable linear regression models examined the association between CBH size and 4.5‐year outcomes accounting for sex, gestational age, and supratentorial injury. Probabilistic maps assessed CBH location and likelihood of a lesion to predict adverse outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐six neonates had CBH: 14 (6%) with only punctate CBH and 22 (10%) with ≥1 larger CBH. CBH occurred mostly in the inferior aspect of the posterior lobes. CBH total volume was independently associated with MABC‐2 motor scores at 4.5 years (β = −0.095, 95% confidence interval = −0.184 to −0.005), with a standardized β coefficient (−0.16) that was similar to that of white matter injury volume (standardized β = −0.22). CBH size was similarly associated with visuomotor integration and externalizing behavior but not cognition. Voxelwise odds ratio and lesion‐symptom maps demonstrated that CBH extending more deeply into the cerebellum predicted adverse motor, visuomotor, and behavioral outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBH size and location on preterm magnetic resonance imaging were associated with reduced preschool motor and visuomotor function and more externalizing behavior independent of supratentorial brain injury in a dose‐dependent fashion. The volumetric quantification and localization of CBH, even when punctate, may allow opportunity to improve motor and behavioral outcomes by providing targeted intervention.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper models the dynamics of a large set of interacting neurons within
the framework of statistical field theory. We use a method initially developed
in the context of statistical field theory [44] and later adapted to complex
systems in interaction [45][46]. Our model keeps track of individual
interacting neurons dynamics but also preserves some of the features and goals
of neural field dynamics, such as indexing a large number of neurons by a space
variable. Thus, this paper bridges the scale of individual interacting neurons
and the macro-scale modelling of neural field theory.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since around 2000, it has been considered that elitist evolutionary
multi-objective optimization algorithms (EMOAs) always outperform non-elitist
EMOAs. This paper revisits the performance of non-elitist EMOAs for
bi-objective continuous optimization when using an unbounded external archive.
This paper examines the performance of EMOAs with two elitist and one
non-elitist environmental selections. The performance of EMOAs is evaluated on
the bi-objective BBOB problem suite provided by the COCO platform. In contrast
to conventional wisdom, results show that non-elitist EMOAs with particular
crossover methods perform significantly well on the bi-objective BBOB problems
with many decision variables when using the unbounded external archive. This
paper also analyzes the properties of the non-elitist selection.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently authors have introduced the idea of training discrete weights neural
networks using a mix between classical simulated annealing and a replica ansatz
known from the statistical physics literature. Among other points, they claim
their method is able to find robust configurations. In this paper, we analyze
this so-called &quot;replicated simulated annealing&quot; algorithm. In particular, we
explicit criteria to guarantee its convergence, and study when it successfully
samples from configurations. We also perform experiments using synthetic and
real data bases.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A Framework to Handle Multi-modal Multi-objective Optimization in Decomposition-based Evolutionary Algorithms. (arXiv:2009.14700v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multi-modal multi-objective optimization is to locate (almost) equivalent
Pareto optimal solutions as many as possible. While decomposition-based
evolutionary algorithms have good performance for multi-objective optimization,
they are likely to perform poorly for multi-modal multi-objective optimization
due to the lack of mechanisms to maintain the solution space diversity. To
address this issue, this paper proposes a framework to improve the performance
of decomposition-based evolutionary algorithms for multi-modal multi-objective
optimization. Our framework is based on three operations: assignment, deletion,
and addition operations. One or more individuals can be assigned to the same
subproblem to handle multiple equivalent solutions. In each iteration, a child
is assigned to a subproblem based on its objective vector, i.e., its location
in the objective space. The child is compared with its neighbors in the
solution space assigned to the same subproblem. The performance of improved
versions of six decomposition-based evolutionary algorithms by our framework is
evaluated on various test problems regarding the number of objectives, decision
variables, and equivalent Pareto optimal solution sets. Results show that the
improved versions perform clearly better than their original algorithms.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14695</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ensemble approaches introduced in the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)
literature mainly come from methods that relies on data sampling procedures,
under the assumption that the training data are heterogeneously enough to set
up diverse base learners. To overcome this assumption, it was proposed an ELM
ensemble method based on the Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) framework,
called Negative Correlation Extreme Learning Machine (NCELM). This model works
in two stages: i) different ELMs are generated as base learners with random
weights in the hidden layer, and ii) a NCL penalty term with the information of
the ensemble prediction is introduced in each ELM minimization problem,
updating the base learners, iii) second step is iterated until the ensemble
converges.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this NCL ensemble method was validated by an experimental study with
multiple benchmark datasets, no information was given on the conditions about
this convergence. This paper mathematically presents the sufficient conditions
to guarantee the global convergence of NCELM. The update of the ensemble in
each iteration is defined as a contraction mapping function, and through Banach
theorem, global convergence of the ensemble is proved.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: An Online Learning Algorithm for a Neuro-Fuzzy Classifier with Mixed-Attribute Data. (arXiv:2009.14670v1 [cs.LG])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14670</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;General fuzzy min-max neural network (GFMMNN) is one of the efficient
neuro-fuzzy systems for data classification. However, one of the downsides of
its original learning algorithms is the inability to handle and learn from the
mixed-attribute data. While categorical features encoding methods can be used
with the GFMMNN learning algorithms, they exhibit a lot of shortcomings. Other
approaches proposed in the literature are not suitable for on-line learning as
they require entire training data available in the learning phase. With the
rapid change in the volume and velocity of streaming data in many application
areas, it is increasingly required that the constructed models can learn and
adapt to the continuous data changes in real-time without the need for their
full retraining or access to the historical data. This paper proposes an
extended online learning algorithm for the GFMMNN. The proposed method can
handle the datasets with both continuous and categorical features. The
extensive experiments confirmed superior and stable classification performance
of the proposed approach in comparison to other relevant learning algorithms
for the GFMM model.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Automated per-instance algorithm selection and configuration have shown
promising performances for a number of classic optimization problems, including
satisfiability, AI planning, and TSP. The techniques often rely on a set of
features that measure some characteristics of the problem instance at hand. In
the context of black-box optimization, these features have to be derived from a
set of $(x,f(x))$ samples. A number of different features have been proposed in
the literature, measuring, for example, the modality, the separability, or the
ruggedness of the instance at hand. Several of the commonly used features,
however, are highly correlated. While state-of-the-art machine learning
techniques can routinely filter such correlations, they hinder explainability
of the derived algorithm design techniques.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We therefore propose in this work to pre-process the measured (raw) landscape
features through representation learning. More precisely, we show that a linear
dimensionality reduction via matrix factorization significantly contributes
towards a better detection of correlation between different problem instances
-- a key prerequisite for successful automated algorithm design.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The main goal of the multitasking optimization paradigm is to solve multiple
and concurrent optimization tasks in a simultaneous way through a single search
process. For attaining promising results, potential complementarities and
synergies between tasks are properly exploited, helping each other by virtue of
the exchange of genetic material. This paper is focused on Evolutionary
Multitasking, which is a perspective for dealing with multitasking optimization
scenarios by embracing concepts from Evolutionary Computation. This work
contributes to this field by presenting a new multitasking approach named as
Coevolutionary Variable Neighborhood Search Algorithm, which finds its
inspiration on both the Variable Neighborhood Search metaheuristic and
coevolutionary strategies. The second contribution of this paper is the
application field, which is the optimal partitioning of graph instances whose
connections among nodes are directed and weighted. This paper pioneers on the
simultaneous solving of this kind of tasks. Two different multitasking
scenarios are considered, each comprising 11 graph instances. Results obtained
by our method are compared to those issued by a parallel Variable Neighborhood
Search and independent executions of the basic Variable Neighborhood Search.
The discussion on such results support our hypothesis that the proposed method
is a promising scheme for simultaneous solving community detection problems
over graphs.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Strategy and Benchmark for Converting Deep Q-Networks to Event-Driven Spiking Neural Networks. (arXiv:2009.14456v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14456</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have great potential for energy-efficient
implementation of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on dedicated neuromorphic
hardware. Recent studies demonstrated competitive performance of SNNs compared
with DNNs on image classification tasks, including CIFAR-10 and ImageNet data.
The present work focuses on using SNNs in combination with deep reinforcement
learning in ATARI games, which involves additional complexity as compared to
image classification. We review the theory of converting DNNs to SNNs and
extending the conversion to Deep Q-Networks (DQNs). We propose a robust
representation of the firing rate to reduce the error during the conversion
process. In addition, we introduce a new metric to evaluate the conversion
process by comparing the decisions made by the DQN and SNN, respectively. We
also analyze how the simulation time and parameter normalization influence the
performance of converted SNNs. We achieve competitive scores on 17
top-performing Atari games. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first
to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple Atari games with SNNs. Our
work serves as a benchmark for the conversion of DQNs to SNNs and paves the way
for further research on solving reinforcement learning tasks with SNNs.

	<title>The Cerebellum: Spinocerebellar Ataxia-Like Presentation of the M233V PSEN1 Mutation</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; gene is considered to be the most common gene, which is responsible for the development of an autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease with early onset and sometimes broad phenotype. We present a patient with a spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-like phenotype who was found to carry an M233V mutation. General and neurological exam was carried out. Brain MRI as well as genetic testing for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 17 were performed. The patient was then referred for a next-generation sequencing-based gene panel test with 723 genes included. A 26-year-old man of an Azerbaijani origin presented with a progressive impairment of coordination followed by memory impairment. Family history was positive for a similar disorder suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance. Brain MRI showed bilateral hippocampal atrophy (more pronounced in the left), as well as mild atrophy of the left temporoparietal cortex. Tests for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 17 came negative. Gene panel test showed c.697A &amp;gt; G heterozygous variant in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; gene leading to a M233V amino acid change, which was validated by a Sanger sequencing. So far, M233V mutation has not been associated with a combination of cerebellar and cognitive features at onset. Our case contributes to a better characterization of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; mutations and expands the phenotype of the M233V carriers. We propose to consider &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; mutations in patients presenting with an SCA-like phenotype but negative for common types of SCA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A prompt diagnosis and treatment of patients with autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (CA) with antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-Abs) may lead to a better prognosis. Herein, we report prodromal transient neurological symptoms that should raise clinical suspicion of CA with GAD-Abs. We initially identified a 70-year-old man who presented a first acute episode of vertigo, diplopia, and ataxia lasting 2 weeks. Two months later, he experienced a similar episode along with new-onset gaze-evoked nystagmus. After 4 months, downbeat nystagmus, left limb dysmetria, and gait ataxia progressively appeared, and an autoimmune CA was diagnosed based on the positivity of GAD-Abs in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We searched retrospectively for similar presentations in a cohort of 31 patients diagnosed with CA and GAD-Abs. We found 11 (35.4%) patients (all women, median age 62 years; 8/11 [72.7%] with autoimmune comorbidities) with transient neurological symptoms antedating CA onset by a median of 3 months, including vertigo in 9 (81.8%; described as paroxysmal in 8) and fluctuating diplopia in 3 (27.3%) patients. The identification of transient neurological symptoms of unknown etiology, such as paroxysmal vertigo and fluctuating diplopia, should lead to GAD-Abs testing in serum and CSF, especially in patients with autoimmune comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by storage of unesterified glycolipids and cholesterol in lysosome. NPC’s clinical presentation is highly heterogeneous, depending on the time of onset. It encompasses visceral, neurological, and/or psychiatric manifestations. As the motor findings are so important and devastating in this disease, there is a lack of description about non-motor symptoms, even though they play important role in quality of life of NPC patients. We described the most common non-motor findings in NPC like cognitive dysfunction, neuroimaging, psychiatric symptoms, sleep disorders, seizures, hearing problems, respiratory and other systemic features, bladder and fecal dysfunction, hypersalivation, and malnutrition. In this review, we highlighted the importance of these undervalued symptoms and their management. Specific measures of all aforementioned clinical features may work as relevant biomarkers in order to evaluate successful therapies in future clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Upward Gaze Palsy: a Valuable Sign to Distinguish Spinocerebellar Ataxias</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01154-2</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) represent a large group of heredodegenerative diseases, with great phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity. However, in the clinical neurological practice, some symptoms and signs might help differentiate the SCAs. This study’s aims were to evaluate the frequency of upward gaze palsy (UGP) and investigate its role in assisting in the clinical differentiation of SCAs. We included 419 patients with SCAs (248 with SCA3, 95 with SCA10, 38 with SCA2, 22 with SCA1, 12 with SCA7, and 4 with SCA6). This study compared UGP with other known markers of disease severity—age of onset, disease duration, SARA score, and size of CAG expansion, and also other semiologic features, as bulging eyes. This sign was significantly more prevalent in SCA3 (64.11%), compared with SCA10 (3.16%; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and other SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA7–11.84%; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). UGP showed very high sensibility ins SCA3 (92.9), although lacking of specificity (64.1%). The odds ratio (OR) of UGP were also very high, 23.52 (95% CI 12.38–44.69), and was significantly correlated with larger CAG expansions, age, and disease duration in SCA3 patients, but not with age of onset or severity of the ataxic syndrome. This study showed that UGP is highly suggestive of SCA3 and has high sensitivity for the differential diagnosis among SCAs, and it could be of great value for bedside semiologic tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Communication difficulties have considerable impact on people with progressive ataxia, yet there are currently no evidence-based treatments. LSVT LOUD® focuses on the production of healthy vocal loudness whilst also improving breath support, vocal quality, loudness and articulation in participating patients. This study aimed to investigate whether Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD®) can improve communication effectiveness in these patients. We performed a rater-blinded, single-arm study investigating LSVT LOUD® treatment in a population of patients with progressive ataxia including Friedreich’s ataxia (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 18), spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1), idiopathic cerebellar ataxia (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1), and spastic paraplegia 7 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1). Twenty-one patients were recruited to the study, with 19 completing treatment. Sessions were administered via Skype in the LSVT-X format, meaning two sessions per week over a period of 8 weeks. Assessments included two baseline and two post-treatment measures and focused on outcome measures covering aspects ranging from physiological function to impact and participation. Results indicate improvements in patient-perceived outcomes for 14 of the 19 participants, in both speech and psychosocial domains. Speech data furthermore demonstrate significant improvements in prolonged vowel duration, and voice quality measures. Intelligibility and naturalness evaluations showed no change post-treatment. Patients reported high acceptability of the treatment itself, as well as administration by Skype. This is the largest treatment study for people with progressive ataxia published to date. It provides an indication that LSVT LOUD® can have a positive impact on communication in this patient group and could form the basis for larger-scale trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Treatment of Primary Autoimmune Cerebellar Ataxia with Mycophenolate</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01152-4</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Immune-mediated ataxias account for a substantial number of sporadic otherwise idiopathic ataxias. Despite some well-characterised entities such as paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration where diagnostic markers exist, the majority of immune ataxias remained undiagnosed and untreated. We present here our experience in the treatment of suspected primary autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (PACA) using mycophenolate. All patients reported attend the Sheffield Ataxia Centre on a regular basis and had undergone extensive investigations, including genetic testing using next-generation sequencing, with other causes of ataxia excluded. The diagnosis of PACA was strongly suspected based on investigations, pattern of disease progression, and cerebellar involvement. Patients were treated with mycophenolate and monitored using MR spectroscopy of the cerebellar vermis. Thirty patients with PACA are reported here. Of these, 22 received mycophenolate (group 1). The remaining 8 were not on treatment (group 2-control group). Out of the 22 treated patients, 4 underwent serial MR spectroscopy prior to starting treatment and thus were used as controls making the total number of patients in the control group 12. The mean change of the MRS within the vermis (NAA/Cr area ratio) in the treatment group was + 0.144 ± 0.09 (improved) and in the untreated group − 0.155 ± 0.06 (deteriorated). The difference was significant. We also demonstrated a strong correlation between the spectroscopy and the SARA score. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of mycophenolate in the treatment of PACA. The results suggest that immune-mediated ataxias are potentially treatable, and that there is a need for early diagnosis to prevent permanent neurological deficit. The recently published diagnostic criteria for PACA would hopefully aid the diagnosis and treatment of this entity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Acoustic Speech Analytics Are Predictive of Cerebellar Dysfunction in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01151-5</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Speech production relies on motor control and cognitive processing and is linked to cerebellar function. In diseases where the cerebellum is impaired, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), speech abnormalities are common and can be detected by instrumental assessments. However, the potential of speech assessments to be used to monitor cerebellar impairment in MS remains unexplored. The aim of this study is to build an objectively measured speech score that reflects cerebellar function, pathology and quality of life in MS. Eighty-five people with MS and 21 controls participated in the study. Speech was independently assessed through objective acoustic analysis and blind expert listener ratings. Cerebellar function and overall disease disability were measured through validated clinical scores; cerebellar pathology was assessed via magnetic resonance imaging, and validated questionnaires informed quality of life. Selected speech variables were entered in a regression model to predict cerebellar function. The resulting model was condensed into one composite speech score and tested for prediction of abnormal 9-hole peg test (9HPT), and for correlations with the remaining cerebellar scores, imaging measurements and self-assessed quality of life. Slow rate of syllable repetition and increased free speech pause percentage were the strongest predictors of cerebellar impairment, complemented by phonatory instability. Those variables formed the acoustic composite score that accounted for 54% of variation in cerebellar function, correlated with cerebellar white matter volume (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.3, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p =&lt;/em&gt; 0.017), quality of life (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.5, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and predicted an abnormal 9HPT with 85% accuracy. An objective multi-feature speech metric was highly representative of motor cerebellar impairment in MS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Trehalose in Machado-Joseph Disease: Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01150-6</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01150-6</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is relatively prevalent among the Yemenite Jewish subpopulation living in Israel. Currently, there is no treatment able to modify the disease progression. Trehalose is a disaccharide with protein-stabilizing and autophagy-enhancing properties. In animal models of MJD, trehalose showed reduction of cerebellar lesion size and improved motor function. This study was designed to be a proof-of-concept, phase 2 study lasting 6 to 12 months, to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of weekly IV administration of 15 g or 30 g 10% trehalose solution in 14 MJD patients. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, which were assessed by various clinical and laboratory tests. Secondary endpoints were changes in the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score, Neurological Examination Score for Spinocerebellar Ataxia (NESSCA), time to do 9-hole peg test (9HPT), time to do 8-meter walk (8MW), and quality of life assessed by the World Health Organization Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-BREF (WHOQoL-BREF). Trehalose was well tolerated, and no serious drug-related adverse events were noted. The average SARA score, NESSCA, and time to do 9HPT and 8MW and the WHOQoL-BREF for all patients remained stable at 6 months. Six patients received treatment for as long as 12 months and continued to remain stable on all the above tests. IV trehalose seems to be safe in humans and probably effective to stabilize neurological impairment in MJD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: EMG Rectification Is Detrimental for Identifying Abnormalities in Corticomuscular and Intermuscular Coherence in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01149-z</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Corticomuscular and intermuscular coherence (CMC, IMC) reflect connectivity between neuronal activity in the motor cortex measured by electroencephalography (EEG) and muscular activity measured by electromyography (EMG), or between activity in different muscles, respectively. There is an ongoing debate on the appropriateness of EMG rectification prior to coherence estimation. This work examines the effects of EMG rectification in CMC and IMC estimation in 20 spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) patients, 16 prodromal SCA2 gene mutation carriers, and 26 healthy controls during a repetitive upper or lower limb motor task. Coherence estimations were performed using the non-rectified raw EMG signal vs. the rectified EMG signal. EMG rectification decreases the level of significance of lower beta-frequency band CMC and IMC values in SCA2 patients and prodromal SCA2 mutation carriers vs. healthy controls, and also results in overall lower coherence values. EMG rectification is detrimental for beta-frequency band CMC and IMC estimation. One likely reason for this effect is distortion of coherence estimation in high-frequency signals, where the level of amplitude cancelation is high.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The cerebellum plays a critical role in promoting learning of new motor tasks, which is an essential function for motor recovery. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the cerebellum can be used to enhance learning. In this study, we investigated the effects of cerebellar intermittent theta burst stimulation (c-iTBS), a high-frequency rTMS protocol, on visuo-motor learning in a sample of hemiparetic patients due to recent stroke in the territory of the contralateral middle cerebral artery. Eight stroke patients were enrolled for the purposes of the study in the chronic stage of recovery (i.e., at least 6 months after stroke). In two sessions, Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with real or sham c-iTBS applied over the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the affected body side. c-iTBS was applied immediately before the learning phase of a visuo-motor adaptation task. Real, but not sham, c-iTBS improved visuo-motor learning as revealed by an increased performance in of the learning phase of the visuo-moto adaptation task. Moreover, we also found that real but not sham c-iTBS induced a sustained improvement in the re-adaptation of the recently learned skill (i.e., when patients were re-tested after 30 min). Taken together, these data point to c-iTBS as a potential novel strategy to promote motor learning in patients with stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Chromosomal Microarray Analysis Has a Poor Diagnostic Yield in Children with Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability When Concurrent Cerebellar Anomalies Are Present</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Chromosomal microarray analysis is commonly used as screening test for children with neurodevelopmental issues, also in case of complex neurological phenotypes. Developmental delay/intellectual disability is a common presentation sign in pediatric ataxias, diseases with high clinical and genetic heterogeneity. In order to determine the diagnostic yield of Array-CGH in such conditions, all the tests performed in the last 10-year activity of a single referral center in children who present, besides the neurodevelopmental impairment, cerebellar abnormalities have been systematically gathered. The study demonstrates that, except for Dandy-Walker malformation or poly-malformative phenotypes, chromosomal microarray analysis should be discouraged as first-line diagnostic test in pediatric ataxias with neurodevelopmental disability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We sought to assess structural and functional patterns of cerebellum in multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type), and investigate the associations of structural and functional cerebellar gray matter abnormalities. We collected magnetic resonance imaging data of 18 patients with multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type) and 18 health control subjects. The gray matter loss across the motor and cognitive cerebellar territories in patients was assessed using voxel-based morphometry. And change in the connectivity between the cerebellum and large-scale cortical networks was assessed using resting-state functional MRI analysis. Furthermore, we assessed the relationship between the extent of cerebellar atrophy and reduced-activation in the cerebellar-cortical and subthalamo-cerebellar functional connectivities. We confirmed the gray matter loss across the motor and cognitive cerebellar territories in patients and found that the extent of cerebellar atrophy was correlated with decreased connectivity between the cerebellum and large-scale cortical networks, including the default, frontal parietal, and sensorimotor networks. The volume reduction in the motor cerebellum was closely associated with the clinical motor severity. A post hoc analysis showed reduced-activation in the subthalamo-cerebellar functional connectivity without the subthalamic nucleus atrophy. These results emphasized significant atrophy in the cerebellar subsystem and its association with the large-scale cortical networks in multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type), which may improve our understanding of the neural pathophysiology mechanisms of disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Are Vermal Lobules VI–VII Smaller in Autism Spectrum Disorder?</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar volume, in particular vermal lobule areas VI–VII, have been extensively researched in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), although findings are often unclear. The aim of the present study is to consolidate all existing cerebellar and age data of individuals with ASD, and compare this data to typically developing (TD) controls. Raw data, or the means and standard deviations of cerebellar volume and age, were obtained from 17 studies (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellum&lt;/sub&gt;: 421 ASD and 370 TD participants; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VI–VII&lt;/sub&gt;: 506 ASD and 290 TD participants). Total cerebellar volume, or VI–VII area, was plotted against age and lines of fit of ASD and TD data were compared. Mean differences in cerebellar volume and VI–VII area between participants with ASD and TD participants were then compared via ANCOVA analyses. Findings revealed multiple differences in VI–VII area between participants with ASD and TD participants below 18 years of age. Additionally, cerebellar volume was greater in males with ASD than TD males between 2 and 4 years. In the present study, cerebellar volume and VI–VII area show different rates of change across age for those with autism compared with those without. These morphological differences provide a neurobiological justification to investigate related behavioural correlates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Shh-Mediated Increase in β-Catenin Levels Maintains Cerebellar Granule Neuron Progenitors in Proliferation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01138-2</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) give rise to the cerebellar granule neurons in the developing cerebellum. Generation of large number of these neurons is made possible by the high proliferation rate of CGNPs in the external granule layer (EGL) in the dorsal cerebellum. Here, we show that upregulation of β-catenin can maintain murine CGNPs in a state of proliferation. Further, we show that β-catenin mRNA and protein levels can be regulated by the mitogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Shh signaling led to an increase in the level of the transcription factor N-myc. N-myc was found to bind the β-catenin promoter, and the increase in β-catenin mRNA and protein levels could be prevented by blocking N-myc upregulation downstream of Shh signaling. Furthermore, blocking Wingless-type MMTV integration site (Wnt) signaling by Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor Dickkopf 1 (Dkk-1) in the presence of Shh did not prevent the upregulation of β-catenin. We propose that in culture, Shh signaling regulates β-catenin expression through N-myc and results in increased CGNP proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Rapidly (and Successfully) Translating Novel Brain Radiotracers From Animal Research Into Clinical Use</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The advent of preclinical research scanners for in vivo imaging of small animals has added confidence into the multi-step decision-making process of radiotracer discovery and development. Furthermore, it has expanded the utility of imaging techniques available to dissect clinical questions, fostering a cyclic interaction between the clinical and the preclinical worlds. Significant efforts from medicinal chemistry have also made available several high-affinity and selective compounds amenable for radiolabeling, that target different receptors, transporters and enzymes in vivo. This substantially increased the range of applications of molecular imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). However, the process of developing novel radiotracers for in vivo imaging of the human brain is a multi-step process that has several inherent pitfalls and technical difficulties, which often hampers the successful translation of novel imaging agents from preclinical research into clinical use. In this paper, the process of radiotracer development and its relevance in brain research is discussed; as well as, its pitfalls, technical challenges and future promises. Examples of successful and unsuccessful translation of brain radiotracers will be presented.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Exploring the Benefits of Doll Play Through Neuroscience</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It has long been hypothesized that pretend play is beneficial to social and cognitive development. However, there is little evidence regarding the neural regions that are active while children engage in pretend play. We examined the activation of prefrontal and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) regions using near-infrared spectroscopy while 42 4- to 8-year-old children freely played with dolls or tablet games with a social partner or by themselves. Social play activated right prefrontal regions more than solo play. Children engaged the pSTS during solo doll play but not during solo tablet play, suggesting they were rehearsing social cognitive skills more with dolls. These findings suggest social play utilizes multiple neural regions and highlight how doll play can achieve similar patterns of activation, even when children play by themselves. Doll play may provide a unique opportunity for children to practice social interactions important for developing social-emotional skills, such as empathy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Methodological Problems With Online Concussion Testing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.509091</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.509091</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reaction time testing is widely used in online computerized concussion assessments, and most concussion studies utilizing the metric have demonstrated varying degrees of difference between concussed and non-concussed individuals. The problem with most of these online concussion assessments is that they predominantly rely on consumer grade technology. Typical administration of these reaction time tests involves presenting a visual stimulus on a computer monitor and prompting the test subject to respond as quickly as possible via keypad or computer mouse. However, inherent delays and variabilities are introduced to the reaction time measure by both computer and associated operating systems that the concussion assessment tool is installed on. The authors hypothesized systems that are typically used to collect concussion reaction time data would demonstrate significant errors in reaction time measurements. To remove human bias, a series of experiments was conducted robotically to assess timing errors introduced by reaction time tests under four different conditions. In the first condition, a visual reaction time test was conducted by flashing a visual stimulus on a computer monitor. Detection was via photodiode and mechanical response was delivered via computer mouse. The second condition employed a mobile device for the visual stimulus, and the mechanical response was delivered to the mobile device's touchscreen. The third condition simulated a tactile reaction time test, and mechanical response was delivered via computer mouse. The fourth condition also simulated a tactile reaction time test, but response was delivered to a dedicated device designed to store the interval between stimulus delivery and response, thus bypassing any problems hypothesized to be introduced by computer and/or computer software. There were significant differences in the range of responses recorded from the four different conditions with the reaction time collected from visual stimulus on a mobile device being the worst and the device with dedicated hardware designed for the task being the best. The results suggest that some of the commonly used visual tasks on consumer grade computers could be (and have been) introducing significant errors for reaction time testing and that dedicated hardware designed for the reaction time task is needed to minimize testing errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Vicarious reward unblocks associative learning about novel cues in male rats</title>

	<description>Many species, including rats, are sensitive to social signals and their valuation is important in social learning. Here we introduce a task that investigates if mutual reward delivery in male rats can drive associative learning. We found that when actor rats have fully learned a stimulus-self-reward association, adding a cue that predicted additional reward to a partner unblocked associative learning about this cue. By contrast, additional cues that did not predict partner reward remained blocked from acquiring positive associative value. Importantly, this social unblocking effect was still present when controlling for secondary reinforcement but absent when social information exchange was impeded, when mutual reward outcomes were disadvantageously unequal to the actor or when the added cue predicted reward delivery to an empty chamber. Taken together, these results suggest that mutual rewards can drive associative learning in rats and is dependent on vicariously experienced social and food-related cues.</description>

	<title>eLife: Myogenin is an essential regulator of adult myofibre growth and muscle stem cell homeostasis</title>

	<description>Growth and maintenance of skeletal muscle fibres depend on coordinated activation and return to quiescence of resident muscle stem cells (MuSCs). The transcription factor Myogenin (Myog) regulates myocyte fusion during development, but its role in adult myogenesis remains unclear. In contrast to mice, &lt;i&gt;myog&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; zebrafish are viable, but have hypotrophic muscles. By isolating adult myofibres with associated MuSCs we found that &lt;i&gt;myog&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; myofibres have severely reduced nuclear number, but increased myonuclear domain size. Expression of fusogenic genes is decreased, Pax7 upregulated, MuSCs are fivefold more numerous and mis-positioned throughout the length of &lt;i&gt;myog&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; myofibres instead of localising at myofibre ends as in wild-type. Loss of Myog dysregulates mTORC1 signalling, resulting in an 'alerted' state of MuSCs, which display precocious activation and faster cell cycle entry ex vivo, concomitant with &lt;i&gt;myod&lt;/i&gt; upregulation. Thus, beyond controlling myocyte fusion, Myog influences the MuSC:niche relationship, demonstrating a multi-level contribution to muscle homeostasis throughout life.</description>

	<title>eLife: Dynamically evolving novel overlapping gene as a factor in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic</title>

	<description>Understanding the emergence of novel viruses requires an accurate and comprehensive annotation of their genomes. Overlapping genes (OLGs) are common in viruses and have been associated with pandemics, but are still widely overlooked. We identify and characterize &lt;i&gt;ORF3d&lt;/i&gt;, a novel OLG in SARS-CoV-2 that is also present in Guangxi pangolin-CoVs but not other closely related pangolin-CoVs or bat-CoVs. We then document evidence of &lt;i&gt;ORF3d&lt;/i&gt; translation, characterize its protein sequence, and conduct an evolutionary analysis at three levels: between taxa (21 members of &lt;i&gt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus&lt;/i&gt;), between human hosts (3978 SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences), and within human hosts (401 deeply sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples). &lt;i&gt;ORF3d&lt;/i&gt; has been independently identified and shown to elicit a strong antibody response in COVID-19 patients. However, it has been misclassified as the unrelated gene &lt;i&gt;ORF3b&lt;/i&gt;, leading to confusion. Our results liken &lt;i&gt;ORF3d&lt;/i&gt; to other accessory genes in emerging viruses and highlight the importance of OLGs.</description>

	<title>eLife: Establishment and maintenance of motor neuron identity via temporal modularity in terminal selector function</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59464</link>
	<description>Terminal selectors are transcription factors (TFs) that establish during development and maintain throughout life post-mitotic neuronal identity. We previously showed that UNC-3/Ebf, the terminal selector of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; cholinergic motor neurons (MNs), acts indirectly to prevent alternative neuronal identities (Feng et al., 2020). Here, we globally identify the direct targets of UNC-3. Unexpectedly, we find that the suite of UNC-3 targets in MNs is modified across different life stages, revealing ‘temporal modularity’ in terminal selector function. In all larval and adult stages examined, UNC-3 is required for continuous expression of various protein classes (e.g. receptors, transporters) critical for MN function. However, only in late larvae and adults, UNC-3 is required to maintain expression of MN-specific TFs. Minimal disruption of UNC-3’s temporal modularity via genome engineering affects locomotion. Another &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; terminal selector (UNC-30/Pitx) also exhibits temporal modularity, supporting the potential generality of this mechanism for the control of neuronal identity.</description>

	<title>eLife: Dopamine promotes instrumental motivation, but reduces reward-related vigour</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58321</link>
	<description>We can be motivated when reward depends on performance, or merely by the prospect of a guaranteed reward. Performance-dependent (contingent) reward is instrumental, relying on an internal action-outcome model, whereas motivation by guaranteed reward may minimise opportunity cost in reward-rich environments. Competing theories propose that each type of motivation should be dependent on dopaminergic activity. We contrasted these two types of motivation with a rewarded saccade task, in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). When PD patients were ON dopamine, they had greater response vigour (peak saccadic velocity residuals) for &lt;i&gt;contingent&lt;/i&gt; rewards, whereas when PD patients were OFF medication, they had greater vigour for &lt;i&gt;guaranteed&lt;/i&gt; rewards. These results support the view that reward expectation and contingency drive distinct motivational processes, and can be dissociated by manipulating dopaminergic activity. We posit that dopamine promotes goal-directed motivation, but dampens reward-driven vigour, contradictory to the prediction that increased tonic dopamine amplifies reward expectation</description>

	<title>eLife: Functional interrogation of HOXA9 regulome in MLLr leukemia via reporter-based CRISPR/Cas9 screen</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57858</link>
	<description>Aberrant &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; expression is a hallmark of most aggressive acute leukemias, notably those with KMT2A (MLL) gene rearrangements. &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; overexpression not only predicts poor diagnosis and outcome but also plays a critical role in leukemia transformation and maintenance. However, our current understanding of &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; regulation in leukemia is limited, hindering development of therapeutic strategies. Here, we generated the &lt;i&gt;HOXA9-mCherry&lt;/i&gt; knock-in reporter cell lines to dissect &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; regulation. By utilizing the reporter and CRISPR/Cas9 screens, we identified transcription factors controlling &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; expression, including a novel regulator, USF2, whose depletion significantly down-regulated &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; expression and impaired MLLr leukemia cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of Hoxa9 rescued impaired leukemia cell proliferation upon USF2 loss. Cut&amp;amp;Run analysis revealed the direct occupancy of USF2 at &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; promoter in MLLr leukemia cells. Collectively, the &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; reporter facilitated the functional interrogation of the &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; regulome and has advanced our understanding of the molecular regulation network in &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt;-driven leukemia.</description>

	<title>eLife: Cadherins regulate nuclear topography and function of developing ocular motor circuitry</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56725</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56725</link>
	<description>In the vertebrate central nervous system, groups of functionally-related neurons, including cranial motor neurons of the brainstem, are frequently organised as nuclei. The molecular mechanisms governing the emergence of nuclear topography and circuit function are poorly understood. Here we investigate the role of cadherin-mediated adhesion in the development of zebrafish ocular motor (sub)nuclei. We find that developing ocular motor (sub)nuclei differentially express classical cadherins. Perturbing cadherin function in these neurons results in distinct defects in neuronal positioning, including scattering of dorsal cells and defective contralateral migration of ventral subnuclei. In addition, we show that cadherin-mediated interactions between adjacent subnuclei are critical for subnucleus position. We also find that disrupting cadherin adhesivity in dorsal oculomotor neurons impairs the larval optokinetic reflex, suggesting that neuronal clustering is important for co-ordinating circuit function. Our findings reveal that cadherins regulate distinct aspects of cranial motor neuron positioning and establish subnuclear topography and motor function.</description>

The field of transcriptomics uses and measures mRNA as a proxy of gene expression. There are currently two major platforms in use for quantifying mRNA, microarray and RNA-Seq. Many comparative studies have shown that their results are not always consistent. In this study we aim to find a robust method to increase comparability of both platforms enabling data analysis of merged data from both platforms. We transformed high dimensional transcriptomics data from two different platforms into a lower dimensional, and biologically relevant dataset by calculating enrichment scores based on gene set collections for all samples. We compared the similarity between data from both platforms based on the raw data and on the enrichment scores. We show that the performed data transforms the data in a biologically relevant way and filters out noise which leads to increased platform concordance. We validate the procedure using predictive models built with microarray based enrichment scores to predict subtypes of breast cancer using enrichment scores based on sequenced data. Although microarray and RNA-Seq expression levels might appear different, transforming them into biologically relevant gene set enrichment scores significantly increases their correlation, which is a step forward in data integration of the two platforms. The gene set collections were shown to contain biologically relevant gene sets. More in-depth investigation on the effect of the composition, size, and number of gene sets that are used for the transformation is suggested for future research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QAKeFKz1bhY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Uncertainty-driven regulation of learning and exploration in adolescents: A computational account</title>

Healthy adults flexibly adapt their learning strategies to ongoing changes in uncertainty, a key feature of adaptive behaviour. However, the developmental trajectory of this ability is yet unknown, as developmental studies have not incorporated trial-to-trial variation in uncertainty in their analyses or models. To address this issue, we compared adolescents’ and adults’ trial-to-trial dynamics of uncertainty, learning rate, and exploration in two tasks that assess learning in noisy but otherwise stable environments. In an estimation task—which provides direct indices of trial-specific learning rate—both age groups reduced their learning rate over time, as self-reported uncertainty decreased. Accordingly, the estimation data in both groups was better explained by a Bayesian model with dynamic learning rate (Kalman filter) than by conventional reinforcement-learning models. Furthermore, adolescents’ learning rates asymptoted at a higher level, reflecting an over-weighting of the most recent outcome, and the estimated Kalman-filter parameters suggested that this was due to an overestimation of environmental volatility. In a choice task, both age groups became more likely to choose the higher-valued option over time, but this increase in choice accuracy was smaller in the adolescents. In contrast to the estimation task, we found no evidence for a Bayesian expectation-updating process in the choice task, suggesting that estimation and choice tasks engage different learning processes. However, our modeling results of the choice task suggested that both age groups reduced their degree of exploration over time, and that the adolescents explored overall more than the adults. Finally, age-related differences in exploration parameters from fits to the choice data were mediated by participants’ volatility parameter from fits to the estimation data. Together, these results suggest that adolescents overestimate the rate of environmental change, resulting in elevated learning rates and increased exploration, which may help understand developmental changes in learning and decision-making.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/q_oMUJUHLS8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

During these days of global emergency for the COVID-19 disease outbreak, there is an urgency to share reliable information able to help worldwide life scientists to get better insights and make sense of the large amount of data currently available. In this study we used the results presented in [1] to perform two different Systems Biology analyses on the HCoV-host interactome. In the first one, we reconstructed the interactome of the HCoV-host proteins, integrating it with highly reliable miRNA and drug interactions information. We then added the IL-6 gene, identified in recent publications [2] as heavily involved in the COVID-19 progression and, interestingly, we identified several interactions with the reconstructed interactome. In the second analysis, we performed a Gene Ontology and a Pathways enrichment analysis on the full set of the HCoV-host interactome proteins and on the ones belonging to a significantly dense cluster of interacting proteins identified in the first analysis. Results of the two analyses provide a compact but comprehensive glance on some of the current state-of-the-art regulations, GO, and pathways involved in the HCoV-host interactome, and that could support all scientists currently focusing on SARS-CoV-2 research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JzU-epzTyFw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Psychiatric disorders are ubiquitously characterized by debilitating social impairments. These difficulties are thought to emerge from aberrant social inference. In order to elucidate the underlying computational mechanisms, patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (N = 29), schizophrenia (N = 31), and borderline personality disorder (N = 31) as well as healthy controls (N = 34) performed a probabilistic reward learning task in which participants could learn from social and nonsocial information. Patients with schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder performed more poorly on the task than healthy controls and patients with major depressive disorder. Broken down by domain, borderline personality disorder patients performed better in the social compared to the non-social domain. In contrast, controls and MDD patients showed the opposite pattern and SCZ patients showed no difference between domains. In effect, borderline personality disorder patients gave up a possible overall performance advantage by concentrating their learning in the social at the expense of the non-social domain. We used computational modeling to assess learning and decision-making parameters estimated for each participant from their behavior. This enabled additional insights into the underlying learning and decision-making mechanisms. Patients with borderline personality disorder showed slower learning from social and non-social information and an exaggerated sensitivity to changes in environmental volatility, both in the non-social and the social domain, but more so in the latter. Regarding decision-making the modeling revealed that compared to controls and major depression patients, patients with borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia showed a stronger reliance on social relative to non-social information when making choices. Depressed patients did not differ significantly from controls in this respect. Overall, our results are consistent with the notion of a general interpersonal hypersensitivity in borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia based on a shared computational mechanism characterized by an over-reliance on beliefs about others in making decisions and by an exaggerated need to make sense of others during learning specifically in borderline personality disorder.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MrkTPYrQlV8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Cyclic transitions between higher order motifs underlie sustained asynchronous spiking in sparse recurrent networks</title>

A basic—yet nontrivial—function which neocortical circuitry must satisfy is the ability to maintain stable spiking activity over time. Stable neocortical activity is asynchronous, critical, and low rate, and these features of spiking dynamics contribute to efficient computation and optimal information propagation. However, it remains unclear how neocortex maintains this asynchronous spiking regime. Here we algorithmically construct spiking neural network models, each composed of 5000 neurons. Network construction synthesized topological statistics from neocortex with a set of objective functions identifying naturalistic low-rate, asynchronous, and critical activity. We find that simulations run on the same topology exhibit sustained asynchronous activity under certain sets of initial membrane voltages but truncated activity under others. Synchrony, rate, and criticality do not provide a full explanation of this dichotomy. Consequently, in order to achieve mechanistic understanding of sustained asynchronous activity, we summarized activity as functional graphs where edges between units are defined by pairwise spike dependencies. We then analyzed the intersection between functional edges and synaptic connectivity- i.e. recruitment networks. Higher-order patterns, such as triplet or triangle motifs, have been tied to cooperativity and integration. We find, over time in each sustained simulation, low-variance periodic transitions between isomorphic triangle motifs in the recruitment networks. We quantify the phenomenon as a Markov process and discover that if the network fails to engage this stereotyped regime of motif dominance “cycling”, spiking activity truncates early. Cycling of motif dominance generalized across manipulations of synaptic weights and topologies, demonstrating the robustness of this regime for maintenance of network activity. Our results point to the crucial role of excitatory higher-order patterns in sustaining asynchronous activity in sparse recurrent networks. They also provide a possible explanation why such connectivity and activity patterns have been prominently reported in neocortex.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JIKiGK-cDv0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Small membrane proteins represent a largely unexplored yet abundant class of proteins in pro- and eukaryotes. They essentially consist of a single transmembrane domain and are associated with stress response mechanisms in bacteria. How these proteins are inserted into the bacterial membrane is unknown. Our study revealed that in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, the 27-amino-acid-long model protein YohP is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP), as indicated by in vivo and in vitro site-directed cross-linking. Cross-links to SRP were also observed for a second small membrane protein, the 33-amino-acid-long YkgR. However, in contrast to the canonical cotranslational recognition by SRP, SRP was found to bind to YohP posttranslationally. In vitro protein transport assays in the presence of a SecY inhibitor and proteoliposome studies demonstrated that SRP and its receptor FtsY are essential for the posttranslational membrane insertion of YohP by either the SecYEG translocon or by the YidC insertase. Furthermore, our data showed that the &lt;i&gt;yohP&lt;/i&gt; mRNA localized preferentially and translation-independently to the bacterial membrane in vivo. In summary, our data revealed that YohP engages an unique SRP-dependent posttranslational insertion pathway that is likely preceded by an mRNA targeting step. This further highlights the enormous plasticity of bacterial protein transport machineries.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/J1Buzevc9iA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Matrix proteins are encoded by many enveloped viruses, including influenza viruses, herpes viruses, and coronaviruses. Underneath the viral envelope of influenza virus, matrix protein 1 (M1) forms an oligomeric layer critical for particle stability and pH-dependent RNA genome release. However, high-resolution structures of full-length monomeric M1 and the matrix layer have not been available, impeding antiviral targeting and understanding of the pH-dependent transitions involved in cell entry. Here, purification and extensive mutagenesis revealed protein–protein interfaces required for the formation of multilayered helical M1 oligomers similar to those observed in virions exposed to the low pH of cell entry. However, single-layered helical oligomers with biochemical and ultrastructural similarity to those found in infectious virions before cell entry were observed upon mutation of a single amino acid. The highly ordered structure of the single-layered oligomers and their likeness to the matrix layer of intact virions prompted structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The resulting 3.4-Å–resolution structure revealed the molecular details of M1 folding and its organization within the single-shelled matrix. The solution of the full-length M1 structure, the identification of critical assembly interfaces, and the development of M1 assembly assays with purified proteins are crucial advances for antiviral targeting of influenza viruses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oIHtLnau1qM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Detection of memory‐ and learning‐related brain connectivity changes following trace eyeblink‐conditioning using resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging in the awake rabbit</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25042?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Detection of memory‐ and learning‐related brain connectivity changes following trace eyeblink‐conditioning using resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging in the awake rabbit&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/61e4eefb-c733-4407-aa17-1d7e702a3fc7/cne25042-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mammalian brain can adapt to life experiences and reorganize its functional network to learn a new task. In our study we were able to detect and characterize rs‐fMRI signals from alert rabbits to track the functional reorganization of the neural networks that mediate acquisition and retention of eyeblink conditioning.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal imaging studies have the potential to further establish resting‐state fMRI (rs‐fMRI) and enable its validation for clinical use. The rabbit subjects used in this work are an ideal model system for studying learning and behavior and are also an excellent established test subject for awake scanning given their natural tolerance for restraint. We found that analysis of rs‐fMRI conducted on a cohort of rabbits undergoing eyeblink conditioning can reveal functional brain connectivity changes associated with learning, and that rs‐fMRI can be used to capture differences between subjects with different levels of cognitive performance. rs‐fMRI sessions were conducted on a cohort of rabbits before and after trace eyeblink conditioning. MRI results were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA) and network analysis. Behavioral data were collected with standard methods using an infrared reflective sensor aimed at the cornea to detect blinks. Behavioral results were analyzed, and a median split was used to create two groups of rabbits based on their performance. The cohort of rabbits undergoing eyeblink conditioning exhibited increased functional connectivity in the cingulate cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and thalamus consistent with brain reorganization associated with increased learning. Differences in the striatum and right cerebellum were also identified between rabbits in the top or bottom halves of the group as measured by the behavioral assay. Thus, rs‐fMRI can provide not only a tool to detect and monitor functional brain changes associated with learning, but also to discriminate between different levels of cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody ameliorates spatial memory and synapse loss induced by chronic stress</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody ameliorates spatial memory and synapse loss induced by chronic stress&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/94ffaa8b-ed4b-4ffb-a493-66600fb963bf/cne25038-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Three weeks of anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody injection at a dose of 8 mg/(kg • d) significantly improved the spatial memory ability of rats under chronic stress
The synapses of the DG, CA1, and CA3 fields of the hippocampus were significantly decreased after 7 weeks of CS stimulation
Three weeks of anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody treatment reversed the CS‐induced decrease in the synapses in the DG, CA1, and CA3 fields of the hippocampus



&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress can induce cognitive impairment, and synapse number was significantly decreased in the hippocampus of rats suffering from chronic stress. Lingo‐1 is a potent negative regulator of axonal outgrowth and synaptic plasticity. In the current study, the effects of anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody on the spatial learning and memory abilities and hippocampal synapses of stressed rats were investigated. After 4 weeks of stress exposure, the model group was randomly divided into a chronic stress group and an anti‐Lingo‐1 group. Then, the anti‐Lingo‐1 group rats were treated with anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody (8 mg/kg) for 3 weeks. The effects of anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody on the spatial learning and memory abilities were investigated with the Morris water maze test. Immunohistological staining and an unbiased stereological method were used to estimate the total number of dendritic spine synapses in the hippocampus. At the behavioral level, after 3 weeks of treatment, the anti‐Lingo‐1 group rats displayed significantly more platform location crossings in the Morris water maze test than the chronic stress group rats. Anti‐Lingo‐1 significantly prevented the declines in dendritic spine synapses and postsynaptic density protein‐95 (PSD‐95) expression in the dentate gyrus and the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. The present results indicated that anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody may be a safe and effective drug for alleviating memory impairment in rats after chronic stress and protecting synapses in the hippocampus of stressed rats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Prior anticoagulation in patients with ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25917?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25917?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and acute ischaemic stroke the association of prior anticoagulation with vitamin‐K antagonists (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) with stroke severity, intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) utilization, safety of IVT, and 3‐months outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohort study of consecutive patients (2013–2019) on anticoagulation versus those without (controls) with regard to stroke severity, rates of IVT/MT, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and favorable outcome (mRS 0–2) at 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 8179 patients (mean[SD]age, 79.8[9.6] years;49%women), 1486(18%) were on VKA treatment, 1634(20%) on DOAC treatment at stroke onset, and 5059 controls. Stroke severity was lower in patients on DOACs (median NIHSS 4,[IQR2–11]) as compared to VKA (6,[2–14]) and controls (7,[3–15], P&amp;lt;0.001; quantile regression: β ‐2.1, 95%CI ‐2.6 – ‐1.7). The IVT‐rate in potentially eligible patients was significantly lower in patients on VKA (156/247 (63%);aOR 0.67; 95%CI 0.50–0.90) and particularly in patients on DOACs (69/464 (15%); aOR 0.06; 95%CI 0.05–0.08) as compared to controls (1544/2504 (74%)). sICH after IVT occurred in 3.6%(2.6–4.7%) of controls, 9/195 (4.6%; 1.9–9.2%; aOR 0.93;0.46‐1.90) of patients on VKA and 2/65 (3.1%; 0.4–10.8%, aOR 0.56;0.28–1.12) of those on DOACs. After adjustments for prognostic confounders, DOAC pretreatment was associated with favorable 3‐month outcome (aOR 1.24,1.01–1.51).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior DOAC therapy in patients with AF was associated with decreased admission stroke severity at onset and a remarkably low rate of IVT. Overall, patients on DOAC might have better functional outcome at 3 months. Further research is needed to overcome potential restrictions for IVT in patients taking DOACs.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Neuronal Representations of Tactic-Based Sensorimotor Transformations in the Primate Medial Prefrontal, Presupplementary, and Supplementary Motor Areas: A Comparative Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.536246</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.536246</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adaptive context-dependent behaviors necessitate the flexible selection of multiple behavioral tactics, i.e., internal protocols for selecting an action. Previous primate studies have shown that the posterior medial prefrontal cortex (pmPFC) contributes to the selection, retention, and use of tactics, but the manner in which this area employs selected tactics to convert sensory information into action and how that manner differs from downstream cortical motor areas have yet to be fully elucidated. To address this issue, the present study recorded neuronal activity in two monkeys as they performed a two-choice arm reaching task that required the selection of multiple tactics when converting spatial cue information into the direction of arm reaching. Neuronal populations in both pmPFC and presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) represented tactics during their selection, maintenance in memory, and their use in determining an action. Additionally, they represented the monkeys’ action in the behavioral epoch in which the direction of reaching was determined. A striking contrast between the pmPFC and the pre-SMA was the representation of the spatial cue location in the former and its absence in the latter area. In individual neurons, neurons in pmPFC and pre-SMA had either single or mixed representation of tactics and action. Some of the pmPFC neurons additionally encoded cue location. Finally, neurons in the supplementary motor area mainly represented the action. Taken together, the present results indicate that, of these three areas, the pmPFC plays a cardinal role during the integration of behavioral tactics and visuospatial information when selecting an action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dendritic spines are small protrusions from the dendrite membrane, where contact with neighboring axons is formed in order to receive synaptic input. Changes in size, shape, and density of synaptic spines are associated with learning and memory, and observed after drug abuse in a variety of neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disorders. Due to the preeminent importance of synaptic spines, there have been major efforts into developing techniques that enable visualization and analysis of dendritic spines in cultured neurons, in fixed slices and in intact brain tissue. The classification of synaptic spines into predefined morphological groups is a standard approach in neuroscience research, where spines are divided into fixed categories such as thin, mushroom, and stubby subclasses. This study examines accumulated evidence that supports the existence of dendritic spine shapes as a continuum rather than separated classes. Using new approaches and software tools we reflect on complex dendritic spine shapes, positing that understanding of their highly dynamic nature is required to perform analysis of their morphology. The study discusses and compares recently developed algorithms that rely on clusterization rather than classification, therefore enabling new levels of spine shape analysis. We reason that improved methods of analysis may help to investigate a link between dendritic spine shape and its function, facilitating future studies of learning and memory as well as studies of brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Tau Protein and Its Role in Blood–Brain Barrier Dysfunction</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The blood–brain barrier (BBB) plays a crucial role in maintaining the specialized microenvironment of the central nervous system (CNS). In aging, the stability of the BBB declines and the permeability increases. The list of CNS pathologies involving BBB dysfunction is growing. The opening of the BBB and subsequent infiltration of serum components to the brain can lead to a host of processes resulting in progressive synaptic, neuronal dysfunction, and detrimental neuroinflammatory changes. Such processes have been implicated in different diseases, including vascular dementia, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hypoxia, ischemia, and diabetes mellitus. The BBB damage is also observed in tauopathies that lack amyloid-β overproduction, suggesting a role for tau in BBB damage. Tauopathies represent a heterogeneous group of around 20 different neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal deposition of the MAPT in cells of the nervous system. Neuropathology of tauopathies is defined as intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) consisting of aggregated hyper- and abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein and neuroinflammation. Disruption of the BBB found in tauopathies is driven by chronic neuroinflammation. Production of pro-inflammatory signaling molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules by glial cells, neurons, and endothelial cells determine the integrity of the BBB and migration of immune cells into the brain. The inflammatory processes promote structural changes in capillaries such as fragmentation, thickening, atrophy of pericytes, accumulation of laminin in the basement membrane, and increased permeability of blood vessels to plasma proteins. Here, we summarize the knowledge about the role of tau protein in BBB structural and functional changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: L-Asparaginase Exerts Neuroprotective Effects in an SH-SY5Y-A53T Model of Parkinson’s Disease by Regulating Glutamine Metabolism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.563054</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.563054</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide and involves deficiencies in alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) degradation. Effective therapeutic strategies for PD are urgently needed. L-asparaginase (L-ASNase) has been developed for therapeutic applications in many fields because it catalyzes the hydrolysis of asparagine and glutamine in cancer cells, which may also activate autophagy and induce the degradation of accumulated α-Syn. However, the efficacy and related mechanism of L-ASNase in PD remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We determined the correlation between L-ASNase and autophagic degradation of α-Syn in a cell model of PD. Mitochondrial function and apoptosis were examined in the presence or absence of L-ASNase. Then, we applied GC-MS/MS targeted amino acid metabolomics analysis to validate the amino acid regulation induced by L-ASNase treatment. Glutamine was added to verify whether the neuroprotective effect was induced by deprivation of glutamine. α-Syn-related autophagy and mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics were detected to explore the mechanism of L-ASNase-based therapy in PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: L-ASNase activated the autophagic degradation of α-Syn in a cell model of PD without cytotoxicity at specific concentrations/times. Under these conditions, L-ASNase showed substantial neuroprotective effects, including improvements in mitochondrial function and decreased apoptosis. Through GC-MS/MS targeted analysis, glutamine metabolism was identified as the target of L-ASNase in PD treatment, and the neuroprotective effect of L-ASNase was reduced after glutamine supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our study demonstrated for the first time that L-ASNase had a neuroprotective effect on a cell model of PD through a moderate deprivation of glutamine, which induced autophagic activation and mitochondrial fusion. Therefore, we demonstrated that L-ASNase could be a promising and effective drug for PD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: 17β-Estradiol Protects Neural Stem/Progenitor Cells Against Ketamine-Induced Injury Through Estrogen Receptor β Pathway</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.576813</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ketamine inhibits neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) proliferation and disrupts normal neurogenesis in the developing brain. 17β-Estradiol alleviates neurogenesis damage and enhances behavioral performance after ketamine administration. However, the receptor pathway of 17β-estradiol that protects NSPCs from ketamine-induced injury remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the role of estrogen receptor α (ER-α) and estrogen receptor β (ER-β) in 17β-estradiol’s protection against ketamine-exposed NSPCs and explored its potential mechanism. The primary cultured NSPCs were identified by immunofluorescence and then treated with ketamine and varying doses of ER-α agonist 4,4′,4″-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl) trisphenol (PPT) or ER-β agonist 2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile (DPN) for 24 h. NSPC proliferation was analyzed by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation test. The expression of phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3β (p-GSK-3β) was quantified by western blotting. It was found that treatment with different concentrations of PPT did not alter the inhibition of ketamine on NSPC proliferation. However, treatment with DPN attenuated the inhibition of ketamine on NSPC proliferation at 24 h after their exposure (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, treatment with DPN increased p-GSK-3β expression in NSPCs exposed to ketamine. These findings indicated that ER-β mediates probably the protective effects of 17β-estradiol on ketamine-damaged NSPC proliferation and GSK-3β is involved in this process&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Investigation on the Alteration of Brain Functional Network and Its Role in the Identification of Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.558434</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is generally regarded as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In coping with the challenges caused by AD, we analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 82 MCI subjects and 93 normal controls (NCs). The alteration of brain functional network in MCI was investigated on three scales, including global metrics, nodal characteristics, and modular properties. The results supported the existence of small worldness, hubs, and community structure in the brain functional networks of both groups. Compared with NCs, the network altered in MCI over all the three scales. In scale I, we found significantly decreased characteristic path length and increased global efficiency in MCI. Moreover, altered global network metrics were associated with cognitive level evaluated by neuropsychological assessments. In scale II, the nodal betweenness centrality of some global hubs, such as the right Crus II of cerebellar hemisphere (CERCRU2.R) and fusiform gyrus (FFG.R), changed significantly and associated with the severity and cognitive impairment in MCI. In scale III, although anatomically adjacent regions tended to be clustered into the same module regardless of group, discrepancies existed in the composition of modules in both groups, with a prominent separation of the cerebellum and a less localized organization of community structure in MCI compared with NC. Taking advantages of random forest approach, we achieved an accuracy of 91.4% to discriminate MCI patients from NCs by integrating cognitive assessments and network analysis. The importance of the used features fed into the classifier further validated the nodal characteristics of CERCRU2.R and FFG.R could be potential biomarkers in the identification of MCI. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the brain functional connectome data altered at the stage of MCI and could assist the automatic diagnosis of MCI patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Deep Learning Based Inter-subject Continuous Decoding of Motor Imagery for Practical Brain-Computer Interfaces</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00918</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inter-subject transfer learning is a long-standing problem in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and has not yet been fully realized due to high inter-subject variability in the brain signals related to motor imagery (MI). The recent success of deep learning-based algorithms in classifying different brain signals warrants further exploration to determine whether it is feasible for the inter-subject continuous decoding of MI signals to provide contingent neurofeedback which is important for neurorehabilitative BCI designs. In this paper, we have shown how a convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning framework can be used for inter-subject continuous decoding of MI related electroencephalographic (EEG) signals using the novel concept of Mega Blocks for adapting the network against inter-subject variabilities. These Mega Blocks have the capacity to repeat a specific architectural block several times such as one or more convolutional layers in a single Mega Block. The parameters of such Mega Blocks can be optimized using Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. The results, obtained on the publicly available BCI competition IV-2b dataset, yields an average inter-subject continuous decoding accuracy of 71.49% (κ = 0.42) and 70.84% (κ = 0.42) for two different training methods such as adaptive moment estimation (Adam) and stochastic gradient descent (SGDM), respectively, in 7 out of 9 subjects. Our results show for the first time that it is feasible to use CNN based architectures for inter-subject continuous decoding with a sufficient level of accuracy for developing calibration-free MI-BCIs for practical purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: A Multi-Scale Computational Model of Excitotoxic Loss of Dopaminergic Cells in Parkinson's Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Although the exact cause of cell death is not clear, the hypothesis that metabolic deficiency is a key factor has been gaining attention in recent years. In the present study, we investigated this hypothesis using a multi-scale computational model of the subsystem of the basal ganglia comprising the subthalamic nucleus (STN), globus pallidus externa (GPe), and SNc. The proposed model is a multiscale model in that interaction among the three nuclei are simulated using more abstract Izhikevich neuron models, while the molecular pathways involved in cell death of SNc neurons are simulated in terms of detailed chemical kinetics. Simulation results obtained from the proposed model showed that energy deficiencies occurring at cellular and network levels could precipitate the excitotoxic loss of SNc neurons in PD. At the subcellular level, the models show how calcium elevation leads to apoptosis of SNc neurons. The therapeutic effects of several neuroprotective interventions are also simulated in the model. From neuroprotective studies, it was clear that glutamate inhibition and apoptotic signal blocker therapies were able to halt the progression of SNc cell loss when compared to other therapeutic interventions, which only slowed down the progression of SNc cell loss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Competition Enhances the Effectiveness and Motivation of Attention Rehabilitation After Stroke. A Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.575403</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Attention deficits are among the most common cognitive impairments observed after experiencing stroke. However, a very limited number of studies have investigated the effectiveness of interventions that specifically focus on the rehabilitation of attention deficits among subjects with impaired attention. Although several interventions have included the use of computerized programs to provide dynamic stimuli, real-time performance feedback, and motivating tasks, existing studies have not exploited the potential benefits of multi-user interactions. Group-based and competitive interventions have been reported to be more enjoyable and motivating, depending on individual traits, and may potentially be more demanding, which may increase their effectiveness. This study investigated the effectiveness and motivating abilities of an intervention specifically designed to address attention deficits. This intervention combined paper-and-pencil tasks and interactive, computerized, multi-touch exercises, which were administered, either non-competitively or competitively, to a group of 43 individuals with chronic stroke. The mediating effects of competitiveness were evaluated for both intervention effectiveness and motivation. Participants were randomly sorted into two groups and underwent 20 one-hour group-based sessions, during which they either worked individually or competed with peers, according to their group allocation. Participants were assessed before and after the intervention, using the Conners' Continuous Performance Test, the d2 Test of Attention, the Color Trail Test, the Digit Span Test, and the Spatial Span Test. The competitiveness and subjective experiences of the participants after the intervention were investigated with the Revised Competitiveness Index and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, respectively. The results showed that participants who competed demonstrated significantly greater improvements in all cognitive abilities, except for divided attention, and reported greater enjoyment than their non-competitive peers. Both groups reported comparable levels of perceived competence, pressure, and usefulness. Interestingly, the competitiveness of the participants did not alter either the effectiveness or the subjective experience of the intervention. These findings suggest that competition might enhance the effectiveness and enjoyment of rehabilitation interventions designed to address attention deficits in individuals post-stroke, regardless of their level of competitiveness and without having a negative effect on their perceived pressure and competence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Hippocampus and Parahippocampus Volume Reduction Associated With Impaired Olfactory Abilities in Subjects Without Evidence of Cognitive Decline</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between olfactory recognition and morphological changes in olfactory brain regions including the amygdala, hippocampus, rectus, parahippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and medial frontal cortex in 27 elderly subjects and 27 younger healthy controls. The specific aim of the study was to determine which brain areas are associated with the initial decline of olfaction in elderly subjects, which occurs before the onset of dementia. All subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging to measure anatomical brain volume and cortical thickness, and subjects were assessed using tests of olfactory acuity and cognitive function measured with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Overall brain volume reductions were observed in elderly subjects compared with young healthy controls, but only reduction in the volume of the left hippocampus was associated with decreased olfactory ability. The parahippocampus of elderly subjects was not different from that of controls; the extent of the reduction of parahippocampus volume varied among individuals, and reduction in this region was associated with olfactory decline. Similarly, parahippocampus thinning was associated with decreased olfactory function. The path analysis showed direct and indirect effects of hippocampus and parahippocampus volume on olfactory ability and that volume reductions in these areas were not associated with cognitive function. Parahippocampus volume reduction and thinning exhibited individual variation; this may be the first appearance of pathological changes and may lead to dysfunction in the connection of olfactory memory to the neocortex. Parahippocampus change may reflect the first sign of olfactory impairment prior to pathological changes in the hippocampus, amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Directional Local Field Potentials in the Subthalamic Nucleus During Deep Brain Implantation of Parkinson’s Disease Patients</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Segmented deep brain stimulation leads feature directional electrodes that allow for a finer spatial control of electrical stimulation compared to traditional ring-shaped electrodes. These segmented leads have demonstrated enlarged therapeutic windows and have thus the potential to improve the treatment of Parkinson’s disease patients. Moreover, they provide a unique opportunity to record directional local field potentials. Here, we investigated whether directional local field potentials can help identify the best stimulation direction to assist device programming. Four Parkinson’s disease patients underwent routine implantation of the subthalamic nucleus. Firstly, local field potentials were recorded in three directions for two conditions: In one condition, the patient was at rest; in the other condition, the patient’s arm was moved. Secondly, current thresholds for therapeutic and side effects were identified intraoperatively for directional stimulation. Therapeutic windows were calculated from these two thresholds. Thirdly, the spectral power of the total beta band (13–35 Hz) and its sub-bands low, high, and peak beta were analyzed post hoc. Fourthly, the spectral power was used by different algorithms to predict the ranking of directions. The spectral power profiles were patient-specific, and spectral peaks were found both in the low beta band (13–20 Hz) and in the high beta band (20.5–35 Hz). The direction with the highest spectral power in the total beta band was most indicative of the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; best direction when defined by therapeutic window. Based on the total beta band, the resting condition and the moving condition were similarly predictive about the direction ranking and classified 83.3% of directions correctly. However, different algorithms were needed to predict the ranking defined by therapeutic window or therapeutic current threshold. Directional local field potentials may help predict the best stimulation direction. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to better distinguish the informative value of different conditions and the beta sub-bands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Identifiability of a Binomial Synapse</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.558477</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.558477</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synapses are highly stochastic transmission units. A classical model describing this stochastic transmission is called the binomial model, and its underlying parameters can be estimated from postsynaptic responses to evoked stimuli. The accuracy of parameter estimates obtained via such a model-based approach depends on the identifiability of the model. A model is said to be structurally identifiable if its parameters can be uniquely inferred from the distribution of its outputs. However, this theoretical property does not necessarily imply practical identifiability. For instance, if the number of observations is low or if the recording noise is high, the model's parameters can only be loosely estimated. Structural identifiability, which is an intrinsic property of a model, has been widely characterized; but practical identifiability, which is a property of both the model and the experimental protocol, is usually only qualitatively assessed. Here, we propose a formal definition for the practical identifiability domain of a statistical model. For a given experimental protocol, this domain corresponds to the set of parameters for which the model is correctly identified as the ground truth compared to a simpler alternative model. Considering a model selection problem instead of a parameter inference problem allows to derive a non-arbitrary criterion for practical identifiability. We apply our definition to the study of neurotransmitter release at a chemical synapse. Our contribution to the analysis of synaptic stochasticity is three-fold: firstly, we propose a quantitative criterion for the practical identifiability of a statistical model, and compute the identifiability domains of different variants of the binomial release model (uni or multi-quantal, with or without short-term plasticity); secondly, we extend the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), a classically used tool for model selection, to models with correlated data (which is the case for most models of chemical synapses); finally, we show that our approach allows to perform data free model selection, i.e., to verify if a model used to fit data was indeed identifiable even without access to the data, but having only access to the fitted parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Inter-band Bispectral Analysis of EEG Background Activity to Characterize Alzheimer's Disease Continuum</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to characterize the EEG alterations in inter-band interactions along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum. For this purpose, EEG background activity from 51 healthy control subjects, 51 mild cognitive impairment patients, 50 mild AD patients, 50 moderate AD patients, and 50 severe AD patients was analyzed by means of bispectrum. Three inter-band features were extracted from bispectrum matrices: bispectral relative power (BispRP), cubic bispectral entropy (BispEn), and bispectral median frequency (BispMF). BispRP results showed an increase of delta and theta interactions with other frequency bands and the opposite behavior for alpha, beta-1, and beta-2. Delta and theta interactions, along with the rest of the spectrum, also experimented a decrease of BispEn with disease progression, suggesting these bands interact with a reduced variety of components in advanced stages of dementia. Finally, BispMF showed a consistent reduction along the AD continuum in all bands, which is reflective of an interaction of the global spectrum with lower frequency bands as the disease develops. Our results indicate a progressive decrease in inter-band interactions with the severity of the disease, especially those involving high frequency components. Since inter-band coupling oscillations are related to complex and multi-scaled brain processes, these alterations likely reflect the neurodegeneration associated with the AD continuum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been employed for motor function rehabilitation for stroke patients, but its effects on post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) remains controversial.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To identify the effects of rTMS intervention on PSCI patients and its potential neural correlates to behavioral improvements.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We recruited 34 PSCI patients for 20 sessions of 10 Hz rTMS or no-stim control treatments over the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Cognitive function was evaluated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale, Victoria Stroop Test, Rivermead Behavior Memory Test, and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) assessed with the Modified Barthel Index. 14 patients received functional MRI scan, a useful non-invasive technique of determining how structurally segregated and functionally specialized brain areas were interconnected, which was reflected by blood oxygenation level–dependent signals. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and functional connectivity (FC) were applied as the analytical approaches, which were used to measure the resting-state brain activity and functional connection.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;rTMS improved cognitive functions and ADLs for PSCI patients relative to patients who received no-stim control treatment. The cognitive improvements correlated to increased ALFF of the left medial prefrontal cortex, and increased FC of right medial prefrontal cortex and right ventral anterior cingulate cortex.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;10 Hz rTMS at DLPFC could improve cognitive function and quality of life for PSCI patients, which is associated with an altered frontal cortical activity.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Registration&lt;p&gt;Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR-IPR-17011908, http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The lack of effective treatments for most neurological diseases has prompted the search for novel therapeutic options. Interestingly, neuroinflammation is emerging as a common feature to target in most CNS pathologies. Recent studies suggest that targeted delivery of small molecules to reduce neuroinflammation can be beneficial. However, suboptimal drug delivery to the CNS is a major barrier to modulate inflammation because neurotherapeutic compounds are currently being delivered systemically without spatial or temporal control. Emerging nanomaterial technologies are providing promising and superior tools to effectively access neuropathological tissue in a controlled manner. Here we highlight recent advances in nanomaterial technologies for drug delivery to the CNS. We propose that state-of-the-art nanoparticle drug delivery platforms can significantly impact local CNS bioavailability of pharmacological compounds and treat neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Endocannabinoid Signaling Contributes to Experience-Induced Increase of Synaptic Release Sites From Parvalbumin Interneurons in Mouse Visual Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;During postnatal development of the visual cortex between eye-opening to puberty, visual experience promotes a gradual increase in the strength of inhibitory synaptic connections from parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV-INs) onto layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. However, the detailed connectivity properties and molecular mechanisms underlying these developmental changes are not well understood. Using dual-patch clamp in brain slices from G42 mice, we revealed that both connection probability and the number of synaptic release sites contributed to the enhancement of synaptic strength. The increase of release site number was hindered by dark rearing from eye-opening and rescued by 3-days re-exposure to the normal visual environment. The effect of light re-exposure on restoring synaptic release sites in dark reared mice was mimicked by the agonist of cannabinoid-1 (CB1) receptors and blocked by an antagonist of these receptors, suggesting a role for endocannabinoid signaling in light-induced maturation of inhibitory connectivity from PV-INs to pyramidal cells during postnatal development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: TNF-Mediated Homeostatic Synaptic Plasticity: From in vitro to in vivo Models</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.565841</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since it was first described almost 30 years ago, homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) has been hypothesized to play a key role in maintaining neuronal circuit function in both developing and adult animals. While well characterized in vitro, determining the in vivo roles of this form of plasticity remains challenging. Since the discovery that the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mediates some forms of HSP, it has been possible to probe some of the in vivo contribution of TNF-mediated HSP. Work from our lab and others has found roles for TNF-HSP in a variety of functions, including the developmental plasticity of sensory systems, models of drug addiction, and the response to psychiatric drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: GABAA Receptor-Mediated Epileptogenicity in Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) Depends on Age at Epilepsy Onset</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.562811</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Enhanced spontaneous GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activity is associated with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a developmental malformation of the cerebral cortex. Clinical manifestations in FCD vary with age at epilepsy onset with a more favorable prognosis in patients with late-onset (LO) compared to that in cases with early-onset (EO). This study was designed to test the hypothesis in FCD that spontaneous GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated epileptogenicity depends on the age at epilepsy onset and varies between patients with early and late-onset age in FCD. To this end, brain specimens were obtained from the maximal spiking region (MAX) and minimal spiking region (MIN) of the epileptic foci of EO (n = 14, mean age = 10.6 ± 2.9 years) and LO (n = 10, mean age = 27 ± 5.6 years) patients undergoing electrocorticography (ECoG) guided surgery. The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to record spontaneous GABAergic currents from normal-looking pyramidal neurons in slice preparations of resected brain samples. We detected higher frequency and amplitude of GABAergic events in MAX samples compared to MIN samples of LO patients, while they were comparable in MIN and MAX samples of EO patients. Further GABAergic activity in the MIN and MAX samples of EO patients was higher than the MIN samples of LO patients. This suggests that in LO patients, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated epileptogenicity is confined only to the high spiking areas, but in EO patients, it affects low spiking regions as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Changes of Amide Proton Transfer Imaging in Multiple System Atrophy Parkinsonism Type</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.572421</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple system atrophy (MSA), an atypical parkinsonism of alpha-synucleinopathies, has no specific biomarker of diagnosis. According to different combinations of symptoms, MSA can be classified as parkinsonism-type MSA (MSA-P) and cerebellar-type MSA (MSA-C; Watanabe et al., 2018). Amide proton transfer (APT) imaging is by far the most studied chemical exchange saturation transfer imaging for its sensitivity to mobile protons and peptides in tissues. We hypothesize that APT imaging may be a feasible biomarker of MSA-P. Twenty MSA-P patients and 20 age-matched normal controls were enrolled in this study and underwent MR exams on a 3.0-T MR scanner. Magnetization transfer spectra at 3.5 ppm were acquired at two transverse slices of the head, including the midbrain and the basal ganglia. Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare the asymmetrical magnetization transfer ratio (MTR&lt;sub&gt;asym&lt;/sub&gt;) difference between MSA-P patients and normal controls. The APT MTR&lt;sub&gt;asym&lt;/sub&gt; values of MSA patients in the red nucleus (RN) (SN; P = 0.000), substantia nigra (P = 0.000), thalamus (P = 0.000), and putamen (P = 0.013) were significantly higher than those in normal controls. There was a negative correlation between APT MTR&lt;sub&gt;asym&lt;/sub&gt; and the score of part III of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (R = −0.338, P = 0.044) in the putamen, while there was a positive correlation between the APT MTR&lt;sub&gt;asym&lt;/sub&gt; and the rate of motor symptom progression (R = 0.406, P = 0.017) in the RN. These findings suggest that APT MTR&lt;sub&gt;asym&lt;/sub&gt; changes are found and may be of value in the diagnosis of MSA-P.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Related Shifts in Theta Oscillatory Activity During Audio-Visual Integration Regardless of Visual Attentional Load</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.571950</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.571950</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Audio-visual integration (AVI) is higher in attended conditions than in unattended conditions. Here, we explore the AVI effect when the attentional recourse is competed by additional visual distractors, and its aging effect using single- and dual-tasks. The results showed the highest AVI effect under single-task-attentional-load condition than under no- and dual-task-attentional-load conditions (all P &amp;lt; 0.05) in both older and younger groups, but the AVI effect was weaker and delayed for older adults compared to younger adults for all attentional-load conditions (all P &amp;lt; 0.05). The non-phase-locked oscillation for AVI analysis illustrated the highest theta and alpha oscillatory activity for single-task-attentional-load condition than for no- and dual-task-attentional-load conditions, and the AVI oscillatory activity mainly occurred in the Cz, CP1 and Oz of older adults but in the Fz, FC1, and Cz of younger adults. The AVI effect was significantly negatively correlated with FC1 (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.1468, P = 0.05) and Cz (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.1447, P = 0.048) theta activity and with Fz (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.1557, P = 0.043), FC1 (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.1042, P = 0.008), and Cz (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0897, P = 0.010) alpha activity for older adults but not for younger adults in dual task. These results suggested a reduction in AVI ability for peripheral stimuli and a shift in AVI oscillation from anterior to posterior regions in older adults as an adaptive mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: New insights on the modeling of the molecular mechanisms underlying neural maps alignment in the midbrain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.59754</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59754</link>
	<description>We previously identified and modeled a principle of visual map alignment in the midbrain involving the mapping of the retinal projections and concurrent transposition of retinal guidance cues into the superior colliculus providing positional information for the organization of cortical V1 projections onto the retinal map (Savier et al., 2017). This principle relies on mechanisms involving Epha/Efna signaling, correlated neuronal activity and axon competition. Here, using the 3-step map alignment computational model, we predict and validate in vivo the visual mapping defects in a well-characterized mouse model. Our results challenge previous hypotheses and provide an alternative, although complementary, explanation for the phenotype observed. In addition, we propose a new quantification method to assess the degree of alignment and organization between maps, allowing inter-model comparisons. This work generalizes the validity and robustness of the 3-step map alignment algorithm as a predictive tool and confirms the basic mechanisms of visual map organization.</description>

	<title>eLife: Expansion of the circadian transcriptome in Brassica rapa and genome-wide diversification of paralog expression patterns</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58993</link>
	<description>An important challenge of crop improvement strategies is assigning function to paralogs in polyploid crops. Here, we describe the circadian transcriptome in the polyploid crop &lt;i&gt;Brassica rapa&lt;/i&gt;. Strikingly, almost three quarters of expressed genes exhibited circadian rhythmicity. Genetic redundancy resulting from whole genome duplication is thought to facilitate evolutionary change through sub- and neo-functionalization among paralogous gene pairs. We observed genome-wide expansion of circadian expression phase among retained paralogous pairs. Using gene regulatory network models, we compared transcription factor targets between &lt;i&gt;B. rapa&lt;/i&gt; and Arabidopsis circadian networks to reveal evidence for divergence between &lt;i&gt;B. rapa&lt;/i&gt; paralogs that may be driven in part by variation in conserved non-coding sequences (CNS). Additionally, differential drought response among retained paralogous pairs suggests further functional diversification. These findings support the rapid expansion and divergence of the transcriptional network in a polyploid crop and offer a new approach for assessing paralog activity at the transcript level.</description>

	<description>Natural sounds convey information via frequency and amplitude modulations (FM and AM). Humans are acutely sensitive to the slow rates of FM that are crucial for speech and music. This sensitivity has long been thought to rely on precise stimulus-driven auditory-nerve spike timing (time code), whereas a coarser code, based on variations in the cochlear place of stimulation (place code), represents faster FM rates. We tested this theory in listeners with normal and impaired hearing, spanning a wide range of place-coding fidelity. Contrary to predictions, sensitivity to both slow and fast FM correlated with place-coding fidelity. We also used incoherent AM on two carriers to simulate place coding of FM and observed poorer sensitivity at high carrier frequencies and fast rates, two properties of FM detection previously ascribed to the limits of time coding. The results suggest a unitary place-based neural code for FM across all rates and carrier frequencies.</description>

	<title>eLife: Antinociceptive modulation by the adhesion GPCR CIRL promotes mechanosensory signal discrimination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56738</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56738</link>
	<description>Adhesion-type GPCRs (aGPCRs) participate in a vast range of physiological processes. Their frequent association with mechanosensitive functions suggests that processing of mechanical stimuli may be a common feature of this receptor family. Previously, we reported that the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; aGPCR CIRL sensitizes sensory responses to gentle touch and sound by amplifying signal transduction in low-threshold mechanoreceptors (Scholz et al., 2017). Here, we show that &lt;i&gt;Cirl&lt;/i&gt; is also expressed in high-threshold mechanical nociceptors where it adjusts nocifensive behaviour under physiological and pathological conditions. Optogenetic &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;experiments indicate that CIRL lowers cAMP levels in both mechanosensory submodalities. However, contrasting its role in touch-sensitive neurons, CIRL dampens the response of nociceptors to mechanical stimulation. Consistent with this finding, rat nociceptors display decreased &lt;i&gt;Cirl1&lt;/i&gt; expression during allodynia. Thus, cAMP-downregulation by CIRL exerts opposing effects on low-threshold mechanosensors and high-threshold nociceptors. This intriguing bipolar action facilitates the separation of mechanosensory signals carrying different physiological information.</description>

	<description>The CNS accommodates a diverse myeloid immune cell compartment that maintains CNS homeostasis in the steady state while contributing to tissue injury during infectious, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disease conditions. Autophagy and autophagy proteins play fundamental roles in myeloid cell–related immune functions. Many of these processes do not necessarily involve the canonical formation of a double-membrane structure known as the ‘autophagosome’ and reflect noncanonical functions of the autophagy machinery.</description>

	<description>How do four-legged animals adapt their locomotion to the environment? How do central and peripheral mechanisms interact within the spinal cord to produce adaptive locomotion and how is locomotion recovered when spinal circuits are perturbed? Salamanders are the only tetrapods that regenerate voluntary locomotion after full spinal transection. Given their evolutionary position, they provide a unique opportunity to bridge discoveries made in fish and mammalian models. Genetic dissection of salamander neural circuits is becoming feasible with new methods for precise manipulation, elimination, and visualisation of cells.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Inferring a complete genotype-phenotype map from a small number of measured phenotypes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Zachary R. Sailer, Sarah H. Shafik, Robert L. Summers, Alex Joule, Alice Patterson-Robert, Rowena E. Martin, Michael J. Harms&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding evolution requires detailed knowledge of genotype-phenotype maps; however, it can be a herculean task to measure every phenotype in a combinatorial map. We have developed a computational strategy to predict the missing phenotypes from an incomplete, combinatorial genotype-phenotype map. As a test case, we used an incomplete genotype-phenotype dataset previously generated for the malaria parasite’s ‘chloroquine resistance transporter’ (PfCRT). Wild-type PfCRT (PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;3D7&lt;/sup&gt;) lacks significant chloroquine (CQ) transport activity, but the introduction of the eight mutations present in the ‘Dd2’ isoform of PfCRT (PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;Dd2&lt;/sup&gt;) enables the protein to transport CQ away from its site of antimalarial action. This gain of a transport function imparts CQ resistance to the parasite. A combinatorial map between PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;3D7&lt;/sup&gt; and PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;Dd2&lt;/sup&gt; consists of 256 genotypes, of which only 52 have had their CQ transport activities measured through expression in the &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; oocyte. We trained a statistical model with these 52 measurements to infer the CQ transport activity for the remaining 204 combinatorial genotypes between PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;3D7&lt;/sup&gt; and PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;Dd2&lt;/sup&gt;. Our best-performing model incorporated a binary classifier, a nonlinear scale, and additive effects for each mutation. The addition of specific pairwise- and high-order-epistatic coefficients decreased the predictive power of the model. We evaluated our predictions by experimentally measuring the CQ transport activities of 24 additional PfCRT genotypes. The R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; value between our predicted and newly-measured phenotypes was 0.90. We then used the model to probe the accessibility of evolutionary trajectories through the map. Approximately 1% of the possible trajectories between PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;3D7&lt;/sup&gt; and PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;Dd2&lt;/sup&gt; are accessible; however, none of the trajectories entailed eight successive increases in CQ transport activity. These results demonstrate that phenotypes can be inferred with known uncertainty from a partial genotype-phenotype dataset. We also validated our approach against a collection of previously published genotype-phenotype maps. The model therefore appears general and should be applicable to a large number of genotype-phenotype maps.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ACe5JeGOk7c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Minimizing the number of optimizations for efficient community dynamic flux balance analysis</title>

Dynamic flux balance analysis uses a quasi-steady state assumption to calculate an organism’s metabolic activity at each time-step of a dynamic simulation, using the well-known technique of flux balance analysis. For microbial communities, this calculation is especially costly and involves solving a linear constrained optimization problem for each member of the community at each time step. However, this is unnecessary and inefficient, as prior solutions can be used to inform future time steps. Here, we show that a basis for the space of internal fluxes can be chosen for each microbe in a community and this basis can be used to simulate forward by solving a relatively inexpensive system of linear equations at most time steps. We can use this solution as long as the resulting metabolic activity remains within the optimization problem’s constraints (i.e. the solution to the linear system of equations remains a feasible to the linear program). As the solution becomes infeasible, it first becomes a feasible but degenerate solution to the optimization problem, and we can solve a different but related optimization problem to choose an appropriate basis to continue forward simulation. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our method by comparing with currently used methods on a four species community, and show that our method requires at least 91% fewer optimizations to be solved. For reproducibility, we prototyped the method using Python.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gastrointestinal microbiota regulate immune responses, but host molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Unbiased screening using SCFA-conjugated affinity nanobeads identified apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), an adaptor protein of inflammasome complex, as a noncanonical SCFA receptor besides GPRs. SCFAs promoted inflammasome activation in macrophages by binding to its ASC PYRIN domain. Activated inflammasome suppressed survival of &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; serovar Typhimurium (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. Typhimurium) in macrophages by pyroptosis and facilitated neutrophil recruitment to promote bacterial elimination and thus inhibit systemic dissemination in the host. Administration of SCFAs or dietary fibers, which are fermented to SCFAs by gut bacteria, significantly prolonged the survival of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. Typhimurium–infected mice through ASC-mediated inflammasome activation. SCFAs penetrated into the inflammatory region of the infected gut mucosa to protect against infection.

	<title>PLoS Biology: Millipede genomes reveal unique adaptations during myriapod evolution</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhe Qu, Wenyan Nong, Wai Lok So, Tom Barton-Owen, Yiqian Li, Thomas C. N. Leung, Chade Li, Tobias Baril, Annette Y. P. Wong, Thomas Swale, Ting-Fung Chan, Alexander Hayward, Sai-Ming Ngai, Jerome H. L. Hui&lt;/p&gt;

The Myriapoda, composed of millipedes and centipedes, is a fascinating but poorly understood branch of life, including species with a highly unusual body plan and a range of unique adaptations to their environment. Here, we sequenced and assembled 2 chromosomal-level genomes of the millipedes &lt;i&gt;Helicorthomorpha holstii&lt;/i&gt; (assembly size = 182 Mb; shortest scaffold/contig length needed to cover 50% of the genome [N50] = 18.11 Mb mainly on 8 pseudomolecules) and &lt;i&gt;Trigoniulus corallinus&lt;/i&gt; (assembly size = 449 Mb, N50 = 26.78 Mb mainly on 17 pseudomolecules). Unique genomic features, patterns of gene regulation, and defence systems in millipedes, not observed in other arthropods, are revealed. Both repeat content and intron size are major contributors to the observed differences in millipede genome size. Tight Hox and the first loose ecdysozoan ParaHox homeobox clusters are identified, and a myriapod-specific genomic rearrangement including &lt;i&gt;Hox3&lt;/i&gt; is also observed. The Argonaute (AGO) proteins for loading small RNAs are duplicated in both millipedes, but unlike in insects, an AGO duplicate has become a pseudogene. Evidence of post-transcriptional modification in small RNAs—including species-specific microRNA arm switching—providing differential gene regulation is also obtained. Millipedes possesses a unique ozadene defensive gland unlike the venomous forcipules found in centipedes. We identify sets of genes associated with the ozadene that play roles in chemical defence as well as antimicrobial activity. Macro-synteny analyses revealed highly conserved genomic blocks between the 2 millipedes and deuterostomes. Collectively, our analyses of millipede genomes reveal that a series of unique adaptations have occurred in this major lineage of arthropod diversity. The 2 high-quality millipede genomes provided here shed new light on the conserved and lineage-specific features of millipedes and centipedes. These findings demonstrate the importance of the consideration of both centipede and millipede genomes—and in particular the reconstruction of the myriapod ancestral situation—for future research to improve understanding of arthropod evolution, and animal evolutionary genomics more widely.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/kaYcF_lVjGc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A stearoyl‐CoA desaturase inhibitor prevents multiple Parkinson's disease‐phenotypes in α‐synuclein mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25920?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25920?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) has useful symptomatic treatments that do not slow the neurodegenerative process, and no significant disease‐modifying treatments are approved. A key therapeutic target in PD is α‐synuclein (αS), which is both genetically implicated and accumulates in Lewy bodies rich in vesicles and other lipid membranes. Reestablishing αS homeostasis is a central goal in PD. Based on previous lipidomic analyses, we conducted a mouse trial of a stearoyl‐CoA desaturase (SCD) inhibitor (“5b”) that prevented αS‐positive vesicular inclusions and cytotoxicity in cultured human neurons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oral dosing and brain activity of 5b were established in non‐tg mice. 5b in drinking water was given to mice expressing WT human αS (WT) or an amplified familial PD αS mutation [E35K+E46K+E61K (‘3K’)] beginning near the onset of nigral and cortical neurodegeneration and the robust PD‐like motor syndrome in 3K. Motor phenotypes, brain cytopathology and SCD‐related lipid changes were quantified in 5b‐ vs. placebo‐treated mice. Outcomes were compared to effects of crossing 3K to SCD1&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt; mice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5b treatment reduced αS hyperphosphorylation in E46K‐expressing human neurons, in 3K neural cultures and in both WT and 3K αS mice. 5b prevented subtle gait deficits in WT αS mice and the PD‐like resting tremor and progressive motor decline of 3K αS mice. 5b also increased αS tetramers and reduced PK‐resistant lipid‐rich aggregates. Similar benefits accrued from genetically deleting one SCD allele, providing target validation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prolonged reduction of brain SCD activity prevented PD‐like neuropathology in multiple PD models. Thus, an orally available SCD inhibitor potently ameliorates PD phenotypes, positioning this approach to treat human α‐synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Remote Blood Biomarkers of Longitudinal Cognitive Outcomes in a Population Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25874?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25874?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longitudinal association of the blood biomarkers total tau (t‐tau), neurofilament light (Nf‐L), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) with common sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognitive decline is not established.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a single molecule array technology, ultrasensitive immunoassays for serum concentrations of t‐tau, Nf‐L, and GFAP were measured in a population sample of 1,327 participants (60% African Americans and women) who had a clinical evaluation for AD, had completed in‐home cognitive assessments, and had undergone 1.5T structural magnetic resonance imaging.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher concentrations of serum biomarkers were associated with the development of clinical AD; especially, the time‐specific associations were notable: t‐tau 8 to 16 years, and Nf‐L and GFAP 4 to 8 years prior to clinical AD. Serum biomarkers were associated with faster cognitive decline over 16 years; baseline t‐tau &amp;gt; 0.40pg/ml had 30% faster decline, Nf‐L &amp;gt; 25.5pg/ml had 110% faster decline, and GFAP &amp;gt; 232pg/ml had 130% faster decline compared to those in the lowest quartile. Participants with baseline GFAP &amp;gt; 232pg/ml showed 160% faster decline in hippocampal volume compared to those with values &amp;lt; 160pg/ml. Additionally, higher baseline t‐tau was associated with faster increase in 3rd ventricular volume, and baseline Nf‐L and GFAP were associated with faster decline in cortical thickness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serum t‐tau, Nf‐L, and GFAP predict the development of sporadic AD and cognitive decline, and changes in structural brain characteristics, suggesting their usefulness not only as screening and predictive biomarkers, but also in capturing the pathogenesis of Alzheimer dementia.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Neural anatomy of echinoid early juveniles and comparison of nervous system organization in echinoderms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25012?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neural anatomy of echinoid early juveniles and comparison of nervous system organization in echinoderms&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/677feba9-8624-4ed1-853c-dbce1e16120b/cne25012-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Graphical Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole mount immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used on juveniles of three echinoderm species to characterize their neuroanatomy. Detailed comparisons confirmed the conservation, among the three species, of a similar general neuroanatomical organization and revealed equivalent innervation patterns at the level of the appendages (i.e., the podia and the spines).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The echinoderms are a phylum of marine deuterostomes characterized by the pentaradial (five fold) symmetry of their adult bodies. Due to this unusual body plan, adult echinoderms have long been excluded from comparative analyses aimed at understanding the origin and evolution of deuterostome nervous systems. Here, we investigated the neural anatomy of early juveniles of representatives of three of the five echinoderm classes: the echinoid &lt;i&gt;Paracentrotus lividus&lt;/i&gt;, the asteroid &lt;i&gt;Patiria miniata&lt;/i&gt;, and the holothuroid &lt;i&gt;Parastichopus parvimensis&lt;/i&gt;. Using whole mount immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, we found that the nervous system of echinoid early juveniles is composed of three main structures: a basiepidermal nerve plexus, five radial nerve cords connected by a circumoral nerve ring, and peripheral nerves innervating the appendages. Our whole mount preparations further allowed us to obtain thorough descriptions of these structures and of several innervation patterns, in particular at the level of the appendages. Detailed comparisons of the echinoid juvenile nervous system with those of asteroid and holothuroid juveniles moreover supported a general conservation of the main neural structures in all three species, including at the level of the appendages. Our results support the previously proposed hypotheses for the existence of two neural units in echinoderms: one consisting of the basiepidermal nerve plexus to process sensory stimuli locally and one composed of the radial nerve cords and the peripheral nerves constituting a centralized control system. This study provides the basis for more in‐depth comparisons of the echinoderm adult nervous system with those of other animals, in particular hemichordates and chordates, to address the long‐standing controversies about deuterostome nervous system evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Causal associations between modifiable risk factors and the Alzheimer’s phenome</title>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25918?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To infer causal relationships between 22 previously reported risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and the “AD phenome”: AD, AD age of onset (AAOS), hippocampal volume, cortical surface area and thickness, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;, tau, and ptau&lt;sub&gt;181&lt;/sub&gt;, and the neuropathological burden of neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and vascular brain injury (VBI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for the 22 risk factors were computed in 26,431 AD cases/controls and the association with AD was evaluated using logistic regression. Two‐sample Mendelian randomization was used to infer the causal effect of risk factors on the AD phenome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRS for increased education and diastolic blood pressure were associated with reduced risk for AD. MR indicated that only education was causally associated with reduced risk of AD, delayed AAOS, and increased cortical surface area and thickness. Total‐ and LDL‐cholesterol levels were causally associated with increased neuritic plaque burden, though the effects were driven by SNPs within the &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; locus. Diastolic blood pressure and pulse pressure are causally associated with increased risk of VBI. Furthermore, total cholesterol was associated with decreased hippocampal volume; smoking initiation with decreased cortical thickness; type 2 diabetes with an earlier AAOS; and sleep duration with increased cortical thickness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our comprehensive examination of the genetic evidence for the causal relationships between previously reported risk factors in AD using PRS and MR, supports a causal role for education, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking, and diabetes with the AD phenome.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Astrocytes—The Ultimate Effectors of Long-Range Neuromodulatory Networks?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.581075</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.581075</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It was long thought that astrocytes, given their lack of electrical signaling, were not involved in communication with neurons. However, we now know that one astrocyte on average maintains and regulates the extracellular neurotransmitter and potassium levels of more than 140,000 synapses, both excitatory and inhibitory, within their individual domains, and form a syncytium that can propagate calcium waves to affect distant cells via release of “gliotransmitters” such as glutamate, ATP, or adenosine. Neuromodulators can affect signal-to-noise and frequency transmission within cortical circuits by effects on inhibition, allowing for the filtering of relevant vs. irrelevant stimuli. Moreover, synchronized “resting” and desynchronized “activated” brain states are gated by short bursts of high-frequency neuromodulatory activity, highlighting the need for neuromodulation that is robust, rapid, and far-reaching. As many neuromodulators are released in a volume manner where degradation/uptake and the confines of the complex CNS limit diffusion distance, we ask the question—are astrocytes responsible for rapidly extending neuromodulator actions to every synapse? Neuromodulators are known to influence transitions between brain states, leading to control over plasticity, responses to salient stimuli, wakefulness, and sleep. These rapid and wide-spread state transitions demand that neuromodulators can simultaneously influence large and diverse regions in a manner that should be impossible given the limitations of simple diffusion. Intriguingly, astrocytes are ideally situated to amplify/extend neuromodulator effects over large populations of synapses given that each astrocyte can: (1) ensheath a large number of synapses; (2) release gliotransmitters (glutamate/ATP/adenosine) known to affect inhibition; (3) regulate extracellular potassium that can affect excitability and excitation/inhibition balance; and (4) express receptors for all neuromodulators. In this review article, we explore the hypothesis that astrocytes extend and amplify neuromodulatory influences on neuronal networks via alterations in calcium dynamics, the release of gliotransmitters, and potassium homeostasis. Given that neuromodulatory networks are at the core of our sleep-wake cycle and behavioral states, and determine how we interact with our environment, this review article highlights the importance of basic astrocyte function in homeostasis, general cognition, and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: A Computational Model Integrating Multiple Phenomena on Cued Fear Conditioning, Extinction, and Reinstatement</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.569108</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.569108</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Conditioning, extinction, and reinstatement are fundamental learning processes of animal adaptation, also strongly involved in human pathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and dependencies. Cued fear conditioning, extinction, restatement, and systematic manipulations of the underlying brain amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex, represent key experimental paradigms to study such processes. Numerous empirical studies have revealed several aspects and the neural systems and plasticity underlying them, but at the moment we lack a comprehensive view. Here we propose a computational model based on firing rate leaky units that contributes to such integration by accounting for 25 different experiments on fear conditioning, extinction, and restatement, on the basis of a single neural architecture having a structure and plasticity grounded in known brain biology. This allows the model to furnish three novel contributions to understand these open issues: (a) the functioning of the central and lateral amygdala system supporting conditioning; (b) the role played by the endocannabinoids system in within- and between-session extinction; (c) the formation of three important types of neurons underlying fear processing, namely fear, extinction, and persistent neurons. The model integration of the results on fear conditioning goes substantially beyond what was done in previous models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: SeSBAT: Single Subject Brain Analysis Toolbox. Application to Huntington’s Disease as a Preliminary Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.488652</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.488652</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers require complex processing routines that are time-consuming and labor-intensive for clinical users. The Single Subject Brain Analysis Toolbox (SeSBAT) is a fully automated MATLAB toolbox with a graphical user interface (GUI) that offers standardized and optimized protocols for the pre-processing and analysis of anatomical MRI data at the single-subject level. In this study, the two-fold strategy provided by SeSBAT is illustrated through its application on a cohort of 42 patients with Huntington’s disease (HD), in pre-manifest and early manifest stages, as a suitable model of neurodegenerative processes. On the one hand, hypothesis-driven analysis can be used to extract biomarkers of neurodegeneration in specific brain regions of interest (ROI-based analysis). On the other hand, an exploratory voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach can detect volume changes due to neurodegeneration throughout the whole brain (whole-brain analysis). That illustration reveals the potential of SeSBAT in providing potential prognostic biomarkers in neurodegenerative processes in clinics, which could be critical to overcoming the limitations of current qualitative evaluation strategies, and thus improve the diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, the importance of the availability of tools for characterization at the single-subject level has been emphasized, as there is high interindividual variability in the pattern of neurodegeneration. Thus, tools like SeSBAT could pave the way towards more effective and personalized medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Detection of Synaptic Proteins in Microglia by Flow Cytometry</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence indicates that microglia actively remove synapses in vivo, thereby playing a key role in synaptic refinement and modulation of brain connectivity. This phenomenon was mainly investigated in immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. However, a quantification of synaptic material in microglia using these techniques is extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we aimed to quantify synaptic proteins in microglia using flow cytometry. With this approach, we first showed that microglia from the healthy adult mouse brain contain a detectable level of VGLUT1 protein. Next, we found more than two-fold increased VGLUT1 immunoreactivity in microglia from the developing brain (P15) as compared to adult microglia. These data indicate that microglia-mediated synaptic pruning mostly occurs during the brain developmental period. We then quantified the VGLUT1 staining in microglia in two transgenic models characterized by pathological microglia-mediated synaptic pruning. In the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) microglia exhibited a significant increase in VGLUT1 immunoreactivity before the onset of amyloid pathology. Moreover, conditional deletion of TDP-43 in microglia, which causes a hyper-phagocytic phenotype associated with synaptic loss, also resulted in increased VGLUT1 immunoreactivity within microglia. This work provides a quantitative assessment of synaptic proteins in microglia, under homeostasis, and in mouse models of disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Effects of Retinal Transcription Regulation After GB20 Needling Treatment in Retina With Optic Neuritis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.568449</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.568449</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Optic neuritis (ON) is one of the most frequent symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) that results in progressive loss of axons and neurons. In clinical trials of Traditional Chinese Medicine, needling at the GB20 acupoint has been widely used for the treatment of ocular diseases, including ON. However, the molecular mechanisms of needling at this site are still unclear. In this study, we generated an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model and investigated the effects of needling treatment at the GB20 acupoint on retina with EAE-associated ON. RNA sequencing of the retinal transcriptome revealed that, of the 234 differentially expressed genes induced by ON, 100 genes were upregulated, and 134 genes were downregulated by ON, while needling at the GB20 acupoint specifically reversed the expression of 21 genes compared with control treatment at GV16 acupoint. Among the reversed genes, Nr4a3, Sncg, Uchl1, and Tppp3 were involved in axon development and regeneration and were downregulated by ON, indicating the beneficial effect of needling at GB20. Further gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that needling at GB20 affected the molecular process of Circadian rhythm in mouse retina with ON. Our study first reported that needling treatment after ON at the GB20 acupoint regulated gene expression of the retina and reversed the expression of downregulated axon development-related genes. This study also demonstrated that GV16 was a perfect control treatment site for GB20 in animal research. Our study provided a scientific basis for needling treatments at GB20 for ocular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Serum Neurofilament Levels in Children With Febrile Seizures and in Controls</title>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Neuroaxonal damage is reflected by serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) values in a variety of acute and degenerative diseases of the brain. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of febrile and epileptic seizures on sNfL, serum copeptin, and prolactin levels in children compared with children with febrile infections without convulsions.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A prospective cross-sectional study was performed in children aging 6 months to 5 years presenting with fever (controls, n = 61), febrile seizures (FS, n = 78), or epileptic seizures (ES, n = 16) at our emergency department. sNfL, copeptin, and prolactin were measured within a few hours after the event in addition to standard clinical, neurophysiological, and laboratory assessment. All children were followed up for at least 1 year after presentation concerning recurrent seizures.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Serum copeptin values were on average 4.1-fold higher in FS and 3.2-fold higher in ES compared with controls (both p &amp;lt; 0.01). Serum prolactin values were on average 1.3-fold higher in FS compared with controls ( p &amp;lt; 0.01) and without difference between ES and controls. There was no significant difference of mean sNfL values (95% CI) between all three groups, FS 21.7 pg/ml (19.6–23.9), ES 17.7 pg/ml (13.8–21.6), and controls 23.4 pg/ml (19.2–27.4). In multivariable analysis, age was the most important predictor of sNfL, followed by sex and C reactive protein. Neither the duration of seizures nor the time elapsed from seizure onset to blood sampling had an impact on sNfL. None of the three biomarkers were related to recurrent seizures.&lt;/p&gt;Significance&lt;p&gt;Serum neurofilament light is not elevated during short recovery time after FS when compared with children presenting febrile infections without seizures. We demonstrate an age-dependent decrease of sNfL from early childhood until school age. In contrast to sNfL levels, copeptin and prolactin serum levels are elevated after FS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Effective and Accurate Diagnosis of Subjective Cognitive Decline Based on Functional Connection and Graph Theory View</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is considered the earliest preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that precedes mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Effective and accurate diagnosis of SCD is crucial for early detection of and timely intervention in AD. In this study, brain functional connectome (i.e., functional connections and graph theory metrics) based on the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provided multiple information about brain networks and has been used to distinguish individuals with SCD from normal controls (NCs). The consensus connections and the discriminative nodal graph metrics selected by group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) mainly distributed in the prefrontal and frontal cortices and the subcortical regions corresponded to default mode network (DMN) and frontoparietal task control network. Nodal efficiency and nodal shortest path showed the most significant discriminative ability among the selected nodal graph metrics. Furthermore, the comparison results of topological attributes suggested that the brain network integration function was weakened and network segregation function was enhanced in SCD patients. Moreover, the combination of brain connectome information based on multiple kernel-support vector machine (MK-SVM) achieved the best classification performance with 83.33% accuracy, 90.00% sensitivity, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.927. The findings of this study provided a new perspective to combine machine learning methods with exploration of brain pathophysiological mechanisms in SCD and offered potential neuroimaging biomarkers for diagnosis of early-stage AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Effects of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K Signaling Pathway Regulation on Neuron Remodeling Caused by Translocation Repair</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Peripheral nerve injury repair has been considered a difficult problem in the field of trauma for a long time. Conventional surgical methods are not applicable in some special types of nerve injury, prompting scholars to seek to develop more effective nerve translocation repair technologies. The purpose of this study was to explore the functional state of neurons in injured lower limbs after translocation repair, with a view to preliminarily clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Eighteen Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into the normal, tibial nerve in situ repair, and common peroneal nerve transposition repair tibial nerve groups. Nerve function assessment and immunohistochemical staining of neurofilament 200 (NF-200), protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) in the dorsal root ganglia were performed at 12 weeks after surgery. Tibial nerve function and neuroelectrophysiological analysis, osmic acid staining, muscle strength testing, and muscle fiber staining showed that the nerve translocation repair could restore the function of the recipient nerve to a certain extent; however, the repair was not as efficient as the in situ repair. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the translocation repair resulted in changes in the microstructure of neuronal cell bodies, and the expressions of Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K in the three dorsal root ganglia groups were significantly different (p &amp;lt; 0.05). This study demonstrates that the nerve translocation repair technology sets up a new reflex loop, with the corresponding neuroskeletal adjustments, in which, donor neurons dominate the recipient nerves. This indicates that nerve translocation repair technology can lead to neuronal remodeling and is important as a supplementary treatment for a peripheral nerve injury. Furthermore, the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway may be involved in the formation of the new neural reflex loop created as a result of the translocation repair.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairment is a well-defined complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but the neural mechanisms are largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;The study aimed to assess white matter (WM) microstructure changes and their relationship with cognitive impairment development during CKD progression.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) datasets were acquired from 38 patients with CKD (19 patients were at stage 3; 19 patients were at stage 4) and 22 healthy controls (HCs). Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was implemented to assess the differences in WM integrity among the three groups. The associations between abnormal WM integrity and clinical indicators (digit symbol test scores, the type A number connection test scores, hemoglobin, serum urea, serum creatinine, serum calcium, and serum potassium levels) were also computed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with patients with CKD at stage 3 and HCs, patients with CKD at stage 4 showed significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean diffusivity (MD) in the corpus callosum (CC), anterior thalamic radiation, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Correlation analysis showed that the MD in the genu of CC was negatively associated with the digit symbol test scores (r = -0.61, p = 0.01), and the FA in the left anterior thalamic radiation was positively associated with the level of serum calcium (r = 0.58, p = 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Patients with non-end-stage CKD have multiple abnormalities in WM regions. DTI metrics change with the progression of CKD and are primarily associated with cognitive impairment. The reduced integrity of WM tracts may be related to a low level of blood calcium.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Perspective: Phase Amplitude Coupling–Based Phase–Dependent Neuromodulation in Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective surgical therapy for Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, limitations of the DBS systems have led to great interest in adaptive neuromodulation systems that can dynamically adjust stimulation parameters to meet concurrent therapeutic demand. Constant high-frequency motor cortex stimulation has not been remarkably efficacious, which has led to greater focus on modulation of subcortical targets. Understanding of the importance of timing in both cortical and subcortical stimulation has generated an interest in developing more refined, parsimonious stimulation techniques based on critical oscillatory activities of the brain. Concurrently, much effort has been put into identifying biomarkers of both parkinsonian and physiological patterns of neuronal activities to drive next generation of adaptive brain stimulation systems. One such biomarker is beta-gamma phase amplitude coupling (PAC) that is detected in the motor cortex. PAC is strongly correlated with parkinsonian specific motor signs and symptoms and respond to therapies in a dose-dependent manner. PAC may represent the overall state of the parkinsonian motor network and have less instantaneously dynamic fluctuation during movement. These findings raise the possibility of novel neuromodulation paradigms that are potentially less invasiveness than DBS. Successful application of PAC in neuromodulation may necessitate phase-dependent stimulation technique, which aims to deliver precisely timed stimulation pulses to a specific phase to predictably modulate to selectively modulate pathological network activities and behavior in real time. Overcoming current technical challenges can lead to deeper understanding of the parkinsonian pathophysiology and development of novel neuromodulatory therapies with potentially less side-effects and higher therapeutic efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Simultaneous Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Aspects of Technical Implementation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The simultaneous transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a unique opportunity to non-invasively stimulate brain circuits while simultaneously monitoring changes in brain activity. However, to take advantage of this multimodal technique, some technical issues need to be considered/addressed. In this work, we evaluated technical issues associated with the setup and utilization of this multimodal tool, such as the use of a large single-channel radio frequency (rf) coil, and the artifacts induced by TMS when interleaved with the echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence. We demonstrated that good image quality can be achieved with this rf coil and that the adoption of axial imaging orientation in conjunction with a safe interval of 100 ms, between the TMS pulse and imaging acquisition, is a suitable combination to eliminate potential image artifacts when using the combined TMS-fMRI technique in 3-T MRI scanners.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Electroacupuncture Promoted Nerve Repair After Peripheral Nerve Injury by Regulating miR-1b and Its Target Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.525144</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.525144</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence indicates that electroacupuncture (EA) has a definite effect on the treatment of peripheral nerve injury (PNI), but its mechanism is not completely clear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the regulation of a variety of biological processes, and EA may enhance PNI repair by regulating miRNAs. In this study, the rat sciatic nerve injury model was treated with EA for 4 weeks. Acupoints Huantiao (GB30) and Zusanli (ST36) were stimulated by EA 20 min once a day, 6 days a week for 4 weeks. We found that EA treatment downregulated the expression of miR-1b in the local injured nerve. In vitro experiments showed that overexpression of miR-1b inhibited the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in rat Schwann cell (SC) line, while BDNF knockdown inhibited the proliferation, migration, and promoted apoptosis of SCs. Subsequently, the rat model of sciatic nerve injury was treated by EA treatment and injection of agomir-1b or antagomir-1b. The nerve conduction velocity ratio (NCV), sciatic functional index (SFI), and S100 immunofluorescence staining were examined and showed that compared with the model group, NCV, SFI, proliferation of SC, and expression of BDNF in the injured nerves of rats treated with EA or EA + anti-miR-1b were elevated, while EA + miR-1b was reduced, indicating that EA promoted sciatic nerve function recovery and SC proliferation through downregulating miR-1b. To summarize, EA may promote the proliferation, migration of SC, and nerve repair after PNI by regulating miR-1b, which targets BDNF.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: PET Imaging for Dynamically Monitoring Neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 Mouse Model Using [18F]DPA714</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00810</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: In the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), microglia play an increasingly important role. Molecular imaging of neuroinflammatory targeting microglia activation and the high expression of 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) has become a hot topic of research in recent years. Dynamic monitoring neuroinflammation is crucial for discovering the best time point of anti-inflammatory therapy. Motivated by this, Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in an APP/PS1 mouse model of AD, using &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-labeled DPA-714 to monitor microglia activation and neuroinflammation, were performed in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We prepared [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DPA714 and tested the biological characteristics of the molecular probe in normal mice. To obtain a higher radiochemical yield, we improved the [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-fluorination conditions in the precursor dosage, reaction temperature, and synthesis time. We performed [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DPA714 PET scanning on APP/PS1 mice at 6–7, 9–10, 12–13, and 15–16 months of age, respectively. The same experiments were conducted in Wild-type (Wt) mice as a control. Referring to the [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DPA714 concentrated situation in the brain, we performed blocking experiments with PK11195 (1 mg/kg) in 12–13-months-old APP/PS1 mice to confirm the specificity of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DPA714 for TSPO in the APP/PS1 mice. Reconstructed brain PET images, fused with the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) template atlas, and the volumes of interests (VOIs) of the hippocampus and cortex were determined. The distribution of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DPA714 in the brain tissues of 15–16-months-old APP/PS1 and Wt mice were studied by immunofluorescence staining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Through the reaction of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F, with 2 mg precursor dissolved in 300 ul acetonitrile at 105°C for 10 min, we obtained the optimal radiochemical yield of 42.3 ± 5.1% (non-decay correction). Quantitative analysis of brain PET images showed that the [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DPA714 uptake in the cortex and hippocampus of 12–13-months-old APP/PS1 mice was higher than that of the control mice of the same age (cortex/muscle: 2.77 ± 0.13 vs. 1.93 ± 0.32, p = 0.0014; hippocampus/muscle: 3.33 ± 0.10 vs. 2.10 ± 0.35, p = 0.0008). The same significant difference was found between 15- and 16-months-old APP/PS1 mice (cortex/muscle: 2.64 ± 0.14 vs. 1.86 ± 0.52, p=0.0159; hippocampus/muscle: 2.89 ± 0.53 vs. 1.77 ± 0.48, p = 0.0050). Immunofluorescence staining showed that the activation of microglia and the level of TSPO expression in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice were significantly higher than Wt mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DPA714, a molecular probe for targeting TSPO, showed great potential in monitoring microglia activation and neuroinflammation, which can be helpful in discovering the best time point for anti-inflammatory therapy in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The UF Deep Brain Stimulation Cognitive Rating Scale (DBS-CRS): Clinical Decision Making, Validity, and Outcomes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.578216</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To more efficiently communicate the results of neuropsychological assessment to interdisciplinary teams, the University of Florida Neuropsychology Service developed a Deep Brain Stimulation-Cognitive Rating Scale (DBS-CRS). This tool condensed results of a 3-h exam into a five-point scale ranging from 1 (least) to 5 (most) cognitive concern for DBS surgery. In this study, we evaluated the role of the DBS-CRS in clinical decisions by the interdisciplinary team to proceed to surgery, its relationship to objective neuropsychological scores, and its predictive utility for clinical outcome. We retrospectively examined 189 patients with Parkinson’s disease who were evaluated for DBS candidacy (mean age 64.8 [SD 9.2], disease duration 8.9 years [SD 5.0], UPDRS-Part III off medication 38.5 [SD 10.5], Dementia Rating Scale-II 135.4 [SD 6.0]). Approximately 19% of patients did not proceed to surgery, with neuropsychological red flags being the most commonly documented reason (57%). Patients who underwent DBS surgery had significantly better DBS-CRS scores than those who did not (p &amp;lt; 0.001). The two strongest and unique neuropsychological contributors to DBS-CRS ratings were delayed memory and executive function, followed by language and visuoperception, based on hierarchical linear regression that accounted for 77.2% of the variance. In terms of outcome, DBS-CRS scores were associated with higher quality of life, less severe motor symptoms, and better daily functioning 6 months following DBS surgery. Together, these findings support the construct and predictive validity of the DBS-CRS as a concise tool for effectively communicating pre-DBS cognitive concerns to an interdisciplinary team, thereby aiding decision making in potential DBS candidates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Correlates of Stepping in Healthy Elderly: Parietal and Prefrontal Cortex Activation Reflects Cognitive-Motor Interference Effects</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gait analysis involving cognitive-motor dual task (DT) is a diagnostic tool in geriatrics. Cognitive-motor interference effects during DT, such as decreased walking speed and increased step-to-step variability, have a high predictive value for fall risk and cognitive decline. Previously we showed the feasibility of DT during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using an MRI-compatible stepping device. Here, we improved the DT-fMRI protocol with respect to task difficulty and signal robustness, making it more suitable for individualized analysis to better understand the neuronal substrates of cognitive-motor interference effects. Thirty healthy elderly subjects performed cognitive and motor single tasks (ST; stepping or finger tapping), as well as combined cognitive-motor DT during fMRI. After whole brain group level analysis, a region-of-interest (ROI) analysis and the computation of dual task costs (DTC = activation difference ratio ST/DT) at individual level were performed. Activations in the primary (M1) and secondary motor as well as in parietal and prefrontal cortex were measured at the group level during DT. Motor areas showed decreased activation whereas parietal and prefrontal areas showed increased activation in DT vs. ST. Stepping yielded more distinctive activations in DT vs. ST than finger tapping. At the individual level, the most robust activations (based on occurrence probability and signal strength) were measured in the stepping condition, in M1, supplementary motor area (SMA) and superior parietal lobule/intraparietal sulcus (SPL/IPS). The distribution of individual DTC in SPL/IPS during stepping suggested a separation of subjects in groups with high vs. low DTC. This study proposes an improved cognitive-motor DT-fMRI protocol and a standardized analysis routine of functional neuronal markers for cognitive-motor interference at the individual level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Continuous Theta-Burst Stimulation Intensity Dependently Facilitates Motor-Evoked Potentials Following Focal Electrical Stimulation of the Rat Motor Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.585624</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.585624</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although theta-burst stimulation (TBS) is known to differentially modify motor cortical excitability according to stimulus conditions in humans, whether similar effects can be seen in animals, in particular rats, remains to be defined. Given the importance of experimental rat models for humans, this study explored this stimulation paradigm in rats. Specifically, this study aimed to explore corticospinal excitability after TBS in anesthetized animals to confirm its comparability with human results. Both inhibition-facilitation configurations using paired electrical stimulation protocols and the effects of the TBS paradigm on motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in rat descending motor pathways were assessed. Paired-stimulation MEPs showed inhibition [interstimulus interval (ISI): 3 ms] and facilitation (11 ms) patterns under medetomidine/midazolam/butorphanol (MMB) anesthesia. Furthermore, while ketamine and xylazine (K/X) anesthesia completely blocked facilitation at 11-ms ISI, inhibition at a 3-ms ISI was preserved. Continuous and intermittent TBS strongly facilitated MEPs depending on stimulus intensity, persisting for up to 25 min under both MMB and K/X anesthesia. These findings are similar to the intracortical inhibition and facilitation observed in the human motor cortex using paired-pulse magnetic stimulation, particularly the glutamate-mediated facilitation phase. However, different TBS facilitatory mechanisms occur in the rat motor cortex. These different TBS facilitatory mechanisms affect the comparability and interpretations of TBS between rat and human models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Lactate Transporters Mediate Glia-Neuron Metabolic Crosstalk in Homeostasis and Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Research over the last couple of decades has provided novel insights into lactate neurobiology and the implications of lactate transport-driven neuroenergetics in health and diseases of peripheral nerve and the brain. The expression pattern of lactate transporters in glia and neurons has now been described, though notable controversies and discrepancies remain. Importantly, down- and up-regulation experiments are underway to better understand the function of these transporters in different systems. Lactate transporters in peripheral nerves are important for maintenance of axon and myelin integrity, motor end-plate integrity, the development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), and the functional recovery following nerve injuries. Similarly, brain energy metabolism and functions ranging from development to synaptic plasticity to axonal integrity are also dependent on lactate transport primarily between glia and neurons. This review is focused on critically analysing the expression pattern and the functions of lactate transporters in peripheral nerves and the brain and highlighting their role in glia-neuron metabolic crosstalk in physiological and pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Cholinergic Dysfunction Involvement in Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion-Induced Impairment of Medial Septum–dCA1 Neurocircuit in Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.586591</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.586591</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is considered a preclinical condition of mild cognitive impairment and thought to precede dementia. However, as the principal cholinergic source of hippocampus, whether the septo-hippocampal neurocircuit was impaired after CCH is still unknown. In this study, we established the CCH rat model by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO). Under anesthesia, the medial septum (MS) of rats was stimulated to evoke the field excitatory post-synaptic potential (fEPSP) in the pyramidal cell layer of dCA1. Consequently, we observed decreased amplitude of fEPSP and increased paired-pulse ratio (PPR) after 8-week CCH. After tail pinch, we also found decreased peak frequency and shortened duration of hippocampal theta rhythm in 2VO rats, indicating the dysfunction of septo-hippocampal neurocircuit. Besides, by intracerebroventricularly injecting GABAergic inhibitor (bicuculline) and cholinergic inhibitors (scopolamine and mecamylamine), we found that CCH impaired both the pre-synaptic cholinergic release and the post-synaptic nAChR function in MS–dCA1 circuits. These results gave an insight into the role of CCH in the impairment of cholinergic MS–dCA1 neurocircuits. These findings may provide a new idea about the CCH-induced neurodegenerative changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Beyond the Hippocampus and the SVZ: Adult Neurogenesis Throughout the Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.576444</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.576444</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Convincing evidence has repeatedly shown that new neurons are produced in the mammalian brain into adulthood. Adult neurogenesis has been best described in the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ), in which a series of distinct stages of neuronal development has been well characterized. However, more recently, new neurons have also been found in other brain regions of the adult mammalian brain, including the hypothalamus, striatum, substantia nigra, cortex, and amygdala. While some studies have suggested that these new neurons originate from endogenous stem cell pools located within these brain regions, others have shown the migration of neurons from the SVZ to these regions. Notably, it has been shown that the generation of new neurons in these brain regions is impacted by neurologic processes such as stroke/ischemia and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, numerous factors such as neurotrophic support, pharmacologic interventions, environmental exposures, and stem cell therapy can modulate this endogenous process. While the presence and significance of adult neurogenesis in the human brain (and particularly outside of the classical neurogenic regions) is still an area of debate, this intrinsic neurogenic potential and its possible regulation through therapeutic measures present an exciting alternative for the treatment of several neurologic conditions. This review summarizes evidence in support of the classic and novel neurogenic zones present within the mammalian brain and discusses the functional significance of these new neurons as well as the factors that regulate their production. Finally, it also discusses the potential clinical applications of promoting neurogenesis outside of the classical neurogenic niches, particularly in the hypothalamus, cortex, striatum, substantia nigra, and amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons are polarized in structure with a cytoplasmic compartment extending into dendrites and a long axon that terminates at the synapse. The high level of compartmentalization imposes specific challenges for protein quality control in neurons making them vulnerable to disturbances that may lead to neurological dysfunctions including neuropsychiatric diseases. Synapse and dendrites undergo structural modulations regulated by neuronal activity involve key proteins requiring strict control of their turnover rates and degradation pathways. Recent advances in the study of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy processes have brought novel insights into the specific roles of these processes in neuronal physiology and synaptic signaling. In this review, we highlight recent data and concepts about UPR and autophagy in neuropsychiatric disorders and synaptic plasticity including a brief outline of possible therapeutic approaches to influence UPR and autophagy signaling in these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mir363-3p Treatment Attenuates Long-Term Cognitive Deficits Precipitated by an Ischemic Stroke in Middle-Aged Female Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairment and memory loss are commonly seen after stroke and a third of patients will develop signs of dementia a year after stroke. Despite a large number of studies on the beneficial effects of neuroprotectants, few studies have examined the effects of these compounds/interventions on long-term cognitive impairment. Our previous work showed that the microRNA mir363-3p reduced infarct volume and sensory-motor impairment in the acute stage of stroke in middle-aged females but not males. Thus, the present study determined the impact of mir363-3p treatment on stroke-induced cognitive impairment in middle-aged females. Sprague–Dawley female rats (12 months of age) were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo; or sham surgery) and injected (iv) with mir363-3p mimic (MCAo + mir363-3p) or scrambled oligos (MCAo + scrambled) 4 h later. Sensory-motor performance was assessed in the acute phase (2–5 days after stroke), while all other behaviors were tested 6 months after MCAo (18 months of age). Cognitive function was assessed by the novel object recognition test (declarative memory) and the Barnes maze (spatial memory). The MCAo + scrambled group showed reduced preference for a novel object after the stroke and poor learning in the spatial memory task. In contrast, mir363-3p treated animals were similar to either their baseline performance or to the sham group. Histological analysis showed significant deterioration of specific white matter tracts due to stroke, which was attenuated in mir363-3p treated animals. The present data builds on our previous finding to show that a neuroprotectant can abrogate the long-term effects of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Interleukin-17A: The Key Cytokine in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.566922</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the loss of neurons and/or myelin sheath, which deteriorate over time and cause dysfunction. Interleukin 17A is the signature cytokine of a subset of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; helper T cells known as Th17 cells, and the IL-17 cytokine family contains six cytokines and five receptors. Recently, several studies have suggested a pivotal role for the interleukin-17A (IL-17A) cytokine family in human inflammatory or autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative diseases, including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and glaucoma. Studies in recent years have shown that the mechanism of action of IL-17A is more subtle than simply causing inflammation. Although the specific mechanism of IL-17A in neurodegenerative diseases is still controversial, it is generally accepted now that IL-17A causes diseases by activating glial cells. In this review article, we will focus on the function of IL-17A, in particular the proposed roles of IL-17A, in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Aging of the Vascular System and Neural Diseases</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vertebrates have acquired complex high-order functions facilitated by the dispersion of vascular and neural networks to every corner of the body. Blood vessels deliver oxygen and nutrients to all cells and provide essential transport systems for removing waste products. For these functions, tissue vascularization must be spatiotemporally appropriate. Recent studies revealed that blood vessels create a tissue-specific niche, thus attracting attention as biologically active sites for tissue development. Each capillary network is critical for maintaining proper brain function because age-related and disease-related impairment of cognitive function is associated with the loss or diminishment of brain capillaries. This review article highlights how structural and functional alterations in the brain vessels may change with age and neurogenerative diseases. Capillaries are also responsible for filtering toxic byproducts, providing an appropriate vascular environment for neuronal function. Accumulation of amyloid β is a key event in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. Recent studies have focused on associations reported between Alzheimer’s disease and vascular aging. Furthermore, the glymphatic system and meningeal lymphatic systems contribute to a functional unit for clearance of amyloid β from the brain from the central nervous system into the cervical lymph nodes. This review article will also focus on recent advances in stem cell therapies that aim at repopulation or regeneration of a degenerating vascular system for neural diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Enhancing Working Memory Based on Mismatch Negativity Neurofeedback in Subjective Cognitive Decline Patients: A Preliminary Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00263</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00263</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mismatch negativity (MMN) is suitable for studies of preattentive auditory discriminability and the auditory memory trace. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is an ideal target for early therapeutic intervention because SCD occurs at preclinical stages many years before the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). According to a novel lifespan-based model of dementia risk, hearing loss is considered the greatest potentially modifiable risk factor of dementia among nine health and lifestyle factors, and hearing impairment is associated with cognitive decline. Therefore, we propose a neurofeedback training based on MMN, which is an objective index of auditory discriminability, to regulate sensory ability and memory as a non-pharmacological intervention (NPI) in SCD patients. Seventeen subjects meeting the standardized clinical evaluations for SCD received neurofeedback training. The auditory frequency discrimination test, the visual digital N-back (1-, 2-, and 3-back), auditory digital N-back (1-, 2-, and 3-back), and auditory tone N-back (1-, 2-, and 3-back) tasks were used pre- and post-training in all SCD patients. The intervention schedule comprised five 60-min training sessions over 2 weeks. The results indicate that the subjects who received neurofeedback training had successfully improved the amplitude of MMN at the parietal electrode (Pz). A slight decrease in the threshold of auditory frequency discrimination was observed after neurofeedback training. Notably, after neurofeedback training, the working memory (WM) performance was significantly enhanced in the auditory tone 3-back test. Moreover, improvements in the accuracy of all WM tests relative to the baseline were observed, although the changes were not significant. To the best of our knowledge, our preliminary study is the first to investigate the effects of MMN neurofeedback training on WM in SCD patients, and our results suggest that MMN neurofeedback may represent an effective treatment for intervention in SCD patients and the elderly with aging memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>With implantation mouse stromal cells begin to transform into epithelial-like cells surrounding the implantation chamber forming an avascular zone called the primary decidual zone (PDZ). In mouse, the PDZ forms a transient, size-dependent permeable barrier to protect the embryo from maternal circulating harmful agents. The process of decidualization is critical for early pregnancy maintenance in mice and humans. Mice deficient in cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, show compromised PDZ with dysregulated angiogenic factors, resulting in the retention of blood vessels and macrophages. This phenotype is replicated in &lt;i&gt;Cnr1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, but not in &lt;i&gt;Cnr2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;n vitro&lt;/i&gt; decidualization models suggest that &lt;i&gt;Cnr1&lt;/i&gt; levels substantially increase in mouse and human decidualizing stromal cells, and that neutralization of CB1 signaling suppresses decidualization and misregulates angiogenic factors. In sum, we propose that implantation quality depends on appropriate angiogenic events driven by the integration of CB2 in endothelial cells and CB1 in decidual cells.</description>

	<title>eLife: Phenotypic analysis of the unstimulated in vivo HIV CD4 T cell reservoir</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60933</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60933</link>
	<description>The latent reservoir is a major barrier to HIV cure. As latently infected cells cannot be phenotyped directly, the features of the in vivo reservoir have remained elusive. Here, we describe a method that leverages high-dimensional phenotyping using CyTOF to trace latently infected cells reactivated ex vivo to their original pre-activation states. Our results suggest that, contrary to common assumptions, the reservoir is not randomly distributed among cell subsets, and is remarkably conserved between individuals. However, reservoir composition differs between tissues and blood, as do cells successfully reactivated by different latency reversing agents. By selecting 8–10 of our 39 original CyTOF markers, we were able to isolate highly purified populations of unstimulated in vivo latent cells. These purified populations were highly enriched for replication-competent and intact provirus, transcribed HIV, and displayed clonal expansion. The ability to isolate unstimulated latent cells from infected individuals enables previously impossible studies on HIV persistence.</description>

	<title>eLife: Lef1 expression in fibroblasts maintains developmental potential in adult skin to regenerate wounds</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60066</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60066</link>
	<description>Scars are a serious health concern for burn victims and individuals with skin conditions associated with wound healing. Here, we identify regenerative factors in neonatal murine skin that transforms adult skin to regenerate instead of only repairing wounds with a scar, without perturbing development and homeostasis. Using scRNA-seq to probe unsorted cells from regenerating, scarring, homeostatic, and developing skin, we identified neonatal papillary fibroblasts that form a transient regenerative cell type that promotes healthy skin regeneration in young skin. These fibroblasts are defined by the expression of a canonical Wnt transcription factor Lef1 and using gain- and loss of function genetic mouse models, we demonstrate that Lef1 expression in fibroblasts primes the adult skin macroenvironment to enhance skin repair, including regeneration of hair follicles with arrector pili muscles in healed wounds. Finally, we share our genomic data in an interactive, searchable companion website (&lt;a href=&quot;https://skinregeneration.org/&quot;&gt;https://skinregeneration.org/&lt;/a&gt;). Together, these data and resources provide a platform to leverage the regenerative abilities of neonatal skin to develop clinically tractable solutions that promote the regeneration of adult tissue.</description>

	<title>eLife: Genome expansion in early eukaryotes drove the transition from lateral gene transfer to meiotic sex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58873</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58873</link>
	<description>Prokaryotes acquire genes from the environment via lateral gene transfer (LGT). Recombination of environmental DNA can prevent the accumulation of deleterious mutations, but LGT was abandoned by the first eukaryotes in favour of sexual reproduction. Here we develop a theoretical model of a haploid population undergoing LGT which includes two new parameters, genome size and recombination length, neglected by previous theoretical models. The greater complexity of eukaryotes is linked with larger genomes and we demonstrate that the benefit of LGT declines rapidly with genome size. The degeneration of larger genomes can only be resisted by increases in recombination length, to the same order as genome size – as occurs in meiosis. Our results can explain the strong selective pressure towards the evolution of sexual cell fusion and reciprocal recombination during early eukaryotic evolution – the origin of meiotic sex.</description>

	<description>Cancer testis antigens (CTAs) are proteins whose expression is normally restricted to the testis but anomalously activated in human cancer. In sperm, a number of CTAs support energy generation, however whether they contribute to tumor metabolism is not understood. We describe human COX6B2, a component of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV). &lt;i&gt;COX6B2&lt;/i&gt; is expressed in human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and expression correlates with reduced survival time. COX6B2, but not its somatic isoform COX6B1, enhances activity of complex IV, increasing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; generation. Consequently, COX6B2-expressing cancer cells display a proliferative advantage, particularly in low oxygen. Conversely, depletion of COX6B2 attenuates OXPHOS and collapses mitochondrial membrane potential leading to cell death or senescence. COX6B2 is both necessary and sufficient for growth of human tumor xenografts in mice. Our findings reveal a previously unappreciated, tumor specific metabolic pathway hijacked from one of the most ATP-intensive processes in the animal kingdom: sperm motility.</description>

	<title>eLife: Genome-wide CRISPR screens of oral squamous cell carcinoma reveal fitness genes in the Hippo pathway</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57761</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57761</link>
	<description>New therapeutic targets for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are urgently needed. We conducted genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens in 21 OSCC cell lines, primarily derived from Asians, to identify genetic vulnerabilities that can be explored as therapeutic targets. We identify known and novel fitness genes and demonstrate that many previously identified OSCC-related cancer genes are non-essential and could have limited therapeutic value, while other fitness genes warrant further investigation for their potential as therapeutic targets. We validate a distinctive dependency on YAP1 and WWTR1 of the Hippo pathway, where the lost-of-fitness effect of one paralog can be compensated only in a subset of lines. We also discover that OSCCs with WWTR1 dependency signature are significantly associated with biomarkers of favourable response towards immunotherapy. In summary, we have delineated the genetic vulnerabilities of OSCC, enabling the prioritization of therapeutic targets for further exploration, including the targeting of YAP1 and WWTR1.</description>

	<title>eLife: Endothelial TGF-β signaling instructs smooth muscle cell development in the cardiac outflow tract</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57603</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57603</link>
	<description>The development of the cardiac outflow tract (OFT), which connects the heart to the great arteries, relies on a complex crosstalk between endothelial (ECs) and smooth muscle (SMCs) cells. Defects in OFT development can lead to severe malformations, including aortic aneurysms, which are frequently associated with impaired TGF-β signaling. To better understand the role of TGF-β signaling in OFT formation, we generated zebrafish lacking the TGF-β receptor Alk5 and found a strikingly specific dilation of the OFT: &lt;i&gt;alk5-/-&lt;/i&gt; OFTs exhibit increased EC numbers as well as extracellular matrix (ECM) and SMC disorganization. Surprisingly, endothelial-specific &lt;i&gt;alk5&lt;/i&gt; overexpression in &lt;i&gt;alk5&lt;/i&gt;-/- rescues the EC, ECM, and SMC defects. Transcriptomic analyses reveal downregulation of the ECM gene &lt;i&gt;fibulin-5,&lt;/i&gt; which when overexpressed in ECs ameliorates OFT morphology and function. These findings reveal a new requirement for endothelial TGF-β signaling in OFT morphogenesis and suggest an important role for the endothelium in the etiology of aortic malformations.</description>

	<title>eLife: Feed-forward recruitment of electrical synapses enhances synchronous spiking in the mouse cerebellar cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57344</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57344</link>
	<description>In the cerebellar cortex, molecular layer interneurons use chemical and electrical synapses to form subnetworks that fine-tune the spiking output of the cerebellum. Although electrical synapses can entrain activity within neuronal assemblies, their role in feed-forward circuits is less well explored. By combining whole-cell patch-clamp and 2-photon laser scanning microscopy of basket cells (BCs), we found that classical excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) are followed by GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-independent outward currents, reflecting the hyperpolarization component of spikelets (a synapse-evoked action potential passively propagating from electrically coupled neighbors). FF recruitment of the spikelet-mediated inhibition curtails the integration time window of concomitant excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and dampens their temporal integration. In contrast with GABAergic-mediated feed-forward inhibition, the depolarizing component of spikelets transiently increases the peak amplitude of EPSPs, and thus postsynaptic spiking probability. Therefore, spikelet transmission can propagate within the BC network to generate synchronous inhibition of Purkinje cells, which can entrain cerebellar output for driving temporally precise behaviors.</description>

	<description>Hydrotropism and gravitropism are important for plant growth. Li et al. show that starch synthesis and amyloplast content are reduced in roots from light to dark, which is a normal root-growth condition in the field. These reduced levels allow normal gravitropism and are optimal for responding to moisture gradients.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Mutation bias interacts with composition bias to influence adaptive evolution</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alejandro V. Cano, Joshua L. Payne&lt;/p&gt;

Mutation is a biased stochastic process, with some types of mutations occurring more frequently than others. Previous work has used synthetic genotype-phenotype landscapes to study how such mutation bias affects adaptive evolution. Here, we consider 746 empirical genotype-phenotype landscapes, each of which describes the binding affinity of target DNA sequences to a transcription factor, to study the influence of mutation bias on adaptive evolution of increased binding affinity. By using empirical genotype-phenotype landscapes, we need to make only few assumptions about landscape topography and about the DNA sequences that each landscape contains. The latter is particularly important because the set of sequences that a landscape contains determines the types of mutations that can occur along a mutational path to an adaptive peak. That is, landscapes can exhibit a composition bias—a statistical enrichment of a particular type of mutation relative to a null expectation, throughout an entire landscape or along particular mutational paths—that is independent of any bias in the mutation process. Our results reveal the way in which composition bias interacts with biases in the mutation process under different population genetic conditions, and how such interaction impacts fundamental properties of adaptive evolution, such as its predictability, as well as the evolution of genetic diversity and mutational robustness.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hNnBJaMhiPI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Tuning network dynamics from criticality to an asynchronous state</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008268</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jingwen Li, Woodrow L. Shew&lt;/p&gt;

According to many experimental observations, neurons in cerebral cortex tend to operate in an asynchronous regime, firing independently of each other. In contrast, many other experimental observations reveal cortical population firing dynamics that are relatively coordinated and occasionally synchronous. These discrepant observations have naturally led to competing hypotheses. A commonly hypothesized explanation of asynchronous firing is that excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs are precisely correlated, nearly canceling each other, sometimes referred to as ‘balanced’ excitation and inhibition. On the other hand, the ‘criticality’ hypothesis posits an explanation of the more coordinated state that also requires a certain balance of excitatory and inhibitory interactions. Both hypotheses claim the same qualitative mechanism—properly balanced excitation and inhibition. Thus, a natural question arises: how are asynchronous population dynamics and critical dynamics related, how do they differ? Here we propose an answer to this question based on investigation of a simple, network-level computational model. We show that the strength of inhibitory synapses relative to excitatory synapses can be tuned from weak to strong to generate a family of models that spans a continuum from critical dynamics to asynchronous dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the coordinated dynamics of criticality and asynchronous dynamics can be generated by the same neural system if excitatory and inhibitory synapses are tuned appropriately.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pQLDDxBo8Qc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Characterizing chromatin folding coordinate and landscape with deep learning</title>

Genome organization is critical for setting up the spatial environment of gene transcription, and substantial progress has been made towards its high-resolution characterization. The underlying molecular mechanism for its establishment is much less understood. We applied a deep-learning approach, variational autoencoder (VAE), to analyze the fluctuation and heterogeneity of chromatin structures revealed by single-cell imaging and to identify a reaction coordinate for chromatin folding. This coordinate connects the seemingly random structures observed in individual cohesin-depleted cells as intermediate states along a folding pathway that leads to the formation of topologically associating domains (TAD). We showed that folding into wild-type-like structures remain energetically favorable in cohesin-depleted cells, potentially as a result of the phase separation between the two chromatin segments with active and repressive histone marks. The energetic stabilization, however, is not strong enough to overcome the entropic penalty, leading to the formation of only partially folded structures and the disappearance of TADs from contact maps upon averaging. Our study suggests that machine learning techniques, when combined with rigorous statistical mechanical analysis, are powerful tools for analyzing structural ensembles of chromatin.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YdoedOR0Mho&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A bacterial size law revealed by a coarse-grained model of cell physiology</title>

Universal observations in Biology are sometimes described as “laws”. In &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;, experimental studies performed over the past six decades have revealed major growth laws relating ribosomal mass fraction and cell size to the growth rate. Because they formalize complex emerging principles in biology, growth laws have been instrumental in shaping our understanding of bacterial physiology. Here, we discovered a novel size law that connects cell size to the inverse of the metabolic proteome mass fraction and the active fraction of ribosomes. We used a simple whole-cell coarse-grained model of cell physiology that combines the proteome allocation theory and the structural model of cell division. This integrated model captures all available experimental data connecting the cell proteome composition, ribosome activity, division size and growth rate in response to nutrient quality, antibiotic treatment and increased protein burden. Finally, a stochastic extension of the model explains non-trivial correlations observed in single cell experiments including the adder principle. This work provides a simple and robust theoretical framework for studying the fundamental principles of cell size determination in unicellular organisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O3t0l5JUN98&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Gene expression atlases have transformed our understanding of the development, composition and function of human tissues. New technologies promise improved cellular or molecular resolution, and have led to the identification of new cell types, or better defined cell states. But as new technologies emerge, information derived on old platforms becomes obsolete. We demonstrate that it is possible to combine a large number of different profiling experiments summarised from dozens of laboratories and representing hundreds of donors, to create an integrated molecular map of human tissue. As an example, we combine 850 samples from 38 platforms to build an integrated atlas of human blood cells. We achieve robust and unbiased cell type clustering using a variance partitioning method, selecting genes with low platform bias relative to biological variation. Other than an initial rescaling, no other transformation to the primary data is applied through batch correction or renormalisation. Additional data, including single-cell datasets, can be projected for comparison, classification and annotation. The resulting atlas provides a multi-scaled approach to visualise and analyse the relationships between sets of genes and blood cell lineages, including the maturation and activation of leukocytes in vivo and in vitro.
In allowing for data integration across hundreds of studies, we address a key reproduciblity challenge which is faced by any new technology. This allows us to draw on the deep phenotypes and functional annotations that accompany traditional profiling methods, and provide important context to the high cellular resolution of single cell profiling. Here, we have implemented the blood atlas in the open access Stemformatics.org platform, drawing on its extensive collection of curated transcriptome data. The method is simple, scalable and amenable for rapid deployment in other biological systems or computational workflows.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-bcs3i7bY_U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Domino-like transient dynamics at seizure onset in epilepsy</title>

The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) groups seizures into “focal”, “generalized” and “unknown” based on whether the seizure onset is confined to a brain region in one hemisphere, arises in several brain region simultaneously, or is not known, respectively. This separation fails to account for the rich diversity of clinically and experimentally observed spatiotemporal patterns of seizure onset and even less so for the properties of the brain networks generating them. We consider three different patterns of domino-like seizure onset in Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy (IGE) and present a novel approach to classification of seizures. To understand how these patterns are generated on networks requires understanding of the relationship between intrinsic node dynamics and coupling between nodes in the presence of noise, which currently is unknown. We investigate this interplay here in the framework of domino-like recruitment across a network. In particular, we use a phenomenological model of seizure onset with heterogeneous coupling and node properties, and show that in combination they generate a range of domino-like onset patterns observed in the IGE seizures. We further explore the individual contribution of heterogeneous node dynamics and coupling by interpreting in-vitro experimental data in which the speed of onset can be chemically modulated. This work contributes to a better understanding of possible drivers for the spatiotemporal patterns observed at seizure onset and may ultimately contribute to a more personalized approach to classification of seizure types in clinical practice.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lljNI7eQQPU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Interaction between filovirus glycoprotein (GP) and the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein is essential for membrane fusion during virus entry. Some single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in two surface-exposed loops of NPC1 are known to reduce viral infectivity. However, the dependence of differences in entry efficiency on SNPs remains unclear. Using vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotyped with Ebola and Marburg virus GPs, we investigated the cell-to-cell spread of viruses in cultured cells expressing NPC1 or SNP derivatives. Eclipse and virus-producing phases were assessed by &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; infection experiments, and we developed a mathematical model describing spatial-temporal virus spread. This mathematical model fit the plaque radius data well from day 2 to day 6. Based on the estimated parameters, we found that SNPs causing the P424A and D508N substitutions in NPC1 most effectively reduced the entry efficiency of Ebola and Marburg viruses, respectively. Our novel approach could be broadly applied to other virus plaque assays.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/X9MgJdJjBeQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Obesity and related metabolic diseases show clear sex-related differences. The growing burden of these diseases calls for better understanding of the age- and sex-related metabolic consequences. High-throughput lipidomic analyses of population-based cohorts offer an opportunity to identify disease-risk–associated biomarkers and to improve our understanding of lipid metabolism and biology at a population level. Here, we comprehensively examined the relationship between lipid classes/subclasses and molecular species with age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, we evaluated sex specificity in the association of the plasma lipidome with age and BMI. Some 747 targeted lipid measures, representing 706 molecular lipid species across 36 classes/subclasses, were measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometer on a total of 10,339 participants from the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab), with 563 lipid species being validated externally on 4,207 participants of the Busselton Health Study (BHS). Heat maps were constructed to visualise the relative differences in lipidomic profile between men and women. Multivariable linear regression analyses, including sex-interaction terms, were performed to assess the associations of lipid species with cardiometabolic phenotypes. Associations with age and sex were found for 472 (66.9%) and 583 (82.6%) lipid species, respectively. We further demonstrated that age-associated lipidomic fingerprints differed by sex. Specific classes of ether-phospholipids and lysophospholipids (calculated as the sum composition of the species within the class) were inversely associated with age in men only. In analyses with women alone, higher triacylglycerol and lower lysoalkylphosphatidylcholine species were observed among postmenopausal women compared with premenopausal women. We also identified sex-specific associations of lipid species with obesity. Lysophospholipids were negatively associated with BMI in both sexes (with a larger effect size in men), whilst acylcarnitine species showed opposing associations based on sex (positive association in women and negative association in men). Finally, by utilising specific lipid ratios as a proxy for enzymatic activity, we identified stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD-1), fatty acid desaturase 3 (FADS3), and plasmanylethanolamine Δ1-desaturase activities, as well as the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, as constituent perturbations of cardiometabolic phenotypes. Our analyses elucidate the effect of age and sex on lipid metabolism by offering a comprehensive view of the lipidomic profiles associated with common cardiometabolic risk factors. These findings have implications for age- and sex-dependent lipid metabolism in health and disease and suggest the need for sex stratification during lipid biomarker discovery, establishing biological reference intervals for assessment of disease risk.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/FBmePFK0DOA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: New boundaries and dissociation of the mouse hippocampus along the dorsal‐ventral axis based on glutamatergic, GABAergic and catecholaminergic receptor densities</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In rodents, gene‐expression, neuronal tuning, connectivity and neurogenesis studies have postulated that the dorsal, the intermediate and the ventral hippocampal formation (HF) are distinct entities. These findings are underpinned by behavioral studies showing a dissociable role of dorsal and ventral HF in learning, memory, stress and emotional processing. However, up to now, the molecular basis of such differences in relation to discrete boundaries is largely unknown. Therefore, we analyzed binding site densities for glutamatergic AMPA, NMDA, kainate and mGluR&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;, GABAergic GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (including benzodiazepine binding sites), GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, dopaminergic D&lt;sub&gt;1/5&lt;/sub&gt; and noradrenergic α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors as key modulators for signal transmission in hippocampal functions, using quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography along the dorsal‐ventral axis of the mouse HF. Beside general different receptor profiles of the dentate gyrus (DG) and Cornu Ammonis fields (CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4/hilus), we detected substantial differences between dorsal, intermediate and ventral subdivisions and individual layers for all investigated receptor types, except GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, striking higher densities of α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors were detected in the ventral DG, while the dorsal DG possesses higher numbers of kainate, NMDA, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;1/5&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. CA1 dorsal and intermediate subdivisions showed higher AMPA, NMDA, mGluR&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;1/5&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, while kainate receptors are higher expressed in ventral CA1, and noradrenergic α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the intermediate region of CA1. CA2 dorsal was distinguished by higher kainate, α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the intermediate region, while CA3 showed a more complex dissociation. Our findings resulted not only in a clear segmentation of the mouse hippocampus along the dorsal‐ventral axis, but also provides insights into the neurochemical basis and likely associated physiological processes in hippocampal functions. Therein, the presented data has a high impact for future studies modeling and investigating dorsal, intermediate and ventral hippocampal dysfunction in relation to neurodegenerative diseases or psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: PIK3R2/Pik3r2 Activating Mutations Result in Brain Overgrowth and EEG Changes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25890?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25890?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutations in phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate 3‐kinase (PI3K) complex have been associated with a broad spectrum of brain and organ overgrowth syndromes. For example, mutations in phosphatidylinositol‐3‐kinase regulatory subunit 2 (&lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt;) have been identified in human patients with megalencephaly polymicrogyria polydactyly hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome, which includes brain overgrowth. To better understand the pathogenesis of &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt;‐related mutations, we have developed and characterized a murine model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We generated a knock‐in mouse model for the most common human &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; mutation, p.G373R (p.G367R in mice) using CRISPR/Cas9. The mouse phenotypes, including brain size, seizure activity, cortical lamination, cell proliferation/size/density, interneuron migration, and PI3K pathway activation, were analyzed using standard methodologies. For human patients with &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; mutations, clinical data (occipitofrontal circumference [OFC] and epilepsy) were retrospectively obtained from our clinical records (published / unpublished).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PI3K‐AKT pathway was hyperactivated in these mice, confirming the p.G367R mutation is an activating mutation in vivo. Similar to human patients with &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; mutations, these mice have enlarged brains. We found cell size to be increased but not cell numbers. The embryonic brain showed mild defects in cortical lamination, although not observed in the mature brain. Furthermore, electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from mutant mice showed background slowing and rare seizures, again similar to our observations in human patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have generated a &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; mouse model that exhibits megalencephaly and EEG changes, both of which overlap with human patients. Our data provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of the human disease caused by PIK3R2 p.G373R mutation. We anticipate this model will be valuable in testing therapeutic options for human patients with MPPH. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Developmental distribution of primary cilia in the retinofugal visual pathway</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25029?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Developmental distribution of primary cilia in the retinofugal visual pathway&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2f94e0fb-4596-49d0-a46a-54650ff312d0/cne25029-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we show that both the number of primary cilia and the number of ciliated neurons declines with age in major retinorecipient targets. Our data suggests that the maturation timing of neuronal and non‐neural cilia differs with maturation of neuronal cilia occurring over a longer postnatal period.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mammalian visual system is composed of circuitry connecting sensory input from the retina to the processing core of the visual cortex. The two main retinorecipient brain targets, the superior colliculus (SC) and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), bridge retinal input and visual output. The primary cilium is a conserved organelle increasingly viewed as a critical sensor for the regulation of developmental and homeostatic pathways in most mammalian cell types. Moreover, cilia have been described as crucial for neurogenesis, neuronal maturation, and survival in the cortex and retina. However, cilia in the visual relay center remain to be fully described. In this study, we characterized the ciliation profile of the SC and dLGN and found that the overall number of ciliated cells declined during development. Interestingly, shorter ciliated cells in both regions were identified as neurons, whose numbers remained stable over time, suggesting that cilia retention is a critical feature for optimal neuronal function in SC and dLGN. Our study suggests that primary cilia are important for neuronal maturation and function in cells of the SC and dLGN.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Remodeling of projections from ventral hippocampus to prefrontal cortex in Alzheimer's mice</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Remodeling of projections from ventral hippocampus to prefrontal cortex in Alzheimer's mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2418eb20-0077-4d2f-965d-12a90c91b504/cne25032-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axon terminal branches, originating from the ventral hippocampus and distributed in the prefrontal cortex, undergo more frequent bifurcation but bear less numerous varicosities, which are putative synaptic sites, in Alzheimer's than wild‐type mice. This projection appears to be more widely spread, with scantier synapses, and therefore diluted in Alzheimer's mice.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotional dysregulation often accompanies cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hippocampus, most notably damaged by AD pathology, is classified into the cognition‐bound posterior and emotion‐bound anterior hippocampi. Since the anterior hippocampus or its rodent counterpart, the ventral hippocampus (VH), sends dense afferents to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), the two structures implicated in fear responses, we investigated whether these afferents are modified in 3xTg AD model mice. An anterograde dextrin tracer injected into VH revealed that axons in PFC were more ramified in 3xTg than wild‐type (WT) mice, with the synaptic density reduced. The VH projections to BLA were not affected. Intracellular accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) or Aβ‐like immunoreactivity was found in PFC and BLA neurons alike. Behaviorally, in the 2‐way active avoidance test, the frequency of chamber change was higher, with the test performance better, in 3xTg than WT mice, suggesting a distorted contextual fear in the 3xTg group. Given the essential involvement of parts of PFC in contextual fear responses and that of BLA in fear responses in general, the observed remodeling of VH‐to‐PFC afferents and the accumulation of intracellular Aβ in BLA and PFC pyramidal cells might exercise critical influences on enhanced avoidance behavior in 3xTg mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Sympathetic innervation of inguinal white adipose tissue in the mouse&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/730a09cc-d99e-4a3f-b372-29829ff62c56/cne25031-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Preganglionic and postganglionic sympathetic inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) inputs are anatomically distinct from interscapular brown adipose tissue.
Dorsolumbar and inguinal iWAT portions are innervated by anatomically distinct sympathetic nerves.
Sympathetic postganglionic iWAT innervation reaches its target organ via lateral cutaneous rami of intercostal nerves T11–L1 and anterior cutaneous femoral nerve (as part of the lumbar plexus, L1)
White adipocytes are sparsely innervated (sparse varicosities), while brown adipocytes (beige islands) show dense innervation (dense varicosities) in iWAT.



&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adipose tissue plays an important role in metabolic homeostasis and its prominent role as endocrine organ is now well recognized. Adipose tissue is controlled via the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). New viral, molecular‐genetic tools will soon allow a more detailed study of adipose tissue innervation in metabolic function, yet, the precise anatomical extent of preganglionic and postganglionic inputs to the inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) is limited. Furthermore, several viral, molecular‐genetic tools will require the use of cre/loxP mouse models, while the available studies on sympathetic iWAT innervation were established in larger species. In this study, we generated a detailed map for the sympathetic innervation of iWAT in male and female mice. We adapted iDISCO tissue clearing to process large, whole‐body specimens for an unprecedented view of the natural abdominal SNS. Combined with pseudorabies virus retrograde tracing from the iWAT, we defined the preganglionic and postganglionic sympathetic input to iWAT. We used fluorescence‐guided anatomical dissections of sympathetic nerves in reporter mice to further clarify that postganglionic axons connect to iWAT via lateral cutaneous rami (dorsolumbar iWAT portion) and the lumbar plexus (inguinal iWAT portion). Importantly, these rami carry axons that branch to iWAT, as well as axons that travel further to innervate the skin and vasculature, and their functional impact will require consideration in denervation studies. Our study may serve as a comprehensive map for future experiments that employ virally driven neuromodulation techniques to predict anatomy‐based viral labeling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the discovery of Rett Syndrome (RTT) genetic mutations, animal models have been developed. Sleep research in RTT animal models may unravel novel neural mechanisms for this severe neurodevelopmental heritable rare disease. In this systematic literature review we summarize the findings on sleep research of 13 studies in animal models of RTT. We found disturbed efficacy and continuity of sleep in all genetically mutated models of mice, cynomolgus monkeys, and &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Models presented highly fragmented sleep with distinct differences in 24‐hr sleep/wake cyclicity and circadian arrhythmicity. Overall, animal models mimic sleep complaints reported in individuals with RTT. However, contrary to human studies, in mutant mice, attenuated sleep delta waves, and sleep apneas in non‐rapid eye movement sleep were reported. Future studies may focus on sleep structure and EEG alterations, potential central mechanisms involved in sleep fragmentation and the occurrence of sleep apnea across different sleep stages. Given that locomotor dysfunction is characteristic of individuals with RTT, studies may consider to integrate its potential impact on the behavioral analysis of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Parvalbumin-Deficiency Accelerates the Age-Dependent ROS Production in Pvalb Neurons in vivo: Link to Neurodevelopmental Disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.571216</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.571216</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia, impairment/malfunctioning of a subpopulation of interneurons expressing the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) –here termed Pvalb neurons– has gradually emerged as a possible cause. These neurons may represent a hub or point-of-convergence in the etiology of NDD. Increased oxidative stress associated with mitochondria impairment in Pvalb neurons is discussed as an essential step in schizophrenia etiology. Since PV downregulation is a common finding in ASD and schizophrenia individuals and PV-deficient (PV−/−) mice show a strong ASD-like behavior phenotype, we investigated the putative link between PV expression, alterations in mitochondria and oxidative stress. In a longitudinal study with 1, 3, and 6-months old PV−/− and wild type mice, oxidative stress was investigated in 9 Pvalb neuron subpopulations in the hippocampus, striatum, somatosensory cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and cerebellum. In Pvalb neuron somata in the striatum and TRN, we additionally determined mitochondria volume and distribution at these three time points. In all Pvalb neuron subpopulations, we observed an age-dependent increase in oxidative stress and the increase strongly correlated with PV expression levels, but not with mitochondria density in these Pvalb neurons. Moreover, oxidative stress was elevated in Pvalb neurons of PV−/− mice and the magnitude of the effect was again correlated with PV expression levels in the corresponding wild type Pvalb neuron subpopulations. The PV-dependent effect was insignificant at 1 month and relative differences between WT and PV−/− Pvalb neurons were largest at 3 months. Besides the increase in mitochondria volume in PV’s absence in TRN and striatal PV−/− Pvalb neurons fully present already at 1 month, we observed a redistribution of mitochondria from the perinuclear region toward the plasma membrane at all time points. We suggest that in absence of PV, slow Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; buffering normally exerted by PV is compensated by a (mal)adaptive, mostly sub-plasmalemmal increase in mitochondria resulting in increased oxidative stress observed in 3- and 6-months old mice. Since PV−/− mice display core ASD-like symptoms already at 1 month, oxidative stress in Pvalb neurons is not a likely cause for their ASD-related behavior observed at this age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain are commonly encoded by IGHV3-53 and most have a short CDR H3. Wu et al. show that IGHV3-53 antibodies with a long CDR H3 adopt an alternative binding mode, demonstrating that IGHV3-53 is even more versatile than previously thought in targeting SARS-CoV-2.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: The effects of internal jugular vein compression for modulating and preserving white matter following a season of American tackle football: A prospective longitudinal evaluation of differential head impact exposure</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24727?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The effects of internal jugular vein compression for modulating and preserving white matter following a season of American tackle football: A prospective longitudinal evaluation of differential head impact exposure&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4b47412f-b661-47a7-a430-5f5ff80eb20e/jnr24727-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internal jugular vein compression, by means of an externally worn neck collar (right side of image), is a potentially viable solution to intervene on the diffusion and anisotropic properties of white matter that change following a season of American tackle football. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this clinical trial was to examine whether internal jugular vein compression (JVC)—using an externally worn neck collar—modulated the relationships between differential head impact exposure levels and pre‐ to postseason changes in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)‐derived diffusivity and anisotropy metrics of white matter following a season of American tackle football. Male high‐school athletes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 284) were prospectively assigned to a non‐collar group or a collar group. Magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from participants pre‐ and postseason and head impact exposure was monitored by accelerometers during every practice and game throughout the competitive season. Athletes' accumulated head impact exposure was systematically thresholded based on the frequency of impacts of progressively higher magnitudes (10 g intervals between 20 to 150 g) and modeled with pre‐ to postseason changes in DTI measures of white matter as a function of JVC neck collar wear. The findings revealed that the JVC neck collar modulated the relationships between greater high‐magnitude head impact exposure (110 to 140 g) and longitudinal changes to white matter, with each group showing associations that varied in directionality. Results also revealed that the JVC neck collar group partially preserved longitudinal changes in DTI metrics. Collectively, these data indicate that a JVC neck collar can provide a mechanistic response to the diffusion and anisotropic properties of brain white matter following the highly diverse exposure to repetitive head impacts in American tackle football.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Circulating lipoprotein lipids, apolipoproteins and ischemic stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25916?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25916?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a Mendelian randomization study to disentangle the comparative effects of lipids and apolipoprotein on ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with low‐ and high‐density lipoprotein (LDL and HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein A‐I and B (apoA‐I and apoB) at the level of genome‐wide significance (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;5×10&lt;sup&gt;‐8&lt;/sup&gt;) in the UK Biobank were used as instrumental variables. Summary‐level data for ischemic stroke and its subtypes were obtained from the MEGASTROKE consortium with 514 791 individuals (60 341 ischemic stroke cases and 454 450 non‐cases).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased levels of apoB, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides were associated with higher risk of any ischemic stroke, large artery stroke and small vessel stroke in the main and sensitivity univariable MR analyses. In multivariable MR analysis including apoB, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in the same model, apoB retained a robust effect (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), whereas the estimate for LDL cholesterol was reversed and that for triglycerides largely attenuated. Decreased levels of apoA‐I and HDL cholesterol were robustly associated with increased risk of any ischemic stroke, large artery stroke and small vessel stroke in all univariable MR analyses, but the association for apoA‐I was attenuated to the null after mutual adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present MR study reveals that apoB is the predominant trait that accounts for the etiological basis of apoB, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in relation to ischemic stroke, in particular large artery and small vessel stroke. Whether HDL cholesterol exerts a protective effect on ischemic stroke independent of apoA‐I needs further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Comparative morphology of the corpus callosum across the adult lifespan in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and humans</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Comparative morphology of the corpus callosum across the adult lifespan in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and humans&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/959b2321-5601-4f4c-af64-dda0ee5a24f0/cne25039-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study compares age‐related difference in corpus callosum morphology of chimpanzees and humans across the adult lifespan utilizing measures of total midsagittal area and regional thickness. We find that the chimpanzee compared to the human aging trajectory is characterized by a slower increase from adolescence to middle adulthood, as well as by a lack of substantial decline from middle to old adulthood. Thus, callosal atrophy in old age is not a universal characteristic of the aging brain, but rather appears to be human‐specific phenomenon of aging.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human corpus callosum exhibits substantial atrophy in old age, which is stronger than what would be predicted from parallel changes in overall brain anatomy. To date, however, it has not been conclusively established whether this accentuated decline represents a common feature of brain aging across species, or whether it is a specific characteristic of the aging human brain. In the present cross‐sectional study, we address this question by comparing age‐related difference in corpus callosum morphology of chimpanzees and humans. For this purpose, we measured total midsagittal area and regional thickness of the corpus callosum from T1‐weighted MRI data from 213 chimpanzees, aged between 9 and 54 years. The results were compared with data drawn from a large‐scale human sample which was age‐range matched using two strategies: (a) matching by chronological age (human sample size: &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 562), or (b) matching by accounting for differences in longevity and various maturational events between the species (i.e., adjusted human age range: 13.6 to 80.9 years; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 664). Using generalized additive modeling to fit and compare aging trajectories, we found significant differences between the two species. The chimpanzee aging trajectory compared with the human trajectory was characterized by a slower increase from adolescence to middle adulthood, and by a lack of substantial decline from middle to old adulthood, which, however, was present in humans. Thus, the accentuated decline of the corpus callosum found in aging humans is not a universal characteristic of the aging brain, and appears to be human‐specific.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Copy number variations (CNVs) of the human 16p11.2 genetic locus are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, and epilepsy. In this review, we delineate genetic information and diverse phenotypes in individuals with 16p11.2 CNVs, and synthesize preclinical findings from transgenic mouse models of 16p11.2 CNVs. Mice with 16p11.2 deletions or duplications recapitulate many core behavioral phenotypes, including social and cognitive deficits, and exhibit altered synaptic function across various brain areas.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Short-term depression and long-term plasticity together tune sensitive range of synaptic plasticity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicolas Deperrois, Michael Graupner&lt;/p&gt;

Synaptic efficacy is subjected to activity-dependent changes on short- and long time scales. While short-term changes decay over minutes, long-term modifications last from hours up to a life-time and are thought to constitute the basis of learning and memory. Both plasticity mechanisms have been studied extensively but how their interaction shapes synaptic dynamics is little known. To investigate how both short- and long-term plasticity together control the induction of synaptic depression and potentiation, we used numerical simulations and mathematical analysis of a calcium-based model, where pre- and postsynaptic activity induces calcium transients driving synaptic long-term plasticity. We found that the model implementing known synaptic short-term dynamics in the calcium transients can be successfully fitted to long-term plasticity data obtained in visual- and somatosensory cortex. Interestingly, the impact of spike-timing and firing rate changes on plasticity occurs in the prevalent firing rate range, which is different in both cortical areas considered here. Our findings suggest that short- and long-term plasticity are together tuned to adapt plasticity to area-specific activity statistics such as firing rates.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Cf187X4zeHs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A greedy classifier optimization strategy to assess ion channel blocking activity and pro-arrhythmia in hiPSC-cardiomyocytes</title>

Novel studies conducting cardiac safety assessment using human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are promising but might be limited by their specificity and predictivity. It is often challenging to correctly classify ion channel blockers or to sufficiently predict the risk for Torsade de Pointes (TdP). In this study, we developed a method combining &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; experiments to improve machine learning approaches in delivering fast and reliable prediction of drug-induced ion-channel blockade and proarrhythmic behaviour. The algorithm is based on the construction of a dictionary and a greedy optimization, leading to the definition of optimal classifiers. Finally, we present a numerical tool that can accurately predict compound-induced pro-arrhythmic risk and involvement of sodium, calcium and potassium channels, based on hiPSC-CM field potential data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OvvhAnsghl8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Spatial repellents (SRs) reduce human-mosquito contact by preventing mosquito entrance into human-occupied spaces and interfering with host-seeking and blood-feeding. A new model to synthesize experimental data on the effects of transfluthrin on &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; explores how SR effects interact to impact the epidemiology of diseases vectored by these mosquitoes. Our results indicate that the greatest impact on force of infection is expected to derive from the chemical’s lethal effect but delayed biting and the negative effect this may have on the mosquito population could elicit substantial impact in the absence of lethality. The relative contributions of these effects depend on coverage, chemical dose, and housing density. We also demonstrate that, through an increase in the number of potentially mosquito bites, increased partial blood-feeding and reduced exiting may elicit adverse impacts, which could offset gains achieved by other effects. Our analysis demonstrates how small-scale experimental data can be leveraged to derive expectations of epidemiological impact of SRs deployed at larger scales.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/doCS5w31lAk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Serotonin distribution in the brain of the plainfin midshipman: Substrates for vocal‐acoustic modulation and a reevaluation of the serotonergic system in teleost fishes&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d86d7012-a5ec-4120-b572-0c8b2c7d33ce/cne24938-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We comprehensively characterized 5‐HT‐immunoreactive (‐ir) innervation throughout the brain of &lt;i&gt;Porichthys notatus&lt;/i&gt;, plainfin midshipman fish, including well‐delineated vocal and auditory nuclei. We report neuroanatomical heterogeneity in populations of the serotonergic raphe nuclei of the brainstem reticular formation, with three discrete subregions in the superior raphe, an intermediate 5‐HT‐ir cell cluster, and an extensive inferior raphe population. This comprehensive atlas offers new insights into the organization of 5‐HT nuclei in teleosts and provides neuroanatomical evidence for serotonin as a modulator of vocal‐acoustic circuitry and behavior in midshipman fish, consistent with findings in vocal tetrapods.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5‐HT) is a modulator of neural circuitry underlying motor patterning, homeostatic control, and social behavior. While previous studies have described 5‐HT distribution in various teleosts, serotonergic raphe subgroups in fish are not well defined and therefore remain problematic for cross‐species comparisons. Here we used the plainfin midshipman fish, &lt;i&gt;Porichthys notatus&lt;/i&gt;, a well‐studied model for investigating the neural and hormonal mechanisms of vertebrate vocal‐acoustic communication, to redefine raphe subgroups based on both stringent neuroanatomical landmarks as well as quantitative cell measurements. In addition, we comprehensively characterized 5‐HT‐immunoreactive (‐ir) innervation throughout the brain, including well‐delineated vocal and auditory nuclei. We report neuroanatomical heterogeneity in populations of the serotonergic raphe nuclei of the brainstem reticular formation, with three discrete subregions in the superior raphe, an intermediate 5‐HT‐ir cell cluster, and an extensive inferior raphe population. 5‐HT‐ir neurons were also observed within the vocal motor nucleus (VMN), forming putative contacts on those cells. In addition, three major 5‐HT‐ir cell groups were identified in the hypothalamus and one group in the pretectum. Significant 5‐HT‐ir innervation was found in components of the vocal pattern generator and cranial motor nuclei. All vocal midbrain nuclei showed considerable 5‐HT‐ir innervation, as did thalamic and hindbrain auditory and lateral line areas and vocal‐acoustic integration sites in the preoptic area and ventral telencephalon. This comprehensive atlas offers new insights into the organization of 5‐HT nuclei in teleosts and provides neuroanatomical evidence for serotonin as a modulator of vocal‐acoustic circuitry and behavior in midshipman fish, consistent with findings in vocal tetrapods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: CAG repeat size influences the progression rate of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25919?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25919?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado‐Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), the expanded CAG repeat in &lt;i&gt;ATXN3&lt;/i&gt; is the causal mutation, and its length is the main factor in determining the age at onset (AO) of clinical symptoms. However, the contribution of the expanded CAG repeat length to the rate of disease progression after onset has remained a matter of debate, even though an understanding of this factor is crucial for experimental data on disease modifiers and their translation to clinical trials and their design.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;82 Dutch SCA3/MJD patients were evaluated annually for 15 years using the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). Using linear growth curve models, ICARS progression rates were calculated and tested for their relation to the length of the CAG repeat expansion and to the residual AO (RAO): the difference between the observed AO and the AO predicted on the basis of the CAG repeat length.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, ICARS scores increased 2·57 points/year of disease. The length of the CAG repeat was positively correlated with a more rapid ICARS progression, explaining 30% of the differences between patients. Combining both the length of the CAG repeat and RAO as co‐modifiers explained up to 47% of the inter‐patient variation in ICARS progression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data imply that the length of the expanded CAG repeat in &lt;i&gt;ATXN3&lt;/i&gt; is a major determinant of clinical decline, which suggests that CAG‐dependent molecular mechanisms similar to those responsible for disease onset also contribute to the rate of disease progression in SCA3/MJD.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Plasma NT1 Tau is a Specific and Early Marker of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25885?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25885?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an urgent need for sensitive, widely available, blood‐based screening tests to identify presymptomatic individuals destined to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated whether tau detected in plasma by our in‐house NT1 assay is specifically altered in AD, and when applied to patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can serve to predict progression to AD dementia. The predictive value of NT1 versus tau measured using assays from Quanterix and Roche, and the specificity of NT1 for AD versus a nonspecific marker of neurodegeneration (neurofilament light [NfL]) were also examined.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NT1 tau and NfL were measured in plasma from prospectively followed patients with SCD or MCI who remained cognitively stable, converted to AD dementia, or converted to non‐AD dementias, and in cognitively unimpaired participants. Tau was measured using Quanterix and Roche assays in baseline subjects with SCD and MCI.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasma NT1 tau was specifically elevated in AD, but not in non‐AD dementia compared with controls, whereas NfL was increased in both AD and non‐AD dementias. Baseline specimens from individuals who had SCD or MCI revealed that NT1 tau, but not tau measured using Quanterix or Roche assays, is elevated in subjects who progress to AD dementia. As expected, baseline plasma NfL is elevated in those who progress to AD and non‐AD dementias.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasma NT1 tau is a specific marker of AD, which is elevated early in disease and may prove useful as a first round screen to identify individuals at risk of developing AD. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Topographic gradients define the projection patterns of the claustrum core and shell in mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25043?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25043?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Topographic gradients define the projection patterns of the claustrum core and shell in mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3f6e0001-977b-4851-a4b5-72b07dd8e288/cne25043-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claustrocortical projections are organized across the dorsoventral axis and map onto the rostrocaudal axis of the cortex. Interneuron subtypes are differentially localized to the core and shell of the claustrum. The lines linking claustrum and cortex highlight some of the most numerous and divergent claustrocortical pathways identified in this study.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claustrum is densely connected to the cortex and participates in brain functions such as attention and sleep. Although some studies have reported the widely divergent organization of claustrum projections, others describe parallel claustrocortical connections to different cortical regions. Therefore, the details underlying how claustrum neurons broadcast information to cortical networks remain incompletely understood. Using multicolor retrograde tracing we determined the density, topography, and co‐projection pattern of fourteen claustrocortical pathways, in mice. We spatially registered these pathways to a common coordinate space and found that the claustrocortical system is topographically organized as a series of overlapping spatial modules, continuously distributed across the dorsoventral claustrum axis. The claustrum core projects predominantly to frontal‐midline cortical regions, whereas the dorsal and ventral shell project to the cortical motor system and temporal lobe, respectively. Anatomically connected cortical regions receive common input from a subset of claustrum neurons shared by neighboring modules, whereas spatially separated regions of cortex are innervated by different claustrum modules. Therefore, each output module exhibits a unique position within the claustrum and overlaps substantially with other modules projecting to functionally related cortical regions. Claustrum inhibitory cells containing parvalbumin, somatostatin, and neuropeptide Y also show unique topographical distributions, suggesting different output modules are controlled by distinct inhibitory circuit motifs. The topographic organization of excitatory and inhibitory cell types may enable parallel claustrum outputs to independently coordinate distinct cortical networks.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Marmosets have a greater diversity of c‐Fos response after hyperstimulation in distinct cortical regions as compared to rats</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Marmosets have a greater diversity of c‐Fos response after hyperstimulation in distinct cortical regions as compared to rats&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f63913ea-8a34-4f90-a4fa-7415ae6d924c/cne25044-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rats and marmosets were injected with pentylenetetrazol and euthanized at different time points after stimulus. Immunohistochemical detection of c‐Fos was quantified using stereological cell counting in eight neocortical regions. Our results showed that the marmoset brain has a greater neuronal activation after intense stimulation by means of pentylenetetrazol and a more complex pattern of brain activation. We speculate that these functional differences may contribute for the understanding of the different neuronal processing capacities of the neocortex in these mammals’ orders.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous evidence indicated a potential mechanism that might support the fact that primates exhibit greater neural integration capacity as a result of the activation of different structures of the central nervous system, as compared to rodents. The current study aimed to provide further evidence to confirm previous findings by analyzing the patterns of c‐Fos expression in more neocortical structures of rats and marmosets using a more robust quantitative technique and evaluating a larger number of brain areas. Nineteen Wistar rats and 21 marmosets (&lt;i&gt;Callithrix jacchus&lt;/i&gt;) were distributed among control groups (animals without injections) and animals injected with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and euthanized at different time points after stimulus. Immunohistochemical detection of c‐Fos was quantified using unbiased and efficient stereological cell counting in eight neocortical regions. Results: Marmosets had a c‐Fos expression that was notably more widely expressed (5x more cells) and longer lasting (up to 3 hours) than rats. c‐Fos expression in rats presented similar patterns of expression according to the function of the brain cortical structures (associative, sensorial and motor functions), which was not observed for marmosets (in which no clear pattern could be drawn, and a more diverse profile emerged). Our results provide evidence that the marmoset brain has a greater neuronal activation after intense stimulation by means of PTZ and a more complex pattern of brain activation. We speculate that these functional differences may contribute for the understanding of the different neuronal processing capacities of the neocortex in these mammals’ orders.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Morphological and physiological properties of Rohon‐Beard neurons along the zebrafish spinal cord</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Morphological and physiological properties of Rohon‐Beard neurons along the zebrafish spinal cord&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d7b339aa-4c43-49ff-ab8b-c6d760eeccfc/cne25033-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary mechanosensory afferents serve as the first level of signal processing at the somatosensory periphery and provide information about behaviorally relevant stimulus features. Here, we show that the mechanosensory Rohon‐Beard (RB) neurons in larval zebrafish are rapidly adapting cells that can signal stimulus onset and offset and encode stimulus intensity implementing rate and temporal coding mechanisms. We also revealed a rostrocaudal variation in both morphology and physiology within the RB neuron population, which offers insights on what signals RBs carry into central circuits and on their role in locomotor behaviors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary mechanosensory neurons play an important role in converting mechanical forces into the sense of touch. In zebrafish, Rohon‐Beard (RB) neurons serve this role at embryonic and larval stages of development. Here we examine the morphology and physiology of RBs in larval zebrafish to better understand how mechanosensory stimuli are represented along the spinal cord. We report that the morphology of RB neurons differs along the rostrocaudal body axis. Rostral RB neurons arborize in the skin near the cell body whereas caudal cells arborize at a distance posterior to their cell body. Using a novel electrophysiological approach, we also found longitudinal differences in the mechanosensitivity and physiological properties of RB neurons. Rostral RB neurons respond to mechanical stimulations close to the soma and produce up to three spikes with increasing stimulus intensity, whereas caudal cells respond at more distal locations and can produce four or more spikes when the intensity of the mechanical stimulus increases. The mechanosensory properties of RB neurons are consistent with those of rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors and can signal the onset, offset and intensity of mechanical stimulation. This is the first report of the intensity encoding properties of RB neurons, where an increase in spike number and a decrease in spike latency are observed with increasing stimulation intensity. This study reveals an unappreciated complexity of the larval zebrafish mechanosensory system and demonstrates how differences in the morphological and physiological properties of RBs related to their rostrocaudal location can influence the signals that enter the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Decreased Evoked Slow-Activity After tDCS in Disorders of Consciousness</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00062</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00062</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Due to life-saving medical advances, the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of consciousness (DOC) has become a more commonly occurring clinical issue. One recently developed intervention option has been non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation. This dichotomy of patient responders may be better understood by investigating the mechanism behind the transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) intervention. The combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) has been an important diagnostic tool in DOC patients. We therefore examined the neural response using TMS-EEG both before and after tDCS in seven DOC patients (four diagnosed as in a minimally conscious state and three with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome). tDCS was applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while TMS pulses were applied to the premotor cortex. None of the seven patients showed relevant behavioral change after tDCS. We did, however, find that the overall evoked slow activity was reduced following tDCS intervention. We also found a positive correlation between the strength of the slow activity and the amount of high-frequency suppression. However, there was no significant pre-post tDCS difference in high frequencies. In the resting-state EEG, we observed that both the incidence of slow waves and the positive slope of the wave were affected by tDCS. Taken together, these results suggest that the tDCS intervention can reduce the slow-wave activity component of bistability, but this may not directly affect high-frequency activity. We hypothesize that while reduced slow activity may be necessary for the recovery of neural function, especially consciousness, this alone is insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Diabetic Polyneuropathy Is Associated With Pathomorphological Changes in Human Dorsal Root Ganglia: A Study Using 3T MR Neurography</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Diabetic neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most severe and yet most poorly understood complications of diabetes mellitus. In vivo imaging of dorsal root ganglia (DRG), a key structure for the understanding of DPN, has been restricted to animal studies. These have shown a correlation of decreased DRG volume with neuropathic symptom severity. Our objective was to investigate correlations of DRG morphology and signal characteristics at 3 Tesla (3T) magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) with clinical and serological data in diabetic patients with and without DPN. In this cross-sectional study, participants underwent 3T MRN of both L5 DRG using an isotropic 3D T2-weighted, fat-suppressed sequence with subsequent segmentation of DRG volume and analysis of normalized signal properties. Overall, 55 diabetes patients (66 ± 9 years; 32 men; 30 with DPN) took part in this study. DRG volume was smaller in patients with severe DPN when compared to patients with mild or moderate DPN (134.7 ± 21.86 vs 170.1 ± 49.22; p = 0.040). In DPN patients, DRG volume was negatively correlated with the neuropathy disability score (r = −0.43; 95%CI = −0.66 to −0.14; p = 0.02), a measure of neuropathy severity. DRG volume showed negative correlations with triglycerides (r = −0.40; 95%CI = −0.57 to −0.19; p = 0.006), and LDL cholesterol (r = −0.33; 95%CI = −0.51 to −0.11; p = 0.04). There was a strong positive correlation of normalized MR signal intensity (SI) with the neuropathy symptom score in the subgroup of patients with painful DPN (r = 0.80; 95%CI = 0.46 to 0.93; p = 0.005). DRG SI was positively correlated with HbA1c levels (r = 0.30; 95%CI = 0.09 to 0.50; p = 0.03) and the triglyceride/HDL ratio (r = 0.40; 95%CI = 0.19 to 0.57; p = 0.007). In this first in vivo study, we found DRG morphological degeneration and signal increase in correlation with neuropathy severity. This elucidates the potential importance of MR-based DRG assessments in studying structural and functional changes in DPN.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Transcranial electrical (TES) and magnetic stimulation (TMS) are both used for assessment of the motor function of the spinal cord in horses. Muscular motor evoked potentials (mMEP) were compared intra-individually for both techniques in five healthy horses. mMEPs were measured twice at increasing stimulation intensity steps over the extensor carpi radialis (ECR), tibialis cranialis (TC), and caninus muscles. Significance was set at p &amp;lt; 0.05. To support the hypothesis that both techniques induce extracranially elicited mMEPs, literature was also reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Both techniques show the presence of late mMEPs below the transcranial threshold appearing as extracranially elicited startle responses. The occurrence of these late mMEPs is especially important for interpretation of TMS tracings when coil misalignment can have an additional influence. Mean transcranial motor latency times (MLT; synaptic delays included) and conduction velocities (CV) of the ECR and TC were significantly different between both techniques: respectively, 4.2 and 5.5 ms (MLT&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;–&lt;/sub&gt;-MLT&lt;sub&gt;TES&lt;/sub&gt;), and −7.7 and −9.9 m/s (CV&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt;-CV&lt;sub&gt;TES&lt;/sub&gt;). TMS and TES show intensity-dependent latency decreases of, respectively, −2.6 (ECR) and −2.7 ms (TC)/30% magnetic intensity and −2.6 (ECR) and −3.2 (TC) ms/30V. When compared to TMS, TES shows the lowest coefficients of variation and highest reproducibility and accuracy for MLTs. This is ascribed to the fact that TES activates a lower number of cascaded interneurons, allows for multipulse stimulation, has an absence of coil repositioning errors, and has less sensitivity for varying degrees of background muscle tonus. Real axonal conduction times and conduction velocities are most closely approximated by TES.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Both intracranial and extracranial mMEPs inevitably carry characteristics of brainstem reflexes. To avoid false interpretations, transcranial mMEPs can be identified by a stepwise latency shortening of 15–20 ms when exceeding the transcranial motor threshold at increasing stimulation intensities. A ring block around the vertex is advised to reduce interference by extracranial mMEPs. mMEPs reflect the functional integrity of the route along the brainstem nuclei, extrapyramidal motor tracts, propriospinal neurons, and motoneurons. The corticospinal tract appears subordinate in horses. TMS and TES are interchangeable for assessing the functional integrity of motor functions of the spinal cord. However, TES reveals significantly shorter MLTs, higher conduction velocities, and better reproducibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Neurodegenerative Motor Neuron Disease With Ocular Involvement</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes degeneration of the lower and upper motor neurons and is the most prevalent motor neuron disease. This disease is characterized by muscle weakness, stiffness, and hyperreflexia. Patients survive for a short period from the onset of the disease. Most cases are sporadic, with only 10% of the cases being genetic. Many genes are now known to be involved in familial ALS cases, including some of the sporadic cases. It has also been observed that, in addition to genetic factors, there are numerous molecular mechanisms involved in these pathologies, such as excitotoxicity, mitochondrial disorders, alterations in axonal transport, oxidative stress, accumulation of misfolded proteins, and neuroinflammation. This pathology affects the motor neurons, the spinal cord, the cerebellum, and the brain, but recently, it has been shown that it also affects the visual system. This impact occurs not only at the level of the oculomotor system but also at the retinal level, which is why the retina is being proposed as a possible biomarker of this pathology. The current review discusses the main aspects mentioned above related to ALS, such as the main genes involved, the most important molecular mechanisms that affect this pathology, its ocular involvement, and the possible usefulness of the retina as a biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Moyamoya disease (MMD) is an important cause of stroke in children and young adults in Asia. To date, diagnosis remains challenging due to varying clinical manifestations and unknown pathogenesis. The study aims to identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exosomal microRNAs (exomiRs) that can serve as a novel diagnostic biomarker for diagnosis and assess its clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;CSF samples were taken from 31 MMD patients and 31 healthy controls. Initial screening of miRNA expression was performed on samples pooled from MMD patients and controls using microarray and validated using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The diagnostic accuracy of the potential exosomal miRNAs was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analyses in an independent patient cohort. The potential pathways regulated by the miRNAs was also determined using bioinformatics analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The microarray results demonstrated that six exomiRs were dysregulated in the MMD patients compared to the controls. Using qRT-PCR, we validated four of the miRNAs (miR-3679-5p, miR-6165, miR-6760-5p, and miR-574-5p) as a biomarker for MMD diagnosis. The four exomiRs showed enhanced sensitivity (75%) and specificity (93.75%) in terms of differentiating MMD patients from healthy subjects [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.9453]. Pathway enrichment analysis for potential targets of six exomiRs identified proteins involved in cell adhesion and junction formation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;We identified a novel and highly sensitive exomiRs signature for MMD detection and explored its potential targets using bioinformatics analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Reduced Global-Brain Functional Connectivity of the Cerebello-Thalamo-Cortical Network in Patients With Dry Eye Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.572693</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.572693</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The pathophysiology of patients with dry eye disease (DED) is associated with abnormal functional connectivity (FC). The present study aims to probe alterations of voxel-wise brain-wide FC in patient with DED at rest in an unbiased way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: A total of 20 patients with DED and 23 controls matched by age, sex, and years of education underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. Global-brain FC (GFC) was adopted to analyze the images. Support vector machine (SVM) was utilized to differentiate the patients from the controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared with the controls, patients with DED exhibited decreased GFC in the right cerebellum lobule VIII/inferior semi-lunar lobule and left thalamus that belonged to the cerebello-thalamo-cortical network. The GFC values in the left thalamus were positively correlated to the illness duration (r = 0.589, p = 0.006) in the patients. Decreased GFC values in the left thalamus could be used to discriminate the patients from the controls with optimal accuracy, sensitivity and specificity (88.37, 85.00, and 91.30%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our findings indicate that decreased GFC in the brain regions associated with cerebello-thalamo-cortical network may provide a new insight for understanding the pathological changes of FC in DED. GFC values in the left thalamus may be utilized as a potential biomarker to identify the patients from the controls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Effectiveness of Online Messages for Promoting Smoking Cessation Resources: Predicting Nationwide Campaign Effects From Neural Responses in the EX Campaign</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;What are the key ingredients that make some persuasive messages resonate with audiences and elicit action, while others fail? Billions of dollars per year are put towards changing human behavior, but it is difficult to know which messages will be the most persuasive in the field. By combining novel neuroimaging techniques and large-scale online data, we examine the role of key health communication variables relevant to motivating action at scale. We exposed a sample of smokers to anti-smoking web-banner messages from a real-world campaign while measuring message-evoked brain response patterns via fMRI, and we also obtained subjective evaluations of each banner. Neural indices were derived based on: (i) message-evoked activity in specific brain regions; and (ii) spatially distributed response patterns, both selected based on prior research and theoretical considerations. Next, we connected the neural and subjective data with an independent, objective outcome of message success, which is the per-banner click-through rate in the real-world campaign. Results show that messages evoking brain responses more similar to signatures of negative emotion and vividness had lower online click-through-rates. This strategy helps to connect and integrate the rapidly growing body of knowledge about brain function with formative research and outcome evaluation of health campaigns, and could ultimately further disease prevention efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Multi-Muscle Electrical Stimulation and Stand Training on Stepping for an Individual With SCI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.549965</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.549965</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical, neural, and functional outcomes during a 10-min treadmill stepping trial before and after two independent interventions with neuromuscular electrical stimulation (ES) in an individual with spinal cord injury (SCI). In this longitudinal study, a 34-year-old male with sensory- and motor-complete SCI (C5/C6) underwent two consecutive interventions: 61 h of supine lower limb ES (ES-alone) followed by 51 h of ES combined with stand training (ST) using an overhead body-weight support (BWS) system (ST + ES). In post ES-alone (unloaded), compared to baseline, the majority (∼60%) of lower extremity muscles decreased their peak surface electromyography (sEMG) amplitude, while in post ST + ES (loaded), compared to post ES-alone, there was a restoration in muscle activation that endured the continuous 10-min stepping. Temporal α-motor neuron activity patterns were observed for the SCI participant. In post ST + ES, there were increases in spinal activity patterns during mid-stance at spinal levels L5–S2 for the right and left limbs. Moreover, in post ES-alone, trunk stability increased with excursions from the midline of the base-of-support (50%) to the left (44.2%; Baseline: 54.2%) and right (66.4%; baseline: 77.5%). The least amount of trunk excursion observed post ST + ES, from midline to left (43%; AB: 22%) and right (64%; AB: 64%). Overall, in post ES-alone, there were gains in trunk independence with a decrease in lower limb muscle activation, whereas in post ST + ES, there were gains in trunk independence and increased muscle activation in both bilateral trunk muscles as well as lower limb muscles during the treadmill stepping paradigm. The results of the study illustrate the importance of loading during the stimulation for neural and mechanical gains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Steering the Volume of Tissue Activated With a Directional Deep Brain Stimulation Lead in the Globus Pallidus Pars Interna: A Modeling Study With Heterogeneous Tissue Properties</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.561180</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.561180</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To study the effect of directional deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrode configuration and vertical electrode spacing on the volume of tissue activated (VTA) in the globus pallidus, pars interna (GPi).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background: Directional DBS leads may allow clinicians to precisely direct current fields to different functional networks within traditionally targeted brain areas. Modeling the shape and size of the VTA for various monopolar or bipolar configurations can inform clinical programming strategies for GPi DBS. However, many computational models of VTA are limited by assuming tissue homogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We generated a multimodal image-based detailed anatomical (MIDA) computational model with a directional DBS lead (1.5 mm or 0.5 mm vertical electrode spacing) placed with segmented contact 2 at the ventral posterolateral “sensorimotor” region of the GPi. The effect of tissue heterogeneity was examined by replacing the MIDA tissues with a homogeneous tissue of conductance 0.3 S/m. DBS pulses (amplitude: 1 mA, pulse width: 60 μs, frequency: 130 Hz) were used to produce VTAs. The following DBS contact configurations were tested: single-segment monopole (2B-/Case+), two-segment monopole (2A-/2B-/Case+ and 2B-/3B-/Case+), ring monopole (2A-/2B-/2C-/Case+), one-cathode three-anode bipole (2B-/3A+/3B+/3C+), three-cathode three-anode bipole (2A-/2B-/2C-/3A+/3B+/3C+). Additionally, certain vertical configurations were repeated with 2 mA current amplitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Using a heterogeneous tissue model affected both the size and shape of the VTA in GPi. Electrodes with both 0.5 mm and 1.5 mm vertical spacing (1 mA) modeling showed that the single segment monopolar VTA was entirely contained within the GPi when the active electrode is placed at the posterolateral “sensorimotor” GPi. Two segments in a same ring and ring settings, however, produced VTAs outside of the GPi border that spread into adjacent white matter pathways, e.g., optic tract and internal capsule. Both stacked monopolar settings and vertical bipolar settings allowed activation of structures dorsal to the GPi in addition to the GPi. Modeling of the stacked monopolar settings with the DBS lead with 0.5 mm vertical electrode spacing further restricted VTAs within the GPi, but the VTA volumes were smaller compared to the equivalent settings of 1.5 mm spacing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Role of Iron, Its Metabolism and Ferroptosis in Traumatic Brain Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a structural and physiological disruption of brain function caused by external forces. It is a major cause of death and disability for patients worldwide. TBI includes both primary and secondary impairments. Iron overload and ferroptosis highly involved in the pathophysiological process of secondary brain injury. Ferroptosis is a form of regulatory cell death, as increased iron accumulation in the brain leads to lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammatory responses, resulting in cellular and neuronal damage. For this reason, eliminating factors like iron deposition and inhibiting lipid peroxidation may be a promising therapy. Iron chelators can be used to eliminate excess iron and to alleviate some of the clinical manifestations of TBI. In this review we will focus on the mechanisms of iron and ferroptosis involving the manifestations of TBI, broaden our understanding of the use of iron chelators for TBI. Through this review, we were able to better find novel clinical therapeutic directions for further TBI study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: An Efficient Screen for Cell-Intrinsic Factors Identifies the Chaperonin CCT and Multiple Conserved Mechanisms as Mediating Dendrite Morphogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.577315</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.577315</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dendritic morphology is inextricably linked to neuronal function. Systematic large-scale screens combined with genetic mapping have uncovered several mechanisms underlying dendrite morphogenesis. However, a comprehensive overview of participating molecular mechanisms is still lacking. Here, we conducted an efficient clonal screen using a collection of mapped P-element insertions that were previously shown to cause lethality and eye defects in Drosophila melanogaster. Of 280 mutants, 52 exhibited dendritic defects. Further database analyses, complementation tests, and RNA interference validations verified 40 P-element insertion genes as being responsible for the dendritic defects. Twenty-eight mutants presented severe arbor reduction, and the remainder displayed other abnormalities. The intrinsic regulators encoded by the identified genes participate in multiple conserved mechanisms and pathways, including the protein folding machinery and the chaperonin-containing TCP-1 (CCT) complex that facilitates tubulin folding. Mutant neurons in which expression of CCT4 or CCT5 was depleted exhibited severely retarded dendrite growth. We show that CCT localizes in dendrites and is required for dendritic microtubule organization and tubulin stability, suggesting that CCT-mediated tubulin folding occurs locally within dendrites. Our study also reveals novel mechanisms underlying dendrite morphogenesis. For example, we show that Drosophila Nogo signaling is required for dendrite development and that Mummy and Wech also regulate dendrite morphogenesis, potentially via Dpp- and integrin-independent pathways. Our methodology represents an efficient strategy for identifying intrinsic dendrite regulators, and provides insights into the plethora of molecular mechanisms underlying dendrite morphogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Rod and Cone Coupling Modulates Photopic ERG Responses in the Mouse Retina</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.566712</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.566712</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Light adaptation changes both the sensitivity and maximum amplitude (R&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of the mouse photopic electroretinogram (ERG) b-wave. Using the ERG, we examined how modulation of gap junctional coupling between rod and cones alters the light-adapted ERG. To measure changes, a b-wave light adaptation enhancement factor (LAEF), was defined as the ratio of R&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; after 15 min light adaptation to R&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; recorded at the onset of an adapting light. For wild-type mice (WT), the LAEF averaged 2.64 ± 0.29, however, it was significantly reduced (1.06 ± 0.04) for connexin 36 knock out (Cx36KO) mice, which lack electrical coupling between photoreceptors. Wild type mice intraocularly injected with meclofenamic acid (MFA), a gap junction blocker, also showed a significantly reduced LAEF. Degeneration of rod photoreceptors significantly alters the effects of light adaptation on the photopic ERG response. Rd10 mice at P21, with large portions of their rod photoreceptors present in the retina, exhibited a similar b-wave enhancement as wildtype controls, with a LAEF of 2.55 ± 0.19. However, by P31 with most of their rod photoreceptors degenerated, rd10 mice had a much reduced b-wave enhancement during light-adaptation (LAEF of 1.54 ± 0.12). Flicker ERG responses showed a higher temporal amplitude in mesopic conditions for WT than those of Cx36KO mice, suggesting rod-cone coupling help high-frequency signals to pass from rods to cone pathways in the retina. In conclusion, our study provides a novel method to noninvasively measure the dynamics and modulation by the light adaptation for rod-cone gap junctional coupling in intact eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Synaptojanin2 Mutation Causes Progressive High-frequency Hearing Loss in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.561857</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.561857</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Progressive hearing loss is very common in the human population but we know little about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Synaptojanin2 (Synj2) has been reported to be involved, as a mouse mutation led to a progressive increase in auditory thresholds with age. Synaptojanin2 is a phosphatidylinositol (PI) phosphatase that removes the five-position phosphates from phosphoinositides, such as PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and is a key enzyme in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. To investigate the mechanisms underlying progressive hearing loss, we have studied a different mutation of mouse Synj2 to look for any evidence of involvement of vesicle trafficking particularly affecting the synapses of sensory hair cells. Auditory brainstem responses (ABR) developed normally at first but started to decline between 3 and 4 weeks of age in Synj2&lt;sup&gt;tm1b&lt;/sup&gt; mutants. At 6 weeks old, some evidence of outer hair cell (OHC) stereocilia fusion and degeneration was observed, but this was only seen in the extreme basal turn so cannot explain the raised ABR thresholds that correspond to more apical regions of the cochlear duct. We found no evidence of any defect in inner hair cell (IHC) exocytosis or endocytosis using single hair cell recordings, nor any sign of hair cell synaptic abnormalities. Endocochlear potentials (EP) were normal. The mechanism underlying progressive hearing loss in these mutants remains elusive, but our findings of raised distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) thresholds and signs of OHC degeneration both suggest an OHC origin for the hearing loss. Synaptojanin2 is not required for normal development of hearing but it is important for its maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Intracerebral Transplants of GMP-Grade Human Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Effectively Treat Subacute-Phase Ischemic Stroke in a Rodent Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.546659</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.546659</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In subacute and chronic phases of the stroke, there are no therapeutics available at present to promote functional recovery. Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hUC-MSCs) are one of the candidate cell types for treating subacute-phase stroke. The benefits of cell-based therapy largely depend on the migratory capacity of products administered, as well as their potential for engraftment in targeted tissues and paracrine activities. Timing and delivery modes may also influence the outcomes of stem-cell therapy. Still, the functional recuperative effects of differing hUC-MSC delivery modes, about cell replacement and cell-to-cell paracrine activity levels, have yet to be clarified in subacute phases of stroke.This study was conducted to compare the therapeutic effects of various delivery routes when administering Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-grade hUC-MSCs in a rodent model of subacute-phase stroke. Cell aliquots (1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) were given to rats as intravenous (IV) injections or intracerebral (IC) transplants 1 week after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Transplanted rats were examined up to 7 weeks later using various behavioral tests and immunohistochemical analyses. Most IC-transplanted cells survived for short periods (i.e., &amp;lt;4 weeks after receipt) and gradually disappeared, whereas IV-injected cells were undetectable in the brain at the same time points (i.e., 3 days, 4 weeks, or 7 weeks after injection). Although short-lived, IC-transplanted cells effectively improved behavioral deficits, serving to reduce infarct volumes and glial scar formation, increase subventricular counts of proliferating neuroblasts, and promote cerebrovascular ingrowth in ischemic penumbra regions. IV injection, however, failed to improve behavioral function or histologic parameters during the same 7-week time frame. These findings overall suggest that IC transplantation is preferable to IV injection for delivery of hUC-MSCs during subacute phases of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: White Matter Dissection of the Fetal Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroplasticity is a complex process of structural and functional reorganization of brain tissue. In the fetal period, neuroplasticity plays an important role in the emergence and development of white matter tracts. Here, we aimed to study the architecture of normal fetal brains by way of Klingler’s dissection. Ten normal brains were collected from in utero deceased fetuses aged between 13 and 35 gestational weeks (GW). During this period, we observed modifications in volume, shape, and sulci configuration. Our findings indicate that the major white matter tracts follow four waves of development. The first wave (13 GW) involves the corpus callosum, the fornix, the anterior commissure, and the uncinate fasciculus. In the second one (14 GW), the superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi and the cingulum could be identified. The third wave (17 GW) concerns the internal capsule and in the fourth wave (20 GW) all the major tracts, including the inferior-occipital fasciculus, were depicted. Our results suggest an earlier development of the white matter tracts than estimated by DTI tractography studies.

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Disentangling the Role of Working Memory in Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Working memory (WM) represents a core cognitive function with a major striatal contribution, and thus WM deficits, commonly observed in Parkinson’s disease (PD), could also relate to many other problems in PD patients. Our online study aimed to determine the subdomains of WM that are particularly affected in PD and to clarify the links between WM and everyday cognitive deficits, other executive functions, psychiatric and PD symptoms, as well as early cognitive impairment. Fifty-two mild-to-moderate PD patients and 54 healthy controls performed seven WM tasks tapping selective updating, continuous monitoring, or maintenance of currently active information. Self-ratings of everyday cognition, depression, and apathy symptoms, as well as screenings of global cognitive impairment, were also collected. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Of the three WM domains, only selective updating was directly predictive of PD group membership. More widespread WM deficits were observed only in relation to global cognitive impairment in PD patients. Self-rated everyday cognition or psychiatric symptoms were not linked to WM performance but correlated with each other. Our findings suggest that WM has a rather limited role in the clinical manifestation of PD. Nevertheless, due to its elementary link to striatal function, the updating component of WM could be a candidate for a cognitive marker of PD also in patients who are otherwise cognitively well-preserved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Differential Circulating Levels of Naturally Occurring Antibody to α-Synuclein in Parkinson’s Disease Dementia, Alzheimer’s Disease, and Vascular Dementia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.571437</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.571437</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Aggregation of alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) is considered to be a significant pathological hallmark and a driving force of Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD dementia (PDD) occurs in a substantial number of PD patients. Naturally occurring antibody against α-Syn (NAb-α-Syn) exists ubiquitously in human blood and is reported to be altered in PD. However, it is not clear yet whether PDD had similar changes of circulating NAb-α-Syn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In this study, we recruited 61 PDD patients, 52 patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), 51 patients with vascular dementia (VaD), and 50 normal controls (NCs). ELISA was used to examine NAb-α-Syn levels in serum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In comparison with NCs, serum levels of NAb-α-Syn were significantly lower in patients with PDD. However, serum levels of NAb-α-Syn were comparable among AD, VaD, and NC groups. Serum levels of NAb-α-Syn were positively correlated with the cognitive function, as reflected by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Serum levels of NAb-α-Syn were negatively correlated with the severity of PD [as reflected by the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)] and the duration of PD and PDD. Serum NAb-α-Syn can differentiate PDD patients from AD and VaD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These results suggest that circulating NAb-α-Syn might be a potential biomarker of PDD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Surgery, Anesthesia and Intensive Care Environment Induce Delirium-Like Behaviors and Impairment of Synaptic Function-Related Gene Expression in Aged Mice</title>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;To establish a clinically relevant mouse model of perioperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Aged C57BL/6J mice were tested at baseline in the Y-maze novel arm preference, buried food, simple discrimination task of the attentional set-shifting test, and open field tests. They were subsequently randomized to insult (anesthesia, surgery, and Intensive Care Unit environment) or control group. Insult-exposed mice received laparotomy under sevoflurane anesthesia, propofol sedation and exposure to intermittent lights, sounds and cage shaking. Controls did not receive anesthesia, surgery, or intensive care environment. All mice were tested in the Y-maze novel arm preference, buried food, attentional, and open field tests at the end of intensive care environment (0 h) and every 6 h up to 24 h. Mouse hippocampi were collected at 24 h for gene expression analyses.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Surgery, anesthesia and Intensive Care environment decreased the entries in the Y-maze novel arm at 0 h (P = 0.001), 6 h (P &amp;lt; 0.001), 18 h (P = 0.002), and 24 h (P = 0.029). Insult exposure increased the latency to find a buried cereal reward at 18 h (P = 0.035) and 24 h (P = 0.027), and increased the trials to criterion in the reverse compound discrimination (P = 0.013) and extradimensional shift (P &amp;lt; 0.001) tasks of the attentional test. The overall incidence of delirium was 72% in A/S/I mice. Messenger RNA levels of synuclein alpha (−3.785 fold change relative to controls), Neurotrophic Receptor Tyrosine Kinase1 (−2.267), and syntaxin1a (−1.498) were decreased in the hippocampus of mice 24 h after insult exposure. Protein levels of syntaxin 1a (P = 0.012), Neurotrophic Receptor Tyrosine Kinase1 (P = 0.039), synuclein alpha (P = 0.017), phosphorylated synuclein alpha (P = 0.008), synaptophysin (P = 0.002), postsynaptic density protein 95 (P = 0.003), and microtubule-associated protein 2 (P = 0.013) were also decreased, relative to controls.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Surgery, anesthesia and Intensive Care environment impaired mouse behaviors that depend on attention, memory, and thought organization. The changes were acute in onset and fluctuating in time. Mice with delirium exhibited decreased expression of key synaptic function-related genes. The behavioral changes induced by anesthesia, surgery, and Intensive Care environment in aged mice are consistent with the clinical features of human delirium, and support the use of this animal model for future mechanistic studies of perioperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Preclinical Evidence and Possible Mechanisms of Baicalein for Rats and Mice With Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00277</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00277</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Baicalein, a major bioactive flavone of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has neuroprotective properties in several animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the available preclinical evidence and possible mechanisms of baicalein for animal models of PD. Ultimately, 20 studies were identified by searching 7 databases from inception to December 2019. Review Manager 5.3 was applied for data analysis. Meta-analyses showed baicalein can significantly improve neurobehavioral function in animal models with PD, including spontaneous motor activity test (n = 5), pole test (n = 2), rotarod test (n = 9), apomorphine-induced rotations test (n = 4), grid test (n = 2), and tremor test (n = 2). Compared with controls, the results of the meta-analysis showed baicalein exerted a significant effect in increasing the frequency of spontaneous activity, prolongating the total time for climbing down the pole, decreasing the number of rotations, prolongating the descent latency, reducing the amplitude, and the frequency in animal models with PD. The possible mechanisms of baicalein for PD are regulating neurotransmitters, adjusting enzyme activity, antioxidation, anti-inflammatory, inhibiting protein aggregation, restorating mitochondrial dysfunction, inhibiting apoptosis, and autophagy. In conclusion, these findings preliminarily demonstrated that baicalein exerts potential neuroprotective effects through multiple signaling pathways in animal models of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Neuron: In press: Neuronal Activity Regulates Blood-Brain Barrier Efflux Transport through Endothelial Circadian Genes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(20)30663-2?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(20)30663-2?rss=yes</link>
	<description>The authors demonstrate that brain endothelial gene expression and blood-brain barrier efflux exhibit plasticity in response to neuronal activity. This has implications for how the blood-brain barrier regulates the composition of endogenous and exogenous molecules in the central nervous system in relation to circadian time and neuronal activity. This also suggests that neuronal activity can extrinsically modulate otherwise cell-intrinsic oscillatory processes.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Classification of estrogenic compounds by coupling high content analysis and machine learning algorithms</title>

Environmental toxicants affect human health in various ways. Of the thousands of chemicals present in the environment, those with adverse effects on the endocrine system are referred to as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Here, we focused on a subclass of EDCs that impacts the estrogen receptor (ER), a pivotal transcriptional regulator in health and disease. Estrogenic activity of compounds can be measured by many &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; or cell-based high throughput assays that record various endpoints from large pools of cells, and increasingly at the single-cell level. To simultaneously capture multiple mechanistic ER endpoints in individual cells that are affected by EDCs, we previously developed a sensitive high throughput/high content imaging assay that is based upon a stable cell line harboring a visible multicopy ER responsive transcription unit and expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion of ER. High content analysis generates voluminous multiplex data comprised of minable features that describe numerous mechanistic endpoints. In this study, we present a machine learning pipeline for rapid, accurate, and sensitive assessment of the endocrine-disrupting potential of benchmark chemicals based on data generated from high content analysis. The multidimensional imaging data was used to train a classification model to ultimately predict the impact of unknown compounds on the ER, either as agonists or antagonists. To this end, both linear logistic regression and nonlinear Random Forest classifiers were benchmarked and evaluated for predicting the estrogenic activity of unknown compounds. Furthermore, through feature selection, data visualization, and model discrimination, the most informative features were identified for the classification of ER agonists/antagonists. The results of this data-driven study showed that highly accurate and generalized classification models with a minimum number of features can be constructed without loss of generality, where these machine learning models serve as a means for rapid mechanistic/phenotypic evaluation of the estrogenic potential of many chemicals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WJZyXcuVTMs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Distinct proportions of cholinergic neurons in the rat prepositus hypoglossi nucleus according to their cerebellar projection targets</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Distinct proportions of cholinergic neurons in the rat prepositus hypoglossi nucleus according to their cerebellar projection targets&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/36c3e35d-a78e-4292-b799-10afba73768e/cne25035-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (PHN) is one of the major sources of cholinergic input to the cerebellum. We report the proportions of cholinergic neurons in PHN projections to distinct cerebellar regions by applying retrograde labeling with dextran‐conjugated Alexa 488 in ChAT‐tdTomato rats. The results suggest the proportion of cholinergic PHN neurons differs depending on cerebellar target areas and the rostro‐caudal regions of the PHN.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerebellar functions are modulated by cholinergic inputs, the density of which varies among cerebellar regions. Although the prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (PHN), a brainstem structure involved in controlling gaze holding, is known as one of the major sources of these cholinergic inputs, the proportions of cholinergic neurons in PHN projections to distinct cerebellar regions have not been quantitatively analyzed. In this study, we identified PHN neurons projecting to the cerebellum by applying retrograde labeling with dextran‐conjugated Alexa 488 in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)‐tdTomato transgenic rats and compared the proportion of cholinergic PHN neurons in the PHN projections to four different regions of the cerebellum, namely the flocculus (FL), the uvula and nodulus (UN), lobules III‐V in the vermis (VM), and the hemispheric paramedian lobule and crus 2 (PC). In the PHN, the percentage of cholinergic PHN neurons was lower in the projection to the FL than in the projection to the UN, VM or PC. Preposito‐cerebellar neurons, except for preposito‐FL neurons, included different proportions of cholinergic neurons at different rostrocaudal positions in the PHN. These results suggest that cholinergic PHN neurons project to not only the vestibulocerebellum but also the anterior vermis and posterior hemisphere and that the proportion of cholinergic neurons among projection neurons from the PHN differs depending on cerebellar target areas and the rostro‐caudal regions of the PHN. This study provides insights regarding the involvement of cerebellar cholinergic networks in gaze holding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Mesencephalic Astrocyte-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (MANF) Regulates Neurite Outgrowth Through the Activation of Akt/mTOR and Erk/mTOR Signaling Pathways</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurite outgrowth is essential for brain development and the recovery of brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we examined the role of the neurotrophic factor MANF in regulating neurite outgrowth. We generated MANF knockout (KO) neuro2a (N2a) cell lines using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 and demonstrated that MANF KO N2a cells failed to grow neurites in response to RA stimulation. Using MANF siRNA, this finding was confirmed in human SH-SY5Y neuronal cell line. Nevertheless, MANF overexpression by adenovirus transduction or addition of MANF into culture media facilitated the growth of longer neurites in RA-treated N2a cells. MANF deficiency resulted in inhibition of Akt, Erk, mTOR, and P70S6, and impaired protein synthesis. MANF overexpression on the other hand facilitated the growth of longer neurites by activating Akt, Erk, mTOR, and P70S6. Pharmacological blockade of Akt, Erk or mTOR eliminated the promoting effect of MANF on neurite outgrowth. These findings suggest that MANF positively regulated neurite outgrowth by activating Akt/mTOR and Erk/mTOR signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Mutation-Independent Therapies for Retinal Diseases: Focus on Gene-Based Approaches</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gene therapy is proving to be an effective approach to treat or prevent ocular diseases ensuring a targeted, stable, and regulated introduction of exogenous genetic material with therapeutic action. Retinal diseases can be broadly categorized into two groups, namely monogenic and complex (multifactorial) forms. The high genetic heterogeneity of monogenic forms represents a significant limitation to the application of gene-specific therapeutic strategies for a significant fraction of patients. Therefore, mutation-independent therapeutic strategies, acting on common pathways that underly retinal damage, are gaining interest as complementary/alternative approaches for retinal diseases. This review will provide an overview of mutation-independent strategies that rely on the modulation in the retina of key genes regulating such crucial degenerative pathways. In particular, we will describe how gene-based approaches explore the use of neurotrophic factors, microRNAs (miRNAs), genome editing and optogenetics in order to restore/prolong visual function in both outer and inner retinal diseases. We predict that the exploitation of gene delivery procedures applied to mutation/gene independent approaches may provide the answer to the unmet therapeutic need of a large fraction of patients with genetically heterogeneous and complex retinal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Aberrant White Matter Microstructure as a Potential Diagnostic Marker in Alzheimer's Disease by Automated Fiber Quantification</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging evidence has suggested white matter microstructure are heavily affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether white matter dysfunction is localized at the specific regions of fiber tracts and whether they would be a potential biomarker for AD remain unclear. By automated fiber quantification (AFQ), we applied diffusion tensor images from 25 healthy controls (HC), 24 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients and 18 AD patients to create tract profiles along 16 major white matter fibers. We compared diffusion metrics [Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (DA), and radial diffusivity (DR)] between groups. To assess the diagnostic value, we applied a random forest (RF) classifier, a type of machine learning method. In the global tract level, we found that aMCI and AD patients showed higher MD, DA, and DR values in some fiber tracts mostly in the left hemisphere compared to HC. In the point-wise level, widespread disruption were distributed on specific locations of different tracts. The point-wise MD measurements presented the best classification performance with respect to differentiating AD from HC. The two most important variables were localized in the prefrontal potion of left uncinate fasciculus and anterior thalamic radiation. In addition, the point-wise DA in the posterior component of the left cingulum cingulate displayed the most robust discriminative ability to identify AD from aMCI. Our findings provide evidence that white matter abnormalities based on the AFQ method could be as a diagnostic biomarker in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Animal models are indispensable tools in the development of innovative treatments for rare and incurable diseases. To date, there is almost no effective treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, and animal models that properly simulate human disease pathologies are eagerly anticipated to identify disease biomarkers and develop therapeutic methods and agents. Among experimental animals, non-human primates are the most suitable animal models for the study of neurodegenerative diseases with human-specific higher brain dysfunction and late-onset and slowly progressing symptoms. With the rapid development of novel therapies such as oligonucleotide therapeutics and genome editing technologies, non-human primate models for neurodegenerative diseases will be essential for preclinical studies and active interventional trials. In a previous publication, we reported the generation of the first transgenic marmoset model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and successful obtainment of subsequent generations with stable disease onset. Moreover, we generated transgenic marmosets in which the transgene was controlled by the tetracycline-inducible gene expression system. In this mini-review, we summarize the research on our marmoset model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Different Stimulation Conditions on the Stimulation Effect of Noisy Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Balance disorders are a risk factor for falls in the elderly population. Balance control involving the complex interaction among nervous, muscular, and sensory systems should be maintained to keep an upright posture and prevent falls. Vestibular sensation is one of the main senses essential for postural control. Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (nGVS) is a noninvasive stimulation method for vestibular organs. Recently, it has received increasing attention for the treatment of balance disorders. However, the effect of balance disorders on stimulus effect during the implementation of nGVS remains unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effects of different floor surface and visual conditions on the stimulus effects of the nGVS intervention. In this study, two experiments were conducted with 24 participants (12 each for Experiments 1 and 2). In Experiment 1, nGVS (0.4 mA; 0.1–640 Hz) was performed in the open-eyes standing position on a solid surface (nGVS condition) and in the closed-eye standing position on a foam rubber (nGVS + foam rubber condition). In Experiment 2, sham stimulation was performed under the same conditions as in Experiment 1, except for nGVS. Center of pressure (COP) sway was measured in all participants with them standing with open eyes at Pre and Post-1 (immediately after the intervention) and Post-2 (10 min after the measurement of post-1). In Experiment 1, under the nGVS condition, COP sway was significantly reduced in Post-1 and Post-2 compared with Pre. However, no significant difference was observed among Pre, Post-1, and Post-2 under the nGVS + foam rubber condition. Furthermore, the intervention effect was significantly greater in the nGVS condition than in the nGVS + foam rubber condition. In contrast, in Experiment 2, the COP sway did not significantly differ among Pre, Post-1, and Post-2 under either condition. Based on the results of this study, nGVS was found to be effective with open-eyes standing on a solid surface.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Proto-Object Based Saliency Model With Texture Detection Channel</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The amount of visual information projected from the retina to the brain exceeds the information processing capacity of the latter. Attention, therefore, functions as a filter to highlight important information at multiple stages of the visual pathway that requires further and more detailed analysis. Among other functions, this determines where to fixate since only the fovea allows for high resolution imaging. Visual saliency modeling, i.e. understanding how the brain selects important information to analyze further and to determine where to fixate next, is an important research topic in computational neuroscience and computer vision. Most existing bottom-up saliency models use low-level features such as intensity and color, while some models employ high-level features, like faces. However, little consideration has been given to mid-level features, such as texture, for visual saliency models. In this paper, we extend a biologically plausible proto-object based saliency model by adding simple texture channels which employ nonlinear operations that mimic the processing performed by primate visual cortex. The extended model shows statistically significant improved performance in predicting human fixations compared to the previous model. Comparing the performance of our model with others on publicly available benchmarking datasets, we find that our biologically plausible model matches the performance of other models, even though those were designed entirely for maximal performance with little regard to biological realism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mean Apparent Propagator MRI Is Better Than Conventional Diffusion Tensor Imaging for the Evaluation of Parkinson’s Disease: A Prospective Pilot Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.563595</guid>

	<description>Background and Purpose&lt;p&gt;Mean apparent propagator (MAP) MRI is a novel diffusion imaging method to map tissue microstructure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of the MAP MRI in Parkinson’s disease (PD) in comparison with conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;23 PD patients and 22 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were included. MAP MRI and DTI were performed on a 3T MR scanner with a 20-channel head coil. The MAP metrics including mean square displacement (MSD), return to the origin probability (RTOP), return to the axis probability (RTAP), and return to the plane probability (RTPP), and DTI metrics including fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD), were measured in subcortical gray matter and compared between the two groups. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze the diagnostic performance of all the metrics. The association between the diffusion metrics and disease severity was assessed by Pearson correlation analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;For MAP MRI, the mean values of MSD in the bilateral caudate, pallidum, putamen, thalamus and substantia nigra (SN) were higher in PD patients than in healthy controls (p&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 0.001); the mean values of the zero displacement probabilities (RTOP, RTAP, and RTPP) in the bilateral caudate, pallidum, putamen and thalamus were lower in PD patients (p&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). For DTI, only FA in the bilateral SN was significantly higher in PD patients than those in the controls (p&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). ROC analysis showed that the areas under the curves of MAP MRI metrics (MSD, RTOP, RTAP, and RTPP) in the bilateral caudate, pallidum, putamen and thalamus (range, 0.85–0.94) were greater than those of FA and MD of DTI (range, 0.55–0.69) in discriminating between PD patients and healthy controls. RTAP in the ipsilateral pallidum (r = −0.56, p&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.027), RTOP in the bilateral and contralateral putamen (r = −0.58, p&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.019; r = −0.57, p&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.024) were negatively correlated with UPDRS III motor scores.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;MAP MRI outperformed the conventional DTI in the diagnosis of PD and evaluation of the disease severity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Central synapses are often surrounded by thin astroglial processes that confine chemical neurotransmission to the synaptic cleft. Henneberger et al. find that memory trace formation at synaptic connections prompts withdrawal of these processes, thus boosting extrasynaptic neurotransmitter actions. Such actions can alter signal integration rules among neighboring synapses.</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Dendritic integration in olfactory bulb granule cells upon simultaneous multispine activation: Low thresholds for nonlocal spiking activity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Max Mueller, Veronica Egger&lt;/p&gt;

The inhibitory axonless olfactory bulb granule cells form reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses with mitral and tufted cells via large spines, mediating recurrent and lateral inhibition. As a case in point for dendritic transmitter release, rat granule cell dendrites are highly excitable, featuring local Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; spine spikes and global Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;- and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-spikes. To investigate the transition from local to global signaling, we performed holographic, simultaneous 2-photon uncaging of glutamate at up to 12 granule cell spines, along with whole-cell recording and dendritic 2-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging in acute juvenile rat brain slices. Coactivation of less than 10 reciprocal spines was sufficient to generate diverse regenerative signals that included regional dendritic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-spikes and dendritic Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-spikes (D-spikes). Global Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-spikes could be triggered in one third of granule cells. Individual spines and dendritic segments sensed the respective signal transitions as increments in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry. Dendritic integration as monitored by the somatic membrane potential was mostly linear until a threshold number of spines was activated, at which often D-spikes along with supralinear summation set in. As to the mechanisms supporting active integration, NMDA receptors (NMDARs) strongly contributed to all aspects of supralinearity, followed by dendritic voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;- and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-channels, whereas local Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; spine spikes, as well as morphological variables, barely mattered.
Because of the low numbers of coactive spines required to trigger dendritic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals and thus possibly lateral release of GABA onto mitral and tufted cells, we predict that thresholds for granule cell-mediated bulbar lateral inhibition are low. Moreover, D-spikes could provide a plausible substrate for granule cell-mediated gamma oscillations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/48r20hfzkFo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Putative dendritic correlates of chronic traumatic encephalopathy: A preliminary quantitative Golgi exploration&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6ee415e4-9382-4441-9600-56badd952bce/cne25022-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macroscopic gray matter changes have been well documented in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The present study examined microscopic gray matter changes in CTE by comparing the dendritic arbors of supragranular pyramidal neurons from prefrontal and occipital cortices in both Control and CTE cases. CTE neurons exhibited significantly lower mean dendritic measure values than did Control neurons, while also displaying considerably greater variability across measures. These changes may be a newly described pathological marker of CTE and could supplement current mechanistic and functional understandings of the disease.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with repetitive head impacts. Neuropathologically, it is defined by the presence of perivascular hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates in cortical tissue (McKee et al., 2016, &lt;i&gt;Acta Neuropathologica&lt;/i&gt;, 131, 75–86). Although many pathological and assumed clinical correlates of CTE have been well characterized, its effects on cortical dendritic arbors are still unknown. Here, we quantified dendrites and dendritic spines of supragranular pyramidal neurons in tissue from human frontal and occipital lobes, in 11 cases with (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 79 ± 7 years) and 5 cases without (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 76 ± 11 years) CTE. Tissue was stained with a modified rapid Golgi technique. Dendritic systems of 20 neurons per region in each brain (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 640 neurons) were quantified using computer‐assisted morphometry. One key finding was that CTE neurons exhibited increased variability and distributional changes across six of the eight dendritic system measures, presumably due to ongoing degeneration and compensatory reorganization of dendritic systems. However, despite heightened variation among CTE neurons, CTE cases exhibited lower mean values than Control cases in seven of the eight dendritic system measures. These dendritic alterations may represent a new pathological marker of CTE, and further examination of dendritic changes could contribute to both mechanistic and functional understandings of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Reminders activate the prefrontal‐medial temporal cortex and attenuate forgetting of event memory</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replicas of an aspect of an experienced event can serve as effective reminders, yet little is known about the neural basis of such reminding effects. Here we examined the neural activity underlying the memory‐enhancing effect of reminders 1 week after encoding of naturalistic film clip events. We used fMRI to determine differences in network activity associated with recently reactivated memories relative to comparably aged, non‐reactivated memories. Reminders were effective in facilitating overall retrieval of memory for film clips, in an all‐or‐none fashion. Prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were activated during both reminders and retrieval. Peak activation in ventro‐lateral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) preceded peak activation in the right hippocampus during the reminders. For film clips that were successfully retrieved after 7 days, pre‐retrieval reminders did not enhance the quality of the retrieved memory or the number of details retrieved, nor did they more strongly engage regions of the recollection network than did successful retrieval of a non‐reminded film clip. These results suggest that reminders prior to retrieval are an effective means of boosting retrieval of otherwise inaccessible episodic events, and that the inability to recall certain events after a delay of a week largely reflects a retrieval deficit, rather than a storage deficit for this information. The results extend other evidence that vPFC drives activation of the hippocampus to facilitate memory retrieval and scene construction, and show that this facilitation also occurs when reminder cues precede successful retrieval attempts. The time course of vPFC‐hippocampal activity during the reminder suggests that reminders may first engage schematic information meditated by vPFC followed by a recollection process mediated by the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Aversive teaching signals from individual dopamine neurons in larval Drosophila show qualitative differences in their temporal 'fingerprint'&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1c821cf6-a6b1-45a3-9efc-93d5afe2a007/cne25037-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Punishment feels bad, but relief from it feels good. Correspondingly, negative memories are formed for cues when these are associated with the occurrence of punishment. In contrast, positive memories result from their association with relief. Such timing‐dependent valence reversal is observed in humans and in animals alike. Using Drosophila larvae, Weiglein et al present an odor cue either before or after optogenetically activating single, identified dopaminergic neurons known to mediate punishment. This reveals that these dopaminergic neurons are heterogeneous: DAN‐f1 establishes timing‐dependent valence reversal, whereas DAN‐d1 does not. Together with recent findings in the reward domain and from adult Drosophila, this suggests that such heterogeneity might be a more general principle of reinforcement processing through dopamine neurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine serves many functions, and dopamine neurons are correspondingly diverse. We use a combination of optogenetics, behavioral experiments, and high‐resolution video‐tracking to probe for the functional capacities of two single, identified dopamine neurons in larval &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. The DAN‐f1 and the DAN‐d1 neuron were recently found to carry aversive teaching signals during Pavlovian olfactory learning. We enquire into a fundamental feature of these teaching signals, namely their temporal ‘fingerprint’. That is, receiving punishment feels bad, whereas being relieved from it feels good, and animals and humans alike learn with opposite valence about the occurrence and the termination of punishment (the same principle applies in the appetitive domain, with opposite sign). We find that DAN‐f1 but not DAN‐d1 can mediate such timing‐dependent valence reversal: presenting an odor before DAN‐f1 activation leads to learned avoidance of the odor (punishment memory), whereas presenting the odor upon termination of DAN‐f1 activation leads to learned approach (relief memory). In contrast, DAN‐d1 confers punishment memory only. These effects are further characterized in terms of the impact of the duration of optogenetic activation, the temporal stability of the memories thus established, and the specific microbehavioral patterns of locomotion through which they are expressed. Together with recent findings in the appetitive domain and from adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, our results suggest that heterogeneity in the temporal fingerprint of teaching signals might be a more general principle of reinforcement processing through dopamine neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides an analysis of the cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture and chemoarchitecture of the diencephalon (dorsal thalamus, ventral thalamus and epithalamus) of the banded mongoose (&lt;i&gt;Mungos mungo&lt;/i&gt;) and domestic ferret (&lt;i&gt;Mustela putorius furo&lt;/i&gt;). Using architectural and immunohistochemical stains, we observe that the nuclear organization of the diencephalon is very similar in the two species, and similar to that reported in other carnivores, such as the domestic cat and dog. The same complement of putatively homologous nuclei were identified in both species, with only one variance, that being the presence of the perireticular nucleus in the domestic ferret, that was not observed in the banded mongoose. The chemoarchitecture was also mostly consistent between species, although there were a number of minor variations across a range of nuclei in the density of structures expressing the calcium‐binding proteins parvalbumin, calbindin and calretinin. Thus, despite almost 53 million years since these two species of carnivores shared a common ancestor, strong phylogenetic constraints appear to limit the potential for adaptive evolutionary plasticity within the carnivore order. Apart from the presence of the perireticular nucleus, the most notable difference between the species studied was the physical inversion of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, as well as the lateral posterior and pulvinar nuclei in the domestic ferret compared to the banded mongoose and other carnivores, although this inversion appears to be a feature of the Mustelidae family. While no functional sequelae are suggested, this inversion is likely to result from the altricial birth of Mustelidae species.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Dietary docosahexaenoic acid inhibits neurodegeneration and prevents stroke</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroke severely impairs quality of life and has a high mortality rate. On the other hand, dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) prevents neuronal damage. In this review, we describe the effects of dietary DHA on ischemic stroke‐associated neuronal damage and its role in stroke prevention. Recent epidemiological studies have been conducted to analyze stroke prevention through DHA intake. The effects of dietary intake and supply of DHA to neuronal cells, DHA‐mediated inhibition of neuronal damage, and its mechanism, including the effects of the DHA metabolite, neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), were investigated. These studies revealed that DHA intake was associated with a reduced risk of stroke. Moreover, studies have shown that DHA intake may reduce stroke mortality rates. DHA, which is abundant in fish oil, passes through the blood–brain barrier to accumulate as a constituent of phospholipids in the cell membranes of neuronal cells and astrocytes. Astrocytes supply DHA to neuronal cells, and neuronal DHA, in turn, activates Akt and Raf‐1 to prevent neuronal death or damage. Therefore, DHA indirectly prevents neuronal damage. Furthermore, NDP1 blocks neuronal apoptosis. DHA, together with NPD1, may block neuronal damage and prevent stroke. The inhibitory effect on neuronal damage is achieved through the antioxidant (via inducing the Nrf2/HO‐1 system) and anti‐inflammatory effects (via promoting JNK/AP‐1 signaling) of DHA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Synaptoprotection in Perinatal Asphyxia: An Experimental Approach</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00035</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00035</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Perinatal asphyxia (PA) is an obstetric complication occurring when the oxygen supply to the newborn is temporally interrupted. This health problem is associated with high morbimortality in term and preterm neonates. It severely affects the brain structure and function, involving cortical, hippocampal, and striatal loss of neurons. Nearly 25% of PA survivor newborns develop several neurodevelopmental disabilities. Behavioral alterations, as well as the morphological and biochemical pathways involved in PA pathophysiology, have been studied using an animal model that resembles intrauterine asphyxia. Experimental evidence shows that PA induces synaptic derangement. Then, synaptic dysfunction embodies a putative target for neuroprotective strategies. Over the last years, therapeutic hypothermia (TH), the only treatment available, has shown positive results in the clinic. Several pharmacological agents are being tested in experimental or clinical trial studies to prevent synaptopathy. Preservation of the synaptic structure and function, i.e., “synaptoprotection,” makes up a promising challenge for reducing incidental neurodevelopmental disorders associated with PA. Accordingly, here, we summarize and review the findings obtained from the referred experimental model and propose a renewed overview in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Cell Biology of Tau Secretion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The progressive accumulation and spread of misfolded tau protein in the nervous system is the hallmark of tauopathies, progressive neurodegenerative diseases with only symptomatic treatments available. A growing body of evidence suggests that spreading of tau pathology can occur via cell-to-cell transfer involving secretion and internalization of pathological forms of tau protein followed by templated misfolding of normal tau in recipient cells. Several studies have addressed the cell biological mechanisms of tau secretion. It now appears that instead of a single mechanism, cells can secrete tau via three coexisting pathways: (1) translocation through the plasma membrane; (2) membranous organelles-based secretion; and (3) ectosomal shedding. The relative importance of these pathways in the secretion of normal and pathological tau is still elusive, though. Moreover, glial cells contribute to tau propagation, and the involvement of different cell types, as well as different secretion pathways, complicates the understanding of prion-like propagation of tauopathy. One of the important regulators of tau secretion in neuronal activity, but its mechanistic connection to tau secretion remains unclear and may involve all three secretion pathways of tau. This review article summarizes recent advancements in the field of tau secretion with an emphasis on cell biological aspects of the secretion process and discusses the role of neuronal activity and glial cells in the spread of pathological forms of tau.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: A Semiquantitative Non-invasive Measurement of PcomA Patency in C57BL/6 Mice Explains Variance in Ischemic Brain Damage in Filament MCAo</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.576741</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.576741</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies on experimental ischemic stroke use the filament middle cerebral artery occlusion (fMCAo) model in C57BL/6 mice, but lesion sizes in this strain are highly variable. A known contributor is variation in the posterior communicating artery (PcomA) patency. We therefore aimed to provide a semiquantitative non-invasive in vivo method to routinely assess PcomA patency. We included 43 male C57BL/6 mice from four independent studies using a transient 45 min fMCAo model. Edema-corrected lesion sizes were measured by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging 24 h after reperfusion. Time-of-flight MR angiography was performed 7 days before and 24 h after fMCAo. Scores of PcomA size measured 24 h after, but not scores measured 7 days before fMCAo were negatively correlated with lesion size. Variability in PcomA patency explained 30% of the variance in our cohort (p &amp;lt; 0.0001, coefficient of determination r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.3). In a simulation using parameters typical for experimental stroke research, the power to detect a true effect of d = 1 between two groups increased by 15% when an according covariate was included in the statistical model. We have demonstrated that in vivo measurement of PcomA size is feasible and can lead to increased accuracy in assessing the effect of treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Peripheral nerve stimulation may be an alternative option to treat severe facial pain. We assessed the application of peripheral nerve stimulation for pain management in patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;A retrospective analysis was conducted in patients suffering severe facial pain caused by ophthalmic herpetic lesions. We identified the change in pain severity before and after peripheral nerve stimulation for up to 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Eighteen patients were enrolled. Their mean age was 70.8 ± 9.5 years. Fifteen patients presented with subacute pain for 1–3 months, and three patients suffered postherpetic neuralgia. Dramatic relief from pain was achieved in 83% of patients (15 out of 18) upon initial removal of the stimulator, with pain reduction of &amp;gt; 50%. The long-term analgesic effect was reported at the 6- and 12-month follow-ups, with reductions in the visual analog scale of 4.8 ± 1.2 (n = 18) and 5.4 ± 1.4 (n = 11), respectively. The prevalence of postherpetic neuralgia was 7% (1 out of 15) in the subacute pain group. No obvious adverse effect was observed.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Peripheral nerve stimulation may be an efficacious and safe approach for pain control in patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Common and Distinct Features of Adult Neurogenesis and Regeneration in the Telencephalon of Zebrafish and Mammals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.568930</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In contrast to mammals, the adult zebrafish brain shows neurogenic activity in a multitude of niches present in almost all brain subdivisions. Irrespectively, constitutive neurogenesis in the adult zebrafish and mouse telencephalon share many similarities at the cellular and molecular level. However, upon injury during tissue repair, the situation is entirely different. In zebrafish, inflammation caused by traumatic brain injury or by induced neurodegeneration initiates specific and distinct neurogenic programs that, in combination with signaling pathways implicated in constitutive neurogenesis, quickly, and efficiently overcome the loss of neurons. In the mouse brain, injury-induced inflammation promotes gliosis leading to glial scar formation and inhibition of regeneration. A better understanding of the regenerative mechanisms occurring in the zebrafish brain could help to develop new therapies to combat the debilitating consequences of brain injury, stroke, and neurodegeneration. The aim of this review is to compare the properties of neural progenitors and the signaling pathways, which control adult neurogenesis and regeneration in the zebrafish and mammalian telencephalon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Systems Biology: Subjectivity as an Emergent Property of Information Processing by Neuronal Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.548071</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.548071</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Here, we examine subjectivity and consciousness as emergent properties of the computational complexity of information processing by the brain, rather than metaphysical phenomena. While Psychology concentrates on the emergent properties and Neurobiology examines the properties of the biological substrate, Neurophysiology and Cognitive Neuroscience link the two levels by investigating the mechanisms and processes by which the functions of the brain emerge from the anatomical, cellular and network properties of the nervous system. Our purpose here is not to locate the neural structures that sustain subjectivity or other psychic functions; rather, we examine the operating modes of neurons and neural circuits: they reveal an intrinsically relational quality; sensory elaboration itself proves to be relational and self-centred, necessarily associated with the vital, hedonic, emotional relevance of each experience and external cue, and intrinsically oriented to a behavioral interaction with the latter. The hippocampus adds to this self-centred relational perspective the capability of transforming the identification and the spatial location of objects into a contextualized representation of reality. Since the hippocampus is strongly interconnected with the archaic structures that evaluate vital and hedonic relevance and generate emotional responses, the contextualized information, emotionally colored, is transformed into a comprehensive individual experience. This way, a subjective, self-centred, affectively colored perspective arises in animals due to the intrinsic properties of neuronal circuits in the brain. We conclude that neuronal network processing is strongly characterized per se by a relational and self-centred (subjective) and emotionally colored, motivationally oriented (personal) perspective. The properties and features of neural processing discussed here constitute well-established knowledge in the neuroscientific community. Yet, from a layman’s perception, subjectivity still mysteriously arises in our brain due to the action of consciousness, and in epistemological and philosophical debates, the question often arises as to how consciousness may add the subjective and personal perspective to neural elaboration. The answer appears to be simple: it does not; subjectivity is already there, present ab initio in neuronal processing and not added a posteriori by some other “consciousness” function of unclear neural basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The immune system is essential for maintaining homeostasis, as well as promoting growth and healing throughout the brain and body. Considering that immune cells respond rapidly to changes in their microenvironment, they are very difficult to study without affecting their structure and function. The advancement of non-invasive imaging methods greatly contributed to elucidating the physiological roles performed by immune cells in the brain across stages of the lifespan and contexts of health and disease. For instance, techniques like two-photon in vivo microscopy were pivotal for studying microglial functional dynamics in the healthy brain. Through these observations, their interactions with neurons, astrocytes, blood vessels and synapses were uncovered. High-resolution electron microscopy with immunostaining and 3D-reconstruction, as well as super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, provided complementary insights by revealing microglial interventions at synapses (phagocytosis, trogocytosis, synaptic stripping, etc.). In addition, serial block-face scanning electron microscopy has provided the first 3D reconstruction of a microglial cell at nanoscale resolution. This review will discuss the technical toolbox that currently allows to study microglia and other immune cells in the brain, as well as introduce emerging methods that were developed and could be used to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of neuroimmune imaging. A special attention will also be placed on positron emission tomography and the development of selective functional radiotracers for microglia and peripheral macrophages, considering their strong potential for research translation between animals and humans, notably when paired with other imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Not All Words Are Equally Acquired: Transitional Probabilities and Instructions Affect the Electrophysiological Correlates of Statistical Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.577991</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.577991</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Statistical learning (SL), the process of extracting regularities from the environment, is a fundamental skill of our cognitive system to structure the world regularly and predictably. SL has been studied using mainly behavioral tasks under implicit conditions and with triplets presenting the same level of difficulty, i.e., a mean transitional probability (TP) of 1.00. Yet, the neural mechanisms underlying SL under other learning conditions remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the neurofunctional correlates of SL using triplets (i.e., three-syllable nonsense words) with a mean TP of 1.00 (easy “words”) and 0.50 (hard “words”) in an SL task performed under incidental (implicit) and intentional (explicit) conditions, to determine whether the same core mechanisms were recruited to assist learning. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants listened firstly to a continuous auditory stream made of the concatenation of four easy and four hard “words” under implicit instructions, and subsequently to another auditory stream made of the concatenation of four easy and four hard “words” drawn from another artificial language under explicit instructions. The stream in each of the SL tasks was presented in two consecutive blocks of ~3.5-min each (~7-min in total) to further examine how ERP components might change over time. Behavioral measures of SL were collected after the familiarization phase of each SL task by asking participants to perform a two-alternative forced-choice (2-AFC) task. Results from the 2-AFC tasks revealed a moderate but reliable level of SL, with no differences between conditions. ERPs were, nevertheless, sensitive to the effect of TPs, showing larger amplitudes of N400 for easy “words,” as well as to the effect of instructions, with a reduced N250 for “words” presented under explicit conditions. Also, significant differences in the N100 were found as a result of the interaction between TPs, instructions, and the amount of exposure to the auditory stream. Taken together, our findings suggest that triplets’ predictability impacts the emergence of “words” representations in the brain both for statistical regularities extracted under incidental and intentional instructions, although the prior knowledge of the “words” seems to favor the recruitment of different SL mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of High-Definition Transcranial Direct-Current Stimulation on Resting-State Functional Connectivity in Patients With Disorders of Consciousness</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently a positive treatment effect on disorders of consciousness (DOCs) with high-definition transcranial direct-current stimulation (HD-tDCS) has been reported; however, the neural modulation mechanisms of this treatment’s efficacy need further investigation. To better understand the processing of HD-tDCS interventions, a long-lasting HD-tDCS protocol was applied to 15 unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients and 20 minimally conscious states (MCS) patients in this study. Ten minutes of resting-state electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded from the patients, and the coma recovery scale-revised scores (CRS-Rs) were assessed for each patient from four time-points (T0, T1, T2, and T3). Brain networks were constructed by calculating the EEG spectral connectivity using the debiased weighted phase lag index (dwPLI) and then quantified the network information transmission efficiency by graph theory. We found that there was an increasing trend in local and global information processing of beta and gamma bands in resting-state functional brain networks during the 14 days of HD-tDCS modulation for MCS patients. Furthermore, the increased functional connectivity not only occurred in the local brain area surrounding the stimulation position but was also present across more global brain areas. Our results suggest that long-lasting HD-tDCS on the precuneus may facilitate information processing among neural populations in MCS patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Emotional decoding and automatic identification of major depressive disorder (MDD) are helpful for the timely diagnosis of the disease. Electroencephalography (EEG) is sensitive to changes in the functional state of the human brain, showing its potential to help doctors diagnose MDD. In this paper, an approach for identifying MDD by fusing interhemispheric asymmetry and cross-correlation with EEG signals is proposed and tested on 32 subjects [16 patients with MDD and 16 healthy controls (HCs)]. First, the structural features and connectivity features of the θ-, α-, and β-frequency bands are extracted on the preprocessed and segmented EEG signals. Second, the structural feature matrix of the θ-, α-, and β-frequency bands are added to and subtracted from the connectivity feature matrix to obtain mixed features. Finally, the structural features, connectivity features, and the mixed features are fed to three classifiers to select suitable features for the classification, and it is found that our mode achieves the best classification results using the mixed features. The results are also compared with those from some state-of-the-art methods, and we achieved an accuracy of 94.13%, a sensitivity of 95.74%, a specificity of 93.52%, and an F1-score (f1) of 95.62% on the data from Beijing Anding Hospital, Capital Medical University. The study could be generalized to develop a system that may be helpful in clinical purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: A Systematic Framework for Olfactory Bulb Signal Transformations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.579143</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We describe an integrated theory of olfactory systems operation that incorporates experimental findings across scales, stages, and methods of analysis into a common framework. In particular, we consider the multiple stages of olfactory signal processing as a collective system, in which each stage samples selectively from its antecedents. We propose that, following the signal conditioning operations of the nasal epithelium and glomerular-layer circuitry, the plastic external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb effects a process of category learning—the basis for extracting meaningful, quasi-discrete odor representations from the metric space of undifferentiated olfactory quality. Moreover, this early categorization process also resolves the foundational problem of how odors of interest can be recognized in the presence of strong competitive interference from simultaneously encountered background odorants. This problem is fundamentally constraining on early-stage olfactory encoding strategies and must be resolved if these strategies and their underlying mechanisms are to be understood. Multiscale general theories of olfactory systems operation are essential in order to leverage the analytical advantages of engineered approaches together with our expanding capacity to interrogate biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Sex-Related Differential Whole-Brain Input Atlas of Locus Coeruleus Noradrenaline Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As the most important organ in our bodies, the brain plays a critical role in deciding sex-related differential features; however, the underlying neural circuitry basis remains unclear. Here, we used a cell-type-specific rabies virus-mediated monosynaptic tracing system to generate a sex differences-related whole-brain input atlas of locus coeruleus noradrenaline (LC-NE) neurons. We developed custom pipelines for brain-wide comparisons of input sources in both sexes with the registration of the whole-brain data set to the Allen Mouse Brain Reference Atlas. Among 257 distinct anatomical regions, we demonstrated the differential proportions of inputs to LC-NE neurons in male and female mice at different levels. Locus coeruleus noradrenaline neurons of two sexes showed general similarity in the input patterns, but with differentiated input proportions quantitatively from major brain regions and diverse sub-regions. For instance, inputs to male LC-NE neurons were found mainly in the cerebrum, interbrain, and cerebellum, whereas inputs to female LC-NE neurons were found in the midbrain and hindbrain. We further found that specific subsets of nuclei nested within sub-regions contributed to overall sex-related differences in the input circuitry. Furthermore, among the totaled 123 anatomical regions with proportion of inputs &amp;gt;0.1%, we also identified 11 sub-regions with significant statistical differences of total inputs between male and female mice, and seven of them also showed such differences in ipsilateral hemispheres. Our study not only provides a structural basis to facilitate our understanding of sex differences at a circuitry level but also provides clues for future sexually differentiated functional studies related to LC-NE neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Effect of β-Hydroxybutyrate on Autophagy Dynamics During Severe Hypoglycemia and the Hypoglycemic Coma</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.547215</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glucose supply from blood is mandatory for brain functioning and its interruption during acute hypoglycemia or cerebral ischemia leads to brain injury. Alternative substrates to glucose such as the ketone bodies (KB), acetoacetate (AcAc), and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), can be used as energy fuels in the brain during hypoglycemia and prevent neuronal death, but the mechanisms involved are still not well understood. During glucose deprivation adaptive cell responses can be activated such as autophagy, a lysosomal-dependent degradation process, to support cell survival. However, impaired or excessive autophagy can lead to cell dysfunction. We have previously shown that impaired autophagy contributes to neuronal death induced by glucose deprivation in cortical neurons and that D isomer of BHB (D-BHB) reestablishes the autophagic flux increasing viability. Here, we aimed to investigate autophagy dynamics in the brain of rats subjected to severe hypoglycemia (SH) without glucose infusion (GI), severe hypoglycemia followed by GI (SH + GI), and a brief period of hypoglycemic coma followed by GI (Coma). The effect of D-BHB administration after the coma was also tested (Coma + BHB). The transformation of LC3-I to LC3-II and the abundance of autophagy proteins, Beclin 1 (BECN1), ATG7, and ATG12–ATG5 conjugate, were analyzed as an index of autophagosome formation, and the levels of sequestrosome1/p62 (SQSTM1/p62) were determined as a hallmark of autophagic degradation. Data suggest that autophagosomes accumulate in the cortex and the hippocampus of rats after SH, likely due to impaired autophagic degradation. In the cortex, autophagosome accumulation persisted at 6 h after GI in animals exposed to SH but recovered basal levels at 24 h, while in the hippocampus no significant effect was observed. In animals subjected to coma, autophagosome accumulation was observed at 24 h after GI in both regions. D-BHB treatment reduced LC3-II and SQSTM1/p62 content and reduced ULK1 phosphorylation by AMPK, suggesting it stimulates the autophagic flux and decreases AMPK activity reducing autophagy initiation. D-BHB also reduced the number of degenerating cells. Together, data suggest different autophagy dynamics after GI in rats subjected to SH or the hypoglycemic coma and support that D-BHB treatment can modulate autophagy dynamics favoring the autophagic flux.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Beneficial Roles of Microglia and Growth Factors in MS, a Brief Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00284</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are the brain resident immune cells; they can produce a large variety of growth factors (GFs) to prevent neuronal damages and promote recovery. In neurodegenerative diseases, microglia can play both benefic and deleterious roles, depending on different factors and disease context. In multiple sclerosis, microglia are involved in both demyelination (DM) and remyelination (RM) processes. Recent studies suggest a beneficial role of microglia in regenerative processes. These include the regenerative development of myelin after DM. This review gives an overlook of how microglia and GFs can influence the RM properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Catecholaminergic Innervation of Periventricular Neurogenic Regions of the Developing Mouse Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.558435</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.558435</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The major catecholamines—dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE)—are not only involved in synaptic communication but also act as important trophic factors and might ultimately be involved in mammalian brain development. The catecholaminergic innervation of neurogenic regions of the developing brain and its putative relationship to neurogenesis is thus of pivotal interest. We here determined DA and NE innervation around the ventricular/subventricular zone (VZ/SVZ) bordering the whole ventricular system of the developing mouse brain from embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5), E16.5, and E19.5 until postnatal day zero (P0) by histological evaluation and HPLC with electrochemical detection. We correlated these data with the proliferation capacity of the respective regions by quantification of MCM2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. During development, VZ/SVZ catecholamine levels dramatically increased between E16.5 and P0 with DA levels increasing in forebrain VZ/SVZ bordering the lateral ventricles and NE levels raising in midbrain/hindbrain VZ/SVZ bordering the third ventricle, the aqueduct, and the fourth ventricle. Conversely, proliferating MCM2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell counts dropped between E16.5 and E19.5 with a special focus on all VZ/SVZs outside the lateral ventricles. We detected an inverse strong negative correlation of the proliferation capacity in the periventricular neurogenic regions (log-transformed MCM2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell counts) with their NE levels (r = −0.932; p &amp;lt; 0.001), but not their DA levels (r = 0.440; p = 0.051) suggesting putative inhibitory effects of NE on cell proliferation within the periventricular regions during mouse brain development. Our data provide the first framework for further demandable studies on the functional importance of catecholamines, particularly NE, in regulating neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation during mammalian brain development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: 3D Exploration of the Brainstem in 50-Micron Resolution MRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00040</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brainstem, a structure of vital importance in mammals, is currently becoming a principal focus in cognitive, affective, and clinical neuroscience. Midbrain, pontine and medullary structures serve as the conduit for signals between the forebrain and spinal cord, are the epicenter of cranial nerve-circuits and systems, and subserve such integrative functions as consciousness, emotional processing, pain, and motivation. In this study, we parcellated the nuclear masses and the principal fiber pathways that were visible in a high-resolution T2-weighted MRI dataset of 50-micron isotropic voxels of a postmortem human brainstem. Based on this analysis, we generated a detailed map of the human brainstem. To assess the validity of our maps, we compared our observations with histological maps of traditional human brainstem atlases. Given the unique capability of MRI-based morphometric analysis in generating and preserving the morphology of 3D objects from individual 2D sections, we reconstructed the motor, sensory and integrative neural systems of the brainstem and rendered them in 3D representations. We anticipate the utilization of these maps by the neuroimaging community for applications in basic neuroscience as well as in neurology, psychiatry, and neurosurgery, due to their versatile computational nature in 2D and 3D representations in a publicly available capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease: Is the Adaptive Immune System a Friend or Foe?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) are characterized by progressive neuronal death and neurological dysfunction, leading to increased disability and a loss of cognitive or motor functions. Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have neurodegeneration as a primary feature. However, in other CNS diseases such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury, neurodegeneration follows another insult, such as demyelination or ischaemia. Although there are different primary causes to these diseases, they all share a hallmark of neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation can occur through the activation of resident immune cells such as microglia, cells of the innate and adaptive peripheral immune system, meningeal inflammation and autoantibodies directed toward components of the CNS. Despite chronic inflammation being pathogenic in these diseases, local inflammation after insult can also promote endogenous regenerative processes in the CNS, which are key to slowing disease progression. The normal aging process in the healthy brain is associated with a decline in physiological function, a steady increase in levels of neuroinflammation, brain shrinkage, and memory deficits. Likewise, aging is also a key contributor to the progression and exacerbation of neurodegenerative diseases. As there are associated co-morbidities within an aging population, pinpointing the precise relationship between aging and neurodegenerative disease progression can be a challenge. The CNS has historically been considered an isolated, “immune privileged” site, however, there is mounting evidence that adaptive immune cells are present in the CNS of both healthy individuals and diseased patients. Adaptive immune cells have also been implicated in both the degeneration and regeneration of the CNS. In this review, we will discuss the key role of the adaptive immune system in CNS degeneration and regeneration, with a focus on how aging influences this crosstalk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
