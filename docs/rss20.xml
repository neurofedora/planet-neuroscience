	<description>Recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of human hemoglobin (Hb) give results in disagreement with experiment. Although it is known that the unliganded (T&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt;) and liganded (R&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;4&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt;) tetramers are stable in solution, the published MD simulations of T&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt; undergo a rapid quaternary transition to an R-like structure. We show that T&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt; is stable only when the periodic solvent box contains ten times more water molecules than the standard size for such simulations. The results suggest that such a large box is required for the hydrophobic effect, which stabilizes the T&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt; tetramer, to be manifested. Even in the largest box, T&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt; is not stable unless His146 is protonated, providing an atomistic validation of the Perutz model. The possibility that extra large boxes are required to obtain meaningful results will have to be considered in evaluating existing and future simulations of a wide range of systems.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Synaptic Mechanisms for Bandwidth Tuning in Awake Mouse Primary Auditory Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy165</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy165/5052731?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Spatial size tuning in the visual cortex has been considered as an important neuronal functional property for sensory perception. However, an analogous mechanism in the auditory system has remained controversial. In the present study, cell-attached recordings in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake mice revealed that excitatory neurons can be categorized into three types according to their bandwidth tuning profiles in response to band-passed noise (BPN) stimuli: nonmonotonic (NM), flat, and monotonic, with the latter two considered as non-tuned for bandwidth. The prevalence of bandwidth-tuned (i.e., NM) neurons increases significantly from layer 4 to layer 2/3. With sequential cell-attached and whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from the same neurons, we found that the bandwidth preference of excitatory neurons is largely determined by the excitatory synaptic input they receive, and that the bandwidth selectivity is further enhanced by flatly tuned inhibition observed in all cells. The latter can be attributed at least partially to the flat tuning of parvalbumin inhibitory neurons. The tuning of auditory cortical neurons for bandwidth of BPN may contribute to the processing of complex sounds.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Heritability of Regional Brain Volumes in Large-Scale Neuroimaging and Genetic Studies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy157</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Brain genetics is an active research area. The degree to which genetic variants impact variations in brain structure and function remains largely unknown. We examined the heritability of regional brain volumes (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; ~ 100) captured by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in UK Biobank (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 9000). We found that regional brain volumes are highly heritable in this study population and common genetic variants can explain up to 80% of their variabilities (median heritability 34.8%). We observed omnigenic impact across the genome and examined the enrichment of SNPs in active chromatin regions. Principal components derived from regional volume data are also highly heritable, but the amount of variance in brain volume explained by the component did not seem to be related to its heritability. Heritability estimates vary substantially across large-scale functional networks, exhibit a symmetric pattern across left and right hemispheres, and are consistent in females and males (correlation = 0.638). We repeated the main analysis in Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 1100), Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 600), and Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 500) datasets, which demonstrated that more stable estimates can be obtained from the UK Biobank.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Audio-Tactile and Peripersonal Space Processing Around the Trunk in Human Parietal and Temporal Cortex: An Intracranial EEG Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy156</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy156/5052728?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Interactions with the environment happen within one’s peripersonal space (PPS)—the space surrounding the body. Studies in monkeys and humans have highlighted a multisensory distributed cortical network representing the PPS. However, knowledge about the temporal dynamics of PPS processing around the trunk is lacking. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in humans while administering tactile stimulation (T), approaching auditory stimuli (A), and the 2 combined (AT). To map PPS, tactile stimulation was delivered when the sound was far, intermediate, or close to the body. The 19% of the electrodes showed AT multisensory integration. Among those, 30% showed a PPS effect, a modulation of the response as a function of the distance between the sound and body. AT multisensory integration and PPS effects had similar spatiotemporal characteristics, with an early response (~50 ms) in the insular cortex, and later responses (~200 ms) in precentral and postcentral gyri. Superior temporal cortex showed a different response pattern with AT multisensory integration at ~100 ms without a PPS effect. These results, represent the first iEEG delineation of PPS processing in humans and show that PPS and multisensory integration happen at similar neural sites and time periods, suggesting that PPS representation is based on a spatial modulation of multisensory integration.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Gap junctions set the speed and nucleation rate of stage I retinal waves</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/368019v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Spontaneous waves in the developing retina are essential in the formation of the retinotopic mapping in the visual system. From experiments in rabbits, it is known that the earliest type of retinal waves (stage I) is nucleated spontaneously, propagates at a speed of 45191 m/sec and relies on gap junction coupling between ganglion cells. Because gap junctions (electrical synapses) have short integration times, it has been argued that they cannot set the low speed of stage I retinal waves. Here, we present a theoretical study of a two-dimensional neural network of the ganglion cell layer with gap junction coupling and intrinsic noise. We demonstrate that this model can explain observed nucleation rates as well as the comparatively slow propagation speed of the waves. From the interaction between two coupled neurons, we estimate the wave speed in the model network. Furthermore, using simulations of small networks of neurons (N260), we estimate the nucleation rate in form of an Arrhenius escape rate. These results allow for informed simulations of a realistically sized network, yielding values of the gap junction coupling and the intrinsic noise level that are in a physiologically plausible range.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Prediction and final temporal errors are used for trial-to-trial motor corrections</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/368001v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/368001v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Correction on the basis of previous errors is paramount to sensorimotor learning. While corrections of spatial errors have been studied extensively, little is known about corrections of previous temporal errors. We tackled this problem in different conditions involving arm movements (AM), saccadic eye movements (SM) or button presses (BP). The task was to intercept a moving target at a designated zone (i. e. no spatial error) either with the hand sliding a pen on a graphics tablet (AM), a saccade (SM) or a button press (BP) that released a cursor moving ballistically for a fixed time of 330 ms. The dependency of the final temporal error on action onset varied from &quot;low&quot; in AM (due to possible online corrections) to &quot;very high&quot; in the other conditions (i.e. open loop). The lag-1 cross-correlation between action onset and the previous temporal error were close to zero in all conditions suggesting that people minimized temporal variability of the final errors across trials. Interestingly, in conditions SM and BP, action onset did not depend on the previous temporal error. However, this dependency was clearly modulated by the movement time in the AM condition: faster movements depended less on the previous actual temporal error. An analysis using a Kalman filter confirmed that people in SM, BP and AM involving fast movements used the prediction error (i.e. intended action onset minus actual action onset) for next trial correction rather than the final target error. A closer look at the AM condition revealed that both error signals were used and that the contribution of each signal follows different patterns with movement time: as movement progresses the reliance on the prediction error decreases non-linearly and that on the final error increases linearly.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Noninvasive Vagus Nerve Stimulation Alters Neural Response and Physiological Autonomic Tone to Noxious Thermal Challenge</title>

	<description>The mechanisms by which noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation (nVNS) affect central and peripheral neural circuits that subserve pain and autonomic physiology are not clear, and thus remain an area of intense investigation. Effects of nVNS vs sham stimulation on subject responses to five noxious thermal stimuli (applied to left lower extremity), were measured in 30 healthy subjects (n=15 sham and n=15 nVNS), with fMRI and physiological galvanic skin response (GSR). With repeated noxious thermal stimuli a group x time analysis showed a significantly (p &amp;lt; .001) decreased response with nVNS in bilateral primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (SI and SII), left dorsoposterior insular cortex, bilateral paracentral lobule, bilateral medial dorsal thalamus, right anterior cingulate cortex, and right orbitofrontal cortex. A group x time x GSR analysis showed a significantly decreased response in nVNS group (p &amp;lt; .0005) in bilaterally in SI, lower and mid medullary brainstem, and inferior occipital cortex. Finally, nVNS treatment showed decreased activity in pronociceptive brainstem nuclei (e.g. the reticular nucleus and rostral ventromedial medulla) and key autonomic integration nuclei (e.g. the rostroventrolateral medulla, nucleus ambiguous, and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve). In aggregate, noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation reduced the physiological response to noxious thermal stimuli and impacted neural circuits important for pain processing and autonomic output.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Anterior Thalamic Excitation and Feedforward Inhibition of Presubicular Neurons Projecting to Medial Entorhinal Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The presubiculum contains head direction cells that are crucial for spatial orientation. Here, we examined the connectivity and strengths of thalamic inputs to presubicular layer 3 neurons projecting to the medial entorhinal cortex in the mouse. We recorded pairs of projection neurons and interneurons while optogenetically stimulating afferent fibers from the anterior thalamic nuclei. Thalamic input differentially affects presubicular neurons: layer 3 pyramidal neurons and fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing interneurons are directly and monosynaptically activated, with depressing dynamics, whereas somatostatin-expressing interneurons are indirectly excited, during repetitive anterior thalamic nuclei activity. This arrangement ensures that the thalamic excitation of layer 3 cells is often followed by disynaptic inhibition. Feedforward inhibition is largely mediated by parvalbumin interneurons, which have a high probability of connection to presubicular pyramidal cells, and it may enforce temporally precise head direction tuning during head turns. Our data point to the potential contribution of presubicular microcircuits for fine-tuning thalamic head direction signals transmitted to medial entorhinal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; How microcircuits participate in shaping neural inputs is crucial to understanding information processing in the brain. Here, we show how the presubiculum may process thalamic head directional information before transmitting it to the medial entorhinal cortex. Synaptic inputs from the anterior thalamic nuclei excite layer 3 pyramidal cells and parvalbumin interneurons, which mediate disynaptic feedforward inhibition. Somatostatin interneurons are excited indirectly. Presubicular circuits may switch between two regimens depending on the angular velocity of head movements. During immobility, somatostatin-pyramidal cell interactions could support maintained head directional firing with attractor-like dynamics. During rapid head turns, in contrast, parvalbumin-mediated feedforward inhibition may act to tune the head direction signal transmitted to medial entorhinal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In language production, humans are confronted with considerable word selection demands. Often, we must select a word from among similar, acceptable, and competing alternative words to construct a sentence that conveys an intended meaning. In recent years, the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) has been identified as being critical to this ability. Despite a recent emphasis on network approaches to understanding language, how the LIFG interacts with the brain's complex networks to facilitate controlled language performance remains unknown. Here, we take a novel approach to understanding word selection as a network control process in the brain. Using an anatomical brain network derived from high-resolution diffusion spectrum imaging, we computed network controllability underlying the site of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the LIFG between administrations of language tasks that vary in response (cognitive control) demands: open-response tasks (word generation) versus closed response tasks (number naming). We found that a statistic that quantifies the LIFG's theoretically predicted control of communication across modules in the human connectome explains TMS-induced changes in open-response language task performance only. Moreover, we found that a statistic that quantifies the LIFG's theoretically predicted control of difficult-to-reach states explains vulnerability to TMS in the closed-ended (but not open-ended) response task. These findings establish a link among network controllability, cognitive function, and TMS effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This work illustrates that network control statistics applied to anatomical connectivity data demonstrate relationships with cognitive variability during controlled language tasks and TMS effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: {alpha}2{delta}-1 Is Essential for Sympathetic Output and NMDA Receptor Activity Potentiated by Angiotensin II in the Hypothalamus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Both the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system are critically involved in hypertension development. Although angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulates hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) neurons to increase sympathetic vasomotor tone, the molecular mechanism mediating this action remains unclear. The glutamate NMDAR in the PVN controls sympathetic outflow in hypertension. In this study, we determined the interaction between α2-1 (encoded by &lt;i&gt;Cacna2d1&lt;/i&gt;), commonly known as a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel subunit, and NMDARs in the hypothalamus and its role in Ang II-induced synaptic NMDAR activity in PVN presympathetic neurons. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that α2-1 interacted with the NMDAR in the hypothalamus of male rats and humans (both sexes). Ang II increased the prevalence of synaptic α2-1–NMDAR complexes in the hypothalamus. Also, Ang II increased presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity via AT1 receptors, and such effects were abolished either by treatment with pregabalin, an inhibitory α2-1 ligand, or by interrupting the α2-1–NMDAR interaction with an α2-1 C terminus-interfering peptide. In &lt;i&gt;Cacna2d1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice (both sexes), Ang II failed to affect the presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity of PVN neurons. In addition, the α2-1 C terminus-interfering peptide blocked the sympathoexcitatory response to microinjection of Ang II into the PVN. Our findings indicate that Ang II augments sympathetic vasomotor tone and excitatory glutamatergic input to PVN presympathetic neurons by stimulating α2-1-bound NMDARs at synapses. This information extends our understanding of the molecular basis for the interaction between the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin systems and suggests new strategies for treating neurogenic hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although both the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system are closely involved in hypertension development, the molecular mechanisms mediating this involvement remain unclear. We showed that α2-1, previously known as a calcium channel subunit, interacts with NMDARs in the hypothalamus of rodents and humans. Angiotensin II (Ang II) increases the synaptic expression level of α2-1–NMDAR complexes. Furthermore, inhibiting α2-1, interrupting the α2-1–NMDAR interaction, or deleting α2-1 abolishes the potentiating effects of Ang II on presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity in the hypothalamus. In addition, the sympathoexcitatory response to Ang II depends on α2-1-bound NMDARs. Thus, α2-1–NMDAR complexes in the hypothalamus serve as an important molecular substrate for the interaction between the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system. This evidence suggests that α2-1 may be a useful target for the treatment neurogenic hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Causal Evidence for Mnemonic Metacognition in Human Precuneus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6379?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Metacognition is the capacity to introspectively monitor and control one's own cognitive processes. Previous anatomical and functional neuroimaging findings implicated the important role of the precuneus in metacognition processing, especially during mnemonic tasks. However, the issue of whether this medial parietal cortex is a domain-specific region that supports mnemonic metacognition remains controversial. Here, we focally disrupted this parietal area with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in healthy human participants of both sexes, seeking to ascertain its functional necessity for metacognition in memory versus perceptual decisions. Perturbing precuneal activity selectively impaired metacognitive efficiency of temporal-order memory judgment, but not perceptual discrimination. Moreover, the correlation in individuals' metacognitive efficiency between domains disappeared when the precuneus was perturbed. Together, these findings provide evidence reinforcing the notion that the precuneal region plays an important role in mediating metacognition of episodic memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Theories on the neural basis of metacognition have thus far been largely centered on the role of the prefrontal cortex. Here we refined the theoretical framework through characterizing a unique precuneal involvement in mnemonic metacognition with a noninvasive but inferentially powerful method: transcranial magnetic stimulation. By quantifying metacognitive efficiency across two distinct domains (memory vs perception) that are matched for stimulus characteristics, we reveal an instrumental role of the precuneus in mnemonic metacognition. This causal evidence corroborates ample clinical reports that parietal lobe lesions often produce inaccurate self-reports of confidence in memory recollection and establish the precuneus as a nexus for the introspective ability to evaluate the success of memory judgment in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Monoamines Inhibit GABAergic Neurons in Ventrolateral Preoptic Area That Make Direct Synaptic Connections to Hypothalamic Arousal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6366?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The hypothalamus plays an important role in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness states. While the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) plays a critical role in the initiation and maintenance of sleep, the lateral posterior part of the hypothalamus contains neuronal populations implicated in maintenance of arousal, including orexin-producing neurons (orexin neurons) in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and histaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN). During a search for neurons that make direct synaptic contact with histidine decarboxylase-positive (HDC+), histaminergic neurons (HDC neurons) in the TMN and orexin neurons in the LHA of male mice, we found that these arousal-related neurons are heavily innervated by GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area including the VLPO. We further characterized GABAergic neurons electrophysiologically in the VLPO (GABA&lt;sup&gt;VLPO&lt;/sup&gt; neurons) that make direct synaptic contact with these hypothalamic arousal-related neurons. These neurons (GABA&lt;sup&gt;VLPO-&amp;gt;HDC&lt;/sup&gt; or GABA&lt;sup&gt;VLPO-&amp;gt;orexin&lt;/sup&gt; neurons) were both potently inhibited by noradrenaline and serotonin, showing typical electrophysiological characteristics of sleep-promoting neurons in the VLPO. This work provides direct evidence of monosynaptic connectivity between GABA&lt;sup&gt;VLPO&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and hypothalamic arousal neurons and identifies the effects of monoamines on these neuronal pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Rabies-virus-mediated tracing of input neurons of two hypothalamic arousal-related neuron populations, histaminergic and orexinergic neurons, showed that they receive similar distributions of input neurons in a variety of brain areas, with rich innervation by GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area, including the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), a region known to play an important role in the initiation and maintenance of sleep. Electrophysiological experiments found that GABAergic neurons in the VLPO (GABA&lt;sup&gt;VLPO&lt;/sup&gt; neurons) that make direct input to orexin or histaminergic neurons are potently inhibited by noradrenaline and serotonin, suggesting that these monoamines disinhibit histamine and orexin neurons. This work demonstrated functional and structural interactions between GABA&lt;sup&gt;VLPO&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and hypothalamic arousal-related neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Comparison of Decision-Related Signals in Sensory and Motor Preparatory Responses of Neurons in Area LIP</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6350?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the lateral intraparietal (LIP) area of Macaques exhibit both sensory and oculomotor preparatory responses. During perceptual decision making, the preparatory responses have been shown to track the state of the evolving evidence leading to the decision. The sensory responses are known to reflect categorical properties of visual stimuli, but it is not known whether these responses also track evolving evidence. We recorded neural responses from lateral intraparietal area of 2 female rhesus monkeys during a direction discrimination task. We compared sensory and oculomotor-preparatory responses in the same neurons when either the discriminandum (random dot motion) or an eye movement choice-target was in the neuron's response field. The neural responses in both configurations reflected the strength and direction of motion and were correlated with the animal's choice, albeit more prominently when the choice-target was in the response field. However, the variance and autocorrelation pattern of only the motor preparatory responses reflected the process of evidence accumulation. Simulations suggest that the task related activity of sensory responses could be inherited through lateral interactions with neurons that are carrying evidence accumulation signals in their motor-preparatory responses. The results are consistent with the proposal that evolving decision processes are supported by persistent neural activity in the service of actions or intentions, as opposed to high-order representations of stimulus properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Perceptual decision making is the process of choosing an appropriate motor action based on perceived sensory information. Association areas of the cortex play an important role in this sensory-motor transformation. The neurons in these areas show both sensory- and motor-related activity. We show here that, in the macaque parietal association area LIP, signatures of the process of evidence accumulation that underlies the decisions are predominantly reflected in the motor-related activity. This finding supports the proposal that perceptual decision making is implemented in the brain as a process of choosing between available motor actions rather than as a process of representing the properties of the sensory stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Brain Circuits Mediating Opposing Effects on Emotion and Pain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The amygdala is important for processing emotion, including negative emotion such as anxiety and depression induced by chronic pain. Although remarkable progress has been achieved in recent years on amygdala regulation of both negative (fear) and positive (reward) behavioral responses, our current understanding is still limited regarding how the amygdala processes and integrates these negative and positive emotion responses within the amygdala circuits. In this study with optogenetic stimulation of specific brain circuits, we investigated how amygdala circuits regulate negative and positive emotion behaviors, using pain as an emotional assay in male rats. We report here that activation of the excitatory pathway from the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) that relays peripheral pain signals to the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) is sufficient to cause behaviors of negative emotion including anxiety, depression, and aversion in normal rats. In strong contrast, activation of the excitatory pathway from basolateral amygdala (BLA) that conveys processed corticolimbic signals to CeA dramatically opposes these behaviors of negative emotion, reducing anxiety and depression, and induces behavior of reward. Surprisingly, activating the PBN–CeA pathway to simulate pain signals does not change pain sensitivity itself, but activating the BLA–CeA pathway inhibits basal and sensitized pain. These findings demonstrate that the pain signal conveyed through the PBN–CeA pathway is sufficient to drive negative emotion and that the corticolimbic signal via the BLA–CeA pathway counteracts the negative emotion, suggesting a top-down brain mechanism for cognitive control of negative emotion under stressful environmental conditions such as pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It remains unclear how the amygdala circuits integrate both negative and positive emotional responses and the brain circuits that link peripheral pain to negative emotion are largely unknown. Using optogenetic stimulation, this study shows that the excitatory projection from the parabrachial nucleus to the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) is sufficient to drive behaviors of negative emotion including anxiety, depression, and aversion in rats. Conversely, activation of the excitatory projection from basolateral amygdala to CeA counteracts each of these behaviors of negative emotion. Thus, this study identifies a brain pathway that mediates pain-driven negative emotion and a brain pathway that counteracts these emotion behaviors in a top-down mechanism for brain control of negative emotion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Hand Motor Recovery Following Extensive Frontoparietal Cortical Injury Is Accompanied by Upregulated Corticoreticular Projections in Monkey</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6323?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6323?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We tested the hypothesis that arm/hand motor recovery after injury of the lateral sensorimotor cortex is associated with upregulation of the corticoreticular projection (CRP) from the supplementary motor cortex (M2) to the gigantocellular reticular nucleus of the medulla (Gi). Three groups of rhesus monkeys of both genders were studied: five controls, four cases with lesions of the arm/hand area of the primary motor cortex (M1) and the lateral premotor cortex (LPMC; F2 lesion group), and five cases with lesions of the arm/hand area of M1, LPMC, S1, and anterior parietal cortex (F2P2 lesion group). CRP strength was assessed using high-resolution anterograde tracers injected into the arm/hand area of M2 and stereology to estimate of the number of synaptic boutons in the Gi. M2 projected bilaterally to the Gi, primarily targeting the medial Gi subsector and, to a lesser extent, lateral, dorsal, and ventral subsectors. Total CRP bouton numbers were similar in controls and F2 lesion cases but F2P2 lesion cases had twice as many boutons as the other two groups (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0002). Recovery of reaching and fine hand/digit function was strongly correlated with estimated numbers of CRP boutons in the F2P2 lesion cases. Because we previously showed that F2P2 lesion cases experience decreased strength of the M2 corticospinal projection (CSP), whereas F2 lesion monkeys experienced increased strength of the M2 CSP, these results suggest one mechanism underlying arm/hand motor recovery after F2P2 injury is upregulation of the M2 CRP. This M2-CRP response may influence an important reticulospinal tract contribution to upper-limb motor recovery following frontoparietal injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We previously showed that after brain injury affecting the lateral motor cortex controlling arm/hand motor function, recovery is variable and closely associated with increased strength of corticospinal projection (CSP) from an uninjured medial cortical motor area. Hand motor recovery also varies after brain injury affecting the lateral sensorimotor cortex, but medial motor cortex CSP strength decreases and cannot account for recovery. Here we observed that motor recovery following sensorimotor cortex injury is closely associated with increased strength of the descending projection from an uninjured medial cortical motor area to a brainstem reticular nucleus involved in control of arm/hand function, suggesting an enhanced corticoreticular projection may compensate for injury to the sensorimotor cortex to enable recovery of arm/hand motor function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dominant Neuropeptide Cotransmission in Kisspeptin-GABA Regulation of GnRH Neuron Firing Driving Ovulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6310?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A population of kisspeptin-GABA coexpressing neurons located in the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V) is believed to activate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons to generate the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge triggering ovulation. Selective optogenetic activation of RP3V kisspeptin (RP3V&lt;sup&gt;KISS&lt;/sup&gt;) neurons in female mice for &amp;gt;30 s and ≥10 Hz in either a continuous or bursting mode was found to reliably generate a delayed and long-lasting activation of GnRH neuron firing in brain slices. Optogenetic activation of RP3V&lt;sup&gt;KISS&lt;/sup&gt; neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; at 10 Hz generated substantial increments in LH secretion of similar amplitude to the endogenous LH surge. Studies using GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonists and optogenetic activation of RP3V GABA (RP3V&lt;sup&gt;GABA&lt;/sup&gt;) neurons &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; revealed that low-frequency (2 Hz) stimulation generated immediate and transient GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated increases in GnRH neuron firing, whereas higher frequencies (10 Hz) recruited the long-lasting activation observed following RP3V&lt;sup&gt;KISS&lt;/sup&gt; neuron stimulation. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, 2 Hz activation of RP3V&lt;sup&gt;GABA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons did not alter LH secretion, whereas 10 Hz stimulation evoked a sustained large increase in LH identical to RP3V&lt;sup&gt;KISS&lt;/sup&gt; neuron activation. Optogenetic activation of RP3V&lt;sup&gt;KISS&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in which kisspeptin had been deleted did not alter LH secretion. These studies demonstrate the presence of parallel transmission streams from RP3V neurons to GnRH neurons that are frequency dependent and temporally distinct. This comprises a rapid and transient GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated activation and a slower onset kisspeptin-mediated stimulation of long duration. At the time of the LH surge, GABA release appears to be functionally redundant with the neuropeptide kisspeptin being the dominant cotransmitter influencing GnRH neuron output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Miscommunication between the brain and ovaries is thought to represent a major cause of infertility in humans. Studies in rodents suggest that a population of neurons located in the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V) are critical for activating the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons that trigger ovulation. The present study provides evidence that an RP3V neuron population coexpressing kisspeptin and GABA provides a functionally important excitatory input to GnRH neurons at the time of ovulation. This neural input releases GABA and/or kisspeptin in the classical frequency dependent and temporally distinct nature of amino acid-neuropeptide cotransmission. Unusually, however, the neuropeptide stream is found to be functionally dominant in activating GnRH neurons at the time of ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Single-Trial Phase Entrainment of Theta Oscillations in Sensory Regions Predicts Human Associative Memory Performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6299?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6299?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Episodic memories are rich in sensory information and often contain integrated information from different sensory modalities. For instance, we can store memories of a recent concert with visual and auditory impressions being integrated in one episode. Theta oscillations have recently been implicated in playing a causal role synchronizing and effectively binding the different modalities together in memory. However, an open question is whether momentary fluctuations in theta synchronization predict the likelihood of associative memory formation for multisensory events. To address this question we entrained the visual and auditory cortex at theta frequency (4 Hz) and in a synchronous or asynchronous manner by modulating the luminance and volume of movies and sounds at 4 Hz, with a phase offset at 0° or 180°. EEG activity from human subjects (both sexes) was recorded while they memorized the association between a movie and a sound. Associative memory performance was significantly enhanced in the 0° compared with the 180° condition. Source-level analysis demonstrated that the physical stimuli effectively entrained their respective cortical areas with a corresponding phase offset. The findings suggested a successful replication of a previous study (Clouter et al., 2017). Importantly, the strength of entrainment during encoding correlated with the efficacy of associative memory such that small phase differences between visual and auditory cortex predicted a high likelihood of correct retrieval in a later recall test. These findings suggest that theta oscillations serve a specific function in the episodic memory system: binding the contents of different modalities into coherent memory episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; How multisensory experiences are bound to form a coherent episodic memory representation is one of the fundamental questions in human episodic memory research. Evidence from animal literature suggests that the relative timing between an input and theta oscillations in the hippocampus is crucial for memory formation. We precisely controlled the timing between visual and auditory stimuli and the neural oscillations at 4 Hz using a multisensory entrainment paradigm. Human associative memory formation depends on coincident timing between sensory streams processed by the corresponding brain regions. We provide evidence for a significant role of relative timing of neural theta activity in human episodic memory on a single-trial level, which reveals a crucial mechanism underlying human episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Homeostatic Feedback Modulates the Development of Two-State Patterned Activity in a Model Serotonin Motor Circuit in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuron activity accompanies synapse formation and maintenance, but how early circuit activity contributes to behavior development is not well understood. Here, we use the &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; egg-laying motor circuit as a model to understand how coordinated cell and circuit activity develops and drives a robust two-state behavior in adults. Using calcium imaging in behaving animals, we find the serotonergic hermaphrodite-specific neurons (HSNs) and vulval muscles show rhythmic calcium transients in L4 larvae before eggs are produced. HSN activity in L4 is tonic and lacks the alternating burst-firing/quiescent pattern seen in egg-laying adults. Vulval muscle activity in L4 is initially uncoordinated but becomes synchronous as the anterior and posterior muscle arms meet at HSN synaptic release sites. However, coordinated muscle activity does not require presynaptic HSN input. Using reversible silencing experiments, we show that neuronal and vulval muscle activity in L4 is not required for the onset of adult behavior. Instead, the accumulation of eggs in the adult uterus renders the muscles sensitive to HSN input. Sterilization or acute electrical silencing of the vulval muscles inhibits presynaptic HSN activity and reversal of muscle silencing triggers a homeostatic increase in HSN activity and egg release that maintains ~12–15 eggs in the uterus. Feedback of egg accumulation depends upon the vulval muscle postsynaptic terminus, suggesting that a retrograde signal sustains HSN synaptic activity and egg release. Our results show that egg-laying behavior in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; is driven by a homeostat that scales serotonin motor neuron activity in response to postsynaptic muscle feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The functional importance of early, spontaneous neuron activity in synapse and circuit development is not well understood. Here, we show in the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; that the serotonergic hermaphrodite-specific neurons (HSNs) and postsynaptic vulval muscles show activity during circuit development, well before the onset of adult behavior. Surprisingly, early activity is not required for circuit development or the onset of adult behavior and the circuit remains unable to drive egg laying until fertilized embryos are deposited into the uterus. Egg accumulation potentiates vulval muscle excitability, but ultimately acts to promote burst firing in the presynaptic HSNs which results in egg laying. Our results suggest that mechanosensory feedback acts at three distinct steps to initiate, sustain, and terminate &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; egg-laying circuit activity and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Reorganization of Destabilized Nodes of Ranvier in {beta}IV Spectrin Mutants Uncovers Critical Timelines for Nodal Restoration and Prevention of Motor Paresis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6267?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6267?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Disorganization of nodes of Ranvier is associated with motor and sensory dysfunctions. Mechanisms that allow nodal recovery during pathological processes remain poorly understood. A highly enriched nodal cytoskeletal protein βIV spectrin anchors and stabilizes the nodal complex to actin cytoskeleton. Loss of murine βIV spectrin allows the initial nodal organization, but causes gradual nodal destabilization. Mutations in human βIV spectrin cause auditory neuropathy and impairment in motor coordination. Similar phenotypes are caused by nodal disruption due to demyelination. Here we report on the precise timelines of nodal disorganization and reorganization by following disassembly and reassembly of key nodal proteins in βIV spectrin mice of both sexes before and after βIV spectrin re-expression at specifically chosen developmental time points. We show that the timeline of nodal restoration has different outcomes in the PNS and CNS with respect to nodal reassembly and functional restoration. In the PNS, restoration of nodes occurs within 1 month regardless of the time of βIV spectrin re-expression. In contrast, the CNS nodal reorganization and functional restoration occurs within a critical time window; after that, nodal reorganization diminishes, leading to less efficient motor recovery. We demonstrate that timely restoration of nodes can improve both the functional properties and the ultrastructure of myelinated fibers affected by long-term nodal disorganization. Our studies, which indicate a critical timeline for nodal restoration together with overall motor performance and prolonged life span, further support the idea that nodal restoration is more beneficial if initiated before any axonal damage, which is critically relevant to demyelinating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Nodes of Ranvier are integral to efficient and rapid signal transmission along myelinated fibers. Various demyelinating disorders are characterized by destabilization of the nodal molecular complex, accompanied by severe reduction in nerve conduction and the onset of motor and sensory dysfunctions. This study is the first to report &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; reassembly of destabilized nodes with sequential improvement in overall motor performance. Our study reveals that nodal restoration is achievable before any axonal damage, and that long-term nodal destabilization causes irreversible axonal structural changes that prevent functional restoration. Our studies provide significant insights into timely restoration of nodal domains as a potential therapeutic approach in treatment of demyelinating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: NOS3 Inhibition Confers Post-Ischemic Protection to Young and Aging White Matter Integrity by Conserving Mitochondrial Dynamics and Miro-2 Levels</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;White matter (WM) damage following a stroke underlies a majority of the neurological disability that is subsequently observed. Although ischemic injury mechanisms are age-dependent, conserving axonal mitochondria provides consistent post-ischemic protection to young and aging WM. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activation is a major cause of oxidative and mitochondrial injury in gray matter during ischemia; therefore, we used a pure WM tract, isolated male mouse optic nerve, to investigate whether NOS inhibition provides post-ischemic functional recovery by preserving mitochondria. We show that pan-NOS inhibition applied before oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) promotes functional recovery of young and aging axons and preserves WM cellular architecture. This protection correlates with reduced nitric oxide (NO) generation, restored glutathione production, preserved axonal mitochondria and oligodendrocytes, and preserved ATP levels. Pan-NOS inhibition provided post-ischemic protection to only young axons, whereas selective inhibition of NOS3 conferred post-ischemic protection to both young and aging axons. Concurrently, genetic deletion of NOS3 conferred long-lasting protection to young axons against ischemia. OGD upregulated NOS3 levels in astrocytes, and we show for the first time that inhibition of NOS3 generation in glial cells prevents axonal mitochondrial fission and restores mitochondrial motility to confer protection to axons by preserving Miro-2 levels. Interestingly, NOS1 inhibition exerted post-ischemic protection selectively to aging axons, which feature age-dependent mechanisms of oxidative injury in WM. Our study provides the first evidence that inhibition of glial NOS activity confers long-lasting benefits to WM function and structure and suggests caution in defining the role of NO in cerebral ischemia at vascular and cellular levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; White matter (WM) injury during stroke is manifested as the subsequent neurological disability in surviving patients. Aging primarily impacts CNS WM and mechanisms of ischemic WM injury change with age. Nitric oxide is involved in various mitochondrial functions and we propose that inhibition of glia-specific nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms promotes axon function recovery by preserving mitochondrial structure, function, integrity, and motility. Using electrophysiology and three-dimensional electron microscopy, we show that NOS3 inhibition provides a common target to improve young and aging axon function, whereas NOS1 inhibition selectively protects aging axons when applied after injury. This study provides the first evidence that inhibition of glial cell NOS activity confers long-lasting benefits to WM structure and function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This process, called arealization, depends on the graded expression of transcription factors in neocortical progenitors and postmitotic neurons prenatally, and on external activity-dependent cues driven by thalamocortical axons during postnatal stages. Thalamic inputs are guided within an intrinsically determined genetic framework to selectively target and innervate layer 4 (L4) cortical neurons in a somatotopic manner. L4 spiny stellate neurons are excitatory locally projecting neurons, which undergo a drastic dendrite remodeling during the first postnatal week and represent the principal sensory gateway to the neocortex. In this review, we will discuss the way intrinsic cortical gene regulation and extrinsic activity-dependent inputs instruct the cellular reorganization of L4 spiny stellate neurons, necessary for proper formation of the barrel cortex during the development of primary somatosensory maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Computer modelling of connectivity change suggests epileptogenesis mechanisms in idiopathic generalised epilepsy. (arXiv:1807.03696v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03696</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03696</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE) typically have normal
conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), hence diagnosis based on MRI is
challenging. Anatomical abnormalities underlying brain dysfunctions in IGE are
unclear and their relation to the pathomechanisms of epileptogenesis is poorly
understood. In this study, we applied connectometry, an advanced quantitative
neuroimaging technique for investigating localised changes in white-matter
tissues in vivo. Analysing white matter structures of 32 subjects we
incorporated our in vivo findings in a computational model of seizure dynamics
to suggest a plausible mechanism of epileptogenesis. Patients with IGE have
significant bilateral alterations in major white-matter fascicles. In cingulum,
fornix, and superior longitudinal fasciculus, tract integrity is compromised,
whereas in specific parts of tracts between thalamus and the precentral gyrus,
tract integrity is enhanced in patients. Incorporating these alterations in a
classification framework, we found that patients and controls are linearly
separable with 81.3% accuracy and 83.3% sensitivity. The computational model,
informed with the findings on the tract abnormalities, specifically highlighted
the importance of enhanced cortico-reticular connections along with impaired
cortico-cortical connections in inducing pathological seizure-like dynamics. We
emphasise taking directionality of brain connectivity into consideration
towards understanding the pathological mechanisms; this is possible by
combining neuroimaging and computational modelling. Our imaging evidence of
structural alterations in IGEs may be applied as non-invasive diagnostic
biomarker. We suggest that impaired connectivity from cortical regions to the
thalamic reticular nucleus offers a therapeutic target for selectively
modifying the brain circuit to reverse the mechanisms leading to
epileptogenesis.

	<description>Recent lineage tracing analyses have significantly improved our understanding of immune system development and highlighted the importance of the different hematopoietic waves. The current challenge is to understand whether these waves interact and whether this affects the function of the immune system. Here we report a molecular pathway regulating the immune response and involving the communication between embryonic and larval hematopoietic waves in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Down-regulating the transcription factor Gcm specific to embryonic hematopoiesis enhances the larval phenotypes induced by over-expressing the pro-inflammatory Jak/Stat pathway or by wasp infestation. Gcm works by modulating the transduction of the Upd cytokines to the site of larval hematopoiesis and hence the response to chronic (Jak/Stat over-expression) and acute (wasp infestation) immune challenges. Thus, homeostatic interactions control the function of the immune system in physiology and pathology. Our data also indicate that a transiently expressed developmental pathway has a long-lasting effect on the immune response.</description>

	<description>The architecture of normal and diseased tissues strongly influences the development and progression of disease as well as responsiveness and resistance to therapy. We describe a tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) method for highly multiplexed immuno-fluorescence imaging of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens mounted on glass slides, the most widely used specimens for histopathological diagnosis of cancer and other diseases.  t-CyCIF generates up to 60-plex images using an iterative process (a cycle) in which conventional low-plex fluorescence images are repeatedly collected from the same sample and then assembled into a high dimensional representation. t-CyCIF requires no specialized instruments or reagents and is compatible with super-resolution imaging; we demonstrate its application to quantifying signal transduction cascades, tumor antigens and immune markers in diverse tissues and tumors. The simplicity and adaptability of t-CyCIF makes it an effective method for pre-clinical and clinical research and a natural complement to single-cell genomics.</description>

	<description>Neuropeptides are often co-expressed in neurons but their neurophysiological effects are commonly studied individually. Multiple neuropeptides may therefore be simultaneously released to coordinate proper neural circuit function. Here, we triggered the release of endogenous neuropeptides in brain slices from male mice to better understand the modulation of central amygdala (CeA) inhibitory inputs onto oval (ov) BNST neurons. We found that locally-released neurotensin (NT) and dynorphin (Dyn) antagonistically regulated CeA inhibitory inputs onto ovBNST neurons. NT and Dyn respectively increased and decreased CeA-to-ovBNST inhibitory inputs through NT receptor 1 (NTR1) and kappa opioid receptor (KOR). Additionally, NT and Dyn mRNAs were highly co-localized in ovBNST neurons suggesting that they may be released from the same cells. Together, we showed that NT and Dyn are key modulators of CeA inputs to ovBNST, paving the way to determine whether different conditions or states can alter the neuropeptidergic regulation of this particular brain circuit.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Corticospinal neuroplasticity and sensorimotor recovery in rats treated by infusion of neurotrophin-3 into disabled forelimb muscles started 24 h after stroke</title>

	<description>Stroke often leads to arm disability and reduced responsiveness to stimuli on the other side of the body. Neurotrophin-3 (NT3) is made by skeletal muscle during infancy but levels drop postnatally and into adulthood. It is essential for the survival and wiring-up of sensory afferents from muscle. We have previously shown that gene therapy delivery of human NT3 into the affected triceps brachii forelimb muscle improves sensorimotor recovery after ischemic stroke in adult and elderly rats. Here, to move this therapy one step nearer to the clinic, we set out to test the hypothesis that intramuscular infusion of NT3 protein could improve sensorimotor recovery after ischemic cortical stroke in adult rats. To simulate a clinically-feasible time-to-treat, twenty-four hours later rats were randomized to receive NT3 or vehicle by infusion into triceps brachii for four weeks using implanted minipumps. NT3 increased the accuracy of forelimb placement during walking on a horizontal ladder and increased use of the affected arm for lateral support during rearing. NT3 also reversed sensory deficits on the affected forearm. There was no evidence of forepaw sensitivity to cold stimuli after stroke or NT3 treatment. MRI confirmed that treatment did not induce neuroprotection. Functional MRI during low threshold electrical stimulation of the affected forearm showed an increase in peri-infarct BOLD signal with time in both stroke groups and indicated that neurotrophin-3 did not further increase peri-infarct BOLD signal. Rather, NT3 induced spinal neuroplasticity including sprouting of the spared corticospinal and serotonergic pathways. Neurophysiology showed that NT3 treatment increased functional connectivity between the corticospinal tracts and spinal circuits controlling muscles on the treated side. After intravenous injection, radiolabelled NT3 crossed from bloodstream into the brain and spinal cord in adult mice with or without strokes. Our results show that delayed, peripheral infusion of neurotrophin-3 can improve sensorimotor function after ischemic stroke. Phase I and II clinical trials of NT3 (for constipation and neuropathy) have shown that peripheral, high doses are safe and well tolerated, which paves the way for NT3 as a therapy for stroke.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Individuals with clinically relevant autistic traits tend to have an eye for detail</title>

	<description>Individuals with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis are often described as having an 'eye for detail'. This observation, and the finding that individuals with ASD tend to 'see the trees before the forest' when performing the Navon task, has led to the proposal that ASD is characterized by a bias towards processing local image details. However, it remains to be shown that natural image recognition in individuals with autism depends more on fine image detail. Here, we resolve this issue by showing that natural image recognition relies more on details in individuals with an above-median number of autistic traits. Furthermore, we found that reliance on details was best predicted by the presence of the most clinically relevant autistic traits. Therefore, our findings raise the possibility that a wide range of real-life abilities and difficulties associated with ASD are related to an enhanced reliance on visual details.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Temporal Multiple Kernel Learning (tMKL) model for predicting resting state FC via characterizing fMRI connectivity dynamics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/367276v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Over the last decade there has been growing interest in understanding the brain activity in the absence of any task or stimulus captured by the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). These resting state patterns are not static, but exhibit complex spatio-temporal dynamics. In the recent years substantial effort has been put to characterize different FC configurations while brain states makes transitions over time. The dynamics governing this transitions and their relationship with stationary functional connectivity remains elusive. Over the last years a multitude of methods has been proposed to discover and characterize FC dynamics and one of the most accepted method is sliding window approach. Moreover, as these FC configurations are observed to be cyclically repeating in time there was further motivation to use of a generic clustering scheme to identify latent states of dynamics. We discover the underlying lower-dimensional manifold of the temporal structure which is further parameterized as a set of local density distributions, or latent transient states. We propose an innovative method that learns parameters specific to these latent states using a graph-theoretic model (temporal Multiple Kernel Learning, tMKL) and finally predicts the grand average functional connectivity (FC) of the unseen subjects by leveraging a state transition Markov model. tMKL thus learns a mapping between the underlying anatomical network and the temporal structure. Training and testing were done using the rs-fMRI data of 46 healthy participants and the results establish the viability of the proposed solution. Parameters of the model are learned via state-specific optimization formulations and yet the model performs at par or better than state-of-the-art models for predicting the grand average FC. Moreover, the model shows sensitivity towards subject-specific anatomy. The proposed model performs significantly better than the established models of predicting resting state functional connectivity based on whole-brain dynamic mean-field model, single diffusion kernel model and another version of multiple kernel learning model. In summary, We provide a novel solution that does not make strong assumption about underlying data and is generally applicable to resting or task data to learn subject specific state transitions and successful characterization of SC-dFC-FC relationship through an unifying framework.</description>

	<description>Through our past studies of the neurobiology of beauty, we have come to divide aesthetic experiences into two broad categories: biological and artifactual. The aesthetic experience of biological beauty is dictated by inherited brain concepts, which are resistant to change even in spite of extensive experience. The experience of artifactual beauty on the other hand is determined by post-natally acquired concepts, which are modifiable throughout life by exposure to different experiences (Zeki, 2009). Hence, in terms of aesthetic rating, biological beauty (in which we include the experience of beautiful faces or human bodies) is characterized by less variability between individuals belonging to different ethnic origins and cultural backgrounds or the same individual at different times. Artifactual beauty (in which we include the aesthetic experience of human artifacts such as buildings and cars) is characterized by greater variability between individuals belonging to different ethnic and cultural groupings and by the same individual at different times. In this paper, we present results to show that the experience of mathematical beauty (Zeki et al 2014), even though it constitutes an extreme example of beauty that is dependent upon (mathematical) culture and learning, belongs to the biological category and obeys one of its characteristics, namely a lesser variability in terms of the aesthetic ratings given to mathematical formulae experienced as beautiful.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Regeneration of dopaminergic neurons in adult zebrafish depends on immune system activation and differs for distinct populations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/367151v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/367151v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Adult zebrafish regenerate neurons in their brain, but the extent and variability of this capacity is unclear. Here we ask whether loss of various dopaminergic neuron populations is sufficient to trigger their functional regeneration. Genetic lineage tracing shows that specific diencephalic ependymo-radial glial progenitor cells (ERGs) give rise to new dopaminergic (Th+) neurons. Ablation elicits an immune response, increased proliferation of ERGs and increased addition of new Th+ neurons in populations that constitutively add new neurons, e.g. diencephalic population 5/6. Inhibiting the immune response attenuates neurogenesis to control levels. Boosting the immune response enhances ERG proliferation, but not addition of Th+ neurons. In contrast, in populations in which constitutive neurogenesis is undetectable, e.g. the posterior tuberculum and locus coeruleus, cell replacement and tissue integration are incomplete and transient. This is associated with permanent deficits in shoaling and reproductive behaviour. Hence, dopaminergic neuron populations in the adult zebrafish brain show vast differences in regenerative capacity that correlate with constitutive addition of neurons and depend on immune system activation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Feasibility of Functional MRI at Ultralow Magnetic Field via Changes in Cerebral Blood Volume</title>

	<description>We investigate the feasibility of performing functional MRI (fMRI) at ultralow field (ULF) with a Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID), as used for detecting magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals from the human head. While there is negligible magnetic susceptibility variation to produce blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast at ULF, changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) may be a sensitive mechanism for fMRI given the five-fold spread in spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) values across the constituents of the human brain. We undertook simulations of functional signal strength for a simplified brain model involving activation of a primary cortical region in a manner consistent with a blocked task experiment. Our simulations involve measured values of T1 at ULF and experimental parameters for the performance of an upgraded ULFMRI scanner. Under ideal experimental conditions we predict a functional signal-to-noise ratio of between 3.1 and 7.1 for an imaging time of 30 minutes, or between 1.5 and 3.5 for a blocked task experiment lasting 7.5 minutes. Our simulations suggest it may be feasible to perform fMRI using a ULFMRI system designed to perform MRI and MEG in situ.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Adolescent Cognitive Control, Theta Oscillations, and Social Motivation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/366831v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Cognitive control supports goal-directed behavior and involves two main components: 1) monitoring for situations requiring control, such as errors or conflict; 2) control recruitment, either proactively before needed or reactively in a just-in-time manner. In adults, increased theta power over medial-frontal cortex (MFC) underlies monitoring, whereas theta connectivity between MFC and lateral-frontal regions reflects control recruitment. Theta oscillations have been proposed as an organizing principle of cognitive control in human adults and are conserved across species. However, the role of theta in supporting adolescent cognitive control remains unclear. Moreover, adolescence is characterized by a motivation-control mismatch, with social motivation being particularly salient. Characterizing theta band dynamics could clarify motivational influences on cognitive control during this developmental window. Here, we investigated theta dynamics while adolescents performed a flanker task twice, once alone and once believing they were under peer observation to increase social motivation. Broadly, theta dynamics were found to behave qualitatively similar to prior reports in adults. In a novel approach, we separated theta dynamics immediately before and after motor responses, identifying specific cognitive control mechanisms. We dissociate MFC connectivity with rostral/caudal frontal cortex and distinct forms of post-error behavioral control, as well as identified inverse relations between pre- and post-response control. Finally, social motivation was found to exclusively upregulate post-response error monitoring and proactive control, as opposed to pre-response conflict monitoring and reactive control. Collectively, the current study links theta to adolescent cognitive control, identifies specific effects of social motivation on proactive control, and more broadly identifies novel cognitive control dynamics.</description>

	<description>People tend to believe their perceptions are veridical representations of the world, but also commonly report perceiving what they want to see or hear, a phenomenon known as motivated perception. It remains unclear whether this phenomenon reflects an actual change in what people perceive or merely a bias in their responding. We manipulated the percept participants wanted to see as they performed a visual categorization task for reward. Even though the reward maximizing strategy was to perform the task accurately, this manipulation biased participants' perceptual judgments. Motivation increased activity in voxels within visual cortex selective for the motivationally relevant category, indicating a bias in participants' neural representation of the presented image. Using a drift diffusion model, we decomposed motivated seeing into response and perceptual components. Response bias was associated with anticipatory activity in the nucleus accumbens, whereas perceptual bias tracked category-selective neural activity. Our results highlight the role of the reward circuitry in biasing perceptual processes and provide a computational description of how the drive for reward can lead to inaccurate representations of the world.</description>

Many species rely on olfaction to navigate towards food sources or mates. Olfactory navigation is a challenging task since odor environments are typically turbulent. While time-averaged odor concentration varies smoothly with the distance to the source, instaneous concentrations are intermittent and obtaining stable averages takes longer than the typical intervals between animals’ navigation decisions. How to effectively sample from the odor distribution to determine sampling location is the focus on this article. To investigate which sampling strategies are most informative about the location of an odor source, we recorded three naturalistic stimuli with planar lased-induced fluorescence and used an information-theoretic approach to quantify the information that different sampling strategies provide about sampling location. Specifically, we compared multiple sampling strategies based on a fixed number of coding bits for encoding the olfactory stimulus. When the coding bits were all allocated to representing odor concentration at a single sensor, information rapidly saturated. Using the same number of coding bits in two sensors provides more information, as does coding multiple samples at different times. When accumulating multiple samples at a fixed location, the temporal sequence does not yield a large amount of information and can be averaged with minimal loss. Furthermore, we show that histogram-equalization is not the most efficient way to use coding bits when using the olfactory sample to determine location.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zIMMO9rrGJQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Architecture of phase relationships among neural oscillations is central for their functional significance but has remained theoretically poorly understood. We use phenomenological model of delay-coupled oscillators with increasing degree of topological complexity to identify underlying principles by which the spatio-temporal structure of the brain governs the phase lags between oscillatory activity at distant regions. Phase relations and their regions of stability are derived and numerically confirmed for two oscillators and for networks with randomly distributed or clustered bimodal delays, as a first approximation for the brain structural connectivity. Besides in-phase, clustered delays can induce anti-phase synchronization for certain frequencies, while the sign of the lags is determined by the natural frequencies and by the inhomogeneous network interactions. For in-phase synchronization faster oscillators always phase lead, while stronger connected nodes lag behind the weaker during frequency depression, which consistently arises for in-silico results. If nodes are in anti-phase regime, then a distance &lt;i&gt;π&lt;/i&gt; is added to the in-phase trends. The statistics of the phases is calculated from the phase locking values (PLV), as in many empirical studies, and we scrutinize the method’s impact. The choice of surrogates do not affects the mean of the observed phase lags, but higher significance levels that are generated by some surrogates, cause decreased variance and might fail to detect the generally weaker coherence of the interhemispheric links. These links are also affected by the non-stationary and intermittent synchronization, which causes multimodal phase lags that can be misleading if averaged. Taken together, the results describe quantitatively the impact of the spatio-temporal connectivity of the brain to the synchronization patterns between brain regions, and to uncover mechanisms through which the spatio-temporal structure of the brain renders phases to be distributed around 0 and &lt;i&gt;π&lt;/i&gt;.

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Examining the Reversibility of Long-Term Behavioral Disruptions in Progeny of Maternal SSRI Exposure</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Serotonergic dysregulation is implicated in numerous psychiatric disorders. Serotonin plays widespread trophic roles during neurodevelopment; thus perturbations to this system during development may increase risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Epidemiological studies have examined association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment during pregnancy and increased autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in offspring. It is unclear from these studies whether ASD susceptibility is purely related to maternal psychiatric diagnosis, or if treatment poses additional risk. We sought to determine whether maternal SSRI treatment alone or in combination with genetically vulnerable background was sufficient to induce offspring behavior disruptions relevant to ASD. We exposed C57BL/6J or &lt;i&gt;Celf6&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; mouse dams to fluoxetine (FLX) during different periods of gestation and lactation and characterized offspring on tasks assessing social communicative interaction and repetitive behavior patterns including sensory sensitivities. We demonstrate robust reductions in pup ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and alterations in social hierarchy behaviors, as well as perseverative behaviors and tactile hypersensitivity. &lt;i&gt;Celf6&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice demonstrate social communicative deficits and perseverative behaviors, without further interaction with FLX. FLX re-exposure in adulthood ameliorates the tactile hypersensitivity yet exacerbates the dominance phenotype. This suggests acute deficiencies in serotonin levels likely underlie the abnormal responses to sensory stimuli, while the social alterations are instead due to altered development of social circuits. These findings indicate maternal FLX treatment, independent of maternal stress, can induce behavioral disruptions in mammalian offspring, thus contributing to our understanding of the developmental role of the serotonin system and the possible risks to offspring of SSRI treatment during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A quantum uncertainty entails entangled linguistic sequences. (arXiv:1807.03174v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03174</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synchronization of finite spike sequences is the way two brain regions
compare their content and extract the most suitable sequence. This is the core
of the linguistic comparison between a word and a previous one retrieved by
memory. Classifying the information content of neural spike trains, an
uncertainty relation emerges between the bit size of a word and its duration.
This uncertainty affects the task of synchronizing spike trains of different
duration representing different words, entailing the occurrence of entangled
sequences, so that word comparison amounts to a measurement based quantum
computation. Entanglement explains the inverse Bayes inference that connects
different words in a linguistic search. The behaviour here discussed provides
an explanation for other reported evidences of quantum effects in human
cognitive processes lacking a plausible framework, since either no assignment
of an appropriate quantum constant had been associated, or speculating on
microscopic processes dependent on Planck's constant resulted in unrealistic
de-coherence times.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03023</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fiber photometry permits monitoring fluorescent indicators of neural activity
in behaving animals. Optical fibers are typically used to excite and collect
fluorescence from genetically-encoded calcium indicators expressed by a subset
of neurons in a circuit of interest. However, a quantitative understanding of
the brain volumes from which signal is collected and how this depends on the
properties of the optical fibers are lacking. Here we analytically model and
experimentally measure the light emission and collection fields for optical
fibers in solution and scattering tissue, providing a comprehensive
characterization of fibers commonly employed for fiber photometry. Since
photometry signals depend on both excitation and collection efficiency, a
combined confocal/2-photon microscope was developed to evaluate these
parameters independently. We find that the 80% of the effective signal arises
from a 10^5-10^6 um3 volume extending ~200 um from the fiber face, and thus
permitting a spatial interpretation of measurements made with fiber photometry.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The permutation test is known as the exact test procedure in statistics.
However, often it is not exact in practice and only an approximate method since
only a small fraction of every possible permutation is generated. Even for a
small sample size, it often requires to generate tens of thousands
permutations, which can be a serious computational bottleneck. In this paper,
we propose a novel combinatorial inference procedure that enumerates all
possible permutations combinatorially without any resampling. The proposed
method is validated against the standard permutation test in simulation studies
with the ground truth. The method is further applied in twin DTI study in
determining the genetic contribution of the minimum spanning tree of the
structural brain connectivity.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: An ALE meta-analytic comparison of verbal working memory tasks. (arXiv:1807.02755v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02755</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02755</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The n-back and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) are
commonly used verbal working memory tasks that have partially overlapping uses
in clinical and experimental psychology. We performed three activation
likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses, comparing two load levels of the
n-back task (2-back, 3-back) to the PASAT and to each-other. These analyses
aimed to determine the involvement of cognitive and emotional brain regions for
these tasks. Results: We observed higher overall likelihood of activation the
frontal eye fields in the 3-back. The PASAT exhibited higher overall activation
in the bilateral supplementary motor areas (SMA), left supramarginal gyrus, and
left superior parietal lobule. Furthermore, the 3-back exhibited higher
activation in the right SMA, and anterior mid-cingulate cortex versus the
2-back, and the PASAT exhibited higher activation in a cluster near the right
premotor area versus the 2-back. A laterality effect was observed in the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex between the PASAT (left) and 3-back(right).
These data suggest greater activation of regions traditionally associated with
the phonological loop during the PASAT, compared to the 2- and 3-back tasks.
Furthermore, individual ALE analyses suggest involvement of emotional
processing and salience network regions (insula, cingulate) in addition to the
well-established verbal working memory regions (Broca's region, bilateral SMA,
premotor, posterior parietal cortices) in all 3 tasks. Conclusions: Here we
identify regions activated by the PASAT, which has not been meta-analytically
reviewed prior to this study. Using ALE meta-analysis, we have also identified
meaningful differences in activation associated with specific cognitive and
emotional aspects of verbal working memory during these tasks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A convex code is a binary code generated by the pattern of intersections of a
collection of open convex sets in some Euclidean space. Convex codes are
relevant to neuroscience as they arise from the activity of neurons that have
convex receptive fields. In this paper, we use algebraic methods to determine
if a code is convex. Specifically, we use the neural ideal of a code, which is
a generalization of the Stanley-Reisner ideal. Using the neural ideal together
with its standard generating set, the canonical form, we provide algebraic
signatures of certain families of codes that are non-convex. We connect these
signatures to the precise conditions on the arrangement of sets that prevent
the codes from being convex. Finally, we also provide algebraic signatures for
some families of codes that are convex, including the class of
intersection-complete codes. These results allow us to detect convexity and
non-convexity in a variety of situations, and point to some interesting open
questions.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02612</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multi-subject fMRI data analysis is an interesting and challenging problem in
human brain decoding studies. The inherent anatomical and functional
variability across subjects make it necessary to do both anatomical and
functional alignment before classification analysis. Besides, when it comes to
big data, time complexity becomes a problem that cannot be ignored. This paper
proposes Gradient Hyperalignment (Gradient-HA) as a gradient-based functional
alignment method that is suitable for multi-subject fMRI datasets with large
amounts of samples and voxels. The advantage of Gradient-HA is that it can
solve independence and high dimension problems by using Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) and Stochastic Gradient Ascent (SGA). Validation using
multi-classification tasks on big data demonstrates that Gradient-HA method has
less time complexity and better or comparable performance compared with other
state-of-the-art functional alignment methods.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02575</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We study stochastic Amari-type neural field equations, which are mean-field
models for neural activity in the cortex. We prove that under certain
assumptions on the coupling kernel, the neural field model can be viewed as a
gradient flow in a nonlocal Hilbert space. This makes all gradient-flow methods
available for the analysis, which could previously not be used, as it was not
known, whether a rigorous gradient flow formulation exists. We show that the
equation is well-posed in the nonlocal Hilbert space in the sense that
solutions starting in this space also remain in it for all times and space-time
regularity results hold for the case of spatially correlated noise. Uniqueness
of invariant measures and ergodic properties for the associated Feller
semigroups are also discussed.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02514</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02514</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the role of astrocytes in brain computation is a nascent
challenge, promising immense rewards, in terms of new neurobiological knowledge
that can be translated into artificial intelligence. In our ongoing effort to
identify principles endow-ing the astrocyte with unique functions in brain
computation, and translate them into neural-astrocytic networks (NANs), we
propose a biophysically realistic model of an astrocyte that preserves the
experimentally observed spatial allocation of its distinct subcellular
compartments. We show how our model may encode, and modu-late, the extent of
synchronous neural activity via calcium waves that propagate intracellularly
across the astrocytic compartments. This relationship between neural activity
and astrocytic calcium waves has long been speculated but it is still lacking a
mechanistic explanation. Our model suggests an astrocytic &quot;calcium cascade&quot;
mechanism for neuronal synchronization, which may empower NANs by imposing
periodic neural modulation known to reduce coding errors. By expanding our
notions of information processing in astrocytes, our work aims to solidify a
computational role for non-neuronal cells and incorporate them into artificial
networks.

	<description>Neurons communicate through neurotransmitter release at specialized synaptic regions known as active zones (AZs). Using biosensors to visualize single synaptic vesicle fusion events at &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junctions, we analyzed the developmental and molecular determinants of release probability (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) for a defined connection with ~300 AZs. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; was heterogeneous but represented a stable feature of each AZ. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;remained stable during high frequency stimulation and retained heterogeneity in mutants lacking the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor Synaptotagmin 1. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; correlated with both presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel abundance and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx at individual release sites. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; heterogeneity also correlated with glutamate receptor abundance, with high &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; connections developing receptor subtype segregation. Intravital imaging throughout development revealed that AZs acquire high &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; during a multi-day maturation period, with &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; heterogeneity largely reflecting AZ age. The rate of synapse maturation was activity-dependent, as both increases and decreases in neuronal activity modulated glutamate receptor field size and segregation.</description>

	<description>Many organisms use free running circadian clocks to anticipate the day night cycle. However, others organisms use simple stimulus-response strategies ('hourglass clocks') and it is not clear when such strategies are sufficient or even preferable to free running clocks. Here, we find that free running clocks, such as those found in the cyanobacterium &lt;i&gt;Synechococcus elongatus&lt;/i&gt; and humans, can efficiently project out light intensity fluctuations due to weather patterns ('external noise') by exploiting their limit cycle attractor. However, such limit cycles are necessarily vulnerable to 'internal noise'. Hence, at sufficiently high internal noise, point attractor-based 'hourglass' clocks, such as those found in a smaller cyanobacterium with low protein copy number, &lt;i&gt;Prochlorococcus marinus&lt;/i&gt;, outperform free running clocks. By interpolating between these two regimes in a diverse range of oscillators drawn from across biology, we demonstrate biochemical clock architectures that are best suited to different relative strengths of external and internal noise.</description>

	<description>The RAS family of proteins is amongst the most highly mutated in human cancers and has so far eluded drug therapy. Currently, much effort is being made to discover mutant RAS inhibitors and in vitro screening for RAS-binding drugs must be followed by cell-based assays. Here, we have developed a robust set of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based RAS biosensors that enable monitoring of RAS-effector interaction inhibition in living cells. These include KRAS, HRAS and NRAS and a variety of different mutations that mirror those found in human cancers with the major RAS effectors such as CRAF, PI3K and RALGDS. We highlighted the utility of these RAS biosensors by showing a RAS-binding compound is a potent pan-RAS-effector interactions inhibitor in cells. The RAS biosensors represent a useful tool to investigate and characterize the potency of anti-RAS inhibitors in cells and more generally any RAS protein-protein interaction (PPI) in cells.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: CYK-4 functions independently of its centralspindlin partner ZEN-4 to cellularize oocytes in germline syncytia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36919</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36919</link>
	<description>Throughout metazoans, germ cells undergo incomplete cytokinesis to form syncytia connected by intercellular bridges. Gamete formation ultimately requires bridge closure, yet how bridges are reactivated to close is not known. The most conserved bridge component is centralspindlin, a complex of the Rho family GTPase-activating protein (GAP) CYK-4/MgcRacGAP and the microtubule motor ZEN-4/kinesin-6. Here, we show that oocyte production by the syncytial &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; germline requires CYK-4 but not ZEN-4, which contrasts with cytokinesis, where both are essential. Longitudinal imaging after conditional inactivation revealed that CYK-4 activity is important for oocyte cellularization, but not for the cytokinesis-like events that generate syncytial compartments. CYK-4's lipid-binding C1 domain and the GTPase-binding interface of its GAP domain were both required to target CYK-4 to intercellular bridges and to cellularize oocytes. These results suggest that the conserved C1-GAP region of CYK-4 constitutes a targeting module required for closure of intercellular bridges in germline syncytia.</description>

	<description>Tauopathies feature progressive accumulation of tau amyloids. Pathology may begin when these amplify from a protein template, or seed, whose structure is unknown. We have purified and characterized distinct forms of tau monomer—inert (M&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) and seed-competent (M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;). Recombinant M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; triggered intracellular tau aggregation, induced tau fibrillization in vitro, and self-assembled. M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; from Alzheimer’s disease also seeded aggregation and self-assembled in vitro to form seed-competent multimers. We used crosslinking with mass spectrometry to probe structural differences in M&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; vs. M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;. Crosslinks informed models of local peptide structure within the repeat domain which suggest relative inaccessibility of residues that drive aggregation (VQIINK/VQIVYK) in M&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, and exposure in M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;. Limited proteolysis supported this idea. Although tau monomer has been considered to be natively unstructured, our findings belie this assumption and suggest that initiation of pathological aggregation could begin with conversion of tau monomer from an inert to a seed-competent form.</description>

	<description>The neural control of transition between posture and movement encompasses the regulation of reflex-stabilizing mechanisms to enable motion. Optimal feedback theory suggests that such transitions require the disengagement of one motor control policy before the implementation of another. To test this possibility, we investigated the continuity of the vestibular control of balance during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion and between two standing postures. Healthy subjects initiated and terminated locomotion or shifted the distribution of their weight between their feet, while exposed to electrical vestibular stimuli (EVS). The relationship between EVS and ground reactions forces was quantified using time-frequency analyses. Discontinuities corresponding to null coherence periods were observed preceding the onset of movement initiation and during the step preceding locomotion termination. These results show humans interrupt the vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms to transition between motor states, suggesting a discrete change between motor control policies, as predicted by optimal feedback theory.</description>

	<description>Over 500 genetic loci have been associated with risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), however most loci are located in gene-distal non-coding regions and their target genes are not known. Here, we generated high-resolution promoter capture Hi-C (PCHi-C) maps in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) to provide a resource for identifying and prioritizing the functional targets of CVD associations. We validate these maps by demonstrating that promoters preferentially contact distal sequences enriched for tissue-specific transcription factor motifs and are enriched for chromatin marks that correlate with dynamic changes in gene expression. Using the CM PCHi-C map, we linked 1,999 CVD-associated SNPs to 347 target genes. Remarkably, more than 90% of SNP-target gene interactions did not involve the nearest gene, while 40% of SNPs interacted with at least two genes, demonstrating the importance of considering long-range chromatin interactions when interpreting functional targets of disease loci.</description>

	<description>Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms infecting hundreds of millions of people. These parasites alternate between asexual reproduction in molluscan hosts and sexual reproduction in mammalian hosts; short-lived, water-borne stages infect each host. Thriving in such disparate environments requires remarkable developmental plasticity, manifested by five body plans deployed throughout the parasite’s life cycle. Stem cells in &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma mansoni&lt;/i&gt; provide a potential source for such plasticity; however, the relationship between stem cells from different life-cycle stages remains unclear, as does the origin of the germline, required for sexual reproduction. Here, we show that subsets of larvally derived stem cells are likely sources of adult stem cells and the germline. We also identify a novel gene that serves as the earliest marker for the schistosome germline, which emerges inside the mammalian host and is ultimately responsible for disease pathology. This work reveals the stem cell heterogeneity driving the propagation of the schistosome life cycle.</description>

	<description>The highly polymorphic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules present peptide antigens to CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, inducing immunity against infections and cancers. Quality control mediated by peptide loading complex (PLC) components is expected to ensure the cell surface expression of stable peptide-HLA class I complexes. This is exemplified by HLA-B*08:01 in primary human lymphocytes, with both expression level and half-life at the high end of the measured HLA-B expression and stability hierarchies. Conversely, low expression on lymphocytes is measured for three HLA-B allotypes that bind peptides with proline at position 2, which are disfavored by the transporter associated with antigen processing. Surprisingly, these lymphocyte-specific expression and stability differences become reversed or altered in monocytes, which display larger intracellular pools of HLA class I than lymphocytes. Together, the findings indicate that allele and cell-dependent variations in antigen acquisition pathways influence HLA-B surface expression levels, half-lives and receptivity to exogenous antigens.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Presenilin mutations deregulate mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis and metabolic activity causing neurodegeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>

	<description>Mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent metabolic deregulation is observed in neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Mutations in the presenilin (PSEN) encoding genes (&lt;i&gt;PSEN1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PSEN2&lt;/i&gt;) cause most cases of familial Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the underlying mechanism of pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we show that mutations in the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; gene encoding a PSEN homolog, &lt;i&gt;sel-12&lt;/i&gt; result in mitochondrial metabolic defects that promote neurodegeneration as a result of oxidative stress. In &lt;i&gt;sel-12&lt;/i&gt; mutants, elevated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling leads to an increase in mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; content which stimulates mitochondrial respiration resulting in an increase in mitochondrial superoxide production. By reducing ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release, mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake or mitochondrial superoxides in &lt;i&gt;sel-12&lt;/i&gt; mutants, we demonstrate rescue of the mitochondrial metabolic defects and prevent neurodegeneration. These data suggest that mutations in PSEN alter mitochondrial metabolic function via ER to mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling and provide insight for alternative targets for treating neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

	<description>Behavior relies on the ability of sensory systems to infer properties of the environment from incoming stimuli. The accuracy of inference depends on the fidelity with which behaviorally relevant properties of stimuli are encoded in neural responses. High-fidelity encodings can be metabolically costly, but low-fidelity encodings can cause errors in inference. Here, we discuss general principles that underlie the tradeoff between encoding cost and inference error. We then derive adaptive encoding schemes that dynamically navigate this tradeoff. These optimal encodings tend to increase the fidelity of the neural representation following a change in the stimulus distribution, and reduce fidelity for stimuli that originate from a known distribution. We predict dynamical signatures of such encoding schemes and demonstrate how known phenomena, such as burst coding and firing rate adaptation, can be understood as hallmarks of optimal coding for accurate inference.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: NMDA Receptor-Mediated Motor Cortex Plasticity After 20 Hz Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy160</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been shown to modulate neural oscillations and excitability levels in the primary motor cortex (M1). These effects can last for more than an hour and an involvement of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;-methyl-&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) mediated synaptic plasticity has been suggested. However, to date the cortical mechanisms underlying tACS after-effects have not been explored. Here, we applied 20 Hz beta tACS to M1 while participants received either the NMDAR antagonist dextromethorphan or a placebo and the effects on cortical beta oscillations and excitability were explored. When a placebo medication was administered, beta tACS was found to increase cortical excitability and beta oscillations for at least 60 min, whereas when dextromethorphan was administered, these effects were completely abolished. These results provide the first direct evidence that tACS can induce NMDAR-mediated plasticity in the motor cortex, which contributes to our understanding of tACS-induced influences on human motor cortex physiology.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Microglia: An Intrinsic Component of the Proliferative Zones in the Fetal Rhesus Monkey (Macaca mulatta) Cerebral Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Microglial cells are increasingly recognized as modulators of brain development. We previously showed that microglia colonize the cortical proliferative zones in the prenatal brain and regulate the number of precursor cells through phagocytosis. To better define cellular interactions between microglia and proliferative cells, we performed lentiviral vector-mediated intraventricular gene transfer to induce enhanced green fluorescent protein expression in fetal cerebrocortical cells. Tissues were collected and counterstained with cell-specific markers to label microglial cells and identify other cortical cell types. We found that microglial cells intimately interact with the radial glial scaffold and make extensive contacts with neural precursor cells throughout the proliferative zones, particularly in the rhesus monkey fetus when compared to rodents. We also identify a subtype of microglia, which we term ‘periventricular microglia’, that interact closely with mitotic precursor cells in the ventricular zone. Our data suggest that microglia are structural modulators that facilitate remodeling of the proliferative zones as precursor cells migrate away from the ventricle and may facilitate the delamination of precursor cells. Taken together, these results indicate that microglial cells are an integral component of cortical proliferative zones and contribute to the interactive milieu in which cortical precursor cells function.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Our brains must maintain a representation of the world over a period of time much longer than the typical lifetime of the biological components producing that representation. For example, recent research suggests that dendritic spines in the adult mouse hippocampus are transient with an average lifetime of approximately 10 days. If this is true, and if turnover is equally likely for all spines, approximately 95-percent of excitatory synapses onto a particular neuron will turn over within 30 days; however, a neuron's receptive field can be relatively stable over this period. Here, we use computational modeling to ask how memories can persist in neural circuits such as the hippocampus and visual cortex in the face of synapse turnover. We demonstrate that Hebbian learning during replay of pre-synaptic activity patterns can integrate newly formed synapses into pre-existing memories. Further, we find that Hebbian learning during replay is sufficient to stabilize the receptive fields of hippocampal place cells in a model of the grid-cell-to-place-cell transformation in CA1 and of orientation-selective cells in a model of the center-surround-to-simple-cell transformation in V1. We also ask how synapse turnover affects memory in Hopfield networks with CA3-like, auto-associative properties. We find that attractors of Hopfield networks are remarkably stable if learning occurs during network reactivations. Together, these data suggest that a simple learning rule, correlative Hebbian plasticity of synaptic strengths, is sufficient to preserve neural representations in the face of synapse turnover, even in the absence of Hebbian structural plasticity.</description>

	<description>The Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is involved in many cellular processes and it regulates synaptic and network development in neurons. Its absence is known to lead to intellectual disability, with a wide range of co-morbidities including autism. Over the past decades, FMRP research focused on abnormalities both in glutamatergic and GABAergic signalling, and an altered balance between excitation and inhibition has been hypothesised to underlie the clinical consequences of absence of the protein. Using FMRP knockout mice, we studied an in vitro model of cortical microcircuitry and observed that the loss of FMRP largely affected the electrophysiological correlates of network development and maturation but caused less alterations in single-cell phenotypes. Using a mathematical model, we demonstrated that the combination of an increased excitation and reduced inhibition describes best predicts our experimental observations during the ex vivo formation of the network connections.</description>

	<description>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is strongly associated with de novo gene mutations. One of the most commonly affected genes is SCN2A. ASD-associated SCN2A mutations impair the encoded protein NaV1.2, a sodium channel important for action potential initiation and propagation in developing excitatory cortical neurons. The link between an axonal sodium channel and ASD, a disorder typically attributed to synaptic or transcriptional dysfunction, is unclear. Here, we show NaV1.2 is unexpectedly critical for dendritic excitability and synaptic function in mature pyramidal neurons, in addition to regulating early developmental axonal excitability. NaV1.2 loss reduced action potential backpropagation into dendrites, impairing synaptic plasticity and synaptic stability, even when NaV1.2 expression was disrupted late in development. Furthermore, we identified behavioral impairments in learning and sociability, paralleling observations in children with SCN2A loss. These results reveal a novel dendritic function for NaV1.2, providing insight into cellular mechanisms likely underlying circuit and behavioral dysfunction in ASD.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Shared Song Object Detector Neurons in Drosophila Male and Female Brains Drive Divergent, Sex-Specific Behaviors</title>

	<description>Males and females often produce distinct responses to the same sensory stimuli. How such differences arise - at the level of sensory processing or in the circuits that generate behavior - remains largely unresolved across sensory modalities. We address this issue in the acoustic communication system of Drosophila. During courtship, males generate time-varying songs, and each sex responds with specific behaviors. We characterize male and female behavioral tuning for all aspects of song, and show that feature tuning is similar between sexes, suggesting sex-shared song detectors drive divergent behaviors. We then identify higher-order neurons in the Drosophila brain, called pC2, that are tuned for multiple temporal aspects of one mode of the male's song, drive sex-specific behaviors, and show a mirrored correspondence between sensory and motor tuning. We thus uncover acoustic object detector neurons at the sensory-motor interface that flexibly link auditory perception with sex-specific behavioral responses to communication signals.</description>

	<description>Humans can learn abstract concepts that describe invariances over relational patterns in data. One such concept, known as magnitude, allows stimuli to be compactly represented by a single dimension (i.e. on a mental line), for example according to their cardinality, size or value. Here, we measured representations of magnitude in humans by recording neural signals whilst they viewed symbolic numbers. During a subsequent reward-guided learning task, the neural patterns elicited by novel complex visual images reflected their pay-out probability in a way that suggested they were encoded onto the same mental number line. Our findings suggest that in humans, learning about values is accompanied by structural alignment of value representations with neural codes for the concept of magnitude.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The role of meaning in visual memory: Face-selective brain activity predicts memory for ambiguous face stimuli</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/366641v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/366641v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>How people process images is known to affect memory for those images, but these effects have typically been studied using explicit task instructions to vary encoding. Here, we investigate the effects of intrinsic variation in processing on subsequent memory, testing whether recognizing an ambiguous stimulus as meaningful (as a face vs. as shape blobs) predicts subsequent visual memory even when matching the perceptual features and the encoding strategy between subsequently remembered and subsequently forgotten items. We show that single trial EEG activity can predict whether participants will subsequently remember an ambiguous Mooney face image (e.g., an image that will sometimes be seen as a face and sometimes not be seen as a face). In addition, we show that a classifier trained only to discriminate between whether participants perceive a face vs. non-face can generalize to predict whether an ambiguous image is subsequently remembered. Furthermore, when we examine the N170, an ERP index of face processing, we find that images that elicit larger N170s are more likely to be remembered than those that elicit smaller N170s, even when the exact same image elicited larger or smaller N170s across participants. Thus, images processed as meaningful - in this case as a face - during encoding are better remembered than identical images that are not processed as a face. This provides strong evidence that understanding the meaning of a stimulus during encoding plays a critical role in visual memory.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Do we predict upcoming speech content in naturalistic environments?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/366427v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/366427v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The ability to predict upcoming actions is a characteristic hallmark of cognition and therefore not surprisingly a central topic in cognitive science. It remains unclear, however, whether the predictive behaviour commonly observed in strictly controlled lab environments generalizes to rich, everyday settings. In four virtual reality experiments, we tested whether a well-established marker of linguistic prediction (i.e. anticipatory eye movements as observed in the visual world paradigm) replicated when increasing the naturalness of the paradigm by means of i) immersing participants in naturalistic everyday scenes, ii) increasing the number of distractor objects present, iii) manipulating the location of referents in central versus peripheral vision, and iv) modifying the proportion of predictable nounreferents in the experiment. Robust anticipatory eye movements were observed, even in the presence of 10 objects (hereby testing working memory) and when only 25% of all sentences contained a visually present referent (hereby testing error-based learning). The anticipatory effect disappeared, however, when referents were placed in peripheral vision. Together, our findings suggest that working memory may play an important role in predictive processing in everyday communication, but only in contexts where upcoming referents have been explicitly attended to prior to encountering the spoken referential act. Methodologically, our study confirms that ecological validity and experimental control may go hand in hand in future studies of human predictive behaviour.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: MicroRNA miR-7 and miR-17-92 in POMC neurons are associated with sex-specific regulation of diet-induced obesity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/366419v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) in mammalian hypothalamus play important roles in regulating appetite, energy expenditure, and glucose and fat metabolisms. Diet-induced obesity often show sex-specific difference. But the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that microRNA (miRNA) miR-7 and miR-17-92 are expressed in the mouse ARC, and mostly in POMC neurons. Knockdown of miR-7 and knockout of miR-17-92 specifically in POMC neurons aggravate diet-induced obesity only in females and males, respectively. Moreover, gene expression profile analysis identifies sex-differential genes in male and female ARCs in wildtype adult mice. Interestingly, these genes that normally show low-expression in the female and male ARCs display upregulated expression in female miR-7 knockdown and male miR-17-92 knockout mice, respectively. Our results demonstrate an important role of miRNAs in regulating sex-specific diet-induced obesity, likely through modulating expression of target genes that show sex-differential expression in the ARC of hypothalamus.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Differential roles of sleep spindles and sleep slow oscillations in memory consolidation</title>

Sleep plays an important role in the consolidation of recent memories. However, the cellular and synaptic mechanisms of consolidation during sleep remain poorly understood. In this study, using a realistic computational model of the thalamocortical network, we tested the role of Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep in memory consolidation. We found that sleep spindles (the hallmark of N2 stage sleep) and slow oscillations (the hallmark of N3 stage sleep) both promote replay of the spike sequences learned in the awake state and replay was localized around the trained network locations. Memory performance improved after a period of NREM sleep but not after the same time period in awake. When multiple memories were trained, the local nature of the spike sequence replay during spindles allowed replay of the distinct memory traces independently, while slow oscillations promoted competition that could prevent replay of the weak memories in a presence of the stronger memory traces. This could lead to extinction of the weak memories unless when sleep spindles (N2 sleep) preceded slow oscillations (N3 sleep), as observed during the natural sleep cycle. Our study presents a mechanistic explanation for the role of sleep rhythms in memory consolidation and proposes a testable hypothesis how the natural structure of sleep stages provides an optimal environment to consolidate memories.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jzS-ldh1Muw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Intracellular polarization, where a cell specifies a spatial axis by segregation of specific factors, is a fundamental biological process. In the early embryo of the nematode worm &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans)&lt;/i&gt;, polarization is often accompanied by deformations of the cortex, a highly contractile structure consisting of actin filaments cross-linked by the motor protein myosin (actomyosin). It has been suggested that the eggshell surrounding the early embryo plays a role in polarization although its function is not understood. Here we develop a mathematical model which couples a reaction-diffusion model of actomyosin dynamics with a phase field model of the cell cortex to implicitly track cell shape changes in the early &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; embryo. We investigate the potential rigidity effect of the geometric constraint imposed by the presence and size of the eggshell on polarization dynamics. Our model suggests that the geometric constraint of the eggshell is essential for proper polarization and the size of the eggshell also affects the dynamics of polarization. Therefore, we conclude that geometric constraint on a cell might affect the dynamics of a biochemical processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S0GKlDO6sm0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Gain control with A-type potassium current: &lt;i&gt;IA&lt;/i&gt; as a switch between divisive and subtractive inhibition</title>

Neurons process and convey information by transforming barrages of synaptic inputs into spiking activity. Synaptic inhibition typically suppresses the output firing activity of a neuron, and is commonly classified as having a &lt;i&gt;subtractive&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;divisive&lt;/i&gt; effect on a neuron’s output firing activity. Subtractive inhibition can narrow the range of inputs that evoke spiking activity by eliminating responses to non-preferred inputs. Divisive inhibition is a form of gain control: it modifies firing rates while preserving the range of inputs that evoke firing activity. Since these two “modes” of inhibition have distinct impacts on neural coding, it is important to understand the biophysical mechanisms that distinguish these response profiles. In this study, we use simulations and mathematical analysis of a neuron model to find the specific conditions (parameter sets) for which inhibitory inputs have subtractive or divisive effects. Significantly, we identify a novel role for the A-type Potassium current (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;). In our model, this fast-activating, slowly-inactivating outward current acts as a switch between subtractive and divisive inhibition. In particular, if &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is strong (large maximal conductance) and fast (activates on a time-scale similar to spike initiation), then inhibition has a subtractive effect on neural firing. In contrast, if &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is weak or insufficiently fast-activating, then inhibition has a divisive effect on neural firing. We explain these findings using dynamical systems methods (plane analysis and fast-slow dissection) to define how a spike threshold condition depends on synaptic inputs and &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. Our findings suggest that neurons can “self-regulate” the gain control effects of inhibition via combinations of synaptic plasticity and/or modulation of the conductance and kinetics of A-type Potassium channels. This novel role for &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; would add flexibility to neurons and networks, and may relate to recent observations of divisive inhibitory effects on neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FDIMHtgjtOc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of learning and behavior relies on the use of invasive techniques, which necessitate the use of animal models. However when different species learn the same task, to what degree are they actually producing the same behavior and engaging homologous neural circuitry? This question has received virtually no recent attention, even as the most powerful new methodologies for measuring and perturbing the nervous system have become increasingly dependent on the use of murine species. Here we test Humans, Rats, Monkeys, and an evolutionarily intermediate species, Tree Shrews, on a three alternative, forced choice, visual contrast discrimination task. As anticipated, learning rate, peak performance and transfer across contrasts was lower in the rat compared to the other species. More interestingly, Rats exhibited two major behavioral peculiarities: While Monkeys and Tree Shrews based their choices largely on visual information, Rats tended to base their choices on past reward history. Furthermore, as the task became more difficult, Rats largely disengaged from the visual stimulus, reverting to innate spatial predispositions in order to collect rewards near chance probability. Our findings highlight the limitation of muridae as models for translational research, at least in the area of visually based decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Research into the biology of cognition and behavior increasingly relies on studies performed in murine species (mice and rats). This is due to the explosion of powerful new, murine specific, genetic tools allowing for unprecedented control in imaging and manipulation of neural circuit elements. Lacking, are concomitant comparative behavioral studies necessary toward translating these exciting results to other species, particularly humans. We show here that, unlike primates, muridae incorporate species-specific predispositions and bias into their behavioral strategy toward the solution of a simple visual task, and are therefore engaging specific circuits not used by primates during task performance. This contradicts the long held idea that learning abolishes species-specific predispositions, and highlights the importance of comparative behavioral studies in translational neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A metric model for the functional architecture of the visual cortex. (arXiv:1807.02479v1 [math.MG])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this work is to construct a model for the functional
architecture of the primary visual cortex (V1), based on a structure of metric
measure space induced by the underlying organization of receptive profiles
(RPs) of visual cells. In order to account for the horizontal connectivity of
V1 in such a context, a diffusion process compatible with the geometry of the
space is defined following the classical approach of K.-T. Sturm. The
construction of our distance function does neither require any group
parameterization of the family of RPs, nor involve any differential structure.
As such, it adapts to non-parameterized sets of RPs, possibly obtained through
numerical procedures; it also allows to model the lateral connectivity arising
from non-differential metrics such as the one induced on a pinwheel surface by
a family of filters of vanishing scale. On the other hand, when applied to the
classical framework of Gabor filters, this construction yields a distance
approximating the sub-Riemannian structure proposed as a model for V1 by G.
Citti and A. Sarti [J Math Imaging Vis 24: 307 (2006)], thus showing itself to
be consistent with existing cortex models.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural codes are binary codes in $\{0,1\}^n$; here we focus on the ones which
represent the firing patterns of a type of neurons called place cells. There is
much interest in determining which neural codes can be realized by a collection
of convex sets. However, drawing representations of these convex sets,
particularly as the number of neurons in a code increases, can be very
difficult. Nevertheless, for a class of codes that are said to be
$k$-inductively pierced for $k=0,1,2$ there is an algorithm for drawing Euler
diagrams. Here we use the toric ideal of a code to show sufficient conditions
for a code to be 1- or 2-inductively pierced, so that we may use the existing
algorithm to draw realizations of such codes.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is true that the &quot;best&quot; neural network is not necessarily the one with the
most &quot;brain-like&quot; behavior. Understanding biological intelligence, however, is
a fundamental goal for several distinct disciplines. Translating our
understanding of intelligence to machines is a fundamental problem in robotics.
Propelled by new advancements in Neuroscience, we developed a spiking neural
network (SNN) that draws from mounting experimental evidence that a number of
individual neurons is associated with spatial navigation. By following the
brain's structure, our model assumes no initial all-to-all connectivity, which
could inhibit its translation to a neuromorphic hardware, and learns an
uncharted territory by mapping its identified components into a limited number
of neural representations, through spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). In
our ongoing effort to employ a bioinspired SNN-controlled robot to real-world
spatial mapping applications, we demonstrate here how an SNN may robustly
control an autonomous robot in mapping and exploring an unknown environment,
while compensating for its own intrinsic hardware imperfections, such as
partial or total loss of visual input.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is a complex dynamical system that gives rise to cognition
through spatiotemporal patterns of coherent and incoherent activity between
brain regions. As different regions dynamically interact to perform cognitive
tasks, variable patterns of partial synchrony can be observed, forming chimera
states. We propose that the emergence of such states plays a fundamental role
in the cognitive organization of the brain, and present a novel
cognitively-informed, chimera-based framework to explore how large-scale brain
architecture affects brain dynamics and function. Using personalized brain
network models, we systematically study how regional brain stimulation produces
different patterns of synchronization across predefined cognitive systems. We
then analyze these emergent patterns within our novel framework to understand
the impact of subject-specific and region-specific structural variability on
brain dynamics. Our results suggest a classification of cognitive systems into
four groups with differing levels of subject and regional variability that
reflect their different functional roles.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is ultimately responsible for all thoughts and movements that
the body produces. This allows humans to successfully interact with their
environment. If the brain is not functioning properly many abilities of human
can be damaged. The goal of cerebral signal analysis is to learn about brain
function. The idea that distinct areas of the brain are responsible for
specific tasks, the functional segregation, is a key aspect of brain function.
Functional integration is an important feature of brain function, it is the
concordance of multiple segregated brain areas to produce a unified response.
There is an amplified feedback mechanism in the brain called reentry which
requires specific timing relations. This specific timing requires neurons
within an assembly to synchronize their firing rates. This has led to increased
interest and use of phase variables, particularly their synchronization, to
measure connectivity in cerebral signals. Herein, we propose a comprehensive
review on concepts and methods previously presented for assessing cerebral
synchrony, with focus on phase synchronization, as a tool for brain
connectivity evaluation.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: PARP1-dependent recruitment of the FBXL10-RNF68-RNF2 ubiquitin ligase to sites of DNA damage controls H2A.Z loading</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38771</link>
	<description>The mammalian FBXL10-RNF68-RNF2 ubiquitin ligase complex (FRRUC) mono-ubiquitylates H2A at Lys119 to repress transcription in unstressed cells. We found that the FRRUC is rapidly and transiently recruited to sites of DNA damage in a PARP1- and TIMELESS-dependent manner to promote mono-ubiquitylation of H2A at Lys119, a local decrease of H2A levels, and an increase of H2A.Z incorporation. Both the FRRUC and H2A.Z promote transcriptional repression, double strand break signaling, and homologous recombination repair (HRR). All these events require both the presence and activity of the FRRUC. Moreover, the FRRUC and its activity are required for the proper recruitment of BMI1-RNF2 and MEL18-RNF2, two other ubiquitin ligases that mono-ubiquitylate Lys119 in H2A upon genotoxic stress. Notably, whereas H2A.Z is not required for H2A mono-ubiquitylation, impairment of the latter results in the inhibition of H2A.Z incorporation. We propose that the recruitment of the FRRUC represents an early and critical regulatory step in HRR.</description>

	<description>SNARE complex disassembly by the ATPase NSF is essential for neurotransmitter release and other membrane trafficking processes. We developed a single molecule FRET assay to monitor repeated rounds of NSF-mediated disassembly and reassembly of individual SNARE complexes. For ternary neuronal SNARE complexes, disassembly proceeds in a single step within 100 msec. We observed short- (&amp;lt; 0.32 sec) and long-lived ({greater than or equal to} 0.32 sec) disassembled states. The long-lived states represent fully disassembled SNARE complex, while the short-lived states correspond to failed disassembly or immediate re-assembly. Either high ionic strength or decreased αSNAP concentration reduces the disassembly rate while increasing the frequency of short-lived states. NSF is also capable of disassembling anti-parallel ternary SNARE complexes, suggesting a role in quality control. Finally, complexin-1 competes with αSNAP binding to the SNARE complex; addition of complexin-1 has an effect similar to that of decreasing the αSNAP concentration, suggesting a possible regulatory role in disassembly.</description>

	<description>Exhaustion of stem cells is a hallmark of aging. In the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; testis, dedifferentiated germline stem cells (GSCs) derived from spermatogonia increases during lifespan, leading to the model that dedifferentiation counteracts the decline of GSCs in aged males. To test this, we blocked dedifferentiation by mis-expressing the differentiation factor &lt;i&gt;bag of marbles&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;bam&lt;/i&gt;) in spermatogonia while lineage-labeling these cells. Strikingly, blocking &lt;i&gt;bam&lt;/i&gt;-lineage dedifferentiation under normal conditions in virgin males has no impact on the GSC pool. However, in mated males or challenging conditions, inhibiting &lt;i&gt;bam&lt;/i&gt;-lineage dedifferentiation markedly reduced the number of GSCs and their ability to proliferate and differentiate. We find that &lt;i&gt;bam&lt;/i&gt;-lineage derived GSCs have significantly higher proliferation rates than sibling GSCs in the same testis. We determined that Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity is autonomously required for &lt;i&gt;bam&lt;/i&gt;-lineage dedifferentiation. Overall, we show that dedifferentiation provides a mechanism to maintain the germline and ensure fertility under chronically stressful conditions.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Age-dependent Pavlovian biases influence motor decision-making</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006304</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiuli Chen, Robb B. Rutledge, Harriet R. Brown, Raymond J. Dolan, Sven Bestmann, Joseph M. Galea&lt;/p&gt;

Motor decision-making is an essential component of everyday life which requires weighing potential rewards and punishments against the probability of successfully executing an action. To achieve this, humans rely on two key mechanisms; a flexible, instrumental, value-dependent process and a hardwired, Pavlovian, value-independent process. In economic decision-making, age-related decline in risk taking is explained by reduced Pavlovian biases that promote action toward reward. Although healthy ageing has also been associated with decreased risk-taking in motor decision-making, it is currently unknown whether this is a result of changes in Pavlovian biases, instrumental processes or a combination of both. Using a newly established approach-avoidance computational model together with a novel app-based motor decision-making task, we measured sensitivity to reward and punishment when participants (n = 26,532) made a ‘go/no-go’ motor gamble based on their perceived ability to execute a complex action. We show that motor decision-making can be better explained by a model with both instrumental and Pavlovian parameters, and reveal age-related changes across punishment- and reward-based instrumental and Pavlovian processes. However, the most striking effect of ageing was a decrease in Pavlovian attraction towards rewards, which was associated with a reduction in optimality of choice behaviour. In a subset of participants who also played an independent economic decision-making task (n = 17,220), we found similar decision-making tendencies for motor and economic domains across a majority of age groups. Pavlovian biases, therefore, play an important role in not only explaining motor decision-making behaviour but also the changes which occur through normal ageing. This provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms which shape motor decision-making across the lifespan.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7I9gI6jfrH8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Temporally ordered multi-neuron patterns likely encode information in the brain. We introduce an unsupervised method, SPOTDisClust (Spike Pattern Optimal Transport Dissimilarity Clustering), for their detection from high-dimensional neural ensembles. SPOTDisClust measures similarity between two ensemble spike patterns by determining the minimum transport cost of transforming their corresponding normalized cross-correlation matrices into each other (SPOTDis). Then, it performs density-based clustering based on the resulting inter-pattern dissimilarity matrix. SPOTDisClust does not require binning and can detect complex patterns (beyond sequential activation) even when high levels of out-of-pattern “noise” spiking are present. Our method handles efficiently the additional information from increasingly large neuronal ensembles and can detect a number of patterns that far exceeds the number of recorded neurons. In an application to neural ensemble data from macaque monkey V1 cortex, SPOTDisClust can identify different moving stimulus directions on the sole basis of temporal spiking patterns.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ve-KmnATpsw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In experimental assays of angiogenesis in three-dimensional fibrin matrices, a temporary scaffold formed during wound healing, the type and composition of fibrin impacts the level of sprouting. More sprouts form on high molecular weight (HMW) than on low molecular weight (LMW) fibrin. It is unclear what mechanisms regulate the number and the positions of the vascular-like structures in cell cultures. To address this question, we propose a mechanistic simulation model of endothelial cell migration and fibrin proteolysis by the plasmin system. The model is a hybrid, cell-based and continuum, computational model based on the cellular Potts model and sets of partial-differential equations. Based on the model results, we propose that a positive feedback mechanism between uPAR, plasmin and transforming growth factor &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1 (TGF&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1) selects cells in the monolayer for matrix invasion. Invading cells releases TGF&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1 from the extracellular matrix through plasmin-mediated fibrin degradation. The activated TGF&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1 further stimulates fibrin degradation and keeps proteolysis active as the sprout invades the fibrin matrix. The binding capacity for TGF&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1 of LMW is reduced relative to that of HMW. This leads to reduced activation of proteolysis and, consequently, reduced cell ingrowth in LMW fibrin compared to HMW fibrin. Thus our model predicts that endothelial cells in LMW fibrin matrices compared to HMW matrices show reduced sprouting due to a lower bio-availability of TGF&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dJeJLhtrNNo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Brain anatomy and physiology support the human ability to navigate a complex space of perceptions and actions. To maneuver across an ever-changing landscape of mental states, the brain invokes cognitive control—a set of dynamic processes that engage and disengage different groups of brain regions to modulate attention, switch between tasks, and inhibit prepotent responses. Current theory posits that correlated and anticorrelated brain activity may signify cooperative and competitive interactions between brain areas that subserve adaptive behavior. In this study, we use a quantitative approach to identify distinct topological motifs of functional interactions and examine how their expression relates to cognitive control processes and behavior. In particular, we acquire fMRI BOLD signal in twenty-eight healthy subjects as they perform two cognitive control tasks—a Stroop interference task and a local-global perception switching task using Navon figures—each with low and high cognitive control demand conditions. Based on these data, we construct dynamic functional brain networks and use a parts-based, network decomposition technique called non-negative matrix factorization to identify putative cognitive control subgraphs whose temporal expression captures distributed network structures involved in different phases of cooperative and competitive control processes. Our results demonstrate that temporal expression of the subgraphs fluctuate alongside changes in cognitive demand and are associated with individual differences in task performance. These findings offer insight into how coordinated changes in the cooperative and competitive roles of cognitive systems map trajectories between cognitively demanding brain states.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XzG9sFK-qtk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Hesam Setareh, Moritz Deger, Wulfram Gerstner&lt;/p&gt;

The time scale of neuronal network dynamics is determined by synaptic interactions and neuronal signal integration, both of which occur on the time scale of milliseconds. Yet many behaviors like the generation of movements or vocalizations of sounds occur on the much slower time scale of seconds. Here we ask the question of how neuronal networks of the brain can support reliable behavior on this time scale. We argue that excitable neuronal assemblies with spike-frequency adaptation may serve as building blocks that can flexibly adjust the speed of execution of neural circuit function. We show in simulations that a chain of neuronal assemblies can propagate signals reliably, similar to the well-known synfire chain, but with the crucial difference that the propagation speed is slower and tunable to the behaviorally relevant range. Moreover we study a grid of excitable neuronal assemblies as a simplified model of the somatosensory barrel cortex of the mouse and demonstrate that various patterns of experimentally observed spatial activity propagation can be explained.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7s2Bl1Mmz-s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Organization of Neural Population Code in Mouse Visual System</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mammalian visual system consists of several anatomically distinct areas, layers, and cell types. To understand the role of these subpopulations in visual information processing, we analyzed neural signals recorded from excitatory neurons from various anatomical and functional structures. For each of 186 mice, one of six genetically tagged cell-types and one of six visual areas were targeted while the mouse was passively viewing various visual stimuli. We trained linear classifiers to decode one of six visual stimulus categories with distinct spatiotemporal structures from the population neural activity. We found that neurons in both the primary visual cortex and secondary visual areas show varying degrees of stimulus-specific decodability, and neurons in superficial layers tend to be more informative about the stimulus categories. Additional decoding analyses of directional motion were consistent with these findings. We observed synergy in the population code of direction in several visual areas suggesting area-specific organization of information representation across neurons. These differences in decoding capacities shed light on the specialized organization of neural information processing across anatomically distinct subpopulations, and further establish the mouse as a model for understanding visual perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; This analysis is one of the first of the Allen Brain Observatory’s visual cortex dataset. The mouse has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to primates and carnivorous species as a model for studying visual perception. Mice offer the benefit of large-scale, high-throughput experiments and sophisticated genetic tools useful to investigating highly specific components of visual perception. Preliminary work in identifying the functional organization of mouse extrastriate areas has focused on single neurons and lacks analysis at the population level. Our population decoding analysis contributes novel evidence about the role of many distinct areas and layers of the mouse visual cortex in visual information processing to further establish the mouse as a viable model for future visual system research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Bidirectional Control of Risk-Seeking Behavior by the Basolateral Amygdala</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Decision-making under risk entails the possibility of simultaneously receiving positive (reward) and negative (punishment) stimuli. To learn in this context, one must integrate conflicting information related to the magnitude of reward and the probability of punishment. Long-term inactivation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) disrupts this process and increases risky behavior. In a recent study published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, Orisini et al., (2017) showed that briefly inhibiting the basolateral amygdala (BLA) may result in increased or decreased risk-taking behavior, depending on the phase of the decision process in which BLA activity is disrupted. Here we discuss the results and propose future experiments that could improve our understanding of how the BLA contributes to adaptive learning under risk and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Targeting the Mouse Ventral Hippocampus in the Intrahippocampal Kainic Acid Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0158-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0158-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Here we describe a novel mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) that moves the site of kainate injection from the rodent dorsal hippocampus (corresponding to the human posterior hippocampus) to the ventral hippocampus (corresponding to the human anterior hippocampus). We compare the phenotypes of this new model – with respect to seizures, cognitive impairment, affective deficits, and histopathology – to the standard dorsal intrahippocampal kainate model. Our results demonstrate that histopathological measures of granule cell dispersion and mossy fiber sprouting maximize near the site of kainate injection. Somewhat surprisingly, both the dorsal and ventral models exhibit similar spatial memory impairments in addition to similar electrographic and behavioral seizure burdens. In contrast, we find a more pronounced affective (anhedonic) phenotype specifically in the ventral model. These results demonstrate that the ventral intrahippocampal kainic acid model recapitulates critical pathologies of the dorsal model while providing a means to further study affective phenotypes such as depression in TLE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by spontaneous recurring seizures. TLE additionally features cognitive and affective comorbidities that impair quality of life. Animal models studying TLE are critical to advance our understanding of the disorder. A current popular model targets the dorsal hippocampus with a focal injection of kainic acid to induce epilepsy. Evidence suggest targeting the ventral hippocampus may produce a model of TLE with distinct benefits. We present data demonstrating that targeting the mouse ventral hippocampus with kainic acid creates a TLE model with similar seizure and cognitive phenotypes to the standard dorsal model but with additional, pronounced affective features, including anhedonia. These results describe a new tool for epilepsy researchers to better study comorbidities of TLE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we explore how Integrated Information Theory of consciousness
(IIT) has evolved and what problems are involved in the theory. IIT is a
hypothesis that consciousness can be explained in terms of integrated
information. It argues that a number of fundamental properties of experience
can be properly analyzed and explained by physical systems' informational
properties. Throughout the last decade, there have been many advances in IIT's
theoretical structure and mathematical model. In addition, as all hypotheses in
the field of science of consciousness, IIT has given rise to several
controversies and issues. In this context, a critical survey for IIT is
urgently needed. To this end, we first introduce fundamental concepts of IIT
and related issues. Thereafter, we discuss major transitions IIT has been
through and how they affect IIT. Finally, in the last section, some theoretical
issues involved in IIT's principles are presented. The paper concludes by
suggesting that, for the sake of future development, IIT should more seriously
take metacognitive accessibility to experience.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: G9a/GLP Complex Acts as a Bidirectional Switch to Regulate Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor-Dependent Plasticity in Hippocampal CA1 Pyramidal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy161</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy161/5049853?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) is conventionally considered to be solely dependent on local protein synthesis. Given the impact of epigenetics on memory, the intriguing question is whether epigenetic regulation influences mGluR-LTD as well. G9a/GLP histone lysine methyltransferase complex is crucial for brain development and goal-directed learning as well as for drug-addiction. In this study, we analyzed whether the epigenetic regulation by G9a/GLP complex affects mGluR-LTD in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons of 5–7 weeks old male Wistar rats. In hippocampal slices with intact CA1 dendritic regions, inhibition of G9a/GLP activity abolished mGluR-LTD. The inhibition of this complex upregulated the expression of plasticity proteins like PKMζ, which mediated the prevention of mGluR-LTD expression by regulating the NSF-GluA2-mediated trafficking of AMPA receptors towards the postsynaptic site. G9a/GLP inhibition during the induction of mGluR-LTD also downregulated the protein levels of phosphorylated-GluA2 and Arc. Interestingly, G9a/GLP inhibition could not impede the mGluR-LTD when the cell-body was severed. Our study highlights the role of G9a/GLP complex in intact neuronal network as a bidirectional switch; when turned on, it facilitates the expression of mGluR-LTD, and when turned off, it promotes the expression of long-term potentiation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Cortical Neuron Migration and Dendrite Morphology are Regulated by Carboxypeptidase E</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy155</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy155/5049851?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Higher brain function relies on proper development of the cerebral cortex, including correct positioning of neurons and dendrite morphology. Disruptions in these processes may result in various neurocognitive disorders. Mutations in the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CPE&lt;/span&gt; gene, which encodes carboxypeptidase E (CPE), have been linked to depression and intellectual disability. However, it remains unclear whether CPE is involved in early brain development and in turn contributes to the pathophysiology of neurocognitive disorders. Here, we investigate the effects of CPE knockdown on early brain development and explore the functional significance of the interaction between CPE and its binding partner p150&lt;sup&gt;Glued&lt;/sup&gt;. We demonstrate that CPE is required for cortical neuron migration and dendrite arborization. Furthermore, we show that expression of CPE-C10 redistributes p150&lt;sup&gt;Glued&lt;/sup&gt; from the centrosome and that disruption of CPE interaction with p150&lt;sup&gt;Glued&lt;/sup&gt; leads to abnormal neuronal migration and dendrite morphology, suggesting that a complex between CPE and p150&lt;sup&gt;Glued&lt;/sup&gt; is necessary for proper neurodevelopment.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Elucidating axonal and dendritic projection patterns of individual neurons is a key for understanding the cytoarchitecture of neural circuits in the brain. This requires genetic approaches to achieve Golgi-like sparse labeling of desired types of neurons. Here, we explored a novel strategy of stochastic gene activation with regulated sparseness (STARS), in which the stochastic choice between 2 competing Cre-&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;lox&lt;/span&gt; recombination events is controlled by varying the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;lox&lt;/span&gt; efficiency and cassette length. In a created STARS transgenic mouse crossed with various Cre driver lines, sparse neuronal labeling with a relatively uniform level of sparseness was achieved across different brain regions and cell types in both central and peripheral nervous systems. Tracing of individual type II peripheral auditory fibers revealed for the first time that they undergo experience-dependent developmental refinement, which is impaired by attenuating external sound input. Our results suggest that STARS strategy can be applied for circuit mapping and sparse gene manipulation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;When we speak, we get correlated sensory feedback from speech sounds and from the muscles and soft tissues of the vocal tract. Here we dissociate the contributions of auditory and somatosensory feedback to identify brain networks that underlie the somatic contribution to speech motor learning. The technique uses a robotic device that selectively alters somatosensory inputs in combination with resting-state fMRI scans that reveal learning-related changes in functional connectivity. A partial correlation analysis is used to identify connectivity changes that are not explained by the time course of activity in any other learning-related areas. This analysis revealed changes related to behavioral improvements in movement and separately, to changes in auditory perception: Speech motor adaptation itself was associated with connectivity changes that were primarily in non-motor areas of brain, specifically, to a strengthening of connectivity between auditory and somatosensory cortex and between presupplementary motor area and the inferior parietal lobule. In contrast, connectively changes associated with alterations to auditory perception were restricted to speech motor areas, specifically, primary motor cortex and inferior frontal gyrus. Overall, our findings show that during adaptation, somatosensory inputs result in a broad range of changes in connectivity in areas associated with speech motor control and learning.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neuronal Mechanisms Recording the Stream of Consciousness–A Reappraisal of Wilder Penfield’s (1891–1976) Concept of Experiential Phenomena Elicited by Electrical Stimulation of the Human Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Research on memory has been a major focus in the neurosciences over the past decades. An important advance was achieved by Wilder Penfield at the Montreal Neurological Institute, who reported from the 1930s to the 1950s about experiential phenomena induced by electrical brain stimulation in humans, implying neuronal causation of memory. Since then, neuroscientists have addressed the topic of memory from a range of subdisciplines; however, these reports by Penfield and his group as well as those on patient H. M. by Brenda Milner at the same institution continue to be referenced as groundbreaking. Further experimental work by Nobel laureates Eric Kandel and John O’Keefe, as well as by Edvard and May-Britt Moser related Penfield’s patient documentation to experiential phenomena. However, our reassessment of Penfield’s original patient documentation questions the stance that he had uncovered the “storehouse of memories.” Human memory must be regarded more as context sensitive and as representative of an active reconstructive process, than as a simple recording of events. Hence, strategies aiming at naturalizing all phenomena of mind (including memory) to cellular and molecular mechanisms cannot convincingly refer to Penfield’s electrophysiological studies alone as evidence that memories are solely caused by neuronal firing patterns.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Paxillin phosphorylation at serine 273 and its effects on Rac, Rho and adhesion dynamics</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Kaixi Tang, Colton G. Boudreau, Claire M. Brown, Anmar Khadra&lt;/p&gt;

Focal adhesions are protein complexes that anchor cells to the extracellular matrix. During migration, the growth and disassembly of these structures are spatiotemporally regulated, with new adhesions forming at the leading edge of the cell and mature adhesions disassembling at the rear. Signalling proteins and structural cytoskeletal components tightly regulate adhesion dynamics. Paxillin, an adaptor protein within adhesions, is one of these proteins. Its phosphorylation at serine 273 (S273) is crucial for maintaining fast adhesion assembly and disassembly. Paxillin is known to bind to a GIT1-βPIX-PAK1 complex, which increases the local activation of the small GTPase Rac. To understand quantitatively the behaviour of this system and how it relates to adhesion assembly/disassembly, we developed a mathematical model describing the dynamics of the small GTPases Rac and Rho as determined by paxillin S273 phosphorylation. Our model revealed that the system possesses bistability, where switching between uninduced (active Rho) and induced (active Rac) states can occur through a change in rate of paxillin phosphorylation or PAK1 activation. The bistable switch is characterized by the presence of memory, minimal change in the levels of active Rac and Rho within the induced and uninduced states, respectively, and the limited regime of monostability associated with the uninduced state. These results were validated experimentally by showing the presence of bimodality in adhesion assembly and disassembly rates, and demonstrating that Rac activity increases after treating Chinese Hamster Ovary cells with okadaic acid (a paxillin phosphatase inhibitor), followed by a modest recovery after 20 min washout. Spatial gradients of phosphorylated paxillin in a reaction-diffusion model gave rise to distinct regions of Rac and Rho activities, resembling polarization of a cell into front and rear. Perturbing several parameters of the model also revealed important insights into how signalling components upstream and downstream of paxillin phosphorylation affect dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4Bo3nqD1NCA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Genome-scale models of metabolism and macromolecular expression (ME-models) explicitly compute the optimal proteome composition of a growing cell. ME-models expand upon the well-established genome-scale models of metabolism (M-models), and they enable a new fundamental understanding of cellular growth. ME-models have increased predictive capabilities and accuracy due to their inclusion of the biosynthetic costs for the machinery of life, but they come with a significant increase in model size and complexity. This challenge results in models which are both difficult to compute and challenging to understand conceptually. As a result, ME-models exist for only two organisms (&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Thermotoga maritima&lt;/i&gt;) and are still used by relatively few researchers. To address these challenges, we have developed a new software framework called COBRAme for building and simulating ME-models. It is coded in Python and built on COBRApy, a popular platform for using M-models. COBRAme streamlines computation and analysis of ME-models. It provides tools to simplify constructing and editing ME-models to enable ME-model reconstructions for new organisms. We used COBRAme to reconstruct a condensed &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; ME-model called &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;JL1678b-ME. This reformulated model gives functionally identical solutions to previous &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; ME-models while using 1/5 the number of free variables and solving in less than 10 minutes, a marked improvement over the 6 hour solve time of previous ME-model formulations. Errors in previous ME-models were also corrected leading to 52 additional genes that must be expressed in &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;JL1678b-ME to grow aerobically in glucose minimal &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; media. This manuscript outlines the architecture of COBRAme and demonstrates how ME-models can be created, modified, and shared most efficiently using the new software framework.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cjOqyaA5KvQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Moment-to-Moment Fluctuations in Neuronal Excitability Bias Subjective Perception Rather than Strategic Decision-Making</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Perceiving an external stimulus depends not only on the physical features of the stimulus, but also fundamentally on the current state of neuronal excitability, indexed by the power of ongoing alpha-band and beta-band oscillations (8–30 Hz). Recent studies suggest that heightened excitability does not improve perceptual precision, but biases observers to report the presence of a stimulus regardless of its physical presence. It is unknown whether this bias is due to changes in observers’ subjective perceptual experience (perceptual bias) or their perception-independent decision-making strategy (decision bias). We tested these alternative interpretations in an EEG experiment in which male and female human participants performed two-interval forced choice (2IFC) detection and discrimination. According to signal detection theory, perceptual bias only affects 2IFC detection, but not discrimination, while interval decision bias should be task independent. We found that correct detection was more likely when excitability before the stimulus-present interval exceeded that before the stimulus-absent interval (i.e., 8–17 Hz power was weaker before the stimulus-present interval), consistent with an effect of excitability on perceptual bias. By contrast, discrimination accuracy was unaffected by excitability fluctuations between intervals, ruling out an effect on interval decision bias. We conclude that the current state of neuronal excitability biases the perceptual experience itself, rather than the decision process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Loss of Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity in a KCl-Induced Model of Episodic Headache Enhances CNS Drug Delivery</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Cortical spreading depression (CSD) in the CNS is suggested as a common mechanism contributing to headache. Despite strong evidence for CNS involvement in headache disorders, drug development for headache disorders remains focused on peripheral targets. Difficulty in delivering drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may partially account for this disparity. It is known, however, that BBB permeability is increased during several CNS pathologies. In this study, we investigated BBB changes in response to KCl-induced CSD events and subsequent allodynia in rats. Cortical KCl injection in awake, freely moving rats produced facial allodynia with peak intensity between 1.5 and 3 hours and CSD induction within 0.5 to 2 hours post-injection. Brain perfusion of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C-sucrose as a marker of BBB paracellular permeability revealed increased leak in the cortex, but not brainstem, beginning 0.5 hours post-KCl injection and resolving within 6 hours; no changes in tight junction (TJ) proteins occludin or claudin-5 expression were observed. Acute pre-treatment with topiramate to inhibit CSD did not prevent the increased BBB paracellular permeability. CNS delivery of the abortive anti-migraine agent sumatriptan was increased in the cortex 1.5 hours post-KCl injection. Surprisingly, sumatriptan uptake was also increased in the brainstem following CSD induction, suggesting regulation of active transport mechanisms at the BBB. Together these results demonstrate the ability of CSD events to produce transient, time-dependent changes in BBB permeability when allodynia is present and to mediate access of clinically relevant therapeutics (i.e., sumatriptan) to the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The need to overcome the BBB is one of the major hurdles in designing CNS active drugs. CNS mechanisms have been shown to play a vital role in primary and secondary headache disorders. In this study we show that BBB permeability is transiently increased in a rat model of CSD induced episodic headache. We also observed a significant increase in sumatriptan uptake into the brain. Clinically, sumatriptan has been shown to be most efficacious when given close to the onset of headache pain, corresponding to times where we observed increased CNS uptake in our rat model. These data suggest that altered BBB permeability occurs during CSD and may be taken advantage of during therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: A Large Endoplasmic Reticulum-Resident Pool of TRPM1 in Retinal ON-Bipolar Cells</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The chemical signal of light onset, a decrease in glutamate release from rod and cone photoreceptors, is processed by a postsynaptic G protein signaling cascade in ON-bipolar cells (BPCs). The metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR6, along with other cascade elements, is localized synaptically at the BPC dendritic tips. The effector ion channel protein transient receptor potential melastatin-1 (TRPM1), in contrast, is located not only at the dendritic tips but also in BPC bodies and axons. Little is known about the intracellular localization of TRPM1, or its trafficking route to the dendritic tip plasma membrane. Recombinant TRPM1 expressed in mammalian cells colocalized with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers, with little or none detected at the plasma membrane. In mouse retina, somatic TRPM1 was similarly intracellular, and not at the plasma membrane. Labeling of ER membranes by expression of a fluorescent marker showed that in BPCs the ER extends into axons and dendrites, but not dendritic tips. In cell bodies, TRPM1 colocalized with the ER, and not with the Golgi apparatus. Fluorescence protease protection (FPP) assays with TRPM1-GFP fusions in heterologous cells revealed that the N and C termini are both accessible to the cytoplasm, consistent with the transmembrane domain topology of related TRP channels. These results indicate that the majority of TRPM1 is present in the ER, from which it can potentially be transported to the dendritic tips as needed for ON light responses. The excess of ER-resident TRPM1 relative to the amount needed at the dendritic tips suggests a potential new function for TRPM1 in the ER.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The role of robot design in decoding error-related information from EEG signals of a human observer. (arXiv:1807.01597v1 [cs.HC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01597</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;For utilization of robotic assistive devices in everyday life, means for
detection and processing of erroneous robot actions are a focal aspect in the
development of collaborative systems, especially when controlled via brain
signals. Though, the variety of possible scenarios and the diversity of used
robotic systems pose a challenge for error decoding from recordings of brain
signals such as via EEG. For example, it is unclear whether humanoid
appearances of robotic assistants have an influence on the performance. In this
paper, we designed a study in which two different robots executed the same task
both in an erroneous and a correct manner. We find error-related EEG signals of
human observers indicating that the performance of the error decoding was
independent of robot design. However, we can show that it was possible to
identify which robot performed the instructed task by means of the EEG signals.
In this case, deep convolutional neural networks (deep ConvNets) could reach
significantly higher ac curacies than both regularized Linear Discriminanat
Analysis (rLDA) and filter bank common spatial patterns (FB-CSP) combined with
rLDA. Our findings indicate that decoding information about robot action
success from the EEG, particularly when using deep neural networks, may be an
applicable approach for a broad range of robot designs.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Tonic activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors decreases intrinsic excitability and promotes bistability in a model of neuronal activity. (arXiv:1807.01491v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;NMDA receptors (NMDA-R) typically contribute to excitatory synaptic
transmission in the central nervous system. While calcium influx through NMDA-R
plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity, indirect experimental evidence
also exists demonstrating actions of NMDAR-mediated calcium influx on neuronal
excitability through the activation of calcium-activated potassium channels.
But, so far, this mechanism has not been studied theoretically. Our theoretical
model provide a simple description of neuronal electrical activity including
the tonic activity of NMDA receptors and a cytosolic calcium compartment. We
show that calcium influx through NMDA-R can directly be coupled to activation
of calcium-activated potassium channels providing an overall inhibitory effect
on neuronal excitability. Furthermore, the presence of tonic NMDA-R activity
promotes bistability in electrical activity by dramatically increasing the
stimulus interval where both a stable steady state and repetitive firing can
exist. This results could provide an intrinsic mechanism for the constitution
of memory traces in neuronal circuits. They also shed light on the way by which
beta-amyloids can decrease neuronal activity when interfering with NMDA-R in
Alzheimer's disease.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In vitro and in vivo spiking activity clearly differ. Whereas networks in
vitro develop strong bursts separated by periods of very little spiking
activity, in vivo cortical networks show continuous activity. This is puzzling
considering that both networks presumably share similar single-neuron dynamics
and plasticity rules. We propose that the defining difference between in vitro
and in vivo dynamics is the strength of external input. In vitro, networks are
virtually isolated, whereas in vivo every brain area receives continuous input.
We analyze a model of spiking neurons in which the input strength, mediated by
spike rate homeostasis, determines the characteristics of the dynamical state.
In more detail, our analytical and numerical results on various network
topologies show consistently that under increasing input, homeostatic
plasticity generates distinct dynamic states, from bursting, to
close-to-critical, reverberating and irregular states. This implies that the
dynamic state of a neural network is not fixed but can readily adapt to the
input strengths. Indeed, our results match experimental spike recordings in
vitro and in vivo: the in vitro bursting behavior is consistent with a state
generated by very low network input (&amp;lt; 0.1%), whereas in vivo activity suggests
that on the order of 1% recorded spikes are input-driven, resulting in
reverberating dynamics. Importantly, this predicts that one can abolish the
ubiquitous bursts of in vitro preparations, and instead impose dynamics
comparable to in vivo activity by exposing the system to weak long-term
stimulation, thereby opening new paths to establish an in vivo-like assay in
vitro for basic as well as neurological studies.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Shot Noise Neuron Model. (arXiv:1807.01469v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01469</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we propose a shot noise-based leaky integrated and firing
neuron model and provide a detailed analysis of the performance of this model
compared to the traditional diffusion approximated model. In theoretical
neuroscience, there are three general neuron models in the field: Compartmental
neuron model is a conductance-based model, in which it views the biological
neurons as a large circuit. The problem of this model comes from its structural
complexity and the number of its free parameters; Leaky integrated and firing
model is a more flexible model due to the special design called
threshold-resetting, in which the voltage of the neuron is reset after reaching
the threshold. This model is proposed as an alternative to the compartment
model to provide a more biologically realistic model that can capture spike
timing behaviors that are observed in experiments. In addition to that, it is
more computationally efficient since it has much less free parameters; Firing
rate-based neuron model uses the firing rate of the neuron as the coupling
terms in the coupled neuronal network models. Models of this kind can be easily
analyzed on the network level. Theoretical analysis for this model proves the
existence of phase transition and shows that the computational capacity is
boosted in the chaotic regime.

	<description>Congenital hydrocephalus (CH) is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality, affecting 1 in 1,000 live births and representing up to 3% of all pediatric hospital charges. Using data from the largest CH exome sequencing study to date, Furey et al. identify four genes (TRIM71, SMARCC1, PTCH1, and SHH) not previously implicated in CH. Remarkably, all four genes regulate ventricular zone neural stem cell fate and, together, explain ∼10% of CH cases. These findings implicate impaired neurogenesis in pathogenesis of a significant number of CH patients, with potential diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic ramifications.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Oscillatory Encoding of Visual Stimulus Familiarity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6223?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6223?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Familiarity of the environment changes the way we perceive and encode incoming information. However, the neural substrates underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. Here we describe a new form of experience-dependent low-frequency oscillations in the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake adult male mice. The oscillations emerged in visually evoked potentials and single-unit activity following repeated visual stimulation. The oscillations were sensitive to the spatial frequency content of a visual stimulus and required the mAChRs for their induction and expression. Finally, ongoing visually evoked  (4–8 Hz) oscillations boost the visually evoked potential amplitude of incoming visual stimuli if the stimuli are presented at the high excitability phase of the oscillations. Our results demonstrate that an oscillatory code can be used to encode familiarity and serves as a gate for oncoming sensory inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Previous experience can influence the processing of incoming sensory information by the brain and alter perception. However, the mechanistic understanding of how this process takes place is lacking. We have discovered that persistent low-frequency oscillations in the primary visual cortex encode information about familiarity and the spatial frequency of the stimulus. These familiarity evoked oscillations influence neuronal responses to the oncoming stimuli in a way that depends on the oscillation phase. Our work demonstrates a new mechanism of visual stimulus feature detection and learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Alcohol Consumption during Adolescence in a Mouse Model of Binge Drinking Alters the Intrinsic Excitability and Function of the Prefrontal Cortex through a Reduction in the Hyperpolarization-Activated Cation Current</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6207?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6207?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Periodic episodes of excessive alcohol consumption (&quot;binge drinking&quot;) occur frequently among adolescents, and early binge drinking is associated with an increased risk of alcohol use disorders later in life. The PFC undergoes significant development during adolescence and hence may be especially susceptible to the effects of binge drinking. In humans and in animal models, adolescent alcohol exposure is known to alter PFC neuronal activity and produce deficits in PFC-dependent behaviors, such as decision making, response inhibition, and working memory. Using a voluntary intermittent access to alcohol (IA EtOH) procedure in male mice, we demonstrate that binge-level alcohol consumption during adolescence leads to altered drinking patterns and working memory deficits in young adulthood, two outcomes that suggest medial PFC dysfunction. We recorded from pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the prelimbic subregion of the medial PFC in slices obtained from mice that had IA EtOH and found that they display altered excitability, including a hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential and reductions in the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) and in intrinsic persistent activity (a mode of neuronal firing that is dependent on I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;). Many of these effects on intrinsic excitability were sustained following abstinence and observed in mice that showed working memory deficits. In addition, we found that resting membrane potential and the I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent voltage &quot;sag&quot; in prelimbic PFC PNs are developmentally regulated during adolescence, suggesting that adolescent alcohol exposure may compromise PFC function by arresting the normal developmental trajectory of PN intrinsic excitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Binge alcohol drinking during adolescence has negative consequences for the function of the developing PFC. Using a mouse model of voluntary binge drinking during adolescence, we found that this behavior leads to working memory deficits and altered drinking behavior in adulthood. In addition, we found that adolescent drinking is associated with specific changes to the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons in the PFC, reducing the ability of these neurons to generate intrinsic persistent activity, a phenomenon thought to be important for working memory. These findings may help explain why human adolescent binge drinkers show performance deficits on tasks mediated by the PFC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Classification of Neurons in the Primate Reticular Formation and Changes after Recovery from Pyramidal Tract Lesion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6190?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The reticular formation is important in primate motor control, both in health and during recovery after brain damage. Little is known about the different neurons present in the reticular nuclei. Here we recorded extracellular spikes from the reticular formation in five healthy female awake behaving monkeys (193 cells), and in two female monkeys 1 year after recovery from a unilateral pyramidal tract lesion (125 cells). Analysis of spike shape and four measures derived from the interspike interval distribution identified four clusters of neurons in control animals. Cluster 1 cells had a slow firing rate. Cluster 2 cells had narrow spikes and irregular firing, which often included high-frequency bursts. Cluster 3 cells were highly rhythmic and fast firing. Cluster 4 cells showed negative spikes. A separate population of 42 cells was antidromically identified as reticulospinal neurons in five anesthetized female monkeys. The distribution of spike width in these cells closely overlaid the distribution for cluster 2, leading us tentatively to suggest that cluster 2 included neurons with reticulospinal projections. In animals after corticospinal lesion, cells could be identified in all four clusters. The firing rate of cells in clusters 1 and 2 was increased in lesioned animals relative to control animals (by 52% and 60%, respectively); cells in cluster 2 were also more regular and more bursting in the lesioned animals. We suggest that changes in both membrane properties and local circuits within the reticular formation occur following lesioning, potentially increasing reticulospinal output to help compensate for lost corticospinal descending drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This work is the first to subclassify neurons in the reticular formation, providing insights into the local circuitry of this important but little understood structure. The approach developed can be applied to any extracellular recording from this region, allowing future studies to place their data within our current framework of four neural types. Changes in reticular neurons may be important to subserve functional recovery after damage in human patients, such as after stroke or spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Post-Turing tissue pattern formation: Advent of mechanochemistry</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006259</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Felix Brinkmann, Moritz Mercker, Thomas Richter, Anna Marciniak-Czochra&lt;/p&gt;

Chemical and mechanical pattern formation is fundamental during embryogenesis and tissue development. Yet, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are still elusive in many cases. Most current theories assume that tissue development is driven by chemical processes: either as a sequence of chemical patterns each depending on the previous one, or by patterns spontaneously arising from specific chemical interactions (such as “Turing-patterns”). Within both theories, mechanical patterns are usually regarded as passive by-products of chemical pre-patters. However, several experiments question these theories, and an increasing number of studies shows that tissue mechanics can actively influence chemical patterns during development. In this study, we thus focus on the interplay between chemical and mechanical processes during tissue development. On one hand, based on recent experimental data, we develop new mechanochemical simulation models of evolving tissues, in which the full 3D representation of the tissue appears to be critical for obtaining a realistic mechanochemical behaviour. The presented modelling approach is flexible and numerically studied using state of the art finite element methods. Thus, it may serve as a basis to combine simulations with new experimental methods in tissue development. On the other hand, we apply the developed approach and demonstrate that even simple interactions between tissue mechanics and chemistry spontaneously lead to robust and complex mechanochemical patterns. Especially, we demonstrate that the main contradictions arising in the framework of purely chemical theories are naturally and automatically resolved using the mechanochemical patterning theory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TU2UMRsefhw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Functional Recovery of a Locomotor Network after Injury: Plasticity beyond the Central Nervous System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0195-18.2018v2?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0195-18.2018v2?rss=1</link>
	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Many animals depend on descending information from the brain for the initiation and proper execution of locomotion. Interestingly, after injury and the loss of such inputs, locomotor function can sometimes be regained without the regrowth of central connections. In the medicinal leech, &lt;i&gt;Hirudo verbana&lt;/i&gt;, we have shown that crawling reemerges after removal of descending inputs. Here, we studied the mechanisms underlying this return of locomotion by asking if central pattern generators (CPGs) in crawl-recovered leeches are sufficient to produce crawl-specific intersegmental coordination. From recovered animals, we treated isolated chains of ganglia with dopamine to activate the crawl CPGs (one crawl CPG per ganglion), and observed fictive crawl-like bursting in the dorsal-longitudinal-excitor motoneuron (DE-3); an established crawl-monitor neuron. However, these preparations did not exhibit crawl-specific coordination across the CPGs. Although the crawl CPGs always generated bi-directional activation of adjacent CPGs, we never observed crawl-appropriate intersegmental phase delays. Because central circuits alone were unable to organize crawl-specific coordination, we tested the coordinating role of the peripheral nervous system. In transected leeches normally destined for recovery, we removed afferent information to the anterior-most (lead) ganglion located below the nerve-cord transection site. In these dually treated animals, overt crawling was greatly delayed or prevented. After filling the peripheral nerves with Neurobiotin tracer distal to the nerve-root lesion, we found a perfect correlation between regrowth of peripheral neuronal fibers and crawl recovery. Our study establishes that during recovery after injury crawl-specific intersegmental coordination switches to a new dependency on afferent information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; In the field of motor control, a pressing issue to resolve is how the central and peripheral nervous system become retuned and work together to establish functional locomotor patterns after descending signals are chronically removed after injury. The work we have presented, in the medicinal leech, clarifies that central pattern generator (CPG) neural networks are highly plastic in their ability to incorporate different timing elements for their intersegmental coordination after descending-coordinating information is removed. Essentially, the crawl CPGs switch their dependence on descending-timing cues to those originating from proprioceptive neurons in the muscular body wall. Results from our experimentally tractable preparation may provide a platform to guide future studies of locomotor recovery in vertebrate animals after spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: A Multilevel Computational Characterization of Endophenotypes in Addiction</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Addiction is characterized by a profound intersubject (phenotypic) variability in the expression of addictive symptomatology and propensity to relapse following treatment. However, laboratory investigations have primarily focused on common neural substrates in addiction and have not yet been able to identify mechanisms that can account for the multifaceted phenotypic behaviors reported in the literature. To fill this knowledge gap theoretically, here we simulated phenotypic variations in addiction symptomology and responses to putative treatments, using both a neural model, based on cortico-striatal circuit dynamics, and an algorithmic model of reinforcement learning. These simulations rely on the widely accepted assumption that both the ventral, model-based, goal-directed system and the dorsal, model-free, habitual system are vulnerable to extra-physiologic dopamine reinforcements triggered by addictive rewards. We found that endophenotypic differences in the balance between the two circuit or control systems resulted in an inverted U-shape in optimal choice behavior. Specifically, greater unbalance led to a higher likelihood of developing addiction and more severe drug-taking behaviors. Furthermore, endophenotypes with opposite asymmetrical biases among cortico-striatal circuits expressed similar addiction behaviors, but responded differently to simulated treatments, suggesting personalized treatment development could rely on endophenotypic rather than phenotypic differentiations. We propose our simulated results, confirmed across neural and algorithmic levels of analysis, inform on a fundamental and, to date, neglected quantitative method to characterize clinical heterogeneity in addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Addiction is known to encompass heterogeneity in its development, maintenance, and treatment response. While previous work has mostly focused on the common mechanisms underlying vulnerabilities in addiction at a group level, the neurocomputational causes for such intersubject variability in addition are not well-understood. To fill this knowledge gap, we combine a neural and a reinforcement learning model to reveal that the balance between neural circuits or computational control modalities characterizes the presence of behavioral phenotypes in addiction. The presence of converging effects, validated across neural and algorithmic levels of analysis, informs on a quantitative method to characterize clinical heterogeneity, and potentially helps future development of precision treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Neurons Specifically Activated by Fear Learning in Lateral Amygdala Display Increased Synaptic Strength</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The lateral amygdala (LA) plays a critical role in the formation of fear conditioned associative memories. Previous studies have used c-&lt;i&gt;fos&lt;/i&gt; regulated expression to identify a spatially restricted population of neurons within the LA that is specifically activated by fear learning. These neurons are likely to be a part of a memory engram but, to date, functional evidence for this has been lacking. We show that neurons within a spatially restricted region of the LA had an increase in both the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSC) when compared to neurons recorded from home-cage control mice. We then more specifically addressed if this increased synaptic activity was limited to learning-activated neurons. Using a &lt;i&gt;fos&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;tau-LacZ&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;/i&gt;) transgenic mouse line, we developed a fluorescence-based method of identifying and recording from neurons activated by fear learning (&lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) in acute brain slices. An increase in frequency and amplitude of sPSCs was observed in &lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; neurons when compared to non-activated &lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; neurons in fear conditioned mice. No learning-induced changes were observed in the action potential input-output relationships. These findings support the idea that a discrete LA neuron population forms part of a memory engram through changes in synaptic connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The lateral amygdala (LA) is critical for the formation of associative fear memories, such as those formed by fear conditioning. A subset of neurons in LA are activated by fear conditioning suggesting that they may be part of a memory engram. However, there is no functional evidence to support this view. Electrophysiological characterisation of LA neurons shows that the frequency and amplitude of synaptic events increase following fear conditioning. A method based on β-galactosidase as a reporter was developed to locate activated neurons in acute slice. An increase in frequency and amplitude of synaptic events was observed in activated compared to non-activated neurons supporting the idea that a discrete LA neuron population forms part of a memory engram.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Chronometry on Spike-LFP Responses Reveals the Functional Neural Circuitry of Early Auditory Cortex Underlying Sound Processing and Discrimination</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Animals and humans rapidly detect specific features of sounds, but the time courses of the underlying neural response for different stimulus categories is largely unknown. Furthermore, the intricate functional organization of auditory information processing pathways is poorly understood. Here, we computed neuronal response latencies from simultaneously recorded spike trains and local field potentials (LFPs) along the first two stages of cortical sound processing, primary auditory cortex (A1) and lateral belt (LB), of awake, behaving macaques. Two types of response latencies were measured for spike trains as well as LFPs: (1) onset latency, time-locked to onset of external auditory stimuli; and (2) selection latency, time taken from stimulus onset to a selective response to a specific stimulus category. Trial-by-trial LFP onset latencies predominantly reflecting synaptic input arrival typically preceded spike onset latencies, assumed to be representative of neuronal output indicating that both areas may receive input environmental signals and relay the information to the next stage. In A1, simple sounds, such as pure tones (PTs), yielded shorter spike onset latencies compared to complex sounds, such as monkey vocalizations (&quot;Coos&quot;). This trend was reversed in LB, indicating a hierarchical functional organization of auditory cortex in the macaque. LFP selection latencies in A1 were always shorter than those in LB for both PT and Coo reflecting the serial arrival of stimulus-specific information in these areas. Thus, chronometry on spike-LFP signals revealed some of the effective neural circuitry underlying complex sound discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>A key component of current theories of brain structure and function is the layer-specific origin of structural connections of the cerebral cortex. This fundamental connectional feature pertains to different mammalian cortices, and recent neuroimaging advancements have started to pave the way for its function-based mapping in humans.

It is challenging to decipher molecular mechanisms in biological systems from system-level input-output data, especially for complex processes that involve interactions among multiple components. We addressed this general problem for the bacterial histidine kinase CheA, the activity of which is regulated in chemotaxis signaling complexes by bacterial chemoreceptors. We developed a general network model to describe the dynamics of the system, treating the receptor complex with coupling protein CheW and the P3P4P5 domains of kinase CheA as a regulated enzyme with two substrates, ATP and P1, the phosphoryl-accepting domain of CheA. Our simple network model allowed us to search hypothesis space systematically. For different and progressively more complex regulation schemes, we fit our models to a large set of input-output data with the aim of identifying the simplest possible regulation mechanisms consistent with the data. Our modeling and analysis revealed novel dual regulation mechanisms in which receptor activity regulated ATP binding plus one other process, either P1 binding or phosphoryl transfer between P1 and ATP. Strikingly, in our models receptor control affected the kinetic rate constants of substrate association and dissociation equally and thus did not alter the respective equilibrium constants. We suggest experiments that could distinguish between the two dual-regulation mechanisms. This systems-biology approach of combining modeling and a large input-output dataset should be applicable for studying other complex biological processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/55xMZx8_bX8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Examining the Reversibility of Long-Term Behavioral Disruptions in Progeny of Maternal SSRI Exposure</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Serotonergic dysregulation is implicated in numerous psychiatric disorders. Serotonin plays widespread trophic roles during neurodevelopment; thus perturbations to this system during development may increase risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Epidemiological studies have examined association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment during pregnancy and increased autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in offspring. It is unclear from these studies whether ASD susceptibility is purely related to maternal psychiatric diagnosis, or if treatment poses additional risk. We sought to determine if maternal SSRI treatment alone or in combination with genetically vulnerable background was sufficient to induce offspring behavior disruptions relevant to ASD. We exposed C57BL/6J or &lt;i&gt;Celf6&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; mouse dams to fluoxetine during different periods of gestation and lactation, and characterized offspring on tasks assessing social communicative interaction and repetitive behavior patterns including sensory sensitivities. We demonstrate robust reductions in pup ultrasonic vocalizations and alterations in social hierarchy behaviors, as well as perseverative behaviors and tactile hypersensitivity. &lt;i&gt;Celf6&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice demonstrate social communicative deficits and perseverative behaviors, without further interaction with fluoxetine. Fluoxetine re-exposure in adulthood ameliorates the tactile hypersensitivity yet exacerbates the dominance phenotype. This suggests acute deficiencies in serotonin levels likely underlie the abnormal responses to sensory stimuli, while the social alterations are instead due to altered development of social circuits. These findings indicate maternal fluoxetine treatment, independent of maternal stress, can induce behavioral disruptions in mammalian offspring, thus contributing to our understanding of the developmental role of the serotonin system and the possible risks to offspring of SSRI treatment during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Human epidemiological studies suggest that taking antidepressants during pregnancy may increase risk autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. Since only women with a diagnosis take antidepressants, there is substantial debate on whether all increased ASD risk is contributed by the diagnosis, or if medication has an additional influence. We reasoned empirical studies in a reduced system might provide some indication if there was biological basis for such an influence. Our mouse studies show that, in the absence of other maternal manipulations or stressors, maternal selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) exposure alone can alter the behavioral circuits for sensory, social and repetitive behaviors, relevant to ASD, in a mammalian brain, and that some of these changes are reversible by SSRI re-exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Key Brain Network Nodes Show Differential Cognitive Relevance and Developmental Trajectories during Childhood and Adolescence</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Human adolescence is a period of rapid changes in cognition and goal-directed behavior, and constitutes a major transitional phase towards adulthood. One of the mechanisms suggested to underlie the protracted maturation of functional brain networks, is the increased network integration and segregation enhancing neural efficiency. Importantly, the increasing coordinated network interplay throughout development is mediated through functional hubs, which are highly connected brain areas suggested to be pivotal nodes for the regulation of neural activity. To elucidate brain hub development during childhood and adolescence, we estimated voxel-wise eigenvector centrality (EC) using fMRI data from two different psychological contexts (resting state and a working memory task), in a large cross-sectional sample (n = 754) spanning the age from 8-22 years, and decomposed the maps using independent component analysis. Our results reveal significant age-related centrality differences in cingulo-opercular, visual and sensorimotor network nodes during both rest and task performance, suggesting that common neurodevelopmental processes manifest across different mental states. Supporting the functional significance of these developmental patterns, the centrality of the cingulo-opercular node was positively associated with task performance. These findings provide evidence for protracted maturation of hub properties in specific nodes of the brain connectome during the course of childhood and adolescence, and suggest that cingulo-opercular centrality is a key factor supporting neurocognitive development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Adolescence is a sensitive period during ontogeny and a maturational gateway to adulthood. A better characterization of the brain changes underpinning cognitive and emotional development occurring during this period is key to inform models of normal and abnormal adaptation. Advanced brain imaging allows for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies of the protracted maturation of brain network function and connectivity during childhood and adolescence. Here, we used functional brain imaging to identify neural hubs during two psychological contexts in 754 children and adolescents. Key regions of the brain network showed increasing importance through adolescence, and individual differences in working memory performance was associated with the centrality of cingulo-opercular network nodes, suggesting a hot-spot for neurocognitive development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Expressions of emotion are powerful triggers for situation-appropriate responses by the observer. Of particular interest regarding the preparation of such adaptive actions are parietal and premotor cortices, given their potential for interaction with the amygdala (AMG), which is known to play a crucial role in the processing of affective information and in motor response. We set out to disentangle the respective roles of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and ventral premotor cortex (PMv) in humans in the processing of emotional body expressions by assessing remote effects of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) in the action network and in AMG. Participants were presented with blocks of short videos showing either angry or neutral whole-body actions. The experiment consisted of three fMRI sessions: two sessions were preceded by stimulation of either right IPL (rIPL) or right PMv (rPMv); and a third session assessed baseline activity. Interestingly, whereas at baseline the left AMG did not differentiate between neutral and angry body postures, a significant difference between these conditions emerged after stimulation of either rIPL or rPMv, with much larger responses to angry than to neutral stimuli. In addition, the effects of cTBS stimulation and emotion were also observed in two other action-relevant areas, the supplementary motor area and the superior parietal cortex. Together, these results show how areas involved in action and emotion perception and in action preparation interact dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Optogenetic Study of Anterior BNST and Basomedial Amygdala Projections to the Ventromedial Hypothalamus</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The basomedial amygdala (BM) influences the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) through direct glutamatergic projections as well as indirectly, through the anterior part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTa). However, BM and BNSTa axons end in a segregated fashion in VMH. BM projects to the core of VMH, where VMH’s projection cells are located, whereas BNSTa projects to the shell of VMH, where GABAergic cells that inhibit core neurons are concentrated. However, the consequences of this dual regulation of VMH by BM and BNSTa are unknown. To study this question, we recorded the responses of VMH’s shell and core neurons to the optogenetic activation of BM or BNSTa inputs in transgenic mice that selectively express Cre-recombinase in glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. Glutamatergic BM inputs fired most core neurons but elicited no response in GABAergic shell neurons. Following BM infusions of AAV-EF1α-DIO-hChR2-mCherry in Vgat-ires-Cre-Ai6 mice, no anterograde labeling was observed in the VMH, suggesting that GABAergic BM neurons do not project to the VMH. In contrast, BNSTa sent mostly GABAergic projections that inhibited both shell and core neurons. However, BNSTa-evoked IPSPs had a higher amplitude in shell neurons. Since we also found that activation of GABAergic shell neurons causes an inhibition of core neurons, these results suggest that depending on the firing rate of shell neurons, BNSTa inputs could elicit a net inhibition or disinhibition of core neurons. Thus, the dual regulation of VMH by BM and BNSTa imparts flexibility to this regulator of defensive and social behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Systemic and Intra-Habenular Activation of the Orphan G Protein-Coupled Receptor GPR139 Decreases Compulsive-Like Alcohol Drinking and Hyperalgesia in Alcohol-Dependent Rats</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;GPR139 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is expressed mainly in the brain, with the highest expression in the medial habenula. The modulation of GPR139 receptor function has been hypothesized to be beneficial in the treatment of some mental disorders, but behavioral studies have not yet provided causal evidence of the role of GPR139 in brain dysfunction. Because of the high expression of GPR139 in the habenula, a critical brain region in addiction, we hypothesized that GPR139 may play role in alcohol dependence. Thus, we tested the effect of GPR139 receptor activation using the selective, brain-penetrant receptor agonist JNJ-63533054 on addiction-like behaviors in alcohol-dependent male rats. Systemic administration of JNJ-63533054 (30 mg/kg but not 10 mg/kg, p.o.) reversed the escalation of alcohol self-administration in alcohol-dependent rats, without affecting water or saccharin intake in dependent rats or alcohol intake in nondependent rats. Moreover, systemic JNJ-63533054 administration decreased withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia, without affecting somatic signs of alcohol withdrawal. Further analysis demonstrated that JNJ-63533054 was effective only in a subgroup of dependent rats that exhibited compulsive-like alcohol drinking. Finally, site-specific microinjection of JNJ-63533054 in the habenula but not interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) reduced both alcohol self-administration and withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia in dependent rats. These results provide robust preclinical evidence that GPR139 receptor activation reverses key addiction-like behaviors in dependent animals, suggest that GPR139 may be a novel target for the treatment of alcohol use disorder, and demonstrate that GPR139 is functionally relevant in regulating mammalian behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human neurons expressing mutations associated with neurodegenerative disease are becoming more widely available. Hence, developing assays capable of accurately detecting changes that occur early in the disease process and identifying therapeutics able to slow these changes should become ever more important. Using automated live-cell imaging, we studied human motor neurons in the process of dying following neurotrophic factor withdrawal. We tracked different neuronal features, including cell body size, neurite length, and number of nodes. In particular, measuring the number of nodes in individual neurons proved to be an accurate predictor of relative health. Importantly, intermediate phenotypes were defined and could be used to distinguish between agents that could fully restore neurons and neurites and those only capable of maintaining neuronal cell bodies. Application of live-cell imaging to disease modeling has the potential to uncover new classes of therapeutic molecules that intervene early in disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Functional Recovery of a Locomotor Network after Injury: Plasticity beyond the Central Nervous System</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Many animals depend on descending information from the brain for the initiation and proper execution of locomotion. Interestingly, after injury and the loss of such inputs, locomotor function can sometimes be regained without the regrowth of central connections. In the medicinal leech, &lt;i&gt;Hirudo verbana&lt;/i&gt;, we have shown that crawling reemerges after removal of descending inputs. Here, we studied the mechanisms underlying this return of locomotion by asking if central pattern generators (CPGs) in crawl-recovered leeches are sufficient to produce crawl-specific intersegmental coordination. From recovered animals, we treated isolated chains of ganglia with dopamine to activate the crawl CPGs (one crawl CPG per ganglion), and observed fictive crawl-like bursting in the dorsal-longitudinal-excitor motoneuron (DE-3); an established crawl-monitor neuron. However, these preparations did not exhibit crawl-specific coordination across the CPGs. Although the crawl CPGs always generated bi-directional activation of adjacent CPGs, we never observed crawl-appropriate intersegmental phase delays. Because central circuits alone were unable to organize crawl-specific coordination, we tested the coordinating role of the peripheral nervous system. In transected leeches normally destined for recovery, we removed afferent information to the anterior-most (lead) ganglion located below the nerve-cord transection site. In these dually treated animals, overt crawling was greatly delayed or prevented. After filling the peripheral nerves with Neurobiotin tracer distal to the nerve-root lesion, we found a perfect correlation between regrowth of peripheral neuronal fibers and crawl recovery. Our study establishes that during recovery after injury crawl-specific intersegmental coordination switches to a new dependency on afferent information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; In the field of motor control, a pressing issue to resolve is how the central and peripheral nervous system become retuned and work together to establish functional locomotor patterns after descending signals are chronically removed after injury. The work we have presented, in the medicinal leech, clarifies that central pattern generator (CPG) neural networks are highly plastic in their ability to incorporate different timing elements for their intersegmental coordination after descending-coordinating information is removed. Essentially, the crawl CPGs switch their dependence on descending-timing cues to those originating from proprioceptive neurons in the muscular body wall. Results from our experimentally tractable preparation may provide a platform to guide future studies of locomotor recovery in vertebrate animals after spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>How can blood rapidly and precisely reach active neurons at a given time and location has remained enigmatic for a long time. A 2003 paper by Zonta et al. suggested key roles for astrocytes in the signaling between neurons and blood vessels. While a consensus on the specific intermediary roles of astrocytes in this process is still evolving, research in the past 15 years has led to a deeper and more refined understanding of the neuro-glio-vascular unit.</description>

	<description>In 1983 Libet et al. demonstrated that brain activity associated with a voluntary act precedes conscious experience of the intention to act by several hundred milliseconds. The implication that it is the brain, rather than ‘free will’, that initiates voluntary acts has been discussed ever since by philosophers and lawyers, as well as by scientists. We show here how Libet’s original study gave rise to an entire research field of experimental investigations of volition.</description>

	<description>The past decade has yielded substantial evidence that the gut microbiome modulates brain function, including for instance behaviors relevant to anxiety and depression, pointing to a need to identify the biological pathways involved. In 2013 Clarke and colleagues reported that the early-life microbiome regulates the hippocampal serotonergic system in a sex-dependent manner, findings that opened up numerous lines of inquiry on the effects of the microbiome on neurodevelopment and behavior.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Spreading of Tau Pathology in Sporadic Alzheimer’s Disease Along Cortico-cortical Top-Down Connections</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;By using AT8-immunocytochemistry that visualizes hyperphosphorylated tau protein, we examined neurofibrillary changes related to sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 40 individuals at neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stages I–IV. We report the presence of abnormal tau changes within solitary pyramidal neurons in layers III and V of the neocortex. These pyramidal cells showed pathology in different cell compartments (dendritic, somatic, axonal) that appeared to occur sequentially: Tau pathology was seen in distal segments of the basal dendrites, then in proximal dendrites, the soma, and, finally, in the axon of affected neurons. These findings are remarkable in that they point to the existence of neurofibrillary changes in regions routinely associated with later NFT stages. In addition, they lend support to the idea that it may be the axons of cortico-cortical top-down neurons in neocortical fields involved in AD that carry and spread abnormal tau seeds in a focused manner (transsynaptically) into the distal dendritic segments of nerve cells following directly in the neuronal chain, thereby sustaining further tau-seeded templating.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Parvalbumin Interneurons Shape Neuronal Vulnerability in Blunt TBI</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Excessive excitation has been hypothesized to subsume a significant part of the acute damage occurring after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, reduced neuronal excitability, loss of neuronal firing, and a disturbed excitation/inhibition balance have been detected. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are major regulators of perisomatic inhibition, principal neurons firing, and overall cortical excitability. However, their role in acute TBI pathogenic cascades is unclear. We exploited the chemogenetic Pharmacologically Selective Activation Module and Pharmacologically Selective Effector Module control of PV-Cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and the Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADD) control of principal neurons in a blunt model of TBI to explore the role of inhibition in shaping neuronal vulnerability to TBI. We demonstrated that inactivation of PV interneurons at the instance or soon after trauma enhances survival of principal neurons and reduces gliosis at 7 dpi whereas, activation of PV interneurons decreased neuronal survival. The protective effect of PV inactivation was suppressed by expressing the nuclear calcium buffer PV-nuclear localisation sequence in principal neurons, implying an activity-dependent neuroprotective signal. In fact, protective effects were obtained by increasing the excitability of principal neurons directly using DREADDs. Thus, we show that sustaining neuronal excitation in the early phases of TBI may reduce neuronal vulnerability by increasing activity-dependent survival, while excess activation of perisomatic inhibition is detrimental to neuronal integrity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Computation predicts rapidly adapting mechanotransduction currents cannot account for tactile encoding in Merkel cell-neurite complexes</title>

Distinct firing properties among touch receptors are influenced by multiple, interworking anatomical structures. Our understanding of the functions and crosstalk of Merkel cells and their associated neurites—the end organs of slowly adapting type I (SAI) afferents—remains incomplete. Piezo2 mechanically activated channels are required both in Merkel cells and in sensory neurons for canonical SAI responses in rodents; however, a central unanswered question is how rapidly inactivating currents give rise to sustained action potential volleys in SAI afferents. The computational model herein synthesizes mechanotransduction currents originating from Merkel cells and neurites, in context of skin mechanics and neural dynamics. Its goal is to mimic distinct spike firing patterns from wildtype animals, as well as &lt;i&gt;Atoh1&lt;/i&gt; knockout animals that completely lack Merkel cells. The developed generator function includes a Merkel cell mechanism that represents its mechanotransduction currents and downstream voltage-activated conductances (slower decay of current) and a neurite mechanism that represents its mechanotransduction currents (faster decay of current). To mimic sustained firing in wildtype animals, a longer time constant was needed than the 200 ms observed for mechanically activated membrane depolarizations in rodent Merkel cells. One mechanism that suffices is to introduce an ultra-slowly inactivating current, with a time constant on the order of 1.7 s. This mechanism may drive the slow adaptation of the sustained response, for which the skin’s viscoelastic relaxation cannot account. Positioned within the sensory neuron, this source of current reconciles the physiology and anatomical characteristics of &lt;i&gt;Atoh1&lt;/i&gt; knockout animals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AN0hi7HylwE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Two critical positions in zinc finger domains are heavily mutated in three human cancer types</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Munro, Dario Ghersi, Mona Singh&lt;/p&gt;

A major goal of cancer genomics is to identify somatic mutations that play a role in tumor initiation or progression. Somatic mutations within transcription factors are of particular interest, as gene expression dysregulation is widespread in cancers. The substantial gene expression variation evident across tumors suggests that numerous regulatory factors are likely to be involved and that somatic mutations within them may not occur at high frequencies across patient cohorts, thereby complicating efforts to uncover which ones are cancer-relevant. Here we analyze somatic mutations within the largest family of human transcription factors, namely those that bind DNA via Cys2His2 zinc finger domains. Specifically, to hone in on important mutations within these genes, we aggregated somatic mutations across all of them by their positions within Cys2His2 zinc finger domains. Remarkably, we found that for three classes of cancers profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)—Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma, Colon and Rectal Adenocarcinomas, and Skin Cutaneous Melanoma—two specific, functionally important positions within zinc finger domains are mutated significantly more often than expected by chance, with alterations in 18%, 10% and 43% of tumors, respectively. Numerous zinc finger genes are affected, with those containing Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) repressor domains preferentially targeted by these mutations. Further, the genes with these mutations also have high overall missense mutation rates, are expressed at levels comparable to those of known cancer genes, and together have biological process annotations that are consistent with roles in cancers. Altogether, we introduce evidence broadly implicating mutations within a diverse set of zinc finger proteins as relevant for cancer, and propose that they contribute to the widespread transcriptional dysregulation observed in cancer cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ei87dOiwXCQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: An Autonomic Network: Synchrony Between Slow Rhythms of Pulse and Brain Resting State Is Associated with Personality and Emotions</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The sympathetic system’s role in modulating vasculature and its influence on emotions and personality led us to test the hypothesis that interactions between brain resting-state networks (RSNs) and pulse amplitude (indexing sympathetic activity) would be associated with emotions and personality. In 203 participants, we characterized RSN spatiotemporal characteristics, and phase–amplitude associations of RSN fluctuations with pulse and respiratory recordings. We found that RSNs are spatially reproducible within participants and were temporally associated with low frequencies (LFs &amp;lt; 0.1 Hz) in physiological signals. LF fluctuations in pulse amplitude were not related to cardiac electrical activity and preceded LF fluctuations in RSNs, while LF respiratory amplitude fluctuations followed LF fluctuations in RSNs. LF phase dispersion (PD) (lack of synchrony) between RSNs and pulse (PD&lt;sub&gt;pulse&lt;/sub&gt;) (not respiratory) correlated with the common variability in measures of personality and emotions, with more synchrony being associated with more positive temperamental characteristics. Voxel-level PD&lt;sub&gt;pulse&lt;/sub&gt; mapping revealed an “autonomic brain network,” including sensory cortices and dorsal attention stream, with significant interactions with peripheral signals. Here, we uncover associations between pulse signal amplitude (presumably of sympathetic origin) and brain resting state, suggesting that interactions between central and autonomic nervous systems are important for characterizing personality and emotions.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>A reductively mechanistic approach to neuroscience suggests that low-level physical laws determine our actions and that mental states are epiphenomena. In this scheme there seems to be little room for free will or genuine agency. I argue here that physical indeterminacy provides room for the information entailed in patterns of neuronal firing – the mental content of beliefs, goals, and intentions – to have real causal power in decision-making.</description>

	<description>Bhattacharya et al. show that the NMDA receptor GluN2C subunit is preferentially incorporated into triheteromeric GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2C receptors in cerebellar granule cells. Triheteromeric GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2C receptors have single-channel properties that cannot be predicted from the composite subunits.</description>

	<title>Neuron: Mettl14 Is Essential for Epitranscriptomic Regulation of Striatal Function and Learning</title>

	<description>Koranda et al. demonstrate Mettl14 is indispensable for m6A mRNA methylation in the adult mammalian brain. Striatal Mettl14 deficiency decreases m6A tagging, altering the epitranscriptome profile. Mettl14 deficiency impairs behavior and alters intrinsic neuronal firing in the absence of morphological changes.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Thalamocortical and intracortical laminar connectivity determines sleep spindle properties</title>

Sleep spindles are brief oscillatory events during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Spindle density and synchronization properties are different in MEG versus EEG recordings in humans and also vary with learning performance, suggesting spindle involvement in memory consolidation. Here, using computational models, we identified network mechanisms that may explain differences in spindle properties across cortical structures. First, we report that differences in spindle occurrence between MEG and EEG data may arise from the contrasting properties of the core and matrix thalamocortical systems. The matrix system, projecting superficially, has wider thalamocortical fanout compared to the core system, which projects to middle layers, and requires the recruitment of a larger population of neurons to initiate a spindle. This property was sufficient to explain lower spindle density and higher spatial synchrony of spindles in the superficial cortical layers, as observed in the EEG signal. In contrast, spindles in the core system occurred more frequently but less synchronously, as observed in the MEG recordings. Furthermore, consistent with human recordings, in the model, spindles occurred independently in the core system but the matrix system spindles commonly co-occurred with core spindles. We also found that the intracortical excitatory connections from layer III/IV to layer V promote spindle propagation from the core to the matrix system, leading to widespread spindle activity. Our study predicts that plasticity of intra- and inter-cortical connectivity can potentially be a mechanism for increased spindle density as has been observed during learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n6XKqTbGe3g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

This paper presents a data analysis framework to uncover relationships between health conditions, age and sex for a large population of patients. We study a massive heterogeneous sample of 1.7 million patients in Brazil, containing 47 million of health records with detailed medical conditions for visits to medical facilities for a period of 17 months. The findings suggest that medical conditions can be grouped into clusters that share very distinctive densities in the ages of the patients. For each cluster, we further present the ICD-10 chapters within it. Finally, we relate the findings to comorbidity networks, uncovering the relation of the discovered clusters of age densities to comorbidity networks literature.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5diqBMl6Y-k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Using cutting edge in vivo monitoring approaches, Beas, Wright et al. identify a circuit by which stress disinhibits the midline thalamus through dopaminergic modulation arising from the locus coeruleus.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/fDlOcZpry44&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Neuronal proteostasis is maintained by the dynamic integration of different processes that regulate the synthesis, folding, quality control, and localization of proteins. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as a fundamental pillar of the proteostasis network, and is emerging as a key compartment to sustain normal brain function. The unfolded protein response (UPR), the main mechanism that copes with ER stress, plays a central role in the quality control of many ion channels and receptors, in addition to crosstalk with signaling pathways that regulate connectivity, synapse formation, and neuronal plasticity.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Theta Oscillations Index Frontal Decision-Making and Mediate Reciprocal Frontal–Parietal Interactions in Willed Attention</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy149</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Attention can be attracted reflexively by sensory signals, biased by learning or reward, or focused voluntarily based on momentary goals. When voluntary attention is focused by purely internal decision processes (will), rather than instructions via external cues, we call this “willed attention.” In prior work, we reported ERP and fMRI correlates of willed spatial attention in trial-by-trial cuing tasks. Here we further investigated the oscillatory mechanisms of willed attention by contrasting the event-related EEG spectrogram between instructional and choice cues. Two experiments were conducted at 2 different sites using the same visuospatial attention paradigm. Consistent between the 2 experiments, we found increases in frontal theta power (starting at ~500 ms post cue) for willed attention relative to instructed attention. This frontal theta increase was accompanied by increased frontal–parietal theta-band coherence and bidirectional Granger causality. Additionally, the onset of attention-related posterior alpha power lateralization was delayed in willed attention relative to instructed attention, and the amount of delay was related to the timing of frontal theta increase. These results, replicated across 2 experiments, suggest that theta oscillations are the neuronal signals indexing decision-making in the frontal cortex, and mediating reciprocal communications between the frontal executive and parietal attentional control regions during willed attention.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Studies of synapses are available for different brain regions of several animal species including non-human primates, but comparatively little is known about their quantitative morphology in humans. Here, synaptic boutons in Layer 5 (L5) of the human temporal lobe (TL) neocortex were investigated in biopsy tissue, using fine-scale electron microscopy, and quantitative three-dimensional reconstructions. The size and organization of the presynaptic active zones (PreAZs), postsynaptic densities (PSDs), and that of the 3 distinct pools of synaptic vesicles (SVs) were particularly analyzed. L5 synaptic boutons were medium-sized (~6 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) with a single but relatively large PreAZ (~0.3 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). They contained a total of ~1500 SVs/bouton, ~20 constituting the putative readily releasable pool (RRP), ~180 the recycling pool (RP), and the remainder, the resting pool. The PreAZs, PSDs, and vesicle pools are ~3-fold larger than those of CNS synapses in other species. Astrocytic processes reached the synaptic cleft and may regulate the glutamate concentration. Profound differences exist between synapses in human TL neocortex and those described in various species, particularly in the size and geometry of PreAZs and PSDs, the large RRP/RP, and the astrocytic ensheathment suggesting high synaptic efficacy, strength, and modulation of synaptic transmission at human synapses.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Human brain anatomical and resting-state functional connectivity have been comprehensively portrayed using MRI, which are termed anatomical and functional connectomes. A systematic examination of tasks modulated whole brain functional connectivity, which we term as task connectome, is still lacking. We analyzed 6 block-designed and 1 event-related designed functional MRI data, and examined whole-brain task modulated connectivity in various task domains, including emotion, reward, language, relation, social cognition, working memory, and inhibition. By using psychophysiological interaction between pairs of regions from the whole brain, we identified statistically significant task modulated connectivity in 4 tasks between their experimental and respective control conditions. Task modulated connectivity was found not only between regions that were activated during the task but also regions that were not activated or deactivated, suggesting a broader involvement of brain regions in a task than indicated by simple regional activations. Decreased functional connectivity was observed in all the 4 tasks and sometimes reduced connectivity was even between regions that were both activated during the task. This suggests that brain regions that are activated together do not necessarily work together. The current study demonstrates the comprehensive task connectomes of 4 tasks, and suggested complex relationships between regional activations and connectivity changes.&lt;/span&gt;</description>
