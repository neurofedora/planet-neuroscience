	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: AZATAX: Acetazolamide safety and efficacy in cerebellar syndrome in PMM2 congenital disorder of glycosylation (PMM2‐CDG)</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphomannomutase deficiency (PMM2 congenital disorder of glycosylation [PMM2‐CDG]) causes cerebellar syndrome and strokelike episodes (SLEs). SLEs are also described in patients with gain‐of‐function mutations in the CaV2.1 channel, for which acetazolamide therapy is suggested. Impairment in N‐glycosylation of CaV2.1 promotes gain‐of‐function effects and may participate in cerebellar syndrome in PMM2‐CDG. AZATAX was designed to establish whether acetazolamide is safe and improves cerebellar syndrome in PMM2‐CDG.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clinical trial included PMM2‐CDG patients, with a 6‐month first‐phase single acetazolamide therapy group, followed by a randomized 5‐week withdrawal phase. Safety was assessed. The primary outcome measure was improvement in the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). Other measures were the Nijmegen Pediatric CDG Rating Scale (NPCRS), a syllable repetition test (PATA test), and cognitive scores.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty‐four patients (mean age = 12.3 ± 4.5 years) were included, showing no serious adverse events. Thirteen patients required dose adjustment due to low bicarbonate or asthenia. There were improvements on ICARS (34.9 ± 23.2 vs 40.7 ± 24.8, effect size = 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.0–7.6, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), detected at 6 weeks in 18 patients among the 20 responders, on NPCRS (95% CI = 0.3–1.6, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.013) and on the PATA test (95% CI = 0.5–3.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006). Acetazolamide improved prothrombin time, factor X, and antithrombin. Clinical severity, epilepsy, and lipodystrophy predicted greater response. The randomized withdrawal phase showed ICARS worsening in the withdrawal group (effect size = 1.46, 95% CI = 2.65–7.52, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AZATAX is the first clinical trial of PMM2‐CDG. Acetazolamide is well tolerated and effective for motor cerebellar syndrome. Its ability to prevent SLEs and its long‐term effects on kidney function should be addressed in future studies. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Metabolic patterns across core features in dementia with lewy bodies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25453?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25453?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify brain regions whose metabolic impairment contributes to dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) clinical core features expression and to assess the influence of severity of global cognitive impairment on the DLB hypometabolic pattern.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and information on core features were available in 171 patients belonging to the imaging repository of the European DLB Consortium. Principal component analysis was applied to identify brain regions relevant to the local data variance. A linear regression model was applied to generate core‐feature–specific patterns controlling for the main confounding variables (Mini‐Mental State Examination [MMSE], age, education, gender, and center). Regression analysis to the locally normalized intensities was performed to generate an MMSE‐sensitive map.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinsonism negatively covaried with bilateral parietal, precuneus, and anterior cingulate metabolism; visual hallucinations (VH) with bilateral dorsolateral–frontal cortex, posterior cingulate, and parietal metabolism; and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) with bilateral parieto‐occipital cortex, precuneus, and ventrolateral–frontal metabolism. VH and RBD shared a positive covariance with metabolism in the medial temporal lobe, cerebellum, brainstem, basal ganglia, thalami, and orbitofrontal and sensorimotor cortex. Cognitive fluctuations negatively covaried with occipital metabolism and positively with parietal lobe metabolism. MMSE positively covaried with metabolism in the left superior frontal gyrus, bilateral–parietal cortex, and left precuneus, and negatively with metabolism in the insula, medial frontal gyrus, hippocampus in the left hemisphere, and right cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regions of more preserved metabolism are relatively consistent across the variegate DLB spectrum. By contrast, core features were associated with more prominent hypometabolism in specific regions, thus suggesting a close clinical–imaging correlation, reflecting the interplay between topography of neurodegeneration and clinical presentation in DLB patients.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Quantum entanglement in physical and cognitive systems: a conceptual analysis and a general representation. (arXiv:1903.09103v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09103</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09103</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We provide a general description of the phenomenon of entanglement in
bipartite systems, as it manifests in micro and macro physical systems, as well
as in human cognitive processes. We do so by observing that when genuine
coincidence measurements are considered, the violation of the 'marginal laws',
in addition to the Bell-CHSH inequality, is also to be expected. The situation
can be described in the quantum formalism by considering the presence of
entanglement not only at the level of the states, but also at the level of the
measurements. However, at the &quot;local'&quot; level of a specific joint measurement, a
description where entanglement is only incorporated in the state remains always
possible, by adopting a fine-tuned tensor product representation. But
contextual tensor product representations should only be considered when there
are good reasons to describe the outcome-states as (non-entangled) product
states. This will not in general be true, hence, the entangement resource will
have to generally be allocated both in the states and in the measurements. In
view of the numerous violations of the marginal laws observed in physics'
laboratories, it remains unclear to date if entanglement in micro-physical
systems is to be understood only as an 'entanglement of the states', or also as
an 'entanglement of the measurements'. But even if measurements would also be
entangled, the corresponding violation of the marginal laws (no-signaling
conditions) would not for this imply that a superluminal communication would be
possible.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Classification of EEG-Based Brain Connectivity Networks in Schizophrenia Using a Multi-Domain Connectome Convolutional Neural Network. (arXiv:1903.08858v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08858</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08858</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We exploit altered patterns in brain functional connectivity as features for
automatic discriminative analysis of neuropsychiatric patients. Deep learning
methods have been introduced to functional network classification only very
recently for fMRI, and the proposed architectures essentially focused on a
single type of connectivity measure. We propose a deep convolutional neural
network (CNN) framework for classification of electroencephalogram
(EEG)-derived brain connectome in schizophrenia (SZ). To capture complementary
aspects of disrupted connectivity in SZ, we explore combination of various
connectivity features consisting of time and frequency-domain metrics of
effective connectivity based on vector autoregressive model and partial
directed coherence, and complex network measures of network topology. We design
a novel multi-domain connectome CNN (MDC-CNN) based on a parallel ensemble of
1D and 2D CNNs to integrate the features from various domains and dimensions
using different fusion strategies. Hierarchical latent representations learned
by the multiple convolutional layers from EEG connectivity reveal apparent
group differences between SZ and healthy controls (HC). Results on a large
resting-state EEG dataset show that the proposed CNNs significantly outperform
traditional support vector machine classifiers. The MDC-CNN with combined
connectivity features further improves performance over single-domain CNNs
using individual features, achieving remarkable accuracy of $93.06\%$ with a
decision-level fusion. The proposed MDC-CNN by integrating information from
diverse brain connectivity descriptors is able to accurately discriminate SZ
from HC. The new framework is potentially useful for developing diagnostic
tools for SZ and other disorders.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Syncrip/hnRNPQ is required for activity-induced Msp300/Nesprin-1 expression and new synapse formation</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/585679v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Memory and learning involve activity-driven expression of proteins and cytoskeletal reorganisation at new synapses, often requiring post-transcriptional regulation a long distance from corresponding nuclei. A key factor expressed early in synapse formation is Msp300/Nesprin-1, which organises actin filaments around the new synapse. How Msp300 expression is regulated during synaptic plasticity is not yet known. Here, we show that the local translation of msp300 is promoted during activity-dependent plasticity by the conserved RNA binding protein Syncrip/hnRNP Q, which binds to msp300 transcripts and is essential for plasticity. Single molecule imaging shows that Syncrip is associated in vivo with msp300 mRNA in ribosome-rich particles. Elevated neural activity alters the dynamics of Syncrip RNP granules at the synapse, suggesting a change in particle composition or binding that facilitates translation. These results introduce Syncrip as an important early-acting activity-dependent translational regulator of a plasticity gene that is strongly associated with human ataxias.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: ChIPulate: A comprehensive ChIP-seq simulation pipeline</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Vishaka Datta, Sridhar Hannenhalli, Rahul Siddharthan&lt;/p&gt;

ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) is a high-throughput technique to identify genomic regions that are bound &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by a particular protein, e.g., a transcription factor (TF). Biological factors, such as chromatin state, indirect and cooperative binding, as well as experimental factors, such as antibody quality, cross-linking, and PCR biases, are known to affect the outcome of ChIP-seq experiments. However, the relative impact of these factors on inferences made from ChIP-seq data is not entirely clear. Here, via a detailed ChIP-seq simulation pipeline, ChIPulate, we assess the impact of various biological and experimental sources of variation on several outcomes of a ChIP-seq experiment, viz., the recoverability of the TF binding motif, accuracy of TF-DNA binding detection, the sensitivity of inferred TF-DNA binding strength, and number of replicates needed to confidently infer binding strength. We find that the TF motif can be recovered despite poor and non-uniform extraction and PCR amplification efficiencies. The recovery of the motif is, however, affected to a larger extent by the fraction of sites that are either cooperatively or indirectly bound. Importantly, our simulations reveal that the number of ChIP-seq replicates needed to accurately measure &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; occupancy at high-affinity sites is larger than the recommended community standards. Our results establish statistical limits on the accuracy of inferences of protein-DNA binding from ChIP-seq and suggest that increasing the mean extraction efficiency, rather than amplification efficiency, would better improve sensitivity. The source code and instructions for running ChIPulate can be found at https://github.com/vishakad/chipulate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lVS1HwZ6VPM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Contrasting the effects of adaptation and synaptic filtering on the timescales of dynamics in recurrent networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006893</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/IrWlAfZyY2k/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Manuel Beiran, Srdjan Ostojic&lt;/p&gt;

Neural activity in awake behaving animals exhibits a vast range of timescales that can be several fold larger than the membrane time constant of individual neurons. Two types of mechanisms have been proposed to explain this conundrum. One possibility is that large timescales are generated by a network mechanism based on positive feedback, but this hypothesis requires fine-tuning of the strength or structure of the synaptic connections. A second possibility is that large timescales in the neural dynamics are inherited from large timescales of underlying biophysical processes, two prominent candidates being intrinsic adaptive ionic currents and synaptic transmission. How the timescales of adaptation or synaptic transmission influence the timescale of the network dynamics has however not been fully explored. To address this question, here we analyze large networks of randomly connected excitatory and inhibitory units with additional degrees of freedom that correspond to adaptation or synaptic filtering. We determine the fixed points of the systems, their stability to perturbations and the corresponding dynamical timescales. Furthermore, we apply dynamical mean field theory to study the temporal statistics of the activity in the fluctuating regime, and examine how the adaptation and synaptic timescales transfer from individual units to the whole population. Our overarching finding is that synaptic filtering and adaptation in single neurons have very different effects at the network level. Unexpectedly, the macroscopic network dynamics do not inherit the large timescale present in adaptive currents. In contrast, the timescales of network activity increase proportionally to the time constant of the synaptic filter. Altogether, our study demonstrates that the timescales of different biophysical processes have different effects on the network level, so that the slow processes within individual neurons do not necessarily induce slow activity in large recurrent neural networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IrWlAfZyY2k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Early Detection of Mental Stress Using Advanced Neuroimaging and Artificial Intelligence. (arXiv:1903.08511v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08511</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While different neuroimaging modalities have been proposed to detect mental
stress, each modality experiences certain limitations. This study proposed
novel approaches to detect stress based on fusion of EEG and fNIRS signals in
the feature-level using joint independent component analysis (jICA) and
canonical correlation analysis method (CCA) and predected the level of stress
using machine-learning approach. The jICA and CCA were then developed to
combine the features to detect mental stress. The jICA fusion scheme discovers
relationships between modalities by utilizing ICA to identify sources from each
modality that modulate in the same way across subjects. The CCA fuse
information from two sets of features to discover the associations across
modalities and to ultimately estimate the sources responsible for these
associations. The study further explored the functional connectivity (FC) and
evaluated the performance of the fusion methods based on their classification
performance and compared it with the result obtained by each individual
modality. The jICA fusion technique significantly improved the classification
accuracy, sensitivity and specificity on average by +3.46% compared to the EEG
and +11.13% compared to the fNIRS. Similarly, CCA method improved the
classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity on average by +8.56%
compared to the EEG and +13.03% compared to the fNIRS, respectively. The
overall performance of the proposed fusion methods significantly improved the
detection rate of mental stress, p&amp;lt;0.05. The FC significantly reduced under
stress and suggested EEG and fNIRS as a potential biomarker of stress.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Simultaneous recordings from many neurons hide important information and the
connections characterizing the network remain generally undiscovered despite
the progresses of statistical and machine learning techniques. Discerning the
presence of direct links between neuron from data is still a not completely
solved problem. To enlarge the number of tools for detecting the underlying
network structure, we propose here the use of copulas, pursuing on a research
direction we started in [1]. Here, we adapt their use to distinguish different
types of connections on a very simple network. Our proposal consists in
choosing suitable random intervals in pairs of spike trains determining the
shapes of their copulas. We show that this approach allows to detect different
types of dependencies. We illustrate the features of the proposed method on
synthetic data from suitably connected networks of two or three formal neurons
directly connected or influenced by the surrounding network. We show how a
smart choice of pairs of random times together with the use of empirical
copulas allows to discern between direct and un-direct interactions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: An increase in membrane cholesterol by graphene oxide disrupts calcium homeostasis in primary astrocytes. (arXiv:1903.08447v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The use of graphene nanomaterials (GNMs) for biomedical applications targeted
to the central nervous system is exponentially increasing, although precise
information on their effects on brain cells is lacking. In this work, we
addressed the molecular changes induced in cortical astrocytes by few-layer
graphene (FLG) and graphene oxide (GO) flakes. Our results show that exposure
to FLG/GO does not affect cell viability or proliferation. However, proteomic
and lipidomic analyses unveiled alterations in several cellular processes,
including intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) homeostasis and cholesterol metabolism,
which were particularly intense in cells exposed to GO. Indeed, GO exposure
impaired spontaneous and evoked astrocyte [Ca2+]i signals and induced a marked
increase in membrane cholesterol levels. Importantly, cholesterol depletion
fully rescued [Ca2+]i dynamics in GO-treated cells, indicating a causal
relationship between these GO-mediated effects. Our results indicate that
exposure to GNMs alters intracellular signaling in astrocytes and may impact on
astrocyte-neuron interactions.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The scientific community has witnessed an exponential increase in the
applications of graphene and graphene-based materials in a wide range of
fields. For what concerns neuroscience, the interest raised by these materials
is two-fold. On one side, nanosheets made of graphene or graphene derivatives
(graphene oxide, or its reduced form) can be used as carriers for drug
delivery. Here, an important aspect is to evaluate their toxicity, which
strongly depends on flake composition, chemical functionalization and
dimensions. On the other side, graphene can be exploited as a substrate for
tissue engineering. In this case, conductivity is probably the most relevant
amongst the various properties of the different graphene materials, as it may
allow to instruct and interrogate neural networks, as well as to drive neural
growth and differentiation. In this review, we try to give a comprehensive view
of the accomplishments and new challenges of the field, as well as which in our
view are the most exciting directions to take in the immediate future. These
include the need to engineer multifunctional nanoparticles able to cross the
blood-brain-barrier to reach neural cells, and to achieve on-demand delivery of
specific drugs. We describe the state-of-the-art in the use of graphene
materials to engineer three-dimensional scaffolds to drive neuronal growth and
regeneration in vivo, and the possibility of using graphene as a component of
hybrid composites/multi-layer organic electronics devices. Last but not least,
we address the need of an accurate theoretical modeling of the interface
between graphene and biological material, by modeling the interaction of
graphene with proteins and cell membranes at the nanoscale, and describing the
physical mechanism(s) of charge transfer by which the various graphene
materials can influence the excitability and physiology of neural cells.

	<description>Risk for Atrial Fibrillation (AF), the most common human arrhythmia, has a major genetic component. The T-box transcription factor TBX5 influences human AF risk, and adult-specific &lt;i&gt;Tbx5&lt;/i&gt;-mutant mice demonstrate spontaneous AF. We report that TBX5 is critical for cellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis, providing a molecular mechanism underlying the genetic implication of TBX5 in AF. We show that cardiomyocyte action potential (AP) abnormalities in &lt;i&gt;Tbx5&lt;/i&gt;-deficient atrial cardiomyocytes are caused by a decreased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase (SERCA2)-mediated SR calcium uptake which was balanced by enhanced trans-sarcolemmal calcium fluxes (calcium current and sodium/calcium exchanger), providing mechanisms for triggered activity. The AP defects, cardiomyocyte ectopy, and AF caused by TBX5 deficiency were rescued by phospholamban removal, which normalized SERCA function. These results directly link transcriptional control of SERCA2 activity, depressed SR Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sequestration, enhanced trans-sarcolemmal calcium fluxes, and AF, establishing a mechanism underlying the genetic basis for a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent pathway for AF risk.</description>

	<description>Small open reading frames (smORFs) encoding ‘micropeptides’ exhibit remarkable evolutionary complexity. Conserved peptides encoded by &lt;i&gt;mille-pattes (mlpt)/polished rice (pri)/tarsal less (tal)&lt;/i&gt; are essential for embryo segmentation in &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt; but, in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, function in terminal epidermal differentiation and patterning of adult legs. Here, we show that a molecular complex identified in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; epidermal differentiation, comprising Mlpt peptides, ubiquitin-ligase Ubr3 and transcription factor Shavenbaby (Svb), represents an ancient developmental module required for early insect embryo patterning. We find that loss of segmentation function for this module in flies evolved concomitantly with restriction of Svb expression in early &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryos. Consistent with this observation, artificially restoring early Svb expression in flies causes segmentation defects that depend on &lt;i&gt;mlpt&lt;/i&gt; function, demonstrating enduring potency of an ancestral developmental switch despite evolving embryonic patterning modes. These results highlight the evolutionary plasticity of conserved molecular complexes under the constraints of essential genetic networks.</description>

	<description>Several recent papers have reported strong signals of selection on European polygenic height scores. These analyses used height effect estimates from the GIANT consortium and replication studies. Here, we describe a new analysis based on the the UK Biobank (UKB), a large, independent dataset. We find that the signals of selection using UKB effect estimates are strongly attenuated or absent. We also provide evidence that previous analyses were confounded by population stratification. Therefore, the conclusion of strong polygenic adaptation now lacks support. Moreover, these discrepancies highlight (1) that methods for correcting for population stratification in GWAS may not always be sufficient for polygenic trait analyses, and (2) that claims of differences in polygenic scores between populations should be treated with caution until these issues are better understood.</description>

	<description>Genetic predictions of height differ among human populations and these differences have been interpreted as evidence of polygenic adaptation. These differences were first detected using SNPs genome-wide significantly associated with height, and shown to grow stronger when large numbers of sub-significant SNPs were included, leading to excitement about the prospect of analyzing large fractions of the genome to detect polygenic adaptation for multiple traits. Previous studies of height have been based on SNP effect size measurements in the GIANT Consortium meta-analysis. Here we repeat the analyses in the UK Biobank, a much more homogeneously designed study. We show that polygenic adaptation signals based on large numbers of SNPs below genome-wide significance are extremely sensitive to biases due to uncorrected population stratification. More generally, our results imply that typical constructions of polygenic scores are sensitive to population stratification and that population-level differences should be interpreted with caution.</description>

	<description>The PF of the intralaminar thalamus is implicated in human neuropsychiatric disease. Mandelbaum et al. deconstruct the mouse PF using transcription, electrophysiological, and whole-brain anatomical analyses. They reveal organization of the PF that bridges molecular, cellular, and circuit levels, forming cortical-PF-cortical and cortical-PF-striatum circuit motifs. These findings reveal PF as a critical node that organizes limbic, associative, and somatosensory information in the basal ganglia.</description>

	<description>Epigenetic regulation of gene transcription plays a critical role in neural network development and in the etiology of Intellectual Disability (ID) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, little is known about the mechanisms by which epigenetic dysregulation leads to neural network defects. Kleefstra syndrome (KS), caused by mutation in the histone methyltransferase EHMT1, is a neurodevelopmental disorder with the clinical features of both ID and ASD. To study the impact of decreased EHMT1 function in human cells, we generated excitatory cortical neurons from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells derived from KS patients. In addition, we created an isogenic set by genetically editing healthy iPS cells. Characterization of the neurons at the single-cell and neuronal network level revealed consistent discriminative properties that distinguished EHMT1-mutant from wildtype neurons. Mutant neuronal networks exhibited network bursting with a reduced rate, longer duration, and increased temporal irregularity compared to control networks. We show that these changes were mediated by the upregulation of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) subunit 1 and correlate with reduced deposition of the repressive H3K9me2 mark, the catalytic product of EHMT1, at the GRIN1 promoter. Furthermore, we show that EHMT1 deficiency in mice leads to similar neuronal network impairments and increased NMDAR function. Finally, we could rescue the KS patient-derived neuronal network phenotypes by pharmacological inhibition of NMDARs. Together, our results demonstrate a direct link between EHMT1 deficiency in human neurons and NMDAR hyperfunction, providing the basis for a more targeted therapeutic approach to treating KS.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A Long Timescale Stimulus History Effect in the Primary Visual Cortex</title>

	<description>Responses of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) are often understood as encoding the current visual stimulus. Yet, some studies indicate that temporal contingency effects exist in the responses of neurons in early sensory areas. We explored if the recent stimulus history would alter the response of V1 layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in head-fixed awake mice during presentation of sequences of complex images. The activity of individual neurons was sparse, such that either one or none of the images in the sequence typically yielded a strong response. We then substituted an image preceding this primary image in order to determine if responses to the primary image were affected. We found that the amplitude of the neuron's response could be significantly altered by substitutions up to five images back from the primary image, even when the substituted image elicited virtually no response by itself. This stimulus history effect was heterogeneous across the population, with some cells showing facilitation and others suppression. For individual cells, the history effect was robust and reproducible across days. Our data show that responses of V1 neurons not only reflect the current stimulus but also encode, through their response amplitude, information about multiple images previously presented as far as 1000 msec in the past. This might enable V1 to retain information about the extended trajectory of past stimuli and perform complex temporal computations that are as of yet not appreciated.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Beta secretase 1-dependent amyloid precursor protein processing promotes excessive vascular sprouting through NOTCH3 signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/585489v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Amyloid beta peptides (A{beta}) proteins play a key role in vascular pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) including impairment of the blood brain barrier and aberrant angiogenesis. Although previous work has demonstrated a pro-angiogenic role of A{beta}, the exact mechanisms by which amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and endothelial angiogenic signalling cascades interact in AD remain a largely unsolved problem. Here, we report that increased endothelial sprouting in human-APP transgenic mouse (TgCRND8) tissue is dependent on {beta}-secretase (BACE1) processing of APP. Higher levels of A{beta} processing in TgCRND8 tissue coincides with decreased NOTCH3/JAG1 signalling, over-production of endothelial filopodia and increased numbers of vascular pericytes. Using a novel in vitro approach to study sprouting angiogenesis in TgCRND8 organotypic brain slice cultures (OBSCs), we find that BACE1 inhibition normalises excessive endothelial filopodia formation and restores NOTCH3 signalling. These data present the first evidence for the potential of BACE1 inhibition as an effective therapeutic target for aberrant angiogenesis in AD.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Relationship between cardiac cycle and the timing of actions during action execution and observation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/585414v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/585414v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Previous research suggests that there may be a relationship between the timing of motor events and phases of the cardiac cycle. However, this relationship has thus far only been researched using simple isolated movements such as key-presses in reaction-time tasks and only in a single subject acting alone. Here, we investigated how the cardiac cycle relates to ongoing self-paced movements in both action execution and observation using a novel dyadic paradigm. We recorded electrocardiography (ECG) in 26 subjects who formed 13 dyads containing an action executioner and observer as they performed a self-paced sequence of movements. We demonstrated that heartbeats are timed to movements during both action execution and observation. Specifically, movements were more likely to culminate between heartbeats than simultaneously with the heartbeat. The same pattern was observed for action observation, with the observer's heartbeats occurring off-phase with movement culmination. These findings demonstrate that there is synchronicity between an action executioner's cardiac cycle and the timing of their movements, and that the same relationship is mirrored in an observer. This suggests that interpersonal synchronicity may be caused by the mirroring of a phasic relationship between movement and the heart.</description>

	<description>The ability to infer how confident other people are in their decisions is crucial for regulating social interactions. It is unclear whether one can read others' confidence in absence of verbal communication and whether one can infer it as accurately as for one's own confidence. To address these questions, we used an auditory task in which participants had to guess the confidence of someone else performing the task or to judge their own confidence in different conditions (i.e., while performing the task themselves or while watching themselves performing the task on a pre-recorded video). Results show that participants are able to guess the confidence of other people as accurately as when judging their own. Crucially, we show that hetero-metacognition is a flexible mechanism relying on different cues according to the context. Our results support the idea that metacognition leverages the same inference mechanisms as involved in theory of mind.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The principle of inverse effectiveness in audiovisual speech perception</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/585182v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/585182v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We assessed how synchronous speech listening and lip reading affects speech recognition in acoustic noise. In simple audiovisual perceptual tasks, inverse effectiveness is often observed, which holds that the weaker the unimodal stimuli, or the poorer their signal-to-noise ratio, the stronger the audiovisual benefit. So far, however, inverse effectiveness has not been demonstrated for complex audiovisual speech stimuli. Here we assess whether this multisensory integration effect can also be observed for the recognizability of spoken words. To that end, we presented audiovisual sentences to 18 native-Dutch normal-hearing participants, who had to identify the spoken words from a finite list. Speech-recognition performance was determined for auditory-only, visual-only (lipreading) and auditory-visual conditions. To modulate acoustic task difficulty, we systematically varied the auditory signal-to-noise ratio. In line with a commonly-observed multisensory enhancement on speech recognition, audiovisual words were more easily recognized than auditory-only words (recognition thresholds of -15 dB and -12 dB, respectively). We here show that the difficulty of recognizing a particular word, either acoustically or visually, determines the occurrence of inverse effectiveness in audiovisual word integration. Thus, words that are better heard or recognized through lipreading, benefit less from bimodal presentation. Audiovisual performance at the lowest acoustic signal-to-noise ratios (45%) fell below the visual recognition rates (60%), reflecting an actual deterioration of lipreading in the presence of excessive acoustic noise. This suggests that the brain may adopt a strategy in which attention has to be divided between listening and lip reading.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: EEG-fMRI reveals rapid representation of personal relevance of faces in social cognition and reward-related brain regions</title>

	<description>Faces are a primary source of social information, but little is known about the sequence of neural processes that extract information from highly personally relevant faces, such as those of our loved ones. We applied representational similarity analyses to EEG-fMRI measurement of neural responses to faces of personal relevance to participants - their romantic partner and a friend - compared to a stranger. Faces expressed fear, happiness or no emotion. Shared EEG-fMRI representations started 100ms after stimulus onset not only in visual cortex, but also regions involved in social cognition, value representation and autobiographical memory, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction and posterior cingulate. Representations in fusiform gyrus, amygdala, insular cortex and N. accumbens were evident after 200 ms. Representations related to romantic love emerged after 400ms in subcortical brain regions associated with reward. The results point to the prioritized processing of personal relevance with rapid and extensive cortical representation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Modeling mechanisms of tremor reduction for essential tremor using symmetric biphasic DBS</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/585117v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/585117v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder, in which the primary symptom is a prominent, involuntary 4-10 Hz movement. For severe, medication refractory cases, deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) can be an effective treatment for cessation of tremor and is thought to work in part by disrupting tremor frequency oscillations (TFOs) in VIM. However, DBS is not universally effective and may be further disrupting cerebellar-mediated activity in the VIM. Here, we applied biophysically detailed computational modeling to investigate whether the efficacy of DBS is affected by the mechanism of generation of TFOs or by the pattern of stimulation. We simulated the effects of DBS using standard, asymmetric pulses as well as biphasic, symmetric pulses to understand biophysical mechanisms of how DBS disrupts TFOs generated either extrinsically or intrinsically. The model results suggested that the efficacy of DBS in the VIM is affected by the mechanism of generation of TFOs. Symmetric biphasic DBS reduced TFOs more than standard DBS in both networks, and these effects were stronger in the intrinsic network. For intrinsic tremor frequency activity, symmetric biphasic DBS was more effective at reducing TFOs. Simulated non-tremor signals were also transmitted during symmetric biphasic DBS, suggesting that this type of DBS may help to reduce side effects caused by disruption of the cerebellothalamocortical pathway. Biophysical details in the model provided a mechanistic interpretation of the cellular and network dynamics contributing to these effects that can be empirically tested in future studies.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Accelerated brain ageing and disability in multiple sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/584888v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/584888v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Brain atrophy occurs in both normal ageing and in multiple sclerosis (MS), but it occurs at a faster rate in MS, where it is the major driver of disability progression. Here, we employed a neuroimaging biomarker of structural brain ageing to explore how MS influences the brain ageing process. Methods: In a longitudinal, multi-centre sample of 3,565 MRI scans in 1,204 MS/clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) patients and 150 healthy controls (HCs) (mean follow-up time: patients 3.41 years, HCs 1.97 years) we measured brain-predicted age using T1-weighted MRI. Brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) was calculated as the difference between the brain-predicted age and chronological age. Positive brain-PAD indicates a brain appears older than its chronological age. We compared brain-PAD between MS/CIS patients and HCs, and between disease subtypes. In patients, the relationship between brain-PAD and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) at study entry and over time was explored. Findings: Adjusted for age, sex, intracranial volume, cohort and scanner effects MS/CIS patients had markedly older-appearing brains than HCs (mean brain-PAD 11.8 years [95% CI 9.1-14.5] versus -0.01 [-3.0-3.0], p&amp;lt;0.0001). All MS subtypes had greater brain-PAD scores than HCs, with the oldest-appearing brains in secondary-progressive MS (mean brain-PAD 18.0 years [15.4-20.5], p&amp;lt;0.05). At baseline, higher brain-PAD was associated with a higher EDSS, longer time since diagnosis and a younger age at diagnosis. Brain-PAD at study entry significantly predicted time-to-EDSS progression (hazard ratio 1.02 [1.01-1.03], p&amp;lt;0.0001): for every 5 years of additional brain-PAD, the risk of progression increased by 14.2%. Interpretation: MS increases brain ageing across all MS subtypes. An older-appearing brain at baseline was associated with more rapid disability progression, suggesting brain-age could be an individualised prognostic biomarker from a single, cross-sectional assessment.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The GABA-Glutamate supramammillary-dorsal Dentate Gyrus pathway controls theta and gamma oscillations in the DG during paradoxical sleep</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/584862v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/584862v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Several studies suggest that neurons from the lateral region of the SuM (SuML) innervating the dorsal dentate gyrus (DG) display a dual GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission and are specifically activated during paradoxical (REM) sleep (PS). The objective of the present study is to fully characterize the anatomical, neurochemical and electrophysiological properties of the SuML-DG projection neurons and to determine how they control DG oscillations and neuronal activation during PS and other vigilance states. For this purpose, we combine structural connectivity techniques using neurotropic viral vectors (rabies virus, AAV), neurochemical anatomy (immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization) and imaging (light, electron and confocal microscopy) with in vitro (patch clamp) and in vivo (LFP, EEG) optogenetic and electrophysiological recordings performed in transgenic VGLUT2-cre mice. At the cellular level, we show that the SuML-DG neurons co-releases GABA and glutamate on dentate granule cells and increase the activity of a subset of DG granule cells. At the network level, we show that the activation of the SuML-DG pathway increases theta power and frequency during PS as well as gamma power during PS and waking in the DG. At the behavioral level, we show that the activation of this pathway does not change animal behavior during PS, induces awakening during slow wave sleep and increases motor and exploratory activity during waking. These results suggest that the SuML-DG pathway is capable of supporting the increase of theta and gamma power in the DG observed during PS and plays an important modulatory role of DG network activity during this state.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Effects of healthy ageing on activation pattern within the brain during movement and motor imagery: an fMRI study.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/584813v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Introduction: Motor imagery (MI) has potential as an intervention to improve performance in neurological disease affecting the motor system and to modulate brain computer interfaces (BCI). We hypothesized that the shared networks of MI and executed movement (EM) would be affected by age. Understanding these changes is important in application of MI in neurological disorders. Methods: Using tensor-independent component analysis (TICA), we mapped the neural networks involved during MI and EM in 31 healthy volunteers (ages 20-72), who were recruited and screened for their ability to perform imagery. We used an fMRI block-design with MI &amp;amp; rest and EM &amp;amp; rest. Results: TICA defined 37 independent components (ICs). Eight remained after excluding ICs representing artifacts. These ICs accounted for 35% of variance. While all ICs had greater activation in EM than MI. Two ICs increased with greater age for EM only. These ICs contained a bilateral network of brain areas, including primary motor cortex and cerebellum. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the prominence of shared cerebral networks between MI and EM. There are age-dependent changes to EM activation, while MI activation appeared age independent. This strengthens the rationale for using MI to access the motor networks independent of age.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The role of feature-based attention in visual serial dependence</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/584789v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Perceptual decisions about current sensory input are biased towards input of the recent past - a phenomenon termed serial dependence. Serial dependence may serve to stabilize neural representations in the face of external and internal noise. However, it is unclear under which circumstances previous input attracts subsequent perceptual decisions, and thus, whether serial dependence reflects a broad smoothing or selective stabilization operation. Here, we investigated whether focusing attention on particular features of the previous stimulus modulates serial dependence. We found an attractive bias in orientation estimations when previous and current stimuli had similar orientations, and a repulsive bias when they had dissimilar orientations. The attractive bias was markedly reduced when observers attended to the size, rather than the orientation, of the previous stimulus. Conversely, the repulsive bias for stimuli with large orientation differences was not modulated by feature-based attention. This suggests separate sources of these positive and negative perceptual biases.</description>

	<description>Stroke is the leading cause of physical disability and the second leading cause of death in adults. Chemokines that regulate ischemic microenvironment can influence neurorestorative therapies in stroke patients. CXCL12 was shown to be neuroprotective, but there are some contradictory results in the literature. The objective of this work is to verify whether CXCL12 delivery to the brain could be beneficial or harmful. We decided to evaluate the intraventricular delivery to facilitate its application in clinical practice. Intraventricular CXCL12 was able to produce increased mRNA expression of the receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 in the cerebral cortex. After the stroke, intraventricular CXCL12 decreased mice ischemic area and improved behavioral response. We found CXCL12 was neuroprotective, increase reactive astrogliosis and improve neurogenesis in the perilesional area.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Leveraging non-human primate multisensory neurons and circuits in assessing consciousness theory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/584516v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Both the Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) and Integrated Information Theory (IIT) posit that highly complex and interconnected networks engender perceptual awareness. GNW specifies that activity recruiting fronto-parietal networks will elicit a subjective experience, while IIT is more concerned with the functional architecture of networks than with activity within it. Here, we argue that according to IIT mathematics, circuits converging on integrative vs. convergent yet non-integrative neurons should support a greater degree of consciousness. We test this hypothesis by analyzing a dataset of neuronal responses collected simultaneously from primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and ventral premotor cortex (vPM) in non-human primates presented with auditory, tactile, and audio-tactile stimuli as they are progressively anesthetized with Propofol. We first describe the multisensory (audio-tactile) characteristics of S1 and vPM neurons (mean and dispersion tendencies, as well as noise-correlations), and functionally label these neurons as convergent or integrative according to their spiking responses. Then, we characterize how these different pools of neurons behave as a function of consciousness. At odds with the IIT mathematics, results suggest that convergent neurons more readily exhibit properties of consciousness (neural complexity and noise correlation) and are more impacted during the loss of consciousness than integrative neurons. Lastly, we provide support for the GNW by showing that neural ignition (i.e., same trial co-activation of S1 and vPM) was more frequent in conscious than unconscious states. Overall, we contrast GNW and IIT within the same single-unit activity dataset, and support the GNW.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Visual area V4 encodes history dependent attentional effort and single-trial perceptual detection</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/584409v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Intense attentional effort improves performance. Neurons in visual area V4 exhibit changes in spike rates that are correlated with effort, selective attention and absolute reward expectation. How neuronal spikes in V4 encode attentional states and perceptual performance with reference to other task relevant motivational and decision signals is poorly understood. We recorded neuronal spikes from monkey visual area V4, and isolated attentional effort from reward expectancy and motor decisions in a visual orientation detection task using a statistical approach based on generalized linear models. We found that V4 spike responses exhibit hysteresis with reward changes. Single trial spiking activity encodes a combination of temporally overlapping sensory and cognitive signals. Neuronal spikes integrate contextual history of attentional effort on a longer time scale, and task related perceptual detection in a shorter timescale within a single trial. Notably, immediate reward expectation and behavioral choice probability are poor predictors of V4 spikes throughout the trial. Further, detection of task relevant perceptual signal is decoded from single trial population spikes with high accuracy. These results provide a detailed representation of perceptual and cognitive signals in V4 that are crucial for performance.</description>

	<description>Speech comprehension requires the ability to temporally segment the acoustic input for higher- level linguistic analysis. Oscillation-based approaches suggest that low-frequency auditory cortex oscillations track syllable-sized acoustic information and therefore emphazise the relevance of syllabic-level processing for speech segmentation. Most linguistic approaches, however, focus on mapping from acoustic-phonemic representations to the lexical level. How syllabic processing interacts with higher levels of speech processing, beyond segmentation, including the anatomical and neurophysiological characteristics of the networks involved, is debated. Here we investigate the effects of lexical processing and the interactions with syllable processing by examining MEG data recorded in a frequency-tagging paradigm. Participants listened to disyllabic words presented at a rate of 4 syllables/sec. Two hypotheses were evaluated: (i) lexical processing of words activates a 2 Hz network that interacts with syllable processing at 4 Hz; and (ii) syllable transitions contribute to word-level processing. We show that lexical content activated a left-lateralized frontal and superior and middle temporal network and increased the interaction between left middle temporal areas and auditory cortex at 2 Hz (phase-phase coupling). Mere syllable-transition information, in contrast, activated a bilateral superior-, middle temporal and inferior frontal network and increased the interaction between those areas at 2 Hz. Lexical and syllable processing interacted in superior, middle temporal, and inferior frontal areas (cross-frequency coupling), whereas syllable tracking decreased when lexical information was present. The data provide a new perspective on speech comprehension by demonstrating a contribution of an acoustic-syllabic to lexical processing route.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The role of feedback from the auditory cortex in shaping responses to sounds in inferior colliculus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/584334v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/584334v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The extensive feedback from the auditory cortex (AC) to the inferior colliculus (IC) supports critical aspects of auditory learning, but has not been extensively characterized. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether and how intra-cortical processing of auditory information propagates to earlier stages in the auditory pathway. Previous studies demonstrated that responses of neurons in IC are altered by focal electrical stimulation and pharmacological inactivation of auditory cortex, but these methods lack the ability to selectively manipulate the activity of projection neurons. Combining viral technology with electrophysiological recordings, we measured the effects of selective optogenetic activation or suppression of cortico-collicular feedback projections on IC responses to sounds. Activation of cortico-collicular feedback generally increased spontaneous activity and decreased stimulus selectivity in IC, whereas suppression of the feedback did not affect collicular activity. To further understand how microcircuits in the auditory cortex may control collicular activity, we tested the effects of optogenetically modulating different cortical neuronal subtypes, specifically parvalbumin-positive (PV) and somatostatin-positive (SOM) inhibitory interneurons. We found that, despite strong effects on sound-evoked responses across the layers of AC, activating either type of interneuron did not affect IC sound-evoked activity. However, suppression of SOMs, but not PVs, weakly increased spontaneous activity in IC. These findings suggest that shaping of sound responses mediated by cortical inhibition does not affect sound processing in IC. Combined, our results identify that activation of excitatory projections, but not inhibitory-driven increases in cortical activity, affects collicular sound responses.</description>

	<description>microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as potent regulators of learning, recent memory and extinction. However, our understanding of miRNAs directly involved in regulating complex psychiatric conditions perpetuated by aberrant memory, such as in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), remains limited. To begin to address the role of miRNAs in persistent memory, we performed small-RNA sequencing on basolateral amygdala (BLA) tissue to identify miRNAs altered by auditory fear conditioning (FC) one month after training. mir-598-3p, a highly conserved miRNA previously unstudied in the brain, was downregulated in the BLA. Further decreasing BLA mir-598-3p levels did not alter the expression or extinction of the remote fear memory. Given that stress is a critical component in PTSD, we next assessed the impact of stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL) on mir-598-3p levels, finding the miRNA is elevated in the BLA of male, but not female, mice susceptible to the effects of stress in SEFL. Accordingly, intra-BLA inhibition of mir-598-3p interfered with expression and extinction of the remote fear memory in male, but not female, mice. This effect could not be attributed to an anxiolytic effect of miRNA inhibition. Finally, bioinformatic analysis following quantitative proteomics on BLA tissue collected 30 days post-SEFL training identified putative mir-598-3p targets and related pathways mediating the differential susceptibility, with evidence for regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.</description>

	<description>The methods for electrophysiology in neuroscience have evolved tremendously over the recent years with a growing emphasis on dense-array signal recordings. Such increased complexity and augmented wealth in the volume of data recorded, have not been accompanied by efforts to streamline and facilitate access to processing methods, which too are susceptible to grow in sophistication. Moreover, unsuccessful attempts to reproduce peer-reviewed publications indicate a problem of transparency in science. This growing problem could be tackled by unrestricted access to methods that promote research transparency and data sharing, ensuring the reproducibility of published results. Here, we provide a free, extensive, open-source software that provides data-analysis, data management and multi-modality integration solutions for invasive neurophysiology. Users can perform their entire analysis through a user-friendly environment without the need of programming skills, in a tractable (logged) way. This work contributes to open-science, analysis standardization, transparency and reproducibility in invasive neurophysiology.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: ZnT2 is an electroneutral proton-coupled vesicular antiporter displaying an apparent stoichiometry of two protons per zinc ion</title>

Zinc is a vital trace element crucial for the proper function of some 3,000 cellular proteins. Specifically, zinc is essential for key physiological processes including nucleic acid metabolism, regulation of gene expression, signal transduction, cell division, immune- and nervous system functions, wound healing, and apoptosis. Consequently, impairment of zinc homeostasis disrupts key cellular functions resulting in various human pathologies. Mammalian zinc transport proceeds via two transporter families ZnT and ZIP. However, the detailed mechanism of action of ZnT2, which is responsible for vesicular zinc accumulation and zinc secretion into breast milk during lactation, is currently unknown. Moreover, although the putative coupling of zinc transport to the proton gradient in acidic vesicles has been suggested, it has not been conclusively established. Herein we modeled the mechanism of action of ZnT2 and demonstrated both computationally and experimentally, using functional zinc transport assays, that ZnT2 is indeed a proton-coupled zinc antiporter. Bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type proton ATPase (V-ATPase) which alkalizes acidic vesicles, abolished ZnT2-dependent zinc transport into intracellular vesicles. Moreover, using LysoTracker Red and Lyso-pHluorin, we further showed that upon transient ZnT2 overexpression in intracellular vesicles and addition of exogenous zinc, the vesicular pH underwent alkalization, presumably due to a proton-zinc antiport; this phenomenon was reversed in the presence of TPEN, a specific zinc chelator. Finally, based on computational energy calculations, we propose that ZnT2 functions as an antiporter with a stoichiometry of 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion. Hence, ZnT2 is a proton motive force-driven, electroneutral vesicular zinc exchanger, concentrating zinc in acidic vesicles on the expense of proton extrusion to the cytoplasm.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sRZv0HVI_Gw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Basal gene expression levels have been shown to be predictive of cellular response to cytotoxic treatments. However, such analyses do not fully reveal complex genotype- phenotype relationships, which are partly encoded in highly interconnected molecular networks. Biological pathways provide a complementary way of understanding drug response variation among individuals. In this study, we integrate chemosensitivity data from a large-scale pharmacogenomics study with basal gene expression data from the CCLE project and prior knowledge of molecular networks to identify specific pathways mediating chemical response. We first develop a computational method called PACER, which ranks pathways for enrichment in a given set of genes using a novel network embedding method. It examines a molecular network that encodes known gene-gene as well as gene-pathway relationships, and determines a vector representation of each gene and pathway in the same low-dimensional vector space. The relevance of a pathway to the given gene set is then captured by the similarity between the pathway vector and gene vectors. To apply this approach to chemosensitivity data, we identify genes whose basal expression levels in a panel of cell lines are correlated with cytotoxic response to a compound, and then rank pathways for relevance to these response-correlated genes using PACER. Extensive evaluation of this approach on benchmarks constructed from databases of compound target genes and large collections of drug response signatures demonstrates its advantages in identifying compound-pathway associations compared to existing statistical methods of pathway enrichment analysis. The associations identified by PACER can serve as testable hypotheses on chemosensitivity pathways and help further study the mechanisms of action of specific cytotoxic drugs. More broadly, PACER represents a novel technique of identifying enriched properties of any gene set of interest while also taking into account networks of known gene-gene relationships and interactions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZzNZeiRYbRM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: An agent-based model of dengue virus transmission shows how uncertainty about breakthrough infections influences vaccination impact projections</title>

Prophylactic vaccination is a powerful tool for reducing the burden of infectious diseases, due to a combination of direct protection of vaccinees and indirect protection of others via herd immunity. Computational models play an important role in devising strategies for vaccination by making projections of its impacts on public health. Such projections are subject to uncertainty about numerous factors, however. For example, many vaccine efficacy trials focus on measuring protection against disease rather than protection against infection, leaving the extent of breakthrough infections (i.e., disease ameliorated but infection unimpeded) among vaccinees unknown. Our goal in this study was to quantify the extent to which uncertainty about breakthrough infections results in uncertainty about vaccination impact, with a focus on vaccines for dengue. To realistically account for the many forms of heterogeneity in dengue virus (DENV) transmission, which could have implications for the dynamics of indirect protection, we used a stochastic, agent-based model for DENV transmission informed by more than a decade of empirical studies in the city of Iquitos, Peru. Following 20 years of routine vaccination of nine-year-old children at 80% coverage, projections of the proportion of disease episodes averted varied by a factor of 1.76 (95% CI: 1.54–2.06) across the range of uncertainty about breakthrough infections. This was equivalent to the range of vaccination impact projected across a range of uncertainty about vaccine efficacy of 0.268 (95% CI: 0.210–0.329). Until uncertainty about breakthrough infections can be addressed empirically, our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for it in models of vaccination impact.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/95Qqs3pfPg8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A central transformation that occurs within mammalian visual cortex is the change from linear, polarity-sensitive responses to nonlinear, polarity-insensitive responses. These neurons are classically labelled as either simple or complex, respectively, on the basis of their response linearity (Skottun et al., 1991). While the difference between cell classes is clear when the stimulus strength is high, reducing stimulus strength diminishes the differences between the cell types and causes some complex cells to respond as simple cells (Crowder et al., 2007; van Kleef et al., 2010; Hietanen et al., 2013). To understand the synaptic basis for this shift in behaviour we used &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; whole cell recordings while systematically shifting stimulus contrast. We find systematic shifts in the degree of complex cell responses in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) at the subthreshold level, demonstrating that synaptic inputs change in concert with the shifts in response linearity and that the change in response linearity is not simply due to the threshold nonlinearity. These shifts are consistent with a visual cortex model in which the recurrent amplification acts as a critical component in the generation of complex cell responses (Chance et al., 1999).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The discovery of simple and complex cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) has been fundamental to our understanding of visual processing. While both cell types are orientation selective, simple cells are spatial phase sensitive while complex cells are phase-invariant. Extracellular recordings have shown that the responses of complex cells become phase sensitive at lower stimulus contrasts, suggesting more flexibility in processing mechanisms than previously thought. The mechanism by which this flexibility arises is not understood. Using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; whole cell recordings, we demonstrated that the flexibility in phase sensitivity is also apparent in the subthreshold responses of mouse V1 cells, suggesting that the effect arises from active cortical recurrent network activity and not from passive spiking threshold mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The transcription factor FosB has been proposed as a molecular switch for the transition from casual, volitional drug use into a chronically addicted state, but the upstream regulatory mechanisms governing FosB expression are incompletely understood. In this study, we find a novel regulatory role for the transcription factor E2F3 — recently implicated in transcriptional regulation by cocaine — in controlling FosB induction in the mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc) following cocaine administration. We find that an E2F consensus sequence 500 bp upstream of the &lt;i&gt;Fosb&lt;/i&gt; transcription start site is enriched for E2F3 specifically over other E2F isoforms. We further conclude that FosB expression is regulated specifically by E2F3a, not E2F3b, that &lt;i&gt;E2f3a&lt;/i&gt; expression is specific to D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons, and that E2F3a overexpression in NAc recapitulates the induction of &lt;i&gt;Fosb&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fosb&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression observed after chronic cocaine exposure. E2F3a knockdown in NAc does not abolish &lt;i&gt;Fosb&lt;/i&gt; induction by cocaine, a result consistent with previously published data showing that singular knockdown of upstream regulators of FosB is insufficient to block cocaine-induced expression. Finally, to elucidate potential combinatorial epigenetic mechanisms involved in E2F3a’s regulation of &lt;i&gt;Fosb,&lt;/i&gt; we explore H3K4me3 enrichment at the &lt;i&gt;Fosb&lt;/i&gt; promoter and find that it is not enhanced by E2F3a overexpression, suggesting it may instead be a pre-existing permissive mark allowing for E2F3a to interact with &lt;i&gt;Fosb&lt;/i&gt;. Taken together, these findings support a role for E2F3a as a novel, upstream regulator of the addiction-mediating transcription factor FosB in NAc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; A hallmark question in the neuroscience of addiction is how repeated drug use is translated into long-lasting changes in neural regulation. Long-lasting changes in behavior are mediated in part by intracellular transcriptional mechanisms which affect gene expression and neural circuitry. Therefore, pinpointing signaling pathways downstream of abused drugs is a high priority for understanding the addiction process. To this end, we identify and characterize E2F3a as a novel regulator of FosB, a transcription factor widely studied as a molecular switch for the transition from casual drug use to addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Calcium imaging is a key method in neuroscience for investigating patterns of neuronal activity in vivo. Still, existing algorithms to detect and extract activity signals from calcium imaging movies have major shortcomings. We introduce the HNCcorr algorithm for cell identification in calcium imaging datasets that addresses these shortcomings. HNCcorr relies on the combinatorial clustering problem HNC - Hochbaum’s Normalized Cut, which is similar to the Normalized Cut problem of Shi and Malik, a well-known problem in image segmentation. HNC identifies cells as coherent clusters of pixels that are highly distinct from the remaining pixels. HNCcorr guarantees a globally optimal solution to the underlying optimization problem as well as minimal dependence on initialization techniques. HNCcorr also employs a new method, named &lt;i&gt;similarity-squared&lt;/i&gt;, for measuring similarity between pixels in calcium imaging movies. The effectiveness of HNCcorr is demonstrated by its top performance on the Neurofinder cell identification benchmark. We believe HNCcorr is an important addition to the toolbox for analysis of calcium imaging movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance&lt;/b&gt; Calcium imaging is a method for recording neuronal activity at a cellular resolution that requires automated approaches to identify cells and their signals. HNCcorr is a novel algorithm that identifies these cells successfully and efficiently. HNCcorr is unique in that it addresses an optimization model and delivers a guaranteed globally optimal solution, thus ensuring a fully transparent link between the input data and the resulting cell identification. This contrasts with existing state-of-the-art approaches that produce only heuristic solutions to the underlying optimization model, and consequently may miss cells due to the sub-optimality of the generated solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;During development the axons of neurons grow toward and locate their synaptic partners to form functional neural circuits. Axons do so by reading a map of guidance cues expressed by surrounding tissues. Guidance cues are expressed at a precise space and time, but how guidance cue expression is regulated, and in a coordinated manner, is poorly understood. Semaphorins (Semas) and Slits are families of molecular ligands that guide axons. We showed previously that Fibroblast Growth Factor (Fgf) signalling maintains &lt;i&gt;sema3a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;slit1&lt;/i&gt; forebrain expression in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt;, and these two repellents cooperate to guide retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons away from the mid-diencephalon and on towards the optic tectum. Here, we investigate whether there are common features of the regulatory pathways that control the expression of these two guidance cues at this single axon guidance decision point. We isolated the &lt;i&gt;sema3a&lt;/i&gt; proximal promoter and confirmed its responsiveness to Fgf signalling. Through misexpression of truncated Fgf receptors (Fgfrs), we found that &lt;i&gt;sema3a&lt;/i&gt; forebrain expression is dependent on Fgfr2-4 but not Fgfr1. This is in contrast to &lt;i&gt;slit1&lt;/i&gt;, whose expression we showed previously depends on Fgfr1 but not Fgfr2-4. Using pharmacological inhibitors and misexpression of constitutively active and dominant negative signalling intermediates, we find that while distinct Fgfrs regulate these two guidance genes, intracellular signalling downstream of Fgfrs appears to converge along the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. A common PI3K-Akt signalling pathway may allow for the coordinated expression of guidance cues that cooperate to direct axons at a guidance choice point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Little is known about the mechanisms regulating axon guidance cue expression. Fibroblast Growth Factor (Fgf) signals maintain &lt;i&gt;semaphorin 3a&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;sema3a&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;slit1&lt;/i&gt; expression at a key guidance point for retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons in the mid-diencephalon. We find that &lt;i&gt;sema3a&lt;/i&gt; expression in the forebrain is promoted by a distinct set of Fgfrs, Fgfr2-4, from the Fgfr1 that maintains &lt;i&gt;slit1&lt;/i&gt; levels. Interestingly, despite the differences in Fgfr dependency, the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway is likely a shared downstream regulator of the expression of both guidance cues. These data argue that related but distinct receptors converge on a common signalling mechanism for coordinated control of a map of molecular cues that cooperate at a single guidance choice point to direct axon behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;CA1 neurons in epileptic animals are vulnerable to selective changes in ion channel expression, called acquired channelopathies, which can increase the excitability of a neuron. Under normal conditions there is a gradient of ion channel expression and intrinsic excitability along the longitudinal, dorsoventral axis of hippocampal area CA1 of the rodent. Many of these channels, including M-channels, GIRK channels and HCN channels, all have dorsoventral expression gradients that might be altered in rodent models of epilepsy. Here, we show that the excitability of dorsal, but not ventral CA1 neurons, had an increased firing rate, reduced interspike interval and increased input resistance in a status epilepticus (SE) model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. As a result, the excitability of CA1 neurons became uniform across the dorsoventral axis of the rat hippocampus post-SE. Using current clamp recordings with pharmacology and immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that the expression of HCN channels was downregulated in the dorsal CA1 region post-SE, while the expression of M and GIRK channels were unchanged. We did not find this acquired channelopathy in ventral CA1 neurons post-SE. Our results suggest that the excitability of dorsal CA1 neurons post-SE increase to resemble the intrinsic properties of ventral CA1 neurons, which likely makes the hippocampal circuit more permissible to seizures, and contributes to the cognitive impairments associated with chronic epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Temporal Lobe Epilepsy is characterized by spontaneous seizures. Evidence from patients and animal models suggest seizures are more likely to start in the ventral hippocampus. It is thought that disruptions in ion channel expression contributes to the generation of spontaneous seizures. In this study, we compared the intrinsic properties of neurons at either end of hippocampal area CA1 in chronic epilepsy and found that through a reduction in HCN channel expression the intrinsic properties of neurons in dorsal CA1 change to resemble the properties of ventral CA1 neurons. This work provides an anatomical context for the pathophysiological changes associated with epilepsy, and has implications for finding better treatments for epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Patients with MS typically present with visual, motor, and sensory deficits. However, an additional complication of MS in large subset of patients is neuropathic pain. To study the underlying immune-mediated pathophysiology of pain in MS we employed the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced experimental autoimmune encephalitis (MOG-EAE) model in mice. Since sensory neurons are crucial for nociceptive transduction, we investigated the effect of this disease on sensory neurons of the lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Here, we report the disease was associated with activation of the complement system and the NLRP3 inflammasome in the DRG. We further observe a transient increase in the number of complement component 5a receptor 1-positive (C5aR1+) immune cells, CD4+ T-cells, and Iba1+ macrophages in the DRG. The absence of any significant change in the levels of mRNA for myelin proteins in the DRG and the sciatic nerve suggests that demyelination in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is not a trigger for the immune response in the DRG. However, we did observe an induction of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) at disease onset and chronic disruption of cytoskeletal proteins in the DRG demonstrating neuronal injury in the PNS in response to the disease. Electrophysiological analysis revealed the emergence of hyperexcitability in medium-to-large (≥26 µm) diameter neurons, especially at the onset of MOG-EAE signs. These results provide conclusive evidence of immune activation, neuronal injury, and peripheral sensitization in MOG-EAE, a model classically considered to be centrally-mediated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) involves central nervous system inflammation, demyelinating plaques, and neurodegeneration. Neuropathic pain is a common symptom of MS thought to occur as a result of disease pathology in the central nervous system. On the contrary, here, we demonstrate that the peripheral nervous system in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (MOG-EAE), a currently used T-cell mediated model of MS, experiences transient inflammation, cellular injury, and chronic cytoskeletal disruption. Furthermore, putative myelinating, medium-to-large diameter sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia show aberrant electrophysiological properties. Our data suggests that pain in MOG-EAE may at least in part be due to disease-mediated sensitization of primary afferents, ultimately enhancing sensory input into the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Circuit Dysfunction in SOD1-ALS Model First Detected in Sensory Feedback Prior to Motor Neuron Degeneration Is Alleviated by BMP Signaling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease for which the origin and underlying cellular defects are not fully understood. Although motor neuron degeneration is the signature feature of ALS, it is not clear whether motor neurons or other cells of the motor circuit are the site of disease initiation. To better understand the contribution of multiple cell types in ALS, we made use of a &lt;i&gt;Drosophila Sod1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;G85R&lt;/sup&gt; knock-in model, in which all cells harbor the disease allele. End-stage &lt;i&gt;dSod1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;G85R&lt;/sup&gt; animals of both sexes exhibit severe motor deficits with clear degeneration of motor neurons. Interestingly, earlier in &lt;i&gt;dSod1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;G85R&lt;/sup&gt; larvae, motor function is also compromised, but their motor neurons exhibit only subtle morphological and electrophysiological changes that are unlikely to cause the observed decrease in locomotion. We analyzed the intact motor circuit and identified a defect in sensory feedback that likely accounts for the altered motor activity of &lt;i&gt;dSod1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;G85R&lt;/sup&gt;. We found cell-autonomous activation of bone morphogenetic protein signaling in proprioceptor sensory neurons which are critical for the relay of the contractile status of muscles back to the central nerve cord, completely rescues early-stage motor defects and partially rescue late-stage motor function to extend lifespan. Identification of a defect in sensory feedback as a potential initiating event in ALS motor dysfunction, coupled with the ability of modified proprioceptors to alleviate such motor deficits, underscores the critical role that nonmotor neurons play in disease progression and highlights their potential as a site to identify early-stage ALS biomarkers and for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; At diagnosis, many cellular processes are already disrupted in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patient. Identifying the initiating cellular events is critical for achieving an earlier diagnosis to slow or prevent disease progression. Our findings indicate that neurons relaying sensory information underlie early stage motor deficits in a &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; knock-in model of ALS that best replicates gene dosage in familial ALS (fALS). Importantly, studies on intact motor circuits revealed defects in sensory feedback before evidence of motor neuron degeneration. These findings strengthen our understanding of how neural circuit dysfunctions lead to neurodegeneration and, coupled with our demonstration that the activation of bone morphogenetic protein signaling in proprioceptors alleviates both early and late motor dysfunction, underscores the importance of considering nonmotor neurons as therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory problems such as neuropathic pain are common and debilitating symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the CNS. Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical for maintaining immune homeostasis, but their role in MS-associated pain remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Treg cell ablation is sufficient to trigger experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and facial allodynia in immunized female mice. In EAE-induced female mice, adoptive transfer of Treg cells and spinal delivery of the Treg cell cytokine interleukin-35 (IL-35) significantly reduced facial stimulus-evoked pain and spontaneous pain independent of disease severity and increased myelination of the facial nociceptive pathway. The effects of intrathecal IL-35 therapy were Treg-cell dependent and associated with upregulated IL-10 expression in CNS-infiltrating lymphocytes and reduced monocyte infiltration in the trigeminal afferent pathway. We present evidence for a beneficial role of Treg cells and IL-35 in attenuating pain associated with EAE independently of motor symptoms by decreasing neuroinflammation and increasing myelination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Pain is a highly prevalent symptom affecting the majority of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and dramatically affects overall health-related quality of life; however, this is a research area that has been largely ignored. Here, we identify for the first time a role for regulatory T (Treg) cells and interleukin-35 (IL-35) in suppressing facial allodynia and facial grimacing in animals with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We demonstrate that spinal delivery of Treg cells and IL-35 reduces pain associated with EAE by decreasing neuroinflammation and increasing myelination independently of motor symptoms. These findings increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pain in EAE and suggest potential treatment strategies for pain relief in MS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Optogenetic Stimulation of the Superior Colliculus Confers Retinal Neuroprotection in a Mouse Glaucoma Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma is characterized by a progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the eye, which ultimately results in visual impairment or even blindness. Because current therapies often fail to halt disease progression, there is an unmet need for novel neuroprotective therapies to support RGC survival. Various research lines suggest that visual target centers in the brain support RGC functioning and survival. Here, we explored whether increasing neuronal activity in one of these projection areas could improve survival of RGCs in a mouse glaucoma model. Prolonged activation of an important murine RGC target area, the superior colliculus (SC), was established via a novel optogenetic stimulation paradigm. By leveraging the unique channel kinetics of the stabilized step function opsin (SSFO), protracted stimulation of the SC was achieved with only a brief light pulse. SSFO-mediated collicular stimulation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry for the immediate-early gene c-Fos and behavioral tracking, which both demonstrated consistent neuronal activity upon repeated stimulation. Finally, the neuroprotective potential of optogenetic collicular stimulation was investigated in mice of either sex subjected to a glaucoma model and a 63% reduction in RGC loss was found. This work describes a new paradigm for optogenetic collicular stimulation and a first demonstration that increasing target neuron activity can increase survival of the projecting neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite glaucoma being a leading cause of blindness and visual impairment worldwide, no curative therapies exist. This study describes a novel paradigm to reduce retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration underlying glaucoma. Building on previous observations that RGC survival is supported by the target neurons to which they project and using an innovative optogenetic approach, we increased neuronal activity in the mouse superior colliculus, a main projection target of rodent RGCs. This proved to be efficient in reducing RGC loss in a glaucoma model. Our findings establish a new optogenetic paradigm for target stimulation and encourage further exploration of the molecular signaling pathways mediating retrograde neuroprotective communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distinct Neural Mechanisms of Spatial Attention and Expectation Guide Perceptual Inference in a Multisensory World</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2301?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2301?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spatial attention (i.e., task-relevance) and expectation (i.e., signal probability) are two critical top-down mechanisms guiding perceptual inference. Spatial attention prioritizes processing of information at task-relevant locations. Spatial expectations encode the statistical structure of the environment. An unresolved question is how the brain allocates attention and forms expectations in a multisensory environment, where task-relevance and signal probability over space can differ across sensory modalities. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in human participants (female and male) to investigate whether the brain encodes task-relevance and signal probability over space separately or interactively across sensory modalities. In a novel multisensory paradigm, we manipulated spatial attention and expectation selectively in audition and assessed their effects on behavioral and neural responses to auditory and visual stimuli. Our results show that both auditory and visual stimuli increased activations in a right-lateralized frontoparietal system, when they were presented at locations that were task-irrelevant in audition. Yet, only auditory stimuli increased activations in the medial prefrontal cortex when presented at expected locations and in audiovisual and frontoparietal cortices signaling a prediction error when presented at unexpected locations. This dissociation in multisensory generalization for attention and expectation effects shows that the brain controls attentional resources interactively across the senses but encodes the statistical structure of the environment as spatial expectations independently for each sensory system. Our results demonstrate that spatial attention and expectation engage partly overlapping neural systems via distinct mechanisms to guide perceptual inference in a multisensory world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In our natural environment the brain is exposed to a constant influx of signals through all our senses. How does the brain allocate attention and form spatial expectations in this multisensory environment? Because observers need to respond to stimuli regardless of their sensory modality, they may allocate attentional resources and encode the probability of events jointly across the senses. This psychophysics and neuroimaging study shows that the brain controls attentional resources interactively across the senses via a frontoparietal system but encodes the statistical structure of the environment independently for each sense in sensory and frontoparietal areas. Thus, spatial attention and expectation engage partly overlapping neural systems via distinct mechanisms to guide perceptual inference in a multisensory world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Pain of Sleep Loss: A Brain Characterization in Humans</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sleep loss increases the experience of pain. However, the brain mechanisms underlying altered pain processing following sleep deprivation are unknown. Moreover, it remains unclear whether ecologically modest night-to-night changes in sleep, within an individual, confer consequential day-to-day changes in experienced pain. Here, we demonstrate that acute sleep deprivation amplifies pain reactivity within human (male and female) primary somatosensory cortex yet blunts pain reactivity in higher-order valuation and decision-making regions of the striatum and insula cortex. Consistent with this altered neural signature, we further show that sleep deprivation expands the temperature range for classifying a stimulus as painful, specifically through a lowering of pain thresholds. Moreover, the degree of amplified reactivity within somatosensory cortex following sleep deprivation significantly predicts this expansion of experienced pain across individuals. Finally, outside of the laboratory setting, we similarly show that even modest nightly changes in sleep quality (increases and decreases) within an individual determine consequential day-to-day changes in experienced pain (decreases and increases, respectively). Together, these data provide a novel framework underlying the impact of sleep loss on pain and, furthermore, establish that the association between sleep and pain is expressed in a night-to-day, bidirectional relationship within a sample of the general population. More broadly, our findings highlight sleep as a novel therapeutic target for pain management within and outside the clinic, including circumstances where sleep is frequently short yet pain is abundant (e.g., the hospital setting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Are you experiencing pain? Did you have a bad night of sleep? This study provides underlying brain and behavioral mechanisms explaining this common co-occurrence. We show that sleep deprivation enhances pain responsivity within the primary sensing regions of the brain's cortex yet blunts activity in other regions that modulate pain processing, the striatum and insula. We further establish that even subtle night-to-night changes in sleep in a sample of the general population predict consequential day-to-day changes in pain (bidirectionally). Considering the societal rise in chronic pain conditions in lock-step with the decline in sleep time through the industrial world, our data support the hypothesis that these two trends may not simply be co-occurring but are significantly interrelated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Ventral Midline Thalamus Mediates Hippocampal Spatial Information Processes upon Spatial Cue Changes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2276?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ventral midline thalamus, consisting of the reuniens and rhomboid nuclei (RE/Rh), is a thalamic structure interconnected with the limbic systems including the hippocampus. Recently, many studies have revealed that this structure plays distinctive roles in spatial learning and memory in collaboration with hippocampal functions. However, what aspects of spatial information process are influenced by the RE/Rh is not clearly known. To elucidate the roles of RE/Rh in spatial information processing and its effects on hippocampal activity, specifically with the manipulation of spatial contents, we measured hippocampal-dependent spatial memory performance and hippocampal place cell activities after RE/Rh lesion using male C57BL/6J &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 129/SvJae hybrid mice. We found that the lesion altered the behavioral aptitude in recognizing locational changes of an object. Furthermore, CA1 place cells in the lesion group showed different spatial representation patterns in recognizing the environment with cue locational changes compared with the control group. Interestingly, the patterns of CA1 place cells in recognizing the same environment previously visited were not disrupted in the lesion group compared with the control group. These findings demonstrate that the ventral midline thalamus (RE/Rh) is important in recognizing the spatial relationships, especially when spatial rearrangement of cue position was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The ventral midline thalamic nuclei (reuniens and rhomboid) interact with the hippocampus to influence various cognitive functions requiring spatial memories, yet what aspects of spatial information process are influenced by these nuclei is not clearly known. Here, we reveal that these nuclei play a crucial role in modulating hippocampal properties only with locational rearrangement of cues, not with the familiar arrangement. These nuclei are distinctively involved in cue-dependent spatial information processes of CA1 place cells. In particular, we suggest that these nuclei modulate spatial information processing on discrete components, especially when the spatial cue relationship is modified.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sensory Representations Supporting Memory Specificity: Age Effects on Behavioral and Neural Discriminability</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Older adults' difficulty in distinguishing between old and new information contributes to memory decline, which may occur because older adults are less likely than young adults to retrieve specific sensory details necessary to distinguish between similar items. In male and female human subjects, the present study measured the extent of age differences in the specificity of memory representations using a false memory paradigm in which studied items were linked to retrieval items at multiple levels of similarity. Older adults showed poorer behavioral discrimination than young adults, driven primarily by false recognition of lures that differed from targets only in perceptual details. Patterns of activation across several regions within ventral visual cortex could be used to distinguish between targets and lures when they differed in both perceptual details and a semantic label. However, of ventral visual regions, only signals in the midline occipital cortex could be used to distinguish targets from lures when they differed only in perceptual details. Although there was an overall age deficit for this neural discrimination in this region, the positive relationship between neural and behavioral discriminability did not differ across age groups. In contrast, age moderated the relationship between neural and behavioral discriminability in lateral occipital and fusiform cortices, suggesting that activation patterns within these regions represent different types of information in each age group. Therefore, the quality of perceptual signals is a key contributor to memory discrimination across age groups, with evidence that age differences in the nature of representations emerges outside early visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Age-related memory decline is due in part to older adults' difficulties in discriminating between old and new information. We tested whether this deficit arises from lack of specificity in the sensory representations underlying older adults' recognition judgments. Using pattern classification analyses in ventral visual cortices, we found that signals in a region early in the visual stream could distinguish between targets and lures at the highest level of similarity. The discriminability of targets and lures in this region was positively related to behavioral discriminability across age groups despite an overall age deficit in classification accuracy. Together, results showed that older adults' memory deficits are related to reduced discriminability of cognitive processes (old/new recognition) in portions of visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Errors in Action Timing and Inhibition Facilitate Learning by Tuning Distinct Mechanisms in the Underlying Decision Process</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Goal-directed behavior requires integrating action selection processes with learning systems that adapt control using environmental feedback. These functions are known to intersect at a common neural substrate with multiple known targets of plasticity (the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic network), suggesting that feedback signals have a multifaceted impact on future decisions. Using a hybrid of accumulation-to-bound decision models and reinforcement learning, we modeled the performance of humans in a stop signal task where participants (N 75: 37 males, 38 females) learned the prior distribution of the timing of a stop signal through trial-and-error feedback. Changes in the drift rate of the action execution process were driven by errors in action timing, whereas adaptation in the boundary height served to increase caution following failed stops. These findings highlight two interactive learning mechanisms for adapting the control of goal-directed actions based on dissociable dimensions of feedback error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Many complex behavioral goals rely on the ability to regulate the timing of action execution while also maintaining enough control to cancel actions in response to &quot;Stop&quot; cues in the environment. Here we examined how these fundamental components of behavior become tuned to the control demands of the environment by combining principles of reinforcement learning with accumulation-to-bound models. Model fits to behavioral data in an adaptive stop signal task revealed two adaptive mechanisms: (1) timing error-related changes in the rate of the execution signal; and (2) an increase in the execution boundary after failed stops. These findings demonstrate unique effects of timing and control errors on the underlying mechanisms of control, the rate and threshold of accumulating action signals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dorsal Horn Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Expressing Neurons Transmit Spinal Itch But Not Pain Signals</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) is a spinal itch transmitter expressed by a small population of dorsal horn interneurons (GRP neurons). The contribution of these neurons to spinal itch relay is still only incompletely understood, and their potential contribution to pain-related behaviors remains controversial. Here, we have addressed this question in a series of experiments performed in &lt;i&gt;GRP::cre&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;GRP::eGFP&lt;/i&gt; transgenic male mice. We combined behavioral tests with neuronal circuit tracing, morphology, chemogenetics, optogenetics, and electrophysiology to obtain a more comprehensive picture. We found that GRP neurons form a rather homogeneous population of central cell-like excitatory neurons located in lamina II of the superficial dorsal horn. Multicolor high-resolution confocal microscopy and optogenetic experiments demonstrated that GRP neurons receive direct input from MrgprA3-positive pruritoceptors. Anterograde HSV-based neuronal tracing initiated from GRP neurons revealed ascending polysynaptic projections to distinct areas and nuclei in the brainstem, midbrain, thalamus, and the somatosensory cortex. Spinally restricted ablation of GRP neurons reduced itch-related behaviors to different pruritogens, whereas their chemogenetic excitation elicited itch-like behaviors and facilitated responses to several pruritogens. By contrast, responses to painful stimuli remained unaltered. These data confirm a critical role of dorsal horn GRP neurons in spinal itch transmission but do not support a role in pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dorsal horn gastrin-releasing peptide neurons serve a well-established function in the spinal transmission of pruritic (itch) signals. A potential role in the transmission of nociceptive (pain) signals has remained controversial. Our results provide further support for a critical role of dorsal horn gastrin-releasing peptide neurons in itch circuits, but we failed to find evidence supporting a role in pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Voltage-Dependent Membrane Properties Shape the Size But Not the Frequency Content of Spontaneous Voltage Fluctuations in Layer 2/3 Somatosensory Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2221?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Under awake and idling conditions, spontaneous intracellular membrane voltage is characterized by large, synchronous, low-frequency fluctuations. Although these properties reflect correlations in synaptic inputs, intrinsic membrane properties often indicate voltage-dependent changes in membrane resistance and time constant values that can amplify and help to generate low-frequency voltage fluctuations. The specific contribution of intrinsic and synaptic factors to the generation of spontaneous fluctuations, however, remains poorly understood. Using visually guided intracellular recordings of somatosensory layer 2/3 pyramidal cells and interneurons in awake male and female mice, we measured the spectrum and size of voltage fluctuation and intrinsic cellular properties at different voltages. In both cell types, depolarizing neurons increased the size of voltage fluctuations. Amplitude changes scaled with voltage-dependent changes in membrane input resistance. Because of the small membrane time constants observed in both pyramidal cells and interneuron cell bodies, the low-frequency content of membrane fluctuations reflects correlations in the synaptic current inputs rather than significant filtering associated with membrane capacitance. Further, blocking synaptic inputs minimally altered somatic membrane resistance and time constant values. Overall, these results indicate that spontaneous synaptic inputs generate a low-conductance state in which the amplitude, but not frequency structure, is influenced by intrinsic membrane properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In the absence of sensory drive, cortical activity in awake animals is associated with self-generated and seemingly random membrane voltage fluctuations characterized by large amplitude and low frequency. Partially, these properties reflect correlations in synaptic input. Nonetheless, neurons express voltage-dependent intrinsic properties that can potentially influence the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous activity. Using visually guided intracellular recordings of cortical neurons in awake mice, we measured the voltage dependence of spontaneous voltage fluctuations and intrinsic membrane properties. We show that voltage-dependent changes in membrane resistance amplify synaptic activity, whereas the frequency of voltage fluctuations reflects correlations in synaptic inputs. Last, synaptic activity has a small impact on intrinsic membrane properties in both pyramidal cells and interneurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Representation of Auditory Motion Directions and Sound Source Locations in the Human Planum Temporale</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2208?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to compute the location and direction of sounds is a crucial perceptual skill to efficiently interact with dynamic environments. How the human brain implements spatial hearing is, however, poorly understood. In our study, we used fMRI to characterize the brain activity of male and female humans listening to sounds moving left, right, up, and down as well as static sounds. Whole-brain univariate results contrasting moving and static sounds varying in their location revealed a robust functional preference for auditory motion in bilateral human planum temporale (hPT). Using independently localized hPT, we show that this region contains information about auditory motion directions and, to a lesser extent, sound source locations. Moreover, hPT showed an axis of motion organization reminiscent of the functional organization of the middle-temporal cortex (hMT+/V5) for vision. Importantly, whereas motion direction and location rely on partially shared pattern geometries in hPT, as demonstrated by successful cross-condition decoding, the responses elicited by static and moving sounds were, however, significantly distinct. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the hPT codes for auditory motion and location but that the underlying neural computation linked to motion processing is more reliable and partially distinct from the one supporting sound source location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Compared with what we know about visual motion, little is known about how the brain implements spatial hearing. Our study reveals that motion directions and sound source locations can be reliably decoded in the human planum temporale (hPT) and that they rely on partially shared pattern geometries. Our study, therefore, sheds important new light on how computing the location or direction of sounds is implemented in the human auditory cortex by showing that those two computations rely on partially shared neural codes. Furthermore, our results show that the neural representation of moving sounds in hPT follows a &quot;preferred axis of motion&quot; organization, reminiscent of the coding mechanisms typically observed in the occipital middle-temporal cortex (hMT+/V5) region for computing visual motion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Conditional Inactivation of Pen-2 in the Developing Neocortex Leads to Rapid Switch of Apical Progenitors to Basal Progenitors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2195?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The transition of apical progenitors (APs) to basal progenitors (BPs) is an important neurogenic process during cortical expansion. Presenilin enhancer 2 (Pen-2, also named as Psenen) is a key subunit of -secretase and has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disease. However, it remains unknown how Pen-2 may regulate the maintenance of APs. To address this question, we generated a conditional KO (cKO) mouse in which Pen-2 is specifically inactivated in neural progenitor cells in the telencephalon. Both male and female embryos were used. We show that &lt;i&gt;Pen-2&lt;/i&gt; cKO cortices display remarkable depletion of Aps, but transient increase on BPs, compared with controls. We demonstrate that the proliferation rate of APs or BPs is not changed, but the switch of APs to BPs is dramatically accelerated in &lt;i&gt;Pen-2&lt;/i&gt; cKO cortices. Molecular analyses reveal decreased levels of Hes1 and Hes5 but increased levels of Ngn2 and NeuroD1 in &lt;i&gt;Pen-2&lt;/i&gt; KO cells. We report that expression of Notch1 intracellular domain in &lt;i&gt;Pen-2&lt;/i&gt; cKO cortices restores the population of APs and BPs. In summary, these findings highlight a central role of the Notch signaling in Pen-2-dependent maintenance of neural stem cells in the developing neocortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Presenilin enhancer 2 (Pen-2) has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disease. However, mechanisms by which Pen-2 regulates cortical development are not understood. In this study, we generated neural progenitor cell-specific &lt;i&gt;Pen-2&lt;/i&gt; conditional KO mice. We observe depletion of apical progenitors and transiently increased the number of basal progenitors in the developing neocortex of Pen-2 mutant mice. Mechanistic analyses reveal decreased levels of Hes1 and Hes5, but increased levels of neurogenic transcription factors in Pen-2 mutant cortices, compared with controls. We demonstrate that reintroduction of Notch intracellular domain into mutant mice restores the population of apical progenitors to basal progenitors. The above findings strongly suggest that the Pen-2-Notch pathway plays an essential role in the maintenance of neural stem cells during cortical development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators Enhance CNS Remyelination Independent of Estrogen Receptors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2184?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A significant unmet need for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is the lack of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved remyelinating therapies. We have identified a compelling remyelinating agent, bazedoxifene (BZA), a European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved (and FDA-approved in combination with conjugated estrogens) selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator (SERM) that could move quickly from bench to bedside. This therapy stands out as a tolerable alternative to previously identified remyelinating agents and other candidates within this family. Using an unbiased high-throughput screen, with subsequent validation in both murine and human oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and coculture systems, we find that BZA enhances differentiation of OPCs into functional oligodendrocytes. Using an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; murine model of focal demyelination, we find that BZA enhances OPC differentiation and remyelination. Of critical importance, we find that BZA acts independently of its presumed target, the ER, in both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; systems. Using a massive computational data integration approach, we independently identify six possible candidate targets through which SERMs may mediate their effect on remyelination. Of particular interest, we identify EBP (encoding 3β-hydroxysteroid-8,7-isomerase), a key enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, which was previously implicated as a target for remyelination. These findings provide valuable insights into the implications for SERMs in remyelination for MS and hormonal research at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Therapeutics targeted at remyelination failure, which results in axonal degeneration and ultimately disease progression, represent a large unmet need in the multiple sclerosis (MS) population. Here, we have validated a tolerable European Medicines Agency-approved (U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved in combination with conjugated estrogens) selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator (SERM), bazedoxifene (BZA), as a potent agent of oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and remyelination. SERMs, which were developed as nuclear ER-α and ER-β agonists/antagonists, have previously been implicated in remyelination and neuroprotection, following a heavy focus on estrogens with underwhelming and conflicting results. We show that nuclear ERs are not required for SERMs to mediate their potent effects on OPC differentiation and remyelination &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and highlight EBP, an enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway that could potentially act as a target for SERMs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Light-Activated ROS Production Induces Synaptic Autophagy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2163?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2163?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The regulated turnover of synaptic vesicle (SV) proteins is thought to involve the ubiquitin-dependent tagging and degradation through endo-lysosomal and autophagy pathways. Yet, it remains unclear which of these pathways are used, when they become activated, and whether SVs are cleared en masse together with SV proteins or whether both are degraded selectively. Equally puzzling is how quickly these systems can be activated and whether they function in real-time to support synaptic health. To address these questions, we have developed an imaging-based system that simultaneously tags presynaptic proteins while monitoring autophagy. Moreover, by tagging SV proteins with a light-activated ROS generator, Supernova, it was possible to temporally control the damage to specific SV proteins and assess their consequence to autophagy-mediated clearance mechanisms and synaptic function. Our results show that, in mouse hippocampal neurons of either sex, presynaptic autophagy can be induced in as little as 5–10 min and eliminates primarily the damaged protein rather than the SV en masse. Importantly, we also find that autophagy is essential for synaptic function, as light-activated damage to, for example, Synaptophysin only compromises synaptic function when autophagy is simultaneously blocked. These data support the concept that presynaptic boutons have a robust highly regulated clearance system to maintain not only synapse integrity, but also synaptic function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The real-time surveillance and clearance of synaptic proteins are thought to be vital to the health, functionality, and integrity of vertebrate synapses and are compromised in neurodegenerative disorders, yet the fundamental mechanisms regulating these systems remain enigmatic. Our analysis reveals that presynaptic autophagy is a critical part of a real-time clearance system at synapses capable of responding to local damage of synaptic vesicle proteins within minutes and to be critical for the ongoing functionality of these synapses. These data indicate that synapse autophagy is not only locally regulated but also crucial for the health and functionality of vertebrate presynaptic boutons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Layer-specific connectivity revealed by diffusion-weighted functional MRI in the rat thalamocortical pathway. (arXiv:1903.08133v1 [physics.med-ph])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08133</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Investigating neural activity from a global brain perspective in-vivo has
been in the domain of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) over the
past few decades. The intricate neurovascular couplings that govern fMRI's
blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional contrast are invaluable in
mapping active brain regions, but they also entail significant limitations,
such as non-specificity of the signal to active foci. Diffusion-weighted
functional MRI (dfMRI) with relatively high diffusion-weighting strives to
ameliorate this shortcoming as it offers functional contrasts more intimately
linked with the underlying activity. Insofar, apart from somewhat smaller
activation foci, dfMRI's contrasts have not been convincingly shown to offer
significant advantages over BOLD, and its contrasts relied on significant
modelling. Here, we study whether dfMRI could offer a better representation of
neural activity in the thalamocortical pathway compared to its (spin-echo (SE))
BOLD counterpart. Using high-end forepaw stimulation experiments in the rat at
9.4 T, and with significant sensitivity enhancements due to the use of
cryocoils, we show for the first time that dfMRI signals exhibit layer
specificity, and, additionally, display signals in areas devoid of SE-BOLD
responses. We find that dfMRI signals in the thalamocortical pathway cohere
with each other, namely, dfMRI signals in the ventral posterolateral (VPL)
thalamic nucleus cohere specifically with layers IV and V in the somatosensory
cortex. These activity patterns are much better correlated (compared with
SE-BOLD signals) with literature-based electrophysiological recordings in the
cortex as well as thalamus. All these findings suggest that dfMRI signals
better represent the underlying neural activity in the pathway. In turn, this
may entail significant implications towards a much more specific and accurate
(...)

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Bayesian regression explains how human participants handle parameter uncertainty. (arXiv:1903.07885v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07885</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain copes with sensory uncertainty in accordance with Bayes'
rule. However, it is unknown how the brain makes predictions in the presence of
parameter uncertainty. Here, we tested whether and how humans take parameter
uncertainty into account in a regression task. Participants extrapolated a
parabola from a limited number of noisy points, shown on a computer screen. The
quadratic parameter was drawn from a prior distribution, unknown to the
observers. We tested whether human observers take full advantage of the given
information, including the likelihood function of the observed points and the
prior distribution of the quadratic parameter. We compared human performance
with Bayesian regression, which is the (Bayes) optimal solution to this
problem, and three sub-optimal models, namely maximum likelihood regression,
prior regression and maximum a posteriori regression, which are simpler to
compute. Our results clearly show that humans use Bayesian regression. We
further investigated several variants of Bayesian regression models depending
on how the generative noise is treated and found that participants act in line
with the more sophisticated version.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Category decoding of visual stimuli from human brain activity using a bidirectional recurrent neural network to simulate bidirectional information flows in human visual cortices. (arXiv:1903.07783v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07783</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07783</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, visual encoding and decoding based on functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) have realized many achievements with the rapid development of
deep network computation. Despite the hierarchically similar representations of
deep network and human vision, visual information flows from primary visual
cortices to high visual cortices and vice versa based on the bottom-up and
top-down manners, respectively. Inspired by the bidirectional information
flows, we proposed a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN)-based method
to decode the categories from fMRI data. The forward and backward directions in
the BRNN module characterized the bottom-up and top-down manners, respectively.
The proposed method regarded the selected voxels of each visual cortex region
(V1, V2, V3, V4, and LO) as one node in the sequence fed into the BRNN module
and combined the output of the BRNN module to decode the categories with the
subsequent fully connected layer. This new method allows the efficient
utilization of hierarchical information representations and bidirectional
information flows in human visual cortices. Experiment results demonstrated
that our method improved the accuracy of three-level category decoding than
other methods, which implicitly validated the hierarchical and bidirectional
human visual representations. Comparative analysis revealed that the category
representations of human visual cortices were hierarchical, distributed,
complementary, and correlative.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Emergent regularities and scaling in armed conflict data. (arXiv:1903.07762v1 [physics.soc-ph])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07762</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Large-scale armed conflict is a characteristic feature of modern
civilization. The statistics of conflict show remarkable regularities like
power law distributions of fatalities and durations, but these properties have
remained disparate, albeit prominent, features of conflict. We explore a large,
detailed data set of $10^5$ armed conflict reports spanning 20 years across
nearly $10^4$ kilometers. By clustering spatiotemporally proximate events into
conflict avalanches, we show that the number of conflict reports, fatalities,
duration, and geographic extent satisfy consistent scaling relations. The
temporal evolution of conflicts measured by these scaling variables display
emergent symmetry, reflecting self-similarity in the trajectories of conflict
avalanches. Taken together, our measurements describe a system that is distinct
from prevailing explanations of conflict growth such as self-similar forest
fire models. A natural interpretation of our findings is in the language of
criticality, suggesting that armed conflicts are dominated by a low-dimensional
process that scales with physical dimensions in a surprisingly unified and
predictable way.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39578</link>
	<description>Stress granules (SGs) are non-membrane-bound RNA-protein granules that assemble through phase separation in response to cellular stress. Disturbances in SG dynamics have been implicated as a primary driver of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), suggesting the hypothesis that these diseases reflect an underlying disturbance in the dynamics and material properties of SGs. However, this concept has remained largely untestable in available models of SG assembly, which require the confounding variable of exogenous stressors. Here we introduce a light-inducible SG system, termed OptoGranules, based on optogenetic multimerization of G3BP1, which is an essential scaffold protein for SG assembly. In this system, which permits experimental control of SGs in living cells in the absence of exogenous stressors, we demonstrate that persistent or repetitive assembly of SGs is cytotoxic and is accompanied by the evolution of SGs to cytoplasmic inclusions that recapitulate the pathology of ALS-FTD.</description>

	<description>Exactly how cerebrovascular alterations contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still unknown. Merlini et al. (2019) show that blood-derived fibrinogen leads to dendritic spine elimination and cognitive deficit via microglial CD11b/CD18. Fibrinogen may be a significant contributor to AD pathogenesis.</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Neural Processing of Communication Signals: The Extent of Sender-Receiver Matching Varies across Species of Apteronotus</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;As communication signal properties change, through genetic drift or selective pressure, the sensory systems that receive these signals must also adapt to maintain sensitivity and adaptability in an array of contexts. Shedding light on this process helps us to understand how sensory codes are tailored to specific tasks. In a species of weakly electric fish, &lt;i&gt;Apteronotus albifrons&lt;/i&gt;, we examined the unique neurophysiological properties that support the encoding of electrosensory communication signals that the animal encounters in social exchanges. We compare our findings to the known coding properties of the closely related species &lt;i&gt;Apteronotus leptorhynchus&lt;/i&gt; to establish how these animals differ in their ability to encode their distinctive communication signals. While there are many similarities between these two species, we found notable differences leading to relatively poor coding of the details of chirp structure occurring on high-frequency background beats. As a result, small differences in chirp properties are poorly resolved by the nervous system. We performed behavioral tests to relate &lt;i&gt;A. albifrons&lt;/i&gt; chirp coding strategies to its use of chirps during social encounters. Our results suggest that &lt;i&gt;A. albifrons&lt;/i&gt; does not exchange frequent chirps in a nonbreeding condition, particularly when the beat frequency is high. These findings parallel the mediocre chirp coding accuracy in that they both point to a reduced reliance on frequent and rich exchange of information through chirps during these social interactions. Therefore, our study suggests that neural coding strategies in the CNS vary across species in a way that parallels the behavioral use of the sensory signals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Electrophysiological Properties of Medium Spiny Neuron Subtypes in the Caudate-Putamen of Prepubertal Male and Female Drd1a-tdTomato Line 6 BAC Transgenic Mice</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The caudate-putamen is a striatal brain region essential for sensorimotor behaviors, habit learning, and other cognitive and premotor functions. The output and predominant neuron of the caudate-putamen is the medium spiny neuron (MSN). MSNs present discrete cellular subtypes that show differences in neurochemistry, dopamine receptor expression, efferent targets, gene expression, functional roles, and most importantly for this study, electrophysiological properties. MSN subtypes include the striatonigral and the striatopallidal groups. Most studies identify the striatopallidal MSN subtype as being more excitable than the striatonigral MSN subtype. However, there is some divergence between studies regarding the exact differences in electrophysiological properties. Furthermore, MSN subtype electrophysiological properties have not been reported disaggregated by biological sex. We addressed these questions using prepubertal male and female Drd1a-tdTomato line 6 BAC transgenic mice, an important transgenic line that has not yet received extensive electrophysiological analysis. We made acute caudate-putamen brain slices and assessed a robust battery of 16 relevant electrophysiological properties using whole-cell patch-clamp recording, including intrinsic membrane, action potential, and miniature EPSC (mEPSC) properties. We found that: (1) MSN subtypes exhibited multiple differential electrophysiological properties in both sexes, including rheobase, action potential threshold and width, input resistance in both the linear and rectified ranges, and mEPSC amplitude; (2) select electrophysiological properties showed interactions between MSN subtype and sex. These findings provide a comprehensive evaluation of mouse caudate-putamen MSN subtype electrophysiological properties across females and males, both confirming and extending previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Rethinking interhemispheric imbalance as a target for stroke neurorehabilitation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25452?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25452?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with chronic stroke have been shown to have failure to release interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) from the intact to the damaged hemisphere before movement execution (premovement IHI). This inhibitory imbalance was found to correlate with poor motor performance in the chronic stage after stroke and has since become a target for therapeutic interventions. The logic of this approach, however, implies that abnormal premovement IHI is causal to poor behavioral outcome and should therefore be present early after stroke when motor impairment is at its worst. To test this idea, in a longitudinal study, we investigated interhemispheric interactions by tracking patients’ premovement IHI for one year following stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assessed premovement IHI and motor behavior five times over a 1‐year period after ischemic stroke in 22 patients and 11 healthy participants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that premovement IHI was normal during the acute/subacute period and only became abnormal at the chronic stage; specifically, release of IHI in movement preparation worsened as motor behavior improved. In addition, premovement IHI did not correlate with behavioral measures cross‐sectionally, whereas the longitudinal emergence of abnormal premovement IHI from the acute to the chronic stage was inversely correlated with recovery of finger individuation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that interhemispheric imbalance is not a cause of poor motor recovery, but instead might be the consequence of underlying recovery processes. These findings call into question the rehabilitation strategy of attempting to rebalance interhemispheric interactions in order to improve motor recovery after stroke.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: A case–control–family study of idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the familial aggregation of idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), neurodegenerative diseases, and related biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 404 and 387 first‐degree relatives of 102 patients with iRBD and of 89 controls were recruited, respectively. Among them, 204 and 208 relatives of patients and controls underwent face‐to‐face clinical assessment, whereas 97 and 75 relatives underwent further video‐polysomnographic assessment, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with relatives of controls, relatives of patients demonstrated higher levels of RBD features, including chin tonic electromyography activity (mean = 1.5 ± 7.5 vs 0.3 ± 1.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04) and behavioral events (n [weighted %] = 12 [11.3] vs 2 [1.9], adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 7.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.54–33.33, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.009) during rapid eye movement sleep, probable diagnosis (n [%] = 57 [14.9] vs 20 [4.9], aHR = 3.45, 95% CI = 1.96–6.25, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and definite diagnosis (n [weighted %] = 10 [8.4] vs 2 [1.4], aHR = 5.56, 95% CI = 1.16–25.00, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03). They also had higher risks of Parkinson disease (3.1% vs 0.5%, aHR = 5.88, 95% CI = 1.37–25.00, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), dementia (6.9% vs 2.6%, aHR = 2.44, 95% CI = 1.15–5.26, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), constipation (8.3% vs 2.4%, adjusted odds ratio = 4.21, 95% CI = 1.34–13.17, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01), and motor dysfunction (Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III motor score, mean = 1.9 ± 3.2 vs 0.9 ± 2.3, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002). The unaffected relatives of patients demonstrated a higher likelihood ratio of prodromal Parkinson disease (median [interquartile range] = 0.27 [1.19] vs 0.22 [0.51], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iRBD is familially aggregated from isolated features to full‐blown sleep disorder. Relatives of patients carry a higher risk of alpha‐synucleinopathy in terms of neurodegenerative diseases and prodromal markers, suggesting a familial aggregation and staging pathology of alpha‐synucleinopathy.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The origin and meaning of facial beauty represent a longstanding puzzle.
Despite the profuse literature devoted to facial attractiveness, its very
nature, its determinants and the nature of inter-person differences remain
controversial issues. Here we tackle such questions proposing a novel
experimental approach in which human subjects, instead of rating natural faces,
are allowed to efficiently explore the face-space and &quot;sculpt&quot; their favorite
variation of a reference facial image. The results reveal that different
subjects prefer distinguishable regions of the face-space, highlighting the
essential subjectivity of the phenomenon. The different sculpted facial vectors
exhibit strong correlations among pairs of facial distances, characterizing the
underlying universality and complexity of the cognitive processes, leading to
the observed subjectivity.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: An intracellular calcium frequency code model extended to the Riemann zeta function. (arXiv:1903.07394v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07394</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07394</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We have used the Nernst chemical potential treatment to couple the time
domains of sodium and calcium ion channel opening and closing rates to the
spatial domain of the diffusing waves of the travelling calcium ions inside
single cells. The model is plausibly evolvable with respect to the origins of
the molecular components and the scaling of the system from simple cells to
neurons. The mixed chemical potentials are calculated by summing the
concentrations or particle numbers of the two constituent ions which are pure
numbers and thus dimensionless. Chemical potentials are true thermodynamic free
Gibbs/Fermi energies and the forces acting on chemical flows are calculated
from the natural logarithms of the particle numbers or their concentrations.
The mixed chemical potential is converted to the time domain of an action
potential by assuming that the injection of calcium ions accelerates
depolarization in direct proportion to the amplitude of the total charge
contribution of the calcium pulse. We assert that the natural logarithm of the
real component of the imaginary term of any Riemann zeta zero corresponds to an
instantaneous calcium potential. In principle, in a physiologically plausible
fashion, the first few thousand Riemann zeta-zeros can be encoded on this
chemical scale manifested as regulated step-changes in the amplitudes of
naturally occurring calcium current transients. We show that pairs of Zn
channels can form Dirac fences which encode the logarithmic spacings and summed
amplitudes of any pair of Riemann zeros. Remarkably the beat frequencies of the
pairings of the early frequency terms overlap the naturally occurring frequency
modes in vertebrate brains. The equation for the time domain in the biological
model has a similar form to the Riemann zeta function on the half-plane and
mimics analytical continuation on the complex plane.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reconstructing multiple molecularly defined neurons from individual brains
and across multiple brain regions can reveal organizational principles of the
nervous system. However, high resolution imaging of the whole brain is a
technically challenging and slow process. Recently, oblique light sheet
microscopy has emerged as a rapid imaging method that can provide whole brain
fluorescence microscopy at a voxel size of 0.4 by 0.4 by 2.5 cubic microns. On
the other hand, complex image artifacts due to whole-brain coverage produce
apparent discontinuities in neuronal arbors. Here, we present
connectivity-preserving methods and data augmentation strategies for supervised
learning of neuroanatomy from light microscopy using neural networks. We
quantify the merit of our approach by implementing an end-to-end automated
tracing pipeline. Lastly, we demonstrate a scalable, distributed implementation
that can reconstruct the large datasets that sub-micron whole-brain images
produce.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43570</link>
	<description>We previously showed that &lt;i&gt;Guy1&lt;/i&gt;, a primary signal expressed from the Y chromosome, is a strong candidate for a male-determining factor that confers female-specific lethality in &lt;i&gt;Anopheles stephensi &lt;/i&gt;(Criscione et al., 2016). Here we present evidence that &lt;i&gt;Guy1&lt;/i&gt; increases X gene expression in &lt;i&gt;Guy1&lt;/i&gt;-transgenic females from two independent lines, providing a mechanism underlying the &lt;i&gt;Guy1&lt;/i&gt;-conferred female lethality. The median level gene expression (MGE) of X-linked genes is significantly higher than autosomal genes in &lt;i&gt;Guy1&lt;/i&gt;-transgenic females while there is no significant difference in MGE between X and autosomal genes in wild type females. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;Guy1&lt;/i&gt; significantly up-regulates at least 40% of the 996 genes across the X chromosome in transgenic females. &lt;i&gt;Guy1&lt;/i&gt;-conferred female-specific lethality is remarkably stable and completely penetrant. These findings indicate that &lt;i&gt;Guy1&lt;/i&gt; regulates dosage compensation in &lt;i&gt;An. stephensi&lt;/i&gt; and components of dosage compensation may be explored to develop novel strategies to control mosquito-borne diseases.</description>

	<description>Nucleosomes restrict the occupancy of most transcription factors (TF) by reducing binding and accelerating dissociation, while a small group of TFs have high affinities to nucleosome-embedded sites and facilitate nucleosome displacement. To mechanistically understand this process, we investigated two &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae &lt;/i&gt;TFs, Reb1 and Cbf1. We show these factors bind their sites within nucleosomes with similar affinities to naked DNA, trapping a partially unwrapped nucleosome without histone eviction. Both the binding and dissociation rates of Reb1 and Cbf1 are significantly slower at the nucleosomal sites relative to DNA, demonstrating that the high affinities are achieved by increasing the dwell time on nucleosomes to compensate for reduced binding. Reb1 also shows slow migration rate in the yeast nuclei. These properties are similar to human pioneer factors (PFs), suggesting the mechanism of nucleosome targeting is conserved from yeast to human.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42627</link>
	<description>This study sought to evaluate the performance of metabolic gestational age estimation models developed in Ontario, Canada in infants born in Bangladesh. Cord and heel prick blood spots were collected in Bangladesh and analyzed at a newborn screening facility in Ottawa, Canada. Algorithm-derived estimates of gestational age and preterm birth were compared to ultrasound-validated estimates. 1036 cord blood and 487 heel prick samples were collected from 1069 unique newborns. The majority of samples (93.2% of heel prick and 89.9% of cord blood) were collected from term infants. When applied to heel prick data, algorithms correctly estimated gestational age to within an average deviation of 1 week overall (root mean square error = 1.07 weeks). Metabolic gestational age estimation provides accurate population-level estimates of gestational age in this data set. Models were effective on data obtained from both heel prick and cord blood, the latter being a more feasible option in low-resource settings.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40529</link>
	<description>&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; parasites possess a protein with homology to Niemann-Pick Type C1 proteins (Niemann-Pick Type C1-Related protein, NCR1). We isolated parasites with resistance-conferring mutations in &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; NCR1 (PfNCR1) during selections with three diverse small-molecule antimalarial compounds and show that the mutations are causative for compound resistance. PfNCR1 protein knockdown results in severely attenuated growth and confers hypersensitivity to the compounds. Compound treatment or protein knockdown leads to increased sensitivity of the parasite plasma membrane (PPM) to the amphipathic glycoside saponin and engenders digestive vacuoles (DVs) that are small and malformed. Immuno-electron microscopy and split-GFP experiments localize PfNCR1 to the PPM. Our experiments show that PfNCR1 activity is critically important for the composition of the PPM and is required for DV biogenesis, suggesting PfNCR1 as a novel antimalarial drug target.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38371</link>
	<description>Humans can run without falling down, usually despite uneven terrain or occasional pushes. Even without such external perturbations, intrinsic sources like sensorimotor noise perturb the running motion incessantly, making each step variable. Here, using simple and generalizable models, we show that even such small step-to-step variability contains considerable information about strategies used to run stably. Deviations in the center of mass motion predict the corrective strategies during the next stance, well in advance of foot touchdown. Horizontal motion is stabilized by total leg impulse modulations, whereas the vertical motion is stabilized by differentially modulating the impulse within stance. We implement these human-derived control strategies on a simple computational biped, showing that it runs stably for hundreds of steps despite incessant noise-like perturbations or larger discrete perturbations. This running controller derived from natural variability echoes behaviors observed in previous animal and robot studies.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Switching From Fear to No Fear by Different Neural Ensembles in Mouse Retrosplenial Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Fear extinction is generally considered a form of new learning that inhibits previously acquired fear memories. Here, by tracking immediate early gene expression in vivo, we found that contextual fear extinction training evoked distinct neural ensembles in mouse retrosplenial cortex (RSC). The optogenetic reactivation of these extinction-activated neurons in the RSC was sufficient to suppress a fear response, while the reactivation of conditioning-activated neurons in the same area promoted a fear response. The generation of such an extinction-memory-related neural ensemble was associated with adult neurogenesis, as abolishing newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus via X-ray irradiation eliminated both the extinction-activated neurons in the RSC and the optogenetic-reactivation-induced suppression of contextual fear memory. Therefore, switching from fear to no fear in response to the same context is modulated by the RSC through an extinction-activated neural ensemble, the generation of which might require adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neurostimulation Reveals Context-Dependent Arbitration Between Model-Based and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;While it is established that humans use model-based (MB) and model-free (MF) reinforcement learning in a complementary fashion, much less is known about how the brain determines which of these systems should control behavior at any given moment. Here we provide causal evidence for a neural mechanism that acts as a context-dependent arbitrator between both systems. We applied excitatory and inhibitory transcranial direct current stimulation over a region of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex previously found to encode the reliability of both learning systems. The opposing neural interventions resulted in a bidirectional shift of control between MB and MF learning. Stimulation also affected the sensitivity of the arbitration mechanism itself, as it changed how often subjects switched between the dominant system over time. Both of these effects depended on varying task contexts that either favored MB or MF control, indicating that this arbitration mechanism is not context-invariant but flexibly incorporates information about current environmental demands.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The mechanism by which hepatitis C virus (HCV) gains entry into cells is a complex one, involving a broad range of host proteins. Entry is a critical phase of the viral lifecycle, and a potential target for therapeutic or vaccine-mediated intervention. However, the mechanics of HCV entry remain poorly understood. Here we describe a novel computational model of viral entry, encompassing the relationship between HCV and the key host receptors CD81 and SR-B1. We conduct experiments to thoroughly quantify the influence of an increase or decrease in receptor availability upon the extent of viral entry. We use these data to build and parameterise a mathematical model, which we then validate by further experiments. Our results are consistent with sequential HCV-receptor interactions, whereby initial interaction between the HCV E2 glycoprotein and SR-B1 facilitates the accumulation CD81 receptors, leading to viral entry. However, we also demonstrate that a small minority of virus can achieve entry in the absence of SR-B1. Our model estimates the impact of the different obstacles that viruses must surmount to achieve entry; among virus particles attaching to the cell surface, around one third of viruses accumulate sufficient CD81 receptors, of which 4–8% then complete the subsequent steps to achieve productive infection. Furthermore, we make estimates of receptor stoichiometry; in excess of 10 receptors are likely to be required to achieve viral entry. Our model provides a tool to investigate the entry characteristics of HCV variants and outlines a framework for future quantitative studies of the multi-receptor dynamics of HCV entry.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/z-aktaoyIsc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Multipartite viruses replicate through a puzzling evolutionary strategy. Their genome is segmented into two or more parts, and encapsidated in separate particles that appear to propagate independently. Completing the replication cycle, however, requires the full genome, so that a systemic infection of a host requires the concurrent presence of several particles. This represents an apparent evolutionary drawback of multipartitism, while its advantages remain unclear. A transition from monopartite to multipartite viral forms has been described &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; under conditions of high multiplicity of infection, suggesting that cooperation between defective mutants is a plausible evolutionary pathway towards multipartitism. However, it is unknown how the putative advantages that multipartitism might enjoy at the microscopic level affect its epidemiology, or if an explicit advantange is needed to explain its ecological persistence. In order to disentangle which mechanisms might contribute to the rise and fixation of multipartitism, we here investigate the interaction between viral spreading dynamics and host population structure. We set up a compartmental model of the spread of a virus in its different forms and explore its epidemiology using both analytical and numerical techniques. We uncover that the impact of host contact structure on spreading dynamics entails a rich phenomenology of ecological relationships that includes cooperation, competition, and commensality. Furthermore, we find out that multipartitism might rise to fixation even in the absence of explicit microscopic advantages. Multipartitism allows the virus to colonize environments that could not be invaded by the monopartite form, while homogeneous contacts between hosts facilitate its spread. We conjecture that these features might have led to an increase in the diversity and prevalence of multipartite viral forms concomitantly with the expansion of agricultural practices.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JYfD-zG8_Sk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Visual pattern detection and discrimination are essential first steps for scene analysis. Numerous human psychophysical studies have modeled visual pattern detection and discrimination by estimating linear templates for classifying noisy stimuli defined by spatial variations in pixel intensities. However, such methods are poorly suited to understanding sensory processing mechanisms for complex visual stimuli such as second-order boundaries defined by spatial differences in contrast or texture. We introduce a novel machine learning framework for modeling human perception of second-order visual stimuli, using image-computable hierarchical neural network models fit directly to psychophysical trial data. This framework is applied to modeling visual processing of boundaries defined by differences in the contrast of a carrier texture pattern, in two different psychophysical tasks: (1) boundary orientation identification, and (2) fine orientation discrimination. Cross-validation analysis is employed to optimize model hyper-parameters, and demonstrate that these models are able to accurately predict human performance on novel stimulus sets not used for fitting model parameters. We find that, like the ideal observer, human observers take a region-based approach to the orientation identification task, while taking an edge-based approach to the fine orientation discrimination task. How observers integrate contrast modulation across orientation channels is investigated by fitting psychophysical data with two models representing competing hypotheses, revealing a preference for a model which combines multiple orientations at the earliest possible stage. Our results suggest that this machine learning approach has much potential to advance the study of second-order visual processing, and we outline future steps towards generalizing the method to modeling visual segmentation of natural texture boundaries. This study demonstrates how machine learning methodology can be fruitfully applied to psychophysical studies of second-order visual processing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mXErxRfGs4Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We use stochastic neural field theory to analyze the stimulus-dependent tuning of neural variability in ring attractor networks. We apply perturbation methods to show how the neural field equations can be reduced to a pair of stochastic nonlinear phase equations describing the stochastic wandering of spontaneously formed tuning curves or bump solutions. These equations are analyzed using a modified version of the bivariate von Mises distribution, which is well-known in the theory of circular statistics. We first consider a single ring network and derive a simple mathematical expression that accounts for the experimentally observed bimodal (or M-shaped) tuning of neural variability. We then explore the effects of inter-network coupling on stimulus-dependent variability in a pair of ring networks. These could represent populations of cells in two different layers of a cortical hypercolumn linked via vertical synaptic connections, or two different cortical hypercolumns linked by horizontal patchy connections within the same layer. We find that neural variability can be suppressed or facilitated, depending on whether the inter-network coupling is excitatory or inhibitory, and on the relative strengths and biases of the external stimuli to the two networks. These results are consistent with the general observation that increasing the mean firing rate via external stimuli or modulating drives tends to reduce neural variability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YRSKMlstR3Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Self-organization of conducting pathways explains electrical wave propagation in cardiac tissues with high fraction of non-conducting cells</title>

Cardiac fibrosis occurs in many forms of heart disease and is considered to be one of the main arrhythmogenic factors. Regions with a high density of fibroblasts are likely to cause blocks of wave propagation that give rise to dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. Therefore, studies of the wave propagation through these regions are very important, yet the precise mechanisms leading to arrhythmia formation in fibrotic cardiac tissue remain poorly understood. Particularly, it is not clear how wave propagation is organized at the cellular level, as experiments show that the regions with a high percentage of fibroblasts (65-75%) are still conducting electrical signals, whereas geometric analysis of randomly distributed conducting and non-conducting cells predicts connectivity loss at 40% at the most (percolation threshold). To address this question, we used a joint &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; approach, which combined experiments in neonatal rat cardiac monolayers with morphological and electrophysiological computer simulations. We have shown that the main reason for sustainable wave propagation in highly fibrotic samples is the formation of a branching network of cardiomyocytes. We have successfully reproduced the morphology of conductive pathways in computer modelling, assuming that cardiomyocytes align their cytoskeletons to fuse into cardiac syncytium. The electrophysiological properties of the monolayers, such as conduction velocity, conduction blocks and wave fractionation, were reproduced as well. In a virtual cardiac tissue, we have also examined the wave propagation at the subcellular level, detected wavebreaks formation and its relation to the structure of fibrosis and, thus, analysed the processes leading to the onset of arrhythmias.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oJ7vIl7BoVg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether high‐frequency oscillations (HFOs) show spatiotemporal propagation and assess the relevance of the earliest oscillations in relation to the seizure onset zone (SOZ) and postsurgical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We retrospectively investigated the intracerebral electroencephalography (EEG) of patients who became seizure free after subsequent surgery. We marked HFOs during 1 hour of recordings. We calculated the time delay between pairs of channels as the median delay between their HFOs and constructed a time line of the delay of each channel with respect to the earliest channel (first source channel). A network was defined when a temporal order could be established among the channels based on the existence of statistically significant delays.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen patients with good surgical outcome were included. We found ripple networks in all patients, and fast ripple networks in 9. For ripples, first source channels were found in a higher proportion in the SOZ than the rest of the network channels (15 of 27 [56%] versus 93 of 262 [35%]; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04). For both ripples and fast ripples, first source channels were resected more often that the rest of the network channels (ripples: 13 of 27 [48%] versus 65 of 262 [25%]; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01; fast ripples: 8 of 9 [89%] versus 17 of 40 [43%]; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002); channels with the highest rates of ripples and fast ripples were resected in a similar proportion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate that interictal HFOs are organized in networks and indicate a possible need for the resection of first source channels. However, resecting them is not superior to resecting channels with highest rates of HFOs. Ann Neurol, 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence from Alzheimer disease supports a potentially beneficial role of slow‐wave sleep in neurodegeneration. However, the importance of slow‐wave sleep in Parkinson disease is unknown. In 129 patients with Parkinson disease, we retrospectively tested whether sleep slow waves, objectively quantified with polysomnography, relate to longitudinal changes in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores. We found that higher accumulated power of sleep slow waves was associated with slower motor progression, particularly of axial motor symptoms, over a mean time of 4.6±2.3 years. This preliminary finding suggests that deeper sleep relates to slower motor progression in Parkinson disease.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Magnetoreception, the perception of the geomagnetic field, is a sensory modality well-established across all major groups of vertebrates and some invertebrates, but its presence in humans has been tested rarely, yielding inconclusive results. We report here a strong, specific human brain response to ecologically-relevant rotations of Earth-strength magnetic fields. Following geomagnetic stimulation, a drop in amplitude of EEG alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) occurred in a repeatable manner. Termed alpha event-related desynchronization (alpha-ERD), such a response has been associated previously with sensory and cognitive processing of external stimuli including vision, auditory and somatosensory cues. Alpha-ERD in response to the geomagnetic field was triggered only by horizontal rotations when the static vertical magnetic field was directed downwards, as it is in the Northern Hemisphere; no brain responses were elicited by the same horizontal rotations when the static vertical component was directed upwards. This implicates a biological response tuned to the ecology of the local human population, rather than a generic physical effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biophysical tests showed that the neural response was sensitive to static components of the magnetic field. This rules out all forms of electrical induction (including artifacts from the electrodes) which are determined solely on dynamic components of the field. The neural response was also sensitive to the polarity of the magnetic field. This rules out free-radical 'quantum compass' mechanisms like the cryptochrome hypothesis, which can detect only axial alignment. Ferromagnetism remains a viable biophysical mechanism for sensory transduction and provides a basis to start the behavioral exploration of human magnetoreception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Although many migrating and homing animals are sensitive to Earth’s magnetic field, most humans are not consciously aware of the geomagnetic stimuli that we encounter in everyday life. Either we have lost a shared, ancestral magnetosensory system, or the system lacks a conscious component with detectable neural activity but no apparent perceptual awareness by us. We found two classes of ecologically-relevant rotations of Earth-strength magnetic fields that produce strong, specific and repeatable effects on human brainwave activity in the EEG alpha band (8-13 Hz); EEG discriminates in response to different geomagnetic field stimuli. Biophysical tests rule out all except the presence of a ferromagnetic transduction element, such as biologically-precipitated crystals of magnetite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>The neocortex is functionally organized into layers. Layer four receives the densest bottom up sensory inputs, while layers 2/3 and 5 receive top down inputs that may convey predictive information. A subset of cortical somatostatin (SST) neurons, the Martinotti cells, gate top down input by inhibiting the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in layers 2/3 and 5, but it is unknown whether an analogous inhibitory mechanism controls activity in layer 4. Using high precision circuit mapping, in vivo optogenetic perturbations, and single cell transcriptional profiling, we reveal complementary circuits in the mouse barrel cortex involving genetically distinct SST subtypes that specifically and reciprocally interconnect with excitatory cells in different layers: Martinotti cells connect with layers 2/3 and 5, whereas non-Martinotti cells connect with layer 4. By enforcing layer-specific inhibition, these parallel SST subnetworks could independently regulate the balance between bottom up and top down input.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Behavioural and neural signatures of perceptual decision-making are modulated by pupil-linked arousal</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42541</link>
	<description>The timing and accuracy of perceptual decision-making is exquisitely sensitive to fluctuations in arousal. Although extensive research has highlighted the role of various neural processing stages in forming decisions, our understanding of how arousal impacts these processes remains limited. Here we isolated electrophysiological signatures of decision-making alongside signals reflecting target selection, attentional engagement and motor output and examined their modulation as a function of tonic and phasic arousal, indexed by baseline and task-evoked pupil diameter, respectively. Reaction times were shorter on trials with lower tonic, and higher phasic arousal. Additionally, these two pupil measures were predictive of a unique set of EEG signatures that together represent multiple information processing steps of decision-making. Finally, behavioural variability associated with fluctuations in tonic and phasic arousal, indicative of neuromodulators acting on multiple timescales, was mediated by its effects on the EEG markers of attentional engagement, sensory processing and the variability in decision processing.</description>

	<description>SNAP-25 is an essential component of SNARE complexes driving fast Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent exocytosis. Yet, the functional implications of the tandem-like structure of SNAP-25 are unclear. Here, we have investigated the mechanistic role of the acylated “linker” domain that concatenates the two SNARE motifs within SNAP-25. Refuting older concepts of an inert connector, our detailed structure-function analysis in murine chromaffin cells demonstrates that linker motifs play a crucial role in vesicle priming, triggering, and fusion pore expansion. Mechanistically, we identify two synergistic functions of the SNAP-25 linker: First, linker motifs support t-SNARE interactions and accelerate ternary complex assembly. Second, the acylated N-terminal linker segment engages in local lipid interactions that facilitate fusion triggering and pore evolution, putatively establishing a favorable membrane configuration by shielding phospholipid headgroups and affecting curvature. Hence, the linker is a functional part of the fusion complex that promotes secretion by SNARE interactions as well as concerted lipid interplay.</description>

	<description>FMRI studies investigating the acquisition of sequential motor skills in humans have revealed learning-related functional reorganizations of the cortico-striatal and cortico-cerebellar motor systems accompanied with an initial hippocampal contribution. Yet, the functional significance of these activity level changes remains ambiguous as they convey the evolution of both sequence-specific knowledge and unspecific task ability. Moreover, these changes do not specifically assess the occurrence of learning-related plasticity. To address these issues, we investigated local circuits tuning to sequence-specific information using multivariate distances between patterns evoked by consolidated or newly acquired motor sequences production. The results reveal that representations in dorsolateral striatum, prefrontal and secondary motor cortices are greater when executing consolidated sequences than untrained ones. By contrast, sequence representations in the hippocampus and dorsomedial striatum becomes less engaged. Our findings show, for the first time in humans, that complementary sequence-specific motor representations evolve distinctively during critical phases of skill acquisition and consolidation.</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Maternal stress during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of psychiatric disorders in offspring, but embryonic brain mechanisms disrupted by prenatal stress are not fully understood. Our lab has shown that prenatal stress delays inhibitory neural progenitor migration. Here, we investigated redox dysregulation as a mechanism for embryonic cortical interneuron migration delay, utilizing direct manipulation of pro- and antioxidants and a mouse model of maternal repetitive restraint stress starting on embryonic day 12. Time-lapse, live-imaging of migrating GAD67GFP+ interneurons showed that normal tangential migration of inhibitory progenitor cells was disrupted by the pro-oxidant, hydrogen peroxide. Interneuron migration was also delayed by in utero intracerebroventricular rotenone. Prenatal stress altered glutathione levels and induced changes in activity of antioxidant enzymes and expression of redox-related genes in the embryonic forebrain. Assessment of dihydroethidium (DHE) fluorescence after prenatal stress in ganglionic eminence (GE), the source of migrating interneurons, showed increased levels of DHE oxidation. Maternal antioxidants (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;-acetylcysteine and astaxanthin) normalized DHE oxidation levels in GE and ameliorated the migration delay caused by prenatal stress. Through convergent redox manipula-tions, delayed interneuron migration after prenatal stress was found to critically involve redox dysregulation. Redox biology during prenatal periods may be a target for protecting brain development.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Hyperpolarization-Activated HCN4 Channel is Important for Proper Maintenance of Oscillatory Activity in the Thalamocortical System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz047</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz047/5382209?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Hyperpolarization-activated cation channels are involved, among other functions, in learning and memory, control of synaptic transmission and epileptogenesis. The importance of the HCN1 and HCN2 isoforms for brain function has been demonstrated, while the role of HCN4, the third major neuronal HCN subunit, is not known. Here we show that HCN4 is essential for oscillatory activity in the thalamocortical (TC) network. HCN4 is selectively expressed in various thalamic nuclei, excluding the thalamic reticular nucleus. HCN4-deficient TC neurons revealed a massive reduction of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Ih&lt;/span&gt; and strongly reduced intrinsic burst firing, whereas the current was normal in cortical pyramidal neurons. In addition, evoked bursting in a thalamic slice preparation was strongly reduced in the mutant mice probes. HCN4-deficiency also significantly slowed down thalamic and cortical oscillations during active wakefulness. Taken together, these results establish that thalamic HCN4 channels are essential for the production of rhythmic intrathalamic oscillations and determine regular TC oscillatory activity during alert states.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Prefrontal Cortical and Behavioral Adaptations to Surgical Delivery Mediated by Metabolic Principles</title>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz046/5382210?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We previously observed an association between mode of delivery and brain mitochondrial mechanisms in pups. We also showed that mitochondrial processes impact adult behavior. However, no experimental data is available to causally connect mode of delivery with cellular processes of neurons in the cerebral cortex and adult behavior. Here we show that surgical delivery of pups alters mitochondrial dynamics and spine synapses of layer 3 pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex compared to the values of mice delivered vaginally. These alterations in ultrastructure seen in adult mice delivered surgically were associated with the development of behavioral phenotypes resembling those characteristic of animal models of psychiatric illness. This included impaired performance in prepulse inhibition as well as hyperlocomotion in the open field and elevated plus maze tests. Knocking out a mitochondria-related gene, UCP-2, blocked cellular and behavioral adaptations induced by surgical delivery. These results highlight a crucial role for brain mitochondrial adaptations in the process of birth to affect neuronal circuitry in support of normal and altered adult behaviors. Further, these findings were supported with neuroimaging data from human neonates delivered vaginally and surgically, suggesting that the murine findings have human clinical relevance.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Corticostriatal Circuits Encode the Subjective Value of Perceived Control</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz045</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The ability to perceive and exercise control over an outcome is both desirable and beneficial to our well-being. It has been shown that animals and humans alike exhibit behavioral bias towards seeking control and that such bias recruits the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and striatum. Yet, this bias remains to be quantitatively captured and studied neurally. Here, we employed a behavioral task to measure the preference for control and characterize its neural underpinnings. Participants made a series of binary choices between having control and no-control over a game for monetary reward. The mere presence of the control option evoked activity in the ventral striatum. Importantly, we manipulated the expected value (EV) of each choice pair to extract the pairing where participants were equally likely to choose either option. The difference in EV between the options at this point of equivalence was inferred as the subjective value of control. Strikingly, perceiving control inflated the reward value of the associated option by 30% and this value inflation was tracked by the vmPFC. Altogether, these results capture the subjective value of perceived control inherent in decision making and highlight the role of corticostriatal circuitry in the perception of control.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Dynamic Causal Modeling of the Relationship between Cognition and Theta–alpha Oscillations in Adults with Down Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz043</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz043/5382204?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) show high inter-subject variability in cognitive ability and have an ultra-high risk of developing dementia (90% lifetime prevalence). Elucidating factors underlying variability in cognitive function can inform us about intellectual disability (ID) and may improve our understanding of factors associated with later cognitive decline. Increased neuronal inhibition has been posited to contribute to ID in DS. Combining electroencephalography (EEG) with dynamic causal modeling (DCM) provides a non-invasive method for investigating excitatory/inhibitory mechanisms. Resting-state EEG recordings were obtained from 36 adults with DS with no evidence of cognitive decline. Theta–alpha activity (4–13 Hz) was characterized in relation to general cognitive ability (raw Kaufmann’s Brief Intelligence Test second Edition (KBIT-2) score). Higher KBIT-2 was associated with higher frontal alpha peak amplitude and higher theta–alpha band power across distributed regions. Modeling this association with DCM revealed intrinsic self-inhibition was the key network parameter underlying observed differences in 4–13 Hz power in relation to KBIT-2 and age. In particular, intrinsic self-inhibition in right V1 was negatively correlated with KBIT-2. Results suggest intrinsic self-inhibition within the alpha network is associated with individual differences in cognitive ability in adults with DS, and may provide a potential therapeutic target for cognitive enhancement.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: When Conflict Cannot be Avoided: Relative Contributions of Early Selection and Frontal Executive Control in Mitigating Stroop Conflict</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz042</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz042/5382203?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;When viewing familiar stimuli (e.g., common words), processing is highly automatized such that it can interfere with the processing of incompatible sensory information. At least two mechanisms may help mitigate this interference. Early selection accounts posit that attentional processes filter out distracting sensory information to avoid conflict. Alternatively, late selection accounts hold that all sensory inputs receive full semantic analysis and that frontal executive mechanisms are recruited to resolve conflict. To test how these mechanisms operate to overcome conflict induced by highly automatized processing, we developed a novel version of the color-word Stroop task, where targets and distractors were simultaneously flickered at different frequencies. We measured the quality of early sensory processing by assessing the amplitude of steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by targets and distractors. We also indexed frontal executive processes by assessing changes in frontal theta oscillations induced by color-word incongruency. We found that target- and distractor-related SSVEPs were not modulated by changes in the level of conflict whereas frontal theta activity increased on high compared to low conflict trials. These results suggest that frontal executive processes play a more dominant role in mitigating cognitive interference driven by the automatic tendency to process highly familiar stimuli.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Phosphodiesterase 1 Bridges Glutamate Inputs with NO- and Dopamine-Induced Cyclic Nucleotide Signals in the Striatum</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz041</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz041/5382205?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The calcium-regulated phosphodiesterase 1 (PDE1) family is highly expressed in the brain, but its functional role in neurones is poorly understood. Using the selective PDE1 inhibitor Lu AF64196 and biosensors for cyclic nucleotides including a novel biosensor for cGMP, we analyzed the effect of PDE1 on cAMP and cGMP in individual neurones in brain slices from male newborn mice. Release of caged NMDA triggered a transient increase of intracellular calcium, which was associated with a decrease in cAMP and cGMP in medium spiny neurones in the striatum. Lu AF64196 alone did not increase neuronal cyclic nucleotide levels, but blocked the NMDA-induced reduction in cyclic nucleotides indicating that this was mediated by calcium-activated PDE1. Similar effects were observed in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Upon corelease of dopamine and NMDA, PDE1 was shown to down-regulate the D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-receptor mediated increase in cAMP. PDE1 inhibition increased long-term potentiation in rat ventral striatum, showing that PDE1 is implicated in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. Overall, our results show that PDE1 reduces cyclic nucleotide signaling in the context of glutamate and dopamine coincidence. This effect could have a therapeutic value for treating brain disorders related to dysfunctions in dopamine neuromodulation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Premotor Cortex Provides a Substrate for the Temporal Transformation of Information During the Planning of Gait Modifications</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We tested the hypothesis that the premotor cortex (PMC) in the cat contributes to the planning and execution of visually guided gait modifications. We analyzed single unit activity from 136 cells localized within layer V of cytoarchitectonic areas 6iffu and that part of 4δ within the ventral bank of the cruciate sulcus while cats walked on a treadmill and stepped over an obstacle that advanced toward them. We found a rich variety of discharge patterns, ranging from limb-independent cells that discharged several steps in front of the obstacle to step-related cells that discharged either during steps over the obstacle or in the steps leading up to that step. We propose that this population of task-related cells within this region of the PMC contributes to the temporal evolution of a planning process that transforms global information of the presence of an obstacle into the precise spatio-temporal limb adjustment required to negotiate that obstacle.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: No Evidence that Predictions and Attention Modulate the First Feedforward Sweep of Cortical Information Processing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz038</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz038/5382202?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Predictive coding models propose that predictions (stimulus likelihood) reduce sensory signals as early as primary visual cortex (V1), and that attention (stimulus relevance) can modulate these effects. Indeed, both prediction and attention have been shown to modulate V1 activity, albeit with fMRI, which has low temporal resolution. This leaves it unclear whether these effects reflect a modulation of the first feedforward sweep of visual information processing and/or later, feedback-related activity. In two experiments, we used electroencephalography and orthogonally manipulated spatial predictions and attention to address this issue. Although clear top-down biases were found, as reflected in pre-stimulus alpha-band activity, we found no evidence for top-down effects on the earliest visual cortical processing stage (&amp;lt;80 ms post-stimulus), as indexed by the amplitude of the C1 event-related potential component and multivariate pattern analyses. These findings indicate that initial visual afferent activity may be impenetrable to top-down influences by spatial prediction and attention.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Acute Inescapable Stress Rapidly Increases Synaptic Energy Metabolism in Prefrontal Cortex and Alters Working Memory Performance</title>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz034/5382201?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Brain energy metabolism actively regulates synaptic transmission and activity. We have previously shown that acute footshock (FS)-stress induces fast and long-lasting functional and morphological changes at excitatory synapses in prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here, we asked whether FS-stress increased energy metabolism in PFC, and modified related cognitive functions. Using positron emission tomography (PET), we found that FS-stress induced a redistribution of glucose metabolism in the brain, with relative decrease of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake in ventro-caudal regions and increase in dorso-rostral ones. Absolute [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake was inversely correlated with serum corticosterone. Increased specific hexokinase activity was also measured in purified PFC synaptosomes (but not in total extract) of FS-stressed rats, which positively correlated with 2-Deoxy [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H] glucose uptake by synaptosomes. In line with increased synaptic energy demand, using an electron microscopy-based stereological approach, we found that acute stress induced a redistribution of mitochondria at excitatory synapses, together with an increase in their volume. The fast functional and metabolic activation of PFC induced by acute stress, was accompanied by rapid and sustained alterations of working memory performance in delayed response to T-maze test. Taken together, the present data suggest that acute stress increases energy consumption at PFC synaptic terminals and alters working memory.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Reduced Hippocampal Dendrite Branching, Spine Density and Neurocognitive Function in Premature Rabbits, and Reversal with Estrogen or TrkB Agonist Treatment</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Preterm-born children suffer from neurological and behavioral disorders. Herein, we hypothesized that premature birth and non-maternal care of preterm newborns might disrupt neurobehavioral function, hippocampal dendritic arborization, and dendritic spine density. Additionally, we assessed whether 17β-estradiol (E2) replacement or the TrkB receptor agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF), would reverse compromised dendritic development and cognitive function in preterm newborns. These hypotheses were tested by comparing preterm (E28.5) rabbit kits cared and gavage-fed by laboratory personnel and term-kits reared and breast-fed by their mother doe at an equivalent postconceptional age. Neurobehavioral tests showed that both premature-birth and formula-feeding with non-maternal care led to increased anxiety behavior, poor social interaction, and lack of novelty preference compared with term-kits. Dendritic branching and number of total or mushroom dendritic spines were reduced in the CA1 field of preterm-kits compared with term controls. While CDC42 and Rac1/2/3 expression levels were lower, RhoA-activity was higher in preterm-kits compared with term controls. Both E2 and DHF treatment reversed prematurity-induced reduction in spine density, reduced total RhoA-GTPase levels, and enhanced cognitive function. Hence, prematurity and non-maternal care result in cognitive deficits, and reduced dendritic arbors and spines in CA1. E2 replacement or DHF treatment might reverse changes in dendritic spines and improve neurodevelopment in premature infants.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Deletion of the KH1 Domain of Fmr1 Leads to Transcriptional Alterations and Attentional Deficits in Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;FMR1&lt;/span&gt; gene. It is a leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder and inherited intellectual disability and is often comorbid with attention deficits. Most FXS cases are due to an expansion of CGG repeats leading to suppressed expression of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein involved in mRNA metabolism. We found that the previously published &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fmr1&lt;/span&gt; knockout rat model of FXS expresses an &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fmr1&lt;/span&gt; transcript with an in-frame deletion of exon 8, which encodes for the K-homology (KH) RNA-binding domain, KH1. Notably, 3 pathogenic missense mutations associated with FXS lie in the KH domains. We observed that the deletion of exon 8 in rats leads to attention deficits and to alterations in transcriptional profiles within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which map to 2 weighted gene coexpression network modules. These modules are conserved in human frontal cortex and enriched for known FMRP targets. Hub genes in these modules represent potential therapeutic targets for FXS. Taken together, these findings indicate that attentional testing might be a reliable cross-species tool for investigating FXS and identify dysregulated conserved gene networks in a relevant brain region.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Alterations in cognitive performance have been noted in nondemented subjects with elevated accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) fibrils. However, it is not yet understood whether brain function is already influenced by Aβ deposition during the very earliest stages of the disease. We therefore investigated associations between [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]Flutemetamol PET, resting-state functional connectivity, gray and white matter structure and cognitive performance in 133 cognitively normal elderly that exhibited normal global Aβ PET levels. [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]Flutemetamol uptake in regions known to accumulate Aβ fibrils early in preclinical AD (i.e., mainly certain parts of the default-mode network) was positively associated with dynamic but not static functional connectivity (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; = 0.77). Dynamic functional connectivity was further related to better cognitive performance (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; = 0.21–0.72). No significant associations were found for Aβ uptake with gray matter volume or white matter diffusivity. The findings demonstrate that the earliest accumulation of Aβ fibrils is associated with increased functional connectivity, which occurs before any structural alterations. The enhanced functional connectivity may reflect a compensatory mechanism to maintain high cognitive performance in the presence of increasing amyloid accumulation during the earliest phases of AD.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Social interactions are fundamental to survival and overall health. The mechanisms underlying social behavior are complex, but we now know that immune signaling plays a fundamental role in the regulation of social interactions. Prolonged or exaggerated alterations in social behavior often accompany altered immune signaling and function in pathological states. Thus, unraveling the link between social behavior and immune signaling is a fundamental challenge, not only to advance our understanding of human health and development, but for the design of comprehensive therapeutic approaches for neural disorders.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Boolean model of growth signaling, cell cycle and apoptosis predicts the molecular mechanism of aberrant cell cycle progression driven by hyperactive &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006402</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Herbert Sizek, Andrew Hamel, Dávid Deritei, Sarah Campbell, Erzsébet Ravasz Regan&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;AKT&lt;/i&gt; signaling pathway plays a role in most cellular functions linked to cancer progression, including cell growth, proliferation, cell survival, tissue invasion and angiogenesis. It is generally recognized that hyperactive &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;AKT&lt;/i&gt; are oncogenic due to their boost to cell survival, cell cycle entry and growth-promoting metabolism. That said, the dynamics of &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;AKT1&lt;/i&gt; during cell cycle progression are highly nonlinear. In addition to negative feedback that curtails their activity, protein expression of &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; subunits has been shown to oscillate in dividing cells. The low-&lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;/low-&lt;i&gt;AKT1&lt;/i&gt; phase of these oscillations is required for cytokinesis, indicating that oncogenic &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; may directly contribute to genome duplication. To explore this, we construct a Boolean model of growth factor signaling that can reproduce &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; oscillations and link them to cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The resulting modular model reproduces hyperactive &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;-driven cytokinesis failure and genome duplication and predicts the molecular drivers responsible for these failures by linking hyperactive &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; to mis-regulation of Polo-like kinase 1 (&lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt;) expression late in G2. To do this, our model captures the role of &lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt; in cell cycle progression and accurately reproduces multiple effects of its loss: G2 arrest, mitotic catastrophe, chromosome mis-segregation / aneuploidy due to premature anaphase, and cytokinesis failure leading to genome duplication, depending on the timing of &lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt; inhibition along the cell cycle. Finally, we offer testable predictions on the molecular drivers of &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; oscillations, the timing of these oscillations with respect to division, and the role of altered &lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FoxO&lt;/i&gt; activity in genome-level defects caused by hyperactive &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;. Our model is an important starting point for the predictive modeling of cell fate decisions that include &lt;i&gt;AKT1&lt;/i&gt;-driven senescence, as well as the non-intuitive effects of drugs that interfere with mitosis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WyFcUBh-Z_Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Inverted encoding models reconstruct an arbitrary model response, not the stimulus</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Probing how large populations of neurons represent stimuli is key to understanding sensory representations as many stimulus characteristics can only be discerned from population activity and not from individual single-units. Recently, inverted encoding models have been used to produce channel response functions from large spatial-scale measurements of human brain activity that are reminiscent of single-unit tuning functions and have been proposed to assay &quot;population-level stimulus representations&quot; (Sprague et al., 2018a). However, these channel response functions do not assay population tuning. We show by derivation that the channel response function is only determined up to an invertible linear transform. Thus these channel response functions are arbitrary, one of an infinite family and therefore not a unique description of population representation. Indeed, simulations demonstrate that bimodal, even random, channel basis functions can account perfectly well for population responses without any underlying neural response units that are so tuned. However, the approach can be salvaged by extending it to reconstruct the stimulus, not the assumed model. We show that when this is done, even using bimodal and random channel basis functions, a unimodal function peaking at the appropriate value of the stimulus is recovered which can be interpreted as a measure of population selectivity. More precisely, the recovered function signifies how likely any value of the stimulus is, given the observed population response. Whether an analysis is recovering the hypothetical responses of an arbitrary model rather than assessing the selectivity of population representations is not an issue unique to the inverted encoding model and human neuroscience, but a general problem that must be confronted as more complex analyses intervene between measurement of population activity and presentation of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We recently showed that inverted encoding models conflate signal to noise ratio with neural tuning width. Sprague and colleagues argued that despite this short falling, inverted encoding models &quot;assay population-level stimulus representations&quot;. However, we show that inverted encoding models reconstruct the model responses, not the stimulus. This is problematic because the model, as we derive here, is only determined up to a linear transform and thus the recovered model responses are only one of an infinite family of equivalent solutions. The approach thus fails to provide a unique assay of population representation. This problem can be circumvented by extending the approach to estimate the probability of different values of the stimulus, thus resulting in an interpretable assay of population representation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Sign Tracking and Goal Tracking Are Characterized by Distinct Patterns of Nucleus Accumbens Activity</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;During Pavlovian conditioning, if a cue (e.g., lever extension) predicts reward delivery in a different location (e.g., a food magazine), some individuals will come to approach and interact with the cue, a behavior known as sign tracking (ST), and others will approach the site of reward, a behavior known as goal tracking (GT). In rats, the acquisition of ST versus GT behavior is associated with distinct profiles of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but it is unknown whether it is associated with different patterns of accumbens neural activity. Therefore, we recorded from individual neurons in the NAc core during the acquisition, maintenance, and extinction of ST and GT behavior. Even though NAc dopamine is specifically important for the acquisition and expression of ST, we found that cue-evoked excitatory responses encode the vigor of both ST and GT behavior. In contrast, among sign trackers only, there was a prominent decrease in reward-related activity over the course of training, which may reflect the decreasing reward prediction error encoded by phasic dopamine. Finally, both behavior and cue-evoked activity were relatively resistant to extinction in sign trackers, as compared with goal trackers, although a subset of neurons in both groups retained their cue-evoked responses. Overall, the results point to the convergence of multiple forms of reward learning in the NAc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, the first histone demethylase (HDM) was identified in 2004, challenging this notion. Since that time, more than 20 HDMs have been identified and characterized, and many have been shown to have critical roles in organismal development, cell fate, and disease. Here, we highlight some of the recent advances in our understanding of the function of HDMs in the context of neuronal development, plasticity, and disease. We focus, in particular, on molecular genetic studies of LSD1, Kdm6b, and Kdm5c that have elucidated both enzymatic and non-enzymatic gene regulatory functions of these HDMs in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While it is still not possible to describe the neural-level connections of
the human brain, we can map the human connectome with several hundred vertices,
by the application of diffusion-MRI based techniques. In these graphs, the
nodes correspond to anatomically identified gray matter areas of the brain,
while the edges correspond to the axonal fibers, connecting these areas. In our
previous contributions, we have described numerous graph-theoretical phenomena
of the human connectomes. Here we map the frequent complete subgraphs of the
human brain networks: in these subgraphs, every pair of vertices is connected
by an edge. We also examine sex differences in the results. The mapping of the
frequent subgraphs gives robust substructures in the graph: if a subgraph is
present in the 80\% of the graphs, then, most probably, it could not be an
artifact of the measurement or the data processing workflow. We list here the
frequent complete subgraphs of the female and the male braingraphs of 414
subjects, each with 463 nodes, with a frequency threshold of 80\%, and identify
complete subgraphs, which are more frequent in male and female connectomes,
respectively.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Recurrence required to capture the dynamic computations of the human ventral visual stream. (arXiv:1903.05946v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The visual system is an intricate network of brain regions that enables us to
recognize the world around us. Despite its abundant lateral and feedback
connections, human object processing is commonly viewed and studied as a
feedforward process. Here, we measure and model the rapid representational
dynamics across multiple stages of the human ventral stream using time-resolved
brain imaging and deep learning. We observe substantial representational
transformations during the first 300 ms of processing within and across
ventral-stream regions. Categorical divisions emerge in sequence, cascading
forward and in reverse across regions, and Granger causality analysis suggests
bidirectional information flow between regions. Finally, recurrent deep neural
network models clearly outperform feedforward models in terms of their ability
to jointly capture the multi-region cortical dynamics. These results establish
that recurrent models are required to understand information processing in the
human ventral stream.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Neural Basis and Evolution of Divergent and Convergent Thought. (arXiv:1611.03609v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03609</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03609</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This chapter takes as its departure point a neural level theory of insight
that arose from studies of the sparse, distributed, content-addressable
architecture of associative memory. It is argued that convergent thought is
most fruitfully characterized in terms of, not the generation of a single
correct solution (as it is conventionally construed), but using concepts in
their most compact form by activating neural cell assemblies that respond to
their most typical properties. This allows them to be deployed in a
conventional manner such that effort is reserved for exploring causal
relationships. Conversely, it is argued that divergent thought is most
fruitfully characterized in terms of, not the generation of multiple solutions
(as it is conventionally construed), but using concepts in a form that is,
albeit expanded, constrained by the situation, by activating neural cell
assemblies that respond to context-specific atypical properties. This allows
them to be deployed in a manner that is conducive to exploring unconventional
yet potentially relevant associations, and unearthing potentially useful
relationships of correlation. Thus, divergent thought can involve as few as one
idea. This proposal is compatible with widespread beliefs that (1) most
creative tasks require not many solutions but one, yet entail both divergent
and convergent thinking, and (2) not all problems with multiple solutions
require creative thinking, and conversely, some problems with single solution
do require creative thought. The chapter discusses how the ability to shift
between convergent and divergent modes of thought may have evolved, and it
concludes with educational and vocational implications.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The association between light and psychological states has a long history and
permeates our language. LIVEIA (Light-based Immersive Visualization Environment
for Imaginative Actualization) is a new immersive, interactive technology that
uses physical light as a metaphor for visualizing peoples' inner lives and
relationships. This paper outlines its educational value, as a tool for
understanding and explaining aspects of how people think and interact, and its
potential therapeutic value as a form of art therapy in which the artwork has
straightforwardly interpretable symbolic meanings.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Multiple decay events target HAC1 mRNA during splicing to regulate the unfolded protein response</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42262</link>
	<description>In the unfolded protein response (UPR), stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates a large transcriptional program to increase ER folding capacity. During the budding yeast UPR, Ire1 excises an intron from the &lt;i&gt;HAC1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA and the exon products of cleavage are ligated, and the translated protein induces hundreds of stress-response genes. Using cells with mutations in RNA repair and decay enzymes, we show that phosphorylation of two different &lt;i&gt;HAC1&lt;/i&gt; splicing intermediates is required for their degradation by the 5′→3′ exonuclease Xrn1 to enact opposing effects on the UPR. We also found that ligated but 2′-phosphorylated &lt;i&gt;HAC1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA is cleaved, yielding a decay intermediate with both 5′- and 2′-phosphates at its 5′-end that inhibit 5′→3′ decay and suggesting that Ire1 degrades incompletely processed &lt;i&gt;HAC1&lt;/i&gt;. These decay events expand the scope of RNA-based regulation in the budding yeast UPR and have implications for the control of the metazoan UPR.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Across-species differences in pitch perception are consistent with differences in cochlear filtering</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41626</link>
	<description>Pitch perception is critical for recognizing speech, music and animal vocalizations, but its neurobiological basis remains unsettled, in part because of divergent results across species. We investigated whether species-specific differences exist in the cues used to perceive pitch and whether these can be accounted for by differences in the auditory periphery. Ferrets accurately generalized pitch discriminations to untrained stimuli whenever temporal envelope cues were robust in the probe sounds, but not when resolved harmonics were the main available cue. By contrast, human listeners exhibited the opposite pattern of results on an analogous task, consistent with previous studies. Simulated cochlear responses in the two species suggest that differences in the relative salience of the two pitch cues can be attributed to differences in cochlear filter bandwidths. The results support the view that cross-species variation in pitch perception reflects the constraints of estimating a sound’s fundamental frequency given species-specific cochlear tuning.</description>

	<description>A variety of environmental regularities enable us to anticipate the timing of upcoming sensations and actions. A recent article (Breska and Ivry, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018;115:12283–12288) reports a striking neural double dissociation between two distinct varieties of temporal anticipation. Looking forward, we consider further dissociations according to the goals for which temporal anticipation is used.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The logic of ionic homeostasis: Cations are for voltage, but not for volume</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006894</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/VHCTEZgTAC4/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrey V. Dmitriev, Alexander A. Dmitriev, Robert A. Linsenmeier&lt;/p&gt;

Neuronal activity is associated with transmembrane ionic redistribution, which can lead to an osmotic imbalance. Accordingly, activity-dependent changes of the membrane potential are sometimes accompanied by changes in intracellular or extracellular volume. Experimental data that include distributions of ions and volume during neuronal activity are rare and rather inconsistent partly due to the technical difficulty of performing such measurements. However, progress in understanding the interrelations among ions, voltage and volume has been achieved recently by computational modelling, particularly “charge-difference” modelling. In this work a charge-difference computational model was used for further understanding of the specific roles for cations and anions. Our simulations show that without anion conductances the transmembrane movements of cations are always osmotically balanced, regardless of the stoichiometry of the pump or the ratio of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductances. Yet any changes in cation conductance or pump activity are associated with changes of the membrane potential, even when a hypothetically electroneutral pump is used in calculations and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductances are equal. On the other hand, when a Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; conductance is present, the only way to keep the Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;equilibrium potential in accordance with the changed membrane potential is to adjust cell volume. Importantly, this voltage-evoked Cl&lt;sup&gt;—&lt;/sup&gt;dependent volume change does not affect intracellular cation concentrations or the amount of energy that is necessary to support the system. Taking other factors into consideration (i.e. the presence of internal impermeant poly-anions, the activity of cation-Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; cotransporters, and the buildup of intra- and extracellular osmolytes, both charged and electroneutral) adds complexity, but does not change the main principles.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VHCTEZgTAC4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Understanding narwhal diving behaviour using Hidden Markov Models with dependent state distributions and long range dependence</title>

Diving behaviour of narwhals is still largely unknown. We use Hidden Markov models (HMMs) to describe the diving behaviour of a narwhal and fit the models to a three-dimensional response vector of maximum dive depth, duration of dives and post-dive surface time of 8,609 dives measured in East Greenland over 83 days, an extraordinarily long and rich data set. Narwhal diving patterns have not been analysed like this before, but in studies of other whale species, response variables have been assumed independent. We extend the existing models to allow for dependence between state distributions, and show that the dependence has an impact on the conclusions drawn about the diving behaviour. We try several HMMs with 2, 3 or 4 states, and with independent and dependent log-normal and gamma distributions, respectively, and different covariates to characterize dive patterns. In particular, diurnal patterns in diving behaviour is inferred, by using periodic B-splines with boundary knots in 0 and 24 hours.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8xzQ9ROcIkY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Plasticity of NMDA Receptors at Ventral Hippocampal Synapses in the Infralimbic Cortex Regulates Cued Fear</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) processes contextual information from the hippocampus to generate appropriate fear responses. In rodents, one path for sending contextual information to the mPFC is via the direct projections from the ventral hippocampus (vHC) to the infralimbic cortex (IL). Plasticity in the synaptic communication from the vHC to the IL could contribute to the behavioral changes produced by the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear. To examine this possibility, we used optogenetic stimulation of vHC synapses in brain slices from trained rats. We found that fear acquisition reduced NMDA receptor (NMDAR) currents at vHC synapses onto IL pyramidal neurons. The depression of NMDAR currents reversed more efficiently after extinction in the conditioning context than extinction in a novel context. Moreover, a cohort of animals that exhibited poor extinction retrieval failed to reverse the plasticity induced by fear conditioning. In addition, ex vivo application of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which is known to simulate extinction in IL, reversed this conditioning-induced plasticity mimicking extinction. Therefore, we have identified a novel mechanism that modulates conditioned fear via changes in NMDAR current at vHC synapses onto IL pyramidal neurons. Disruption of this mechanism could contribute to the abnormal contextual modulation of fear seen in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Contextual information processing by the medial prefrontal cortex is critical for appropriate behavioral responses. Using optogenetics in brain slices, we found that acquisition of conditioned fear depressed NMDA receptor currents at ventral hippocampal synapses in the infralimbic cortex (IL) and extinction reversed the depression. BDNF could also reverse the conditioning-induced depression mimicking extinction. In contrast, animals with impaired fear extinction recall, a PTSD-like phenotype, failed to reverse the conditioning-induced changes. Our findings suggest that conditioned fear responses are modulated by changes in NMDAR current at ventral hippocampal synapses in IL and suggest a novel mechanism that could contribute to impaired contextual modulation of fear seen in patients with PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Increased expression of the FK506-binding protein 5 (&lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt;) gene has been associated with a number of diseases, but most prominently in connection to psychiatric illnesses. Many of these psychiatric disorders present with dementia and other cognitive deficits, but a direct connection between these issues and alterations in &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; remains unclear. We generated a novel transgenic mouse to selectively overexpress &lt;i&gt;FKBP5,&lt;/i&gt; which encodes the FKBP51 protein, in the corticolimbic system, which had no overt effects on gross body weight, motor ability, or general anxiety. Instead, we found that overexpression of FKBP51 impaired long-term depression (LTD) as well as spatial reversal learning and memory, suggesting a role in glutamate receptor regulation. Indeed, FKBP51 altered the association of heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) with AMPA receptors, which was accompanied by an accelerated rate of AMPA recycling. In this way, the chaperone system is critical in triage decisions for AMPA receptor trafficking. Imbalance in the chaperone system may manifest in impairments in both inhibitory learning and cognitive function. These findings uncover an unexpected and essential mechanism for learning and memory that is controlled by the psychiatric risk factor &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Seizures are characterized by hypersynchronization of neuronal networks. Understanding these networks could provide a critical window for therapeutic control of recurrent seizure activity, i.e., epilepsy. However, imaging seizure networks has largely been limited to microcircuits &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; or small &quot;windows&quot; &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we combine fast confocal imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP)-expressing larval zebrafish with local field potential (LFP) recordings to study epileptiform events at whole-brain and single-neuron levels &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Using an acute seizure model (pentylenetetrazole, PTZ), we reliably observed recurrent electrographic ictal-like events associated with generalized activation of all major brain regions and uncovered a well-preserved anterior-to-posterior seizure propagation pattern. We also examined brain-wide network synchronization and spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal activity in the optic tectum microcircuit. Brain-wide and single-neuronal level analysis of PTZ-exposed and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-exposed zebrafish revealed distinct network dynamics associated with seizure and non-seizure hyperexcitable states, respectively. Neuronal ensembles, comprised of coactive neurons, were also uncovered during interictal-like periods. Taken together, these results demonstrate that macro- and micro-network calcium motifs in zebrafish may provide a greater understanding of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: How Can Memories Last for Days, Years, or a Lifetime? Proposed Mechanisms for Maintaining Synaptic Potentiation and Memory. (arXiv:1903.05610v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05610</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With memory encoding reliant on persistent changes in the properties of
synapses, a key question is how can memories be maintained from days to months
or a lifetime given molecular turnover? It is likely that positive feedback
loops are necessary to persistently maintain the strength of synapses that
participate in encoding. Such feedback may occur within signal-transduction
cascades and/or the regulation of translation, and it may occur within specific
subcellular compartments or within neuronal networks. Not surprisingly,
numerous positive feedback loops have been proposed. Some posited loops operate
at the level of biochemical signal transduction cascades, such as persistent
activation of Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II or protein kinase M zeta. Another level
consists of feedback loops involving transcriptional, epigenetic and
translational pathways, and autocrine actions of growth factors such as BDNF.
Finally, at the neuronal network level, recurrent reactivation of cell
assemblies encoding memories is likely to be essential for late maintenance of
memory. These levels are not isolated, but linked by shared components of
feedback loops. Here, we review characteristics of some commonly discussed
feedback loops proposed to underlie the maintenance of memory and long-term
synaptic plasticity, assess evidence for and against their necessity, and
suggest experiments that could further delineate the dynamics of these feedback
loops. We also discuss crosstalk between proposed loops, and ways in which such
interaction can facilitate the rapidity and robustness of memory formation and
storage.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Noisy network attractor models for transitions between EEG microstates. (arXiv:1903.05590v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05590</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05590</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain is intrinsically organized into large-scale networks that
constantly re-organize on multiple timescales, even when the brain is at rest.
The timing of these dynamics is crucial for sensation, perception, cognition
and ultimately consciousness, but the underlying dynamics governing the
constant reorganization and switching between networks are not yet well
understood. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
electroencephalography (EEG) provide anatomical and temporal information about
the resting-state networks (RSNs), respectively. EEG microstates are brief
periods of stable scalp topography, and four distinct configurations with
characteristic switching patterns between them are reliably identified at rest.
Microstates have been identified as the electrophysiological correlate of
fMRI-defined RSNs, this link could be established because EEG microstate
sequences are scale-free and have long-range temporal correlations. This
property is crucial for any approach to model EEG microstates. This paper
proposes a novel modeling approach for microstates: we consider nonlinear
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that exhibit a noisy network attractor
between nodes that represent the microstates. Using a single layer network
between four states, we can reproduce the transition probabilities between
microstates but not the heavy tailed residence time distributions. Introducing
a two layer network with a hidden layer gives the flexibility to capture these
heavy tails and their long-range temporal correlations. We fit these models to
capture the statistical properties of microstate sequences from EEG data
recorded inside and outside the MRI scanner and show that the processing
required to separate the EEG signal from the fMRI machine noise results in a
loss of information which is reflected in differences in the long tail of the
dwell-time distributions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Effect of Interpopulation Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity on Synchronized Rhythms in Neuronal Networks with Inhibitory and Excitatory Populations. (arXiv:1903.05288v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05288</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05288</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider clustered small-world networks (SWNs) with two inhibitory (I) and
excitatory (E) populations. This I-E neuronal network has adaptive dynamic I to
E and E to I interpopulation synaptic strengths, governed by interpopulation
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). In previous works without STDPs, fast
sparsely synchronized rhythms were found to appear in a range of noise
intensity $D$. Here, by varying $D$, we investigate the effect of
interpopulation STDPs on population states in the I- and the E-populations.
Depending on values of $D$, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term
depression (LTD) for population-averaged values of saturated interpopulation
synaptic strengths are found to occur, and they make effects on the degree of
population synchronization. In a broad region of intermediate $D$, the degree
of good synchronization (with higher spiking measure) becomes decreased, while
in a region of large $D$, the degree of bad synchronization (with lower spiking
measure) gets increased. Consequently, in each I- or E-population, the
synchronization degree becomes nearly the same in a wide range of $D$. This
kind of &quot;equalization effect&quot; is found to occur via cooperative interplay
between the average occupation and pacing degrees of synchronized rhythms. Such
equalization effect is much more enhanced in the presence of combined I to E
and E to I STDPs when compared with the case of individual I to E or E to I
STDP. We note that the equalization effect in interpopulation synaptic
plasticity is in contrast to the Matthew (bipolarization) effect in
intrapopulation (I to I and E to E) synaptic plasticity where good (bad)
synchronization gets better (worse). Moreover, emergences of LTP and LTD of
interpopulation synaptic strengths are intensively investigated via a
microscopic method based on the distributions of time delays between the pre-
and the post-synaptic spike times.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A spatio-temporal individual-based network framework for West Nile virus in the USA: Spreading pattern of West Nile virus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Sifat A. Moon, Lee W. Cohnstaedt, D. Scott McVey, Caterina M. Scoglio&lt;/p&gt;

West Nile virus (WNV)—a mosquito-borne arbovirus—entered the USA through New York City in 1999 and spread to the contiguous USA within three years while transitioning from epidemic outbreaks to endemic transmission. The virus is transmitted by vector competent mosquitoes and maintained in the avian populations. WNV spatial distribution is mainly determined by the movement of residential and migratory avian populations. We developed an individual-level heterogeneous network framework across the USA with the goal of understanding the long-range spatial distribution of WNV. To this end, we proposed three distance dispersal kernels model: 1) exponential—short-range dispersal, 2) power-law—long-range dispersal in all directions, and 3) power-law biased by flyway direction —long-range dispersal only along established migratory routes. To select the appropriate dispersal kernel we used the human case data and adopted a model selection framework based on approximate Bayesian computation with sequential Monte Carlo sampling (ABC-SMC). From estimated parameters, we find that the power-law biased by flyway direction kernel is the best kernel to fit WNV human case data, supporting the hypothesis of long-range WNV transmission is mainly along the migratory bird flyways. Through extensive simulation from 2014 to 2016, we proposed and tested hypothetical mitigation strategies and found that mosquito population reduction in the infected states and neighboring states is potentially cost-effective.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9rfZ0tOoEtc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Cholinergic system changes of falls and freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postural instability and gait difficulties (PIGDs) represent debilitating disturbances in Parkinson's disease (PD). Past acetylcholinesterase positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies implicate cholinergic changes as significant contributors to PIGD features. These studies were limited in quantification of striatal cholinergic synapse integrity. Vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) PET ligands are better suited for evaluation of high binding areas. We examined associations between regional VAChT expression and freezing of gait (FoG) and falls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ninety‐four PD subjects underwent clinical assessment and VAChT ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FEOBV) PET.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐five subjects (37.2%) reported a history of falls, and 15 (16%) had observed FoG. Univariate volume‐of‐interest analyses demonstrated significantly reduced thalamic (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0016) VAChT expression in fallers compared to nonfallers. VAChT expression was significantly reduced in the striatum (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0012) and limbic archicortex (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004) in freezers compared to nonfreezers. Whole‐brain voxel‐based analyses of FEOBV PET complemented these findings and showed more granular changes associated with falling history, including the right visual thalamus (especially the right lateral geniculate nucleus [LGN]), right caudate nucleus, and bilateral prefrontal regions. Freezers had prominent VAChT expression reductions in the bilateral striatum, temporal, and mesiofrontal limbic regions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings confirm and extend on previous PET findings of thalamic cholinergic deficits associated with falling history and now emphasize right visual thalamus complex changes, including the right LGN. FoG status is associated with reduced VAChT expression in striatal cholinergic interneurons and the limbic archicortex. These observations suggest different cholinergic systems changes underlying falls and FoG in PD. Ann Neurol, 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Perceived target range shapes human sound-localization behavior</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The auditory system relies on binaural differences and spectral pinna cues to localize sounds in azimuth and elevation. However, the acoustic input can be unreliable, due to uncertainty about the environment, and neural noise. A possible strategy to reduce sound-location uncertainty is to integrate the sensory observations with sensorimotor information from previous experience, to infer where sounds are more likely to occur. We investigated whether and how human sound localization performance is affected by the spatial distribution of target sounds, and changes thereof. We tested three different open-loop paradigms, in which we varied the spatial range of sounds in different ways. For the narrowest ranges, target-response gains were highly idiosyncratic and deviated from an optimal gain predicted by error-minimization; in the horizontal plane the deviation typically consisted of a response overshoot. Moreover, participants adjusted their behavior by rapidly adapting their gain to the target range, both in elevation and in azimuth, yielding behavior closer to optimal for larger target ranges. Notably, gain changes occurred without any exogenous feedback about performance. We discuss how the findings can be explained by a sub-optimal model in which the motor-control system reduces its response error across trials to within an acceptable range – rather than strictly minimizing the error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Sensory observations can be noisy, leading to uncertainty in perceptual inferences and variable estimation errors. Theoretically, to reduce uncertainty, sensory information could be integrated with knowledge from prior experience, and with feedback about one’s own response behavior. Here we show, that for a basic and accurate sensorimotor task such as sound localization, humans indeed rely on perceived experience in the absence of exogenous feedback, as they rapidly changed their response sensitivity to experimental variations in the spatial distribution of targets. We argue that the auditory system reduces its estimated localization error close to its expected minimum across trials, allowing for idiosyncratic sub-optimal target response gains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: LDB1 Is Required for the Early Development of the Dorsal Telencephalon and the Thalamus</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;LIM domain binding protein 1 (LDB1) is a protein cofactor that participates in several multiprotein complexes with transcription factors that regulate mouse forebrain development. Since &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; null mutants display early embryonic lethality, we used a conditional knockout strategy to examine the role of LDB1 in early forebrain development using multiple Cre lines. Loss of &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; from E8.75 using Foxg1Cre caused a disruption of midline boundary structures in the dorsal telencephalon. While this Cre line gave the expected pattern of recombination of the floxed &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; locus, unexpectedly, standard Cre lines that act from embryonic day (E)10.5 (Emx1Cre) and E11.5 (NesCre) did not show efficient or complete recombination in the dorsal telencephalon by E12.5. Intriguingly, this effect was specific to the &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; floxed allele, since three other lines including floxed Ai9 and mTmG reporters, and a floxed &lt;i&gt;Lhx2&lt;/i&gt; line, each displayed the expected spatial patterns of recombination. Furthermore, the incomplete recombination of the floxed &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; locus using NesCre was limited to the dorsal telencephalon, while the ventral telencephalon and the diencephalon displayed the expected loss of &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt;. This permitted us to examine the requirement for LDB1 in the development of the thalamus in a context wherein the cortex continued to express &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt;. We report that the somatosensory VB nucleus is profoundly shrunken upon loss of LDB1. Our findings highlight the unusual nature of the &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; locus in terms of recombination efficiency, and also report a novel role for LDB1 during the development of the thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Long-Term, Targeted Delivery of GDNF from Encapsulated Cells Is Neuroprotective and Reduces Seizures in the Pilocarpine Model of Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2144?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurotrophic factors are candidates for treating epilepsy, but their development has been hampered by difficulties in achieving stable and targeted delivery of efficacious concentrations within the desired brain region. We have developed an encapsulated cell technology that overcomes these obstacles by providing a targeted, continuous, &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; synthesized source of high levels of neurotrophic molecules from human clonal ARPE-19 cells encapsulated into hollow fiber membranes. Here we illustrate the potential of this approach for delivering glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) directly to the hippocampus of epileptic rats. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies demonstrated that bilateral intrahippocampal implants continued to secrete GDNF that produced high hippocampal GDNF tissue levels in a long-term manner. Identical implants robustly reduced seizure frequency in the pilocarpine model. Seizures were reduced rapidly, and this effect increased in magnitude over 3 months, ultimately leading to a reduction of seizures by 93%. This effect persisted even after device removal, suggesting potential disease-modifying benefits. Importantly, seizure reduction was associated with normalized changes in anxiety and improved cognitive performance. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the neurological benefits of GDNF were associated with the normalization of anatomical alterations accompanying chronic epilepsy, including hippocampal atrophy, cell degeneration, loss of parvalbumin-positive interneurons, and abnormal neurogenesis. These effects were associated with the activation of GDNF receptors. All in all, these results support the concept that the implantation of encapsulated GDNF-secreting cells can deliver GDNF in a sustained, targeted, and efficacious manner, paving the way for continuing preclinical evaluation and eventual clinical translation of this approach for epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological conditions, affecting millions of individuals of all ages. These patients experience debilitating seizures that frequently increase over time and can associate with significant cognitive decline and psychiatric disorders that are generally poorly controlled by pharmacotherapy. We have developed a clinically validated, implantable cell encapsulation system that delivers high and consistent levels of GDNF directly to the brain. In epileptic animals, this system produced a progressive and permanent reduction (&amp;gt;90%) in seizure frequency. These benefits were accompanied by improvements in cognitive and anxiolytic behavior and the normalization of changes in CNS anatomy that underlie chronic epilepsy. Together, these data suggest a novel means of tackling the frequently intractable neurological consequences of this devastating disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: MicroRNA-1224 Splicing CircularRNA-Filip1l in an Ago2-Dependent Manner Regulates Chronic Inflammatory Pain via Targeting Ubr5</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2125?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dysfunctions of gene transcription and translation in the nociceptive pathways play the critical role in development and maintenance of chronic pain. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging as new players in regulation of gene expression, but whether and how circRNAs are involved in chronic pain remain elusive. We showed here that complete Freund's adjuvant-induced chronic inflammation pain significantly increased circRNA-Filip1l (filamin A interacting protein 1-like) expression in spinal neurons of mice. Blockage of this increase attenuated complete Freund's adjuvant-induced nociceptive behaviors, and overexpression of spinal circRNA-Filip1l in naive mice mimicked the nociceptive behaviors as evidenced by decreased thermal and mechanical nociceptive threshold. Furthermore, we found that mature circRNA-Filip1l expression was negatively regulated by miRNA-1224 via binding and splicing of precursor of circRNA-Filip1l (pre-circRNA-Filip1l) in the Argonaute-2 (&lt;i&gt;Ago2&lt;/i&gt;)-dependent manner. Increase of spinal circRNA-Filip1l expression resulted from the decrease of miRNA-1224 expression under chronic inflammation pain state. miRNA-1224 knockdown or &lt;i&gt;Ago2&lt;/i&gt; overexpression induced nociceptive behaviors in naive mice, which was prevented by the knockdown of spinal circRNA-Filip1l. Finally, we demonstrated that a ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-recognin 5 (&lt;i&gt;Ubr5&lt;/i&gt;), validated as a target of circRNA-Filip1l, plays a pivotal role in regulation of nociception by spinal circRNA-Filip1l. These data suggest that miRNA-1224-mediated and Ago2-dependent modulation of spinal circRNA-Filip1l expression regulates nociception via targeting &lt;i&gt;Ubr5&lt;/i&gt;, revealing a novel epigenetic mechanism of interaction between miRNA and circRNA in chronic inflammation pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; circRNAs are emerging as new players in regulation of gene expression. Here, we found that the increase of circRNA-Filip1l mediated by miRNA-1224 in an Ago2-dependent way in the spinal cord is involved in regulation of nociception via targeting &lt;i&gt;Ubr5&lt;/i&gt;. Our study reveals a novel epigenetic mechanism of interaction between miRNA and circRNA in chronic inflammation pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In response to altered neuronal energy state, mitochondria adapt to enable energy homeostasis and nervous system function. This adaptation, also called mitochondrial plasticity, can be observed as alterations in the form, function and position. The primary site of energy consumption in neurons is localized at the synapse, where mitochondria are critical for both pre- and postsynaptic functions. In this review, we will discuss molecular mechanisms regulating mitochondrial plasticity at the synapse and how they contribute to information processing within neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify shared polygenic risk and causal associations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linkage disequilibrium score regression and Mendelian randomization were applied in a large‐scale, data‐driven manner to explore genetic correlations and causal relationships between &amp;gt;700 phenotypic traits and ALS. Exposures consisted of publicly available genome‐wide association studies (GWASes) summary statistics from &lt;i&gt;MR Base&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;LD‐hub&lt;/i&gt;. The outcome data came from the recently published ALS GWAS involving 20,806 cases and 59,804 controls. Multivariate analyses, genetic risk profiling, and Bayesian colocalization analyses were also performed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have shown, by linkage disequilibrium score regression, that ALS shares polygenic risk genetic factors with a number of traits and conditions, including positive correlations with smoking status and moderate levels of physical activity, and negative correlations with higher cognitive performance, higher educational attainment, and light levels of physical activity. Using Mendelian randomization, we found evidence that hyperlipidemia is a causal risk factor for ALS and localized putative functional signals within loci of interest.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we have developed a public resource (&lt;a href=&quot;https://lng-nia.shinyapps.io/mrshiny&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;https://lng-nia.shinyapps.io/mrshiny&lt;/a&gt;) which we hope will become a valuable tool for the ALS community, and that will be expanded and updated as new data become available. Shared polygenic risk exists between ALS and educational attainment, physical activity, smoking, and tenseness/restlessness. We also found evidence that elevated low‐desnity lipoprotein cholesterol is a causal risk factor for ALS. Future randomized controlled trials should be considered as a proof of causality.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we examined the potential causal effect of smoking on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using the Project MinE data involving 12,577 patients with ALS and 23,475 controls in a Mendelian randomization (MR) framework. The MR approach has the potential to investigate a causal relationship between a risk factor and a disease, avoiding confounding and information bias that often present in conventional epidemiological studies. We found that smokers had a higher risk of ALS compared to never smokers. Our study thus provides evidence for a causal relationship between smoking and ALS. Ann Neurol, 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Movement Vigor as a Reflection of Subjective Economic Utility</title>

	<description>To understand subjective evaluation of an option, various disciplines have quantified the interaction between reward and effort during decision making, producing an estimate of economic utility, namely the subjective ‘goodness’ of an option. However, variables that affect utility of an option also influence the vigor of movements toward that option. For example, expectation of reward increases speed of saccadic eye movements, whereas expectation of effort decreases this speed. These results imply that vigor may serve as a new, real-time metric with which to quantify subjective utility, and that the control of movements may be an implicit reflection of the brain’s economic evaluation of the expected outcome.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Synaptic plasticity onto inhibitory neurons as a mechanism for ocular dominance plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006834</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jacopo Bono, Claudia Clopath&lt;/p&gt;

Ocular dominance plasticity is a well-documented phenomenon allowing us to study properties of cortical maturation. Understanding this maturation might be an important step towards unravelling how cortical circuits function. However, it is still not fully understood which mechanisms are responsible for the opening and closing of the critical period for ocular dominance and how changes in cortical responsiveness arise after visual deprivation. In this article, we present a theory of ocular dominance plasticity. Following recent experimental work, we propose a framework where a reduction in inhibition is necessary for ocular dominance plasticity in both juvenile and adult animals. In this framework, two ingredients are crucial to observe ocular dominance shifts: a sufficient level of inhibition as well as excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic plasticity. In our model, the former is responsible for the opening of the critical period, while the latter limits the plasticity in adult animals. Finally, we also provide a possible explanation for the variability in ocular dominance shifts observed in individual neurons and for the counter-intuitive shifts towards the closed eye.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2HjERBCZGPc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Evaluating the future consequences of actions is achievable by simulating a mental search tree into the future. Expanding deep trees, however, is computationally taxing. Therefore, machines and humans use a plan-until-habit scheme that simulates the environment up to a limited depth and then exploits habitual values as proxies for consequences that may arise in the future. Two outstanding questions in this scheme are “in which directions the search tree should be expanded?”, and “when should the expansion stop?”. Here we propose a principled solution to these questions based on a speed/accuracy tradeoff: deeper expansion in the appropriate directions leads to more accurate planning, but at the cost of slower decision-making. Our simulation results show how this algorithm expands the search tree effectively and efficiently in a grid-world environment. We further show that our algorithm can explain several behavioral patterns in animals and humans, namely the effect of time-pressure on the depth of planning, the effect of reward magnitudes on the direction of planning, and the gradual shift from goal-directed to habitual behavior over the course of training. The algorithm also provides several predictions testable in animal/human experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CETQ5A5g_oA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Spike burst-pause dynamics of Purkinje cells regulate sensorimotor adaptation</title>

Cerebellar Purkinje cells mediate accurate eye movement coordination. However, it remains unclear how oculomotor adaptation depends on the interplay between the characteristic Purkinje cell response patterns, namely tonic, bursting, and spike pauses. Here, a spiking cerebellar model assesses the role of Purkinje cell firing patterns in vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) adaptation. The model captures the cerebellar microcircuit properties and it incorporates spike-based synaptic plasticity at multiple cerebellar sites. A detailed Purkinje cell model reproduces the three spike-firing patterns that are shown to regulate the cerebellar output. Our results suggest that pauses following Purkinje complex spikes (bursts) encode transient disinhibition of targeted medial vestibular nuclei, critically gating the vestibular signals conveyed by mossy fibres. This gating mechanism accounts for early and coarse VOR acquisition, prior to the late reflex consolidation. In addition, properly timed and sized Purkinje cell bursts allow the ratio between long-term depression and potentiation (LTD/LTP) to be finely shaped at mossy fibre-medial vestibular nuclei synapses, which optimises VOR consolidation. Tonic Purkinje cell firing maintains the consolidated VOR through time. Importantly, pauses are crucial to facilitate VOR phase-reversal learning, by reshaping previously learnt synaptic weight distributions. Altogether, these results predict that Purkinje spike burst-pause dynamics are instrumental to VOR learning and reversal adaptation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yPKm5tnZcuc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Different Inhibitory Interneuron Cell Classes Make Distinct Contributions to Visual Contrast Perception</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;While recent work has revealed how different inhibitory interneurons influence responses of cortical neurons to sensory stimuli, little is known about their distinct contributions to sensory perception. Here, we optogenetically activated different genetically defined interneurons [parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)] in visual cortex (V1) of mice working at threshold in a contrast increment detection task. The visual stimulus was paired with optogenetic stimulation to assess how enhancing V1 inhibitory neuron activity during visual processing altered task performance. PV or SST activation impaired, while VIP stimulation improved, contrast increment detection. The impairment produced by PV or SST activation persisted over several weeks of testing. In contrast, mice learned to reliably detect VIP activation in the absence of any natural visual stimulus. Thus, different inhibitory signals make distinct contributions to visual contrast perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: The Thalamus Regulates Retinoic Acid Signaling and Development of Parvalbumin Interneurons in Postnatal Mouse Prefrontal Cortex</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;GABAergic inhibitory neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) play crucial roles in higher cognitive functions. Despite the link between aberrant development of PFC interneurons and a number of psychiatric disorders, mechanisms underlying the development of these neurons are poorly understood. Here we show that the retinoic acid (RA)-degrading enzyme CYP26B1 (cytochrome P450 family 26, subfamily B, member 1) is transiently expressed in the mouse frontal cortex during postnatal development, and that medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived interneurons, particularly in parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons, are the main cell type that has active RA signaling during this period. We found that frontal cortex-specific &lt;i&gt;Cyp26b1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice had an increased density of PV-expressing, but not somatostatin-expressing, interneurons in medial PFC, indicating a novel role of RA signaling in controlling PV neuron development. The initiation of &lt;i&gt;Cyp26b1&lt;/i&gt; expression in neonatal PFC coincides with the establishment of connections between the thalamus and the PFC. We found that these connections are required for the postnatal expression of &lt;i&gt;Cyp26b1&lt;/i&gt; in medial PFC. In addition to this region-specific role in postnatal PFC that regulates RA signaling and PV neuron development, the thalamocortical connectivity had an earlier role in controlling radial dispersion of MGE-derived interneurons throughout embryonic neocortex. In summary, our results suggest that the thalamus plays multiple, temporally separate roles in interneuron development in the PFC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Gene therapy improves brain white matter in aromatic l‐amino acid decarboxylase deficiency</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children with aromatic &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;‐amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency suffer from severe motor dysfunction. Restoration of dopamine levels in the putamen by gene therapy has led to significant improvement in motor function. This study explored brain structure changes in patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed before and 12 months after gene therapy. Whole‐brain tract‐specific analysis was performed to assess white matter microstructural integrity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the eight patients (1.67 to 8.42 years of age) enrolled in the study, gene therapy did not affect macroscopic structure. DTI prior to gene therapy revealed lower total mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the patients than in the age‐matched pretreatment controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.017, median difference = −0.0136, 95% confidence interval [CI] [−0.0319, −0.0126]). After gene therapy, total mean FA increased (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012, median difference = 0.0211, 95% CI [0.0094, 0.0456]) and the values in the patients were not different from the age‐matched posttreatment controls. The increase in total mean FA after gene therapy in the patients was correlated with their increase in motor score (R = 0.846; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008), but was inversely correlated with their ages at the time of gene therapy (R = −0.754; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.031). The corticospinal tracts, and the thalamic radiation and callosal fibers involving motor function, improved after gene therapy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improvement in the microstructural integrity of white matter tracts is associated with the improvement in motor function following gene therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Association between Perihematomal Cerebral Blood Volume and Intracerebral Hemorrhage Expansion: a CT Perfusion Study</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated whether CT perfusion can identify intracerebral hemorrhage patients at high risk of hematoma growth (HG). A total of 155 subjects underwent CT perfusion on admission. Variables associated with log‐transformed absolute HG were explored with multivariable linear regression. Perihematomal cerebral blood volume (CBV) was inversely associated with HG (B=‐0.20,p&amp;lt;0.001), independently from blood pressure, ICH volume and other confounders. This association was not dose‐dependent and only very low CBV (&amp;lt;1.4 mL/100g) was significantly associated with HG (B=0.25,p&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, reduced perihematomal CBV is associated with HG, suggesting a potential role of the perihematomal region in the pathophysiology of hematoma enlargement.&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding the principles by which agents interact with both complex environments and each other is a key goal of decision neuroscience. However, most previous studies have used experimental paradigms in which choices are discrete (and few), play is static, and optimal solutions are known. Yet in natural environments, interactions between agents typically involve continuous action spaces, ongoing dynamics, and no known optimal solution. Here, we seek to bridge this divide by using a “penalty shot” task in which pairs of monkeys competed against each other in a competitive, real-time video game. We modeled monkeys’ strategies as driven by stochastically evolving goals, onscreen positions that served as set points for a control model that produced observed joystick movements. We fit this goal-based dynamical system model using approximate Bayesian inference methods, using neural networks to parameterize players’ goals as a dynamic mixture of Gaussian components. Our model is conceptually simple, constructed of interpretable components, and capable of generating synthetic data that capture the complexity of real player dynamics. We further characterized players’ strategies using the number of change points on each trial. We found that this complexity varied more across sessions than within sessions, and that more complex strategies benefited offensive players but not defensive players. Together, our experimental paradigm and model offer a powerful combination of tools for the study of realistic social dynamics in the laboratory setting.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8EQny46_S5o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The number of active metabolic pathways is bounded by the number of cellular constraints at maximal metabolic rates</title>

Growth rate is a near-universal selective pressure across microbial species. High growth rates require hundreds of metabolic enzymes, each with different nonlinear kinetics, to be precisely tuned within the bounds set by physicochemical constraints. Yet, the metabolic behaviour of many species is characterized by simple relations between growth rate, enzyme expression levels and metabolic rates. We asked if this simplicity could be the outcome of optimisation by evolution. Indeed, when the growth rate is maximized—in a static environment under mass-conservation and enzyme expression constraints—we prove mathematically that the resulting optimal metabolic flux distribution is described by a limited number of subnetworks, known as Elementary Flux Modes (EFMs). We show that, because EFMs are the minimal subnetworks leading to growth, a small active number automatically leads to the simple relations that are measured. We find that the maximal number of flux-carrying EFMs is determined only by the number of imposed constraints on enzyme expression, not by the size, kinetics or topology of the network. This minimal-EFM extremum principle is illustrated in a graphical framework, which explains qualitative changes in microbial behaviours, such as overflow metabolism and co-consumption, and provides a method for identification of the enzyme expression constraints that limit growth under the prevalent conditions. The extremum principle applies to all microorganisms that are selected for maximal growth rates under protein concentration constraints, for example the solvent capacities of cytosol, membrane or periplasmic space.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DEY-lhs5fHw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Manipulating the dynamics of neural systems through targeted stimulation is a frontier of research and clinical neuroscience; however, the control schemes considered for neural systems are mismatched for the unique needs of manipulating neural dynamics. An appropriate control method should respect the variability in neural systems, incorporating moment to moment “input” to the neural dynamics and behaving based on the current neural state, irrespective of the past trajectory. We propose such a controller under a nonlinear state-space feedback framework that steers one dynamical system to function as through it were another dynamical system entirely. This “myopic” controller is formulated through a novel variant of a model reference control cost that manipulates dynamics in a short-sighted manner that only sets a target trajectory of a single time step into the future (hence its myopic nature), which omits the need to pre-calculate a rigid and computationally costly neural feedback control solution. To demonstrate the breadth of this control’s utility, two examples with distinctly different applications in neuroscience are studied. First, we show the myopic control’s utility to probe the causal link between dynamics and behavior for cognitive processes by transforming a winner-take-all decision-making system to operate as a robust neural integrator of evidence. Second, an unhealthy motor-like system containing an unwanted beta-oscillation spiral attractor is controlled to function as a healthy motor system, a relevant clinical example for neurological disorders.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6oinXWRforY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Disease‐associated proteins are thought to propagate along neuronal processes in neurodegenerative diseases. To detect disease‐associated prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;) in the vagus nerve in different forms and molecular subtypes of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), we applied 3 different anti‐PrP antibodies. We screened the vagus nerve in 162 sporadic and 30 genetic CJD cases. Four of 31 VV‐2 type sporadic CJD and 7 of 30 genetic CJD cases showed vagal PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; immunodeposits with distinct morphology. Thus, PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; in CJD affects the vagus nerve analogously to α‐synuclein in Parkinson disease. The morphologically diverse deposition of PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; in genetic and sporadic CJD argues against uniform mechanisms of propagation of PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Concordance for Parkinson's disease in twins: A 20‐year update</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;During the 1990s, we estimated the genetic contribution to Parkinson's disease risk in a large, population‐based twin registry. Because many unaffected twins were still alive, previous concordance estimates were based on incomplete information. Ninety‐five percent of twins are now deceased. Here, we update concordance and heritability through 2015 using National Death Index data. In total, we identified 30 concordant and 193 discordant pairs. Proband‐wise concordance was 0.20 in monozygotic and 0.13 in dizygotic pairs. Heritability was 0.27 overall, 0.83 in pairs diagnosed ≤50, and 0.19 in pairs diagnosed &amp;gt;50. High concordance in dizygotic twins suggests shared effects of early childhood environment. Ann Neurol, 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Homocysteine and small vessel stroke: A mendelian randomization analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25440?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trials of B vitamin therapy to lower blood total homocysteine (tHcy) levels for prevention of stroke are inconclusive. Secondary analyses of trial data and epidemiological studies suggest that tHcy levels may be particularly associated with small vessel stroke (SVS). We assessed whether circulating tHcy and B vitamin levels are selectively associated with SVS, but not other stroke subtypes, using Mendelian randomization.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used summary statistics data for single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with tHcy (n = 18), folate (n = 3), vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 1), and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 14) levels, and the corresponding data for stroke from the MEGASTROKE consortium (n = 16,952 subtyped ischemic stroke cases and 404,630 noncases).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetically predicted tHcy was associated with SVS, with an odds ratio of 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13–1.58; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 6.7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–4&lt;/sup&gt;) per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in genetically predicted tHcy levels, but was not associated with large artery or cardioembolic stroke. The association was mainly driven by SNPs at or near the &lt;i&gt;MTHFR&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MUT&lt;/i&gt; genes. The odds ratios of SVS per 1 SD increase in genetically predicted folate and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; levels were 0.49 (95% CI, 0.34–0.71; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–4&lt;/sup&gt;) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.52–0.94; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), respectively. Genetically higher vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; levels were not associated with any stroke subtype.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that any effect of homocysteine‐lowering treatment in preventing stroke will be confined to the SVS subtype. Whether genetic variants at or near the &lt;i&gt;MTHFR&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MUT&lt;/i&gt; genes influence SVS risk through pathways other than homocysteine levels and downstream effects require further investigation.

	<description>Rhythmical brain activity around 5Hz can be observed in the prefrontal cortex under conditions requiring high levels of cognitive control. However, its temporal dynamics are still elusive. A recent research paper (Cooper et al. Neuroimage 2019;189:130–140) provides evidence that the temporal evolution of this frontal-midline theta activity reflects the style of cognitive control being implemented.</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Deep cerebellar stimulation reduces ataxic motor symptoms in the shaker rat</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25464?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25464?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Degenerative cerebellar ataxias (DCAs) affect up to 1 in 5,000 people worldwide, leading to incoordination, tremor, and falls. Loss of Purkinje cells, nearly universal across DCAs, dysregulates the dentatothalamocortical network. To address the paucity of treatment strategies, we developed an electrical stimulation‐based therapy for DCAs targeting the dorsal dentate nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested this therapeutic strategy in the Wistar Furth &lt;i&gt;shaker&lt;/i&gt; rat model of Purkinje cell loss resulting in tremor and ataxia. We implanted &lt;i&gt;shaker&lt;/i&gt; rats with stimulating electrodes targeted to the dorsal dentate nucleus and tested a spectrum of frequencies ranging from 4 to 180 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulation at 30 Hz most effectively reduced motor symptoms. Stimulation frequencies over 100 Hz, commonly used for Parkinsonism and essential tremor, worsened incoordination, while frequencies within the tremor physiologic range may worsen tremor.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low‐frequency deep cerebellar stimulation may provide a novel strategy for treating motor symptoms of degenerative cerebellar ataxias.&lt;/p&gt;

While much effort has been devoted to understanding the capacity and role for local protein synthesis in dendrites and spines, local mRNA translation in mature axons, projecting over distances up to a meter, has received much less attention. Also, little is known about the spatio-temporal dynamics of axonal and dendritic gene expression as function of mRNA abundance, protein synthesis and degradation. Here, we summarize key recent findings that have shaped our knowledge of the precise location of local protein production and discuss unique strategies used by neurons to shape presynaptic and postsynaptic proteomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Both proteins play critical roles during the development of the nervous system and may also regulate stimuli-driven transcription and plasticity in postmitotic neurons. The multiplicity of functions, substrates, and molecular partners, together with the redundancy and singularity of the two KAT3 paralogs, define a complex cat’s cradle of relationships. In this review, we discuss the role of the KAT3 proteins in neurons and integrate recent information regarding their function and mode of action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multiplicity of functions, substrates, and molecular partners of the two KAT3 proteins defines a complex cat’s cradle of relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Graphical abstract for this article&quot; src=&quot;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438818302101-fx1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;CRISPR-based technology has provided new avenues to interrogate gene function, but difficulties in transgene expression in post-mitotic neurons has delayed incorporation of these tools in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient, neuron-optimized dual lentiviral CRISPR-based transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) system capable of robust, modular, and tunable gene induction and multiplexed gene regulation across several primary rodent neuron culture systems. CRISPRa targeting unique promoters in the complex multi-transcript gene brain-derived neurotrophic factor (&lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt;) revealed both transcript- and genome-level selectivity of this approach, in addition to highlighting downstream transcriptional and physiological consequences of &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; regulation. Finally, we illustrate that CRISPRa is highly efficient &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, resulting in increased protein levels of a target gene in diverse brain structures. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CRISPRa is an efficient and selective method to study gene expression programs in brain health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Selectively inhibiting the median preoptic nucleus attenuates angiotensin II and hyperosmotic-induced drinking behavior and vasopressin release in adult male rats</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) is a putative integrative region that contributes to body fluid balance. Activation of the MnPO can influence thirst but it is not clear how these responses are linked to body fluid homeostasis. We used Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to determine the role of the MnPO in drinking behavior and vasopressin release in response to peripheral angiotensin II (ANG II) or 3% hypertonic saline in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300g). Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and stereotaxically injected with an inhibitory DREADD (rAAV5-CaMKIIa-hM4D(G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)-mCherry) or control (rAAV5-CaMKIIa-mCherry) virus in the MnPO. After 2 weeks’ recovery, a subset of rats were used for extracellular recordings to verify functional effects of ANG II or hyperosmotic challenges in MnPO slice preparations. Remaining rats were used in drinking behavior studies. Each rat was administered either 10mg/kg of exogenous clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) to inhibit DREADD-expressing cells or vehicle ip followed by a test treatment with either 2mg/kg ANG II or 3% hypertonic saline (1mL/100g bw) sc, twice per week for two separate treatment weeks. CNO-induced inhibition during either test treatment significantly attenuated drinking responses compared to vehicle treatments and controls. Brain tissue processed for cFos immunohistochemistry showed decreased expression with CNO-induced inhibition during either test treatment in the MnPO and downstream nuclei compared to controls. CNO-mediated inhibition significantly attenuated treatment-induced increases in plasma vasopressin compared to controls. The results indicate inhibition of CaMKIIa-expressing MnPO neurons significantly reduces drinking and vasopressin release in response to ANG II or hyperosmotic challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The MnPO is an important regulatory center that influences thirst, cardiovascular and neuroendocrine function. Activation of different MnPO neuronal populations can inhibit or stimulate water intake. However, the role of the MnPO and its pathway-specific projections during ANG II and hyperosmotic challenges still have not yet been fully elucidated. These studies directly address this by using DREADDs to acutely and selectively inhibit pathway-specific MnPO neurons, and uses techniques that measure changes at the protein, neuronal, and overall physiological and behavioral level. More importantly, we have been able to demonstrate that physiological challenges related to extracellular (ANG II) or cellular (hypertonic saline) dehydration activate MnPO neurons that may project to different parts of the hypothalamus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Structural Associations of Cortical Contrast and Thickness in First Episode Psychosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz040</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz040/5371084?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;There is growing evidence that psychosis is characterized by brain network abnormalities. Analyzing morphological abnormalities with T1-weighted structural MRI may be limited in discovering the extent of deviations in cortical associations. We assess whether structural associations of either cortical white–gray contrast (WGC) or cortical thickness (CT) allow for a better understanding of brain structural relationships in first episode of psychosis (FEP) patients. Principal component and structural covariance analyses were applied to WGC and CT derived from T1-weighted MRI for 116 patients and 88 controls, to explore sets of brain regions that showed group differences, and associations with symptom severity and cognitive ability in patients. We focused on 2 principal components: one encompassed primary somatomotor regions, which showed trend-like group differences in WGC, and the second included heteromodal cortices. Patients’ component scores were related to general psychopathology for WGC, but not CT. Structural covariance analyses with WGC revealed group differences in pairwise correlations across widespread brain regions, mirroring areas derived from PCA. More group differences were uncovered with WGC compared with CT. WGC holds potential as a proxy measure of myelin from commonly acquired T1-weighted MRI and may be sensitive in detecting systems-level aberrations in early psychosis, and relationships with clinical/cognitive profiles.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Spatial Patterns of Brain Activity Preferentially Reflecting Transient Pain and Stimulus Intensity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz026</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz026/5371085?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;How pain emerges in the human brain remains an unresolved question. Neuroimaging studies have suggested that several brain areas subserve pain perception because their activation correlates with perceived pain intensity. However, painful stimuli are often intense and highly salient; therefore, using both intensity- and saliency-matched control stimuli is crucial to isolate pain-selective brain responses. Here, we used these intensity/saliency-matched painful and non-painful stimuli to test whether pain-selective information can be isolated in the functional magnetic resonance imaging responses elicited by painful stimuli. Using two independent datasets, multivariate pattern analysis was able to isolate features distinguishing the responses triggered by (1) intensity/saliency-matched painful versus non-painful stimuli, and (2) high versus low-intensity/saliency stimuli regardless of whether they elicit pain. This indicates that neural activity in the so-called “pain matrix” is functionally heterogeneous, and part of it carries information related to both painfulness and intensity/saliency. The response features distinguishing these aspects are spatially distributed and cannot be ascribed to specific brain structures.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Targeted DamID (TaDa) is proving invaluable in identifying the genome-wide binding sites of chromatin-associated proteins &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, without fixation, cell isolation, or immunoprecipitation. The simplicity and efficiency of the technique have led to an ever-expanding TaDa toolbox. These tools enable profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility, as well as the identification of the genome-wide binding sites of chromatin complexes, transcription factors and RNAs. Here, we review these new developments, with particular emphasis on the use of TaDa in studying neuronal specification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>The occurrence of wake-like electroencephalography (EEG) traces during rapid-eye movement sleep (REM) has intrigued scientists for decades. A recent study by Bergel et al. (Nat. Commun. 2018;9;5364) imaged brain-wide hemodynamics in rats during wakefulness and sleep. The findings suggest that brain energy expenditure is highest during REM because of heightened theta and gamma activity.</description>
