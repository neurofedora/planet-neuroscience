	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Dimensionality, information and learning in prefrontal cortex</title>

Learning leads to changes in population patterns of neural activity. In this study we wanted to examine how these changes in patterns of activity affect the dimensionality of neural responses and information about choices. We addressed these questions by carrying out high channel count recordings in dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; 768 electrodes) while monkeys performed a two-armed bandit reinforcement learning task. The high channel count recordings allowed us to study population coding while monkeys learned choices between actions or objects. We found that the dimensionality of neural population activity was higher across blocks in which animals learned the values of novel pairs of objects, than across blocks in which they learned the values of actions. The increase in dimensionality with learning in object blocks was related to less shared information across blocks, and therefore patterns of neural activity that were less similar, when compared to learning in action blocks. Furthermore, these differences emerged with learning, and were not a simple function of the choice of a visual image or action. Therefore, learning the values of novel objects increases the dimensionality of neural representations in dlPFC.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KUb9aJqcgf8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

With the current rapid spread of COVID-19, global health systems are increasingly overburdened by the sheer number of people that need diagnosis, isolation and treatment. Shortcomings are evident across the board, from staffing, facilities for rapid and reliable testing to availability of hospital beds and key medical-grade equipment. The scale and breadth of the problem calls for an equally substantive response not only from frontline workers such as medical staff and scientists, but from skilled members of the public who have the time, facilities and knowledge to meaningfully contribute to a consolidated global response. Here, we summarise community-driven approaches based on Free and Open Source scientific and medical Hardware (FOSH) as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) currently being developed and deployed to support the global response for COVID-19 prevention, patient treatment and diagnostics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ljp7gPlfShU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: TRIC-A shapes oscillatory Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals by interaction with STIM1/Orai1 complexes</title>

Trimeric intracellular cation (TRIC) channels have been proposed to modulate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and determine oscillatory Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals. Here, we report that TRIC-A–mediated amplitude and frequency modulation of ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2)-mediated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R)-induced cytosolic signals is based on attenuating store-operated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry (SOCE). Further, TRIC-A–dependent delay in ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; store refilling contributes to shaping the pattern of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations. Upon ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; depletion, TRIC-A clusters with stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-release–activated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel 1 (Orai1) within ER–plasma membrane (PM) junctions and impairs assembly of the STIM1/Orai1 complex, causing a decrease in Orai1-mediated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current and SOCE. Together, our findings demonstrate that TRIC-A is a negative regulator of STIM1/Orai1 function. Thus, aberrant SOCE could contribute to muscle disorders associated with loss of TRIC-A.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QB6hSmTAL_4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Visuomotor feedback responses vary in intensity throughout a reach, commonly explained by optimal control. Here, we show that the optimal control for a range of movements with the same goal can be simplified to a time-to-target dependent control scheme. We measure our human participants’ visuomotor responses in five reaching conditions, each with different hand or cursor kinematics. Participants only produced different feedback responses when these kinematic changes resulted in different times-to-target. We complement our experimental data with a range of finite and non-finite horizon optimal feedback control (OFC) models, finding that the model with time-to-target as one of the input parameters best replicates the experimental data. Overall, this suggests that time-to-target is a critical control parameter in online feedback control. Moreover, we propose that for a specific task and known dynamics, humans can instantly produce a control signal without any additional online computation allowing rapid response onset and close to optimal control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Cellular Basis of Bitter-Driven Aversive Behaviors in Drosophila Larva</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Feeding, a critical behavior for survival, consists of a complex series of behavioral steps. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larvae, the initial steps of feeding are food choice, during which the quality of a potential food source is judged, and ingestion, during which the selected food source is ingested into the digestive tract. It remains unclear whether these steps employ different mechanisms of neural perception. Here, we provide insight into the two initial steps of feeding in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larva. We find that substrate choice and ingestion are determined by independent circuits at the cellular level. First, we took 22 candidate bitter compounds and examined their influence on choice preference and ingestion behavior. Interestingly, certain bitter tastants caused different responses in choice and ingestion, suggesting distinct mechanisms of perception. We further provide evidence that certain gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) in the external terminal organ (TO) are involved in determining choice preference, and a pair of larval pharyngeal GRNs is involved in mediating both avoidance and suppression of ingestion. Our results show that feeding behavior is coordinated by a multistep regulatory process employing relatively independent neural elements. These findings are consistent with a model in which distinct sensory pathways act as modulatory circuits controlling distinct subprograms during feeding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Priming of Attentional Selection in Macaque Visual Cortex: Feature-Based Facilitation and Location-Based Inhibition of Return</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Visual search performance varies with stimulus and response history. Priming of pop-out refers to increased accuracy and reduced response time with repeated presentation of particular singleton and distractor features (e.g., a red target among green distractor stimuli), which are abruptly impaired when singleton and distractor features swap (e.g., green target among red distractors). Meanwhile, inhibition of return refers to the slowing of response time when target location repeats. Neurophysiological correlates of both these phenomena have been reported in the frontal eye field (FEF), an area in the frontal lobe contributing to attentional selection and eye movement planning. To understand the mechanistic origin of these adaptive behaviors, we investigated visual cortical area V4, an area providing input to and receiving feedback from FEF, during feature-based priming of pop-out and location-based inhibition of return. Performing a color pop-out task, monkeys exhibited pronounced priming of pop-out and inhibition of return. Neural spiking from V4 revealed earlier target selection associated with priming of pop-out and delayed selection associated with inhibition of return. These results demonstrate substantial involvement of extrastriate visual cortex in behavioral priming and inhibition of return.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Inter-individual Differences in Occipital Alpha Oscillations Correlate with White Matter Tissue Properties of the Optic Radiation</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Neural oscillations at ~10 Hz, called alpha oscillations, are one of the most prominent components of neural oscillations in the human brain. In recent years, characteristics (power/frequency/phase) of occipital alpha oscillations have been correlated with various perceptual phenomena. However, the relationship between inter-individual differences in alpha oscillatory characteristics and the properties of the underlying brain structures, such as white matter pathways, is unclear. A possibility is that intrinsic occipital alpha oscillations are mediated by thalamocortical interaction; we hypothesized that the most promising candidate for characterizing the intrinsic alpha oscillation is optic radiation (OR), which is the geniculo-cortical pathway carrying signals between the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1). We used resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) and diffusion-weighted/quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (dMRI/qMRI) to correlate the frequency and power of occipital alpha oscillations with the tissue properties of the OR by focusing on the different characteristics across individuals. We found that the peak alpha frequency (PAF) negatively correlated with intracellular volume fraction (ICVF), reflecting diffusion properties in intracellular (axonal) space, whereas the peak alpha power was not correlated with any tissue properties measurements. No significant correlation was found between OR and beta frequency/amplitude or between other white matter tract connecting parietal and inferotemporal cortex and alpha frequency/amplitude. These results support the hypothesis that an interaction between thalamic nuclei and early visual areas is essential for the occipital alpha oscillatory rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Human observers perceptually discriminate the dynamic deformation of materials in the real world. However, the psychophysical and neural mechanisms responsible for the perception of dynamic deformation have not been fully elucidated. By using a deforming bar as the stimulus, we showed that the spatial frequency of deformation was a critical determinant of deformation perception. Simulating the response of direction-selective units (i.e., MT pattern motion cells) to stimuli, we found that the perception of dynamic deformation was well explained by assuming a higher-order mechanism monitoring the spatial pattern of direction responses. Our model with the higher-order mechanism also successfully explained the appearance of a visual illusion wherein a static bar apparently deforms against a tilted drifting grating. In particular, it was the lower spatial frequencies in this pattern that strongly contributed to the deformation perception. Finally, by manipulating the luminance of the static bar, we observed that the mechanism for the illusory deformation was more sensitive to luminance than contrast cues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Tip the Balance: Improving Exploration of Balanced Crossover Operators by Adaptive Bias. (arXiv:2004.11331v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11331</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The use of balanced crossover operators in Genetic Algorithms (GA) ensures
that the binary strings generated as offsprings have the same Hamming weight of
the parents, a constraint which is sought in certain discrete optimization
problems. Although this method reduces the size of the search space, the
resulting fitness landscape often becomes more difficult for the GA to explore
and to discover optimal solutions. This issue has been studied in this paper by
applying an adaptive bias strategy to a counter-based crossover operator that
introduces unbalancedness in the offspring with a certain probability, which is
decreased throughout the evolutionary process. Experiments show that improving
the exploration of the search space with this adaptive bias strategy is
beneficial for the GA performances in terms of the number of optimal solutions
found for the balanced nonlinear Boolean functions problem.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11300</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We investigate the use of Genetic Programming (GP) as a convolutional
predictor for supervised learning tasks in signal processing, focusing on the
use case of predicting missing pixels in images. The training is performed by
sweeping a small sliding window on the available pixels: all pixels in the
window except for the central one are fed in input to a GP tree whose output is
taken as the predicted value for the central pixel. The best GP tree in the
population scoring the lowest prediction error over all available pixels in the
population is then tested on the actual missing pixels of the degraded image.
We experimentally assess this approach by training over four target images,
removing up to 20\% of the pixels for the testing phase. The results indicate
that our method can learn to some extent the distribution of missing pixels in
an image and that GP with Moore neighborhood works better than the Von Neumann
neighborhood, although the latter allows for a larger training set size.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The notion of memory capacity, originally introduced for echo state and
linear networks with independent inputs, is generalized to nonlinear recurrent
networks with stationary but dependent inputs. The presence of dependence in
the inputs makes natural the introduction of the network forecasting capacity,
that measures the possibility of forecasting time series values using network
states. Generic bounds for memory and forecasting capacities are formulated in
terms of the number of neurons of the network and the autocovariance function
of the input. These bounds generalize well-known estimates in the literature to
a dependent inputs setup. Finally, for linear recurrent networks and
independent inputs it is proved that the memory capacity is given by the rank
of the associated controllability matrix.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hyperdimensional (HD) computing is built upon its unique data type referred
to as hypervectors. The dimension of these hypervectors is typically in the
range of tens of thousands. Proposed to solve cognitive tasks, HD computing
aims at calculating similarity among its data. Data transformation is realized
by three operations, including addition, multiplication and permutation. Its
ultra-wide data representation introduces redundancy against noise. Since
information is evenly distributed over every bit of the hypervectors, HD
computing is inherently robust. Additionally, due to the nature of those three
operations, HD computing leads to fast learning ability, high energy efficiency
and acceptable accuracy in learning and classification tasks. This paper
introduces the background of HD computing, and reviews the data representation,
data transformation, and similarity measurement. The orthogonality in high
dimensions presents opportunities for flexible computing. To balance the
tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, strategies include but are not
limited to encoding, retraining, binarization and hardware acceleration.
Evaluations indicate that HD computing shows great potential in addressing
problems using data in the form of letters, signals and images. HD computing
especially shows significant promise to replace machine learning algorithms as
a light-weight classifier in the field of internet of things (IoTs).

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a novel data-driven method for learning deep constrained
continuous control policies and dynamical models of linear systems. By
leveraging partial knowledge of system dynamics and constraint enforcing
multi-objective loss functions, the method can learn from small and static
datasets, handle time-varying state and input constraints and enforce the
stability properties of the controlled system. We use a continuous control
design example to demonstrate the performance of the method on three distinct
tasks: system identification, control policy learning, and simultaneous system
identification and policy learning. We assess the system identification
performance by comparing open-loop simulations of the true system and the
learned models. We demonstrate the performance of the policy learning
methodology in closed-loop simulations using the system model affected by
varying levels of parametric and additive uncertainties. We report superior
performance in terms of reference tracking, robustness, and online
computational and memory footprints compared with classical control approaches,
namely LQR and LQI controllers, and with three variants of model predictive
control (MPC) formulations and two traditional MPC solution approaches. We then
evaluate the potential of simultaneously learning the system model and control
policy. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our unifying
framework for constrained optimal control of linear systems to provide
stability guarantees of the learned dynamics, robustness to uncertainty, and
high sampling efficiency.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Beam-ACO, a modification of the traditional Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
algorithms that incorporates a modified beam search, is one of the most
effective ACO algorithms for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
Although adding beam search to the ACO heuristic search process is effective,
it also increases the amount of work (in terms of partial paths) done by the
algorithm at each step. In this work, we introduce a greedy variant of Beam-ACO
that uses a greedy path selection heuristic. The exploitation of the greedy
path selection is offset by the exploration required in maintaining the beam of
paths. This approach has the added benefit of avoiding costly calls to a random
number generator and reduces the algorithms internal state, making it simpler
to parallelize. Our experiments demonstrate that not only is our greedy
Beam-ACO (gBeam-ACO) faster than traditional Beam-ACO, in some cases by an
order of magnitude, but it does not sacrifice quality of the found solution,
especially on large TSP instances. We also found that our greedy algorithm,
which we refer to as gBeam-ACO, was less dependent on hyperparameter settings.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The in-memory computing paradigm with emerging memory devices has been
recently shown to be a promising way to accelerate deep learning. Resistive
processing unit (RPU) has been proposed to enable the vector-vector outer
product in a crossbar array using a stochastic train of identical pulses to
enable one-shot weight update, promising intense speed-up in matrix
multiplication operations, which form the bulk of training neural networks.
However, the performance of the system suffers if the device does not satisfy
the condition of linear conductance change over around 1,000 conductance
levels. This is a challenge for nanoscale memories. Recently, Charge Trap Flash
(CTF) memory was shown to have a large number of levels before saturation, but
variable non-linearity. In this paper, we explore the trade-off between the
range of conductance change and linearity. We show, through simulations, that
at an optimum choice of the range, our system performs nearly as well as the
models trained using exact floating point operations, with less than 1%
reduction in the performance. Our system reaches an accuracy of 97.9% on MNIST
dataset, 89.1% and 70.5% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets (using
pre-extracted features). We also show its use in reinforcement learning, where
it is used for value function approximation in Q-Learning, and learns to
complete an episode the mountain car control problem in around 146 steps.
Benchmarked to state-of-the-art, the CTF based RPU shows best in class
performance to enable software equivalent performance.

predictions from high-dimensional, complex data, they are widely seen as
uninterpretable &quot;black boxes&quot;, since it can be difficult to discover what input
information is used to make predictions. This ability is particularly important
for applications in cognitive neuroscience and neuroinformatics. A saliency map
is a common approach for producing interpretable visualizations of the relative
importance of input features for a prediction. However, many methods for
creating these maps fail due to focusing too much on the input or being
extremely sensitive to small input noise. It is also challenging to
quantitatively evaluate how well saliency maps correspond to the truly relevant
input information. In this paper, we develop two quantitative evaluation
procedures for saliency methods, using the fact that the Human Connectome
Project (HCP) dataset contains functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) data
from multiple tasks per subject to create ground truth saliency maps.We then
introduce an adversarial training method that makes DNNs robust to small input
noise, and use these evaluations to demonstrate that it greatly improves
interpretability.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: On Bayesian Search for the Feasible Space Under Computationally Expensive Constraints. (arXiv:2004.11055v1 [cs.LG])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We are often interested in identifying the feasible subset of a decision
space under multiple constraints. However, in cases where the constraints
cannot be represented by analytical formulae, the cost of solving these
problems can be prohibitive, since the only way to determine feasibility is to
run computationally or financially expensive simulations. We propose a novel
approach for this problem: we learn a surrogate classifier that can rapidly and
accurately identify feasible solutions using only a very limited number of
samples ($11n$, where $n$ is the dimension of the decision space) obviating the
need for full simulations. This is a data-efficient active-learning approach
using Gaussian processes (GPs), a form of Bayesian regression models, and we
refer to this method as Bayesian search. Using a small training set to begin
with, we train a GP model for each constraint. The algorithm then identifies
the next decision vector to expensively evaluate using an acquisition function.
We subsequently augment the training data set with each newly evaluated
solution, improving the accuracy of the estimated feasibility on each step.
This iterative process continues until the limit on the number of expensive
evaluations is reached. Initially, we adapted acquisition functions from the
reliability engineering literature for this purpose. However, these acquisition
functions do not appropriately consider the uncertainty in predictions offered
by the GP models. We, therefore, introduce a new acquisition function to
account for this. The new acquisition function combines the probability that a
solution lies at the boundary between feasible and infeasible spaces
representing exploitation) as well as the entropy in predictions (representing
exploration). In our experiments, the best classifier has a median informedness
of at least $97.95\%$ across five of the G problems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep reinforcement learning is a promising approach to training a dialog
manager, but current methods struggle with the large state and action spaces of
multi-domain dialog systems. Building upon Deep Q-learning from Demonstrations
(DQfD), an algorithm that scores highly in difficult Atari games, we leverage
dialog data to guide the agent to successfully respond to a user's requests. We
make progressively fewer assumptions about the data needed, using labeled,
reduced-labeled, and even unlabeled data to train expert demonstrators. We
introduce Reinforced Fine-tune Learning, an extension to DQfD, enabling us to
overcome the domain gap between the datasets and the environment. Experiments
in a challenging multi-domain dialog system framework validate our approaches,
and get high success rates even when trained on out-of-domain data.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite many successful applications, Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP)
suffers from limited scalability, especially when used for evolutionary circuit
design. Considering the multiplier design problem, for example, the 5x5-bit
multiplier represents the most complex circuit evolved from a randomly
generated initial population. The efficiency of CGP highly depends on the
performance of the point mutation operator, however, this operator is purely
stochastic. This contrasts with the recent developments in Genetic Programming
(GP), where advanced informed approaches such as semantic-aware operators are
incorporated to improve the search space exploration capability of GP. In this
paper, we propose a semantically-oriented mutation operator (SOMO) suitable for
the evolutionary design of combinational circuits. SOMO uses semantics to
determine the best value for each mutated gene. Compared to the common CGP and
its variants as well as the recent versions of Semantic GP, the proposed method
converges on common Boolean benchmarks substantially faster while keeping the
phenotype size relatively small. The successfully evolved instances presented
in this paper include 10-bit parity, 10+10-bit adder and 5x5-bit multiplier.
The most complex circuits were evolved in less than one hour with a
single-thread implementation running on a common CPU.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A major goal of machine learning is to create techniques that abstract away
irrelevant information. The generalisation property of standard Learning
Classifier System (LCS) removes such information at the feature level but not
at the feature interaction level. Code Fragments (CFs), a form of tree-based
programs, introduced feature manipulation to discover important interactions,
but they often contain irrelevant information, which causes structural
inefficiency. XOF is a recently introduced LCS that uses CFs to encode building
blocks of knowledge about feature interaction. This paper aims to optimise the
structural efficiency of CFs in XOF. We propose two measures to improve
constructing CFs to achieve this goal. Firstly, a new CF-fitness update
estimates the applicability of CFs that also considers the structural
complexity. The second measure we can use is a niche-based method of generating
CFs. These approaches were tested on Even-parity and Hierarchical problems,
which require highly complex combinations of input features to capture the data
patterns. The results show that the proposed methods significantly increase the
structural efficiency of CFs, which is estimated by the rule &quot;generality rate&quot;.
This results in faster learning performance in the Hierarchical Majority-on
problem. Furthermore, a user-set depth limit for CF generation is not needed as
the learning agent will not adopt higher-level CFs once optimal CFs are
constructed.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Differential equations are frequently used in engineering domains, such as
modeling and control of industrial systems, where safety and performance
guarantees are of paramount importance. Traditional physics-based modeling
approaches require domain expertise and are often difficult to tune or adapt to
new systems. In this paper, we show how to model discrete ordinary differential
equations (ODE) with algebraic nonlinearities as deep neural networks with
varying degrees of prior knowledge. We derive the stability guarantees of the
network layers based on the implicit constraints imposed on the weight's
eigenvalues. Moreover, we show how to use barrier methods to generically handle
additional inequality constraints. We demonstrate the prediction accuracy of
learned neural ODEs evaluated on open-loop simulations compared to ground truth
dynamics with bi-linear terms.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In evolutionary computation, different reproduction operators have various
search dynamics. To strike a well balance between exploration and exploitation,
it is attractive to have an adaptive operator selection (AOS) mechanism that
automatically chooses the most appropriate operator on the fly according to the
current status. This paper proposes a new AOS mechanism for multi-objective
evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). More specifically, the
AOS is formulated as a multi-armed bandit problem where the dynamic Thompson
sampling (DYTS) is applied to adapt the bandit learning model, originally
proposed with an assumption of a fixed award distribution, to a non-stationary
setup. In particular, each arm of our bandit learning model represents a
reproduction operator and is assigned with a prior reward distribution. The
parameters of these reward distributions will be progressively updated
according to the performance of its performance collected from the evolutionary
process. When generating an offspring, an operator is chosen by sampling from
those reward distribution according to the DYTS. Experimental results fully
demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our proposed AOS mechanism
compared with other four state-of-the-art MOEA/D variants.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Specialized accelerators for tensor-operations, such as blocked-matrix
operations and multi-dimensional convolutions, have been emerged as powerful
architecture choices for high-performance Deep-Learning computing. The rapid
development of frameworks, models, and precision options challenges the
adaptability of such tensor-accelerators since the adaptation to new
requirements incurs significant engineering costs. Programmable tensor
accelerators offer a promising alternative by allowing reconfiguration of a
virtual architecture that overlays on top of the physical FPGA configurable
fabric. We propose an overlay ({\tau}-VTA) and an optimization method guided by
agile-inspired auto-tuning techniques. We achieve higher performance and faster
convergence than state-of-art.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We study the ability of human observer to control fixation duration during
execution of visual search tasks. We conducted the eye-tracking experiments
with natural and synthetic images and found the dependency of fixation duration
on difficulty of the task and the lengths of preceding and succeeding saccades.
In order to explain it, we developed the novel control model of human
eye-movements that incorporates continuous-time decision making, observation
and update of belief state. This model is based on Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process with delay in observation and saccade execution that accounts
for a delay between eye and cortex. We validated the computational model
through comparison of statistical properties of simulated and experimental
eye-movement trajectories.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we address the problem of car detection from aerial images
using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This problem presents additional
challenges as compared to car (or any object) detection from ground images
because features of vehicles from aerial images are more difficult to discern.
To investigate this issue, we assess the performance of two state-of-the-art
CNN algorithms, namely Faster R-CNN, which is the most popular region-based
algorithm, and YOLOv3, which is known to be the fastest detection algorithm. We
analyze two datasets with different characteristics to check the impact of
various factors, such as UAV's altitude, camera resolution, and object size. A
total of 39 training experiments were conducted to account for the effect of
different hyperparameter values. The objective of this work is to conduct the
most robust and exhaustive comparison between these two cutting-edge algorithms
on the specific domain of aerial images. By using a variety of metrics, we show
that YOLOv3 yields better performance in most configurations, except that it
exhibits a lower recall and less confident detections when object sizes and
scales in the testing dataset differ largely from those in the training
dataset.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Backpropagation is driving today's artificial neural networks (ANNs).
However, despite extensive research, it remains unclear if the brain implements
this algorithm. Among neuroscientists, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms
are often seen as a realistic alternative: neurons can randomly introduce
change, and use unspecific feedback signals to observe their effect on the cost
and thus approximate their gradient. However, the convergence rate of such
learning scales poorly with the number of involved neurons. Here we propose a
hybrid learning approach. Each neuron uses an RL-type strategy to learn how to
approximate the gradients that backpropagation would provide. We provide proof
that our approach converges to the true gradient for certain classes of
networks. In both feedforward and convolutional networks, we empirically show
that our approach learns to approximate the gradient, and can match or the
performance of exact gradient-based learning. Learning feedback weights
provides a biologically plausible mechanism of achieving good performance,
without the need for precise, pre-specified learning rules.

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Presynaptic Calcium Channel Open Probability and Changes in Calcium Influx Throughout the Action Potential Determined Using AP-Waveforms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00017</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00017</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Action potentials arriving at a nerve terminal activate voltage-gated calcium channels and set the electrical driving force for calcium entry which affects the amount and duration of neurotransmitter release. During propagation, the duration, amplitude, and shape of action potentials often changes. This affects calcium entry, and can cause large changes in neurotransmitter release. Here, we have used a series of amplitude and area matched stimuli to examine how the shape and amplitude of a stimulus affect calcium influx at a presynaptic nerve terminal in the mammalian brain. We identify fundamental differences in calcium entry following calcium channel activation by a standard voltage jump vs. an action potential-like stimulation. We also tested a series of action potential-like stimuli with the same amplitude, duration, and stimulus area, but differing in their rise and decay times. We find that a stimulus that matches the rise and decay times of a physiological action potential produces a calcium channel response that is optimized over a range of peak amplitudes. Next, we determined the relative number of calcium channels that are active at different times during an action potential, which is important in the context of how local calcium domains trigger neurotransmitter release. We find the depolarizing phase of an AP-like stimulus only opens ~20% of the maximum number of calcium channels that can be activated. Channels continue to activate during the falling phase of the action potential, with peak calcium channel activation occurring near 0 mV. Although less than 25% of calcium channels are active at the end of the action potential, these calcium channels will generate a larger local calcium concentration that will increase the release probability for nearby vesicles. Determining the change in open probability of presynaptic calcium channels, and taking into account how local calcium concentration also changes throughout the action potential are both necessary to fully understand how the action potential triggers neurotransmitter release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Chronic Presence of Oligomeric Aβ Differentially Modulates Spine Parameters in the Hippocampus and Cortex of Mice With Low APP Transgene Expression</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00016</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is regarded as a synaptopathy with a long presymptomatic phase. Soluble, oligomeric amyloid-β (Aβ) is thought to play a causative role in this disease, which eventually leads to cognitive decline. However, most animal studies have employed mice expressing high levels of the Aβ precursor protein (APP) transgene to drive pathology. Here, to understand how the principal neurons in different brain regions cope with moderate, chronically present levels of Aβ, we employed transgenic mice expressing equal levels of mouse and human APP carrying a combination of three familial AD (FAD)-linked mutations (Swedish, Dutch, and London), that develop plaques only in old age. We analyzed dendritic spine parameters in hippocampal and cortical brain regions after targeted expression of EGFP to allow high-resolution imaging, followed by algorithm-based evaluation of mice of both sexes from adolescence to old age. We report that Aβ species gradually accumulated throughout the life of APP&lt;sub&gt;SDL&lt;/sub&gt; mice, but not the oligomeric forms, and that the amount of membrane-associated oligomers decreased at the onset of plaque formation. We observed an age-dependent loss of thin spines under most conditions as an indicator of a loss of synaptic plasticity in older mice. We further found that hippocampal pyramidal neurons respond to increased Aβ levels by lowering spine density and shifting spine morphology, which reached significance in the CA1 subfield. In contrast, the spine density in cortical pyramidal neurons of APP&lt;sub&gt;SDL&lt;/sub&gt; mice was unchanged. We also observed an increase in the protein levels of PSD-95 and Arc in the hippocampus and cortex, respectively. Our data demonstrated that increased concentrations of Aβ have diverse effects on dendritic spines in the brain and suggest that hippocampal and cortical neurons have different adaptive and compensatory capacity during their lifetime. Our data also indicated that spine morphology differs between sexes in a region-specific manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: 5-Hydroxytryptamine Receptors and Tardive Dyskinesia in Schizophrenia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00063</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a common side effect of antipsychotic treatment. This movement disorder consists of orofacial and limb-truncal components. The present study is aimed at investigating the role of serotonin receptors (HTR) in modulating tardive dyskinesia by genotyping patients with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A set of 29 SNPs of genes of serotonin receptors HTR1A, HTR1B, HTR2A, HTR2C, HTR3A, HTR3B, and HTR6 was studied in a population of 449 Caucasians (226 females and 223 males) with verified clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia (according to ICD-10: F20). Five SNPs were excluded because of low minor allele frequency or for not passing the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test. Affinity of antipsychotics to 5-HT2 receptors was defined according to previous publications. Genotyping was carried out with SEQUENOM Mass Array Analyzer 4.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Statistically significant associations of rs1928040 of HTR2A gene in groups of patients with orofacial type of TD and total diagnosis of TD was found for alleles, and a statistical trend for genotypes. Moreover, statistically significant associations were discovered in the female group for rs1801412 of HTR2C for alleles and genotypes. Excluding patients who used HTR2A, respectively, HTR2C antagonists changed little to the associations of HTR2A polymorphisms, but caused a major change of the magnitude of the association of HTR2C variants. Due to the low patient numbers, these sub-analyses did not have significant results.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We found significant associations in rs1928040 of HTR2A and for rs1801412 of X-bound HTR2C in female patients. The associations were particularly related to the orofacial type of TD. Excluding patients using relevant antagonists particularly affected rs1801412, but not rs1928040-related associations. This suggest that rs1801412 is directly or indirectly linked to the functioning of HTR2C. Further study of variants of the HTR2C gene in a larger group of male patients who were not using HTR2C antagonists is necessary in order to verify a possible functional role of this receptor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: From Neural Tube Formation Through the Differentiation of Spinal Cord Neurons: Ion Channels in Action During Neural Development</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ion channels are expressed throughout nervous system development. The type and diversity of conductances and gating mechanisms vary at different developmental stages and with the progressive maturational status of neural cells. The variety of ion channels allows for distinct signaling mechanisms in developing neural cells that in turn regulate the needed cellular processes taking place during each developmental period. These include neural cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation, which are crucial for developmental events ranging from the earliest steps of morphogenesis of the neural tube through the establishment of neuronal circuits. Here, we compile studies assessing the ontogeny of ionic currents in the developing nervous system. We then review work demonstrating a role for ion channels in neural tube formation, to underscore the necessity of the signaling downstream ion channels even at the earliest stages of neural development. We discuss the function of ion channels in neural cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation and conclude with how the regulation of all these morphogenetic and cellular processes by electrical activity enables the appropriate development of the nervous system and the establishment of functional circuits adapted to respond to a changing environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Early Inflammatory Signatures Predict Subsequent Cognition in Long-Term Virally Suppressed Women With HIV</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00020</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Immunologic function is an important determinant of cognition. Here we examined the contribution of early immune signatures to cognitive performance among HIV-infected, virally suppressed women (HIV+VS) and in HIV-uninfected (HIV-) women. Specifically, we measured serum inflammatory markers, developed combinatory immune signatures, and evaluated their associations with cognition. Forty-nine HIV+VS women in the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) who achieved viral suppression shortly after effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, and 56 matched HIV− women were selected. Forty-two serum inflammatory markers were measured within 2 years of effective ART initiation for HIV+VS women, and at an initial timepoint for HIV− women. The same inflammatory markers were also measured approximately 1, 7, and 12 years later for all women. Of the 105 women with complete immune data, 83 (34 HIV+VS, 49 HIV−) also had cognitive data available 12 years later at ≥1 time points (median = 3.1). We searched for combinatory immune signatures by adapting a dynamic matrix factorization analytic method that builds upon Tucker decomposition followed by Ingenuity&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Pathway Analysis to facilitate data interpretation. Seven combinatory immune signatures emerged based on the Frobenius residual. Three signatures were common between HIV+VS and HIV− women, while four signatures were unique. These inflammatory signatures predicted subsequent cognitive performance in both groups using mixed-effects modeling, but more domain-specific associations were significant in HIV+VS than HIV− women. Leukocyte influx into brain was a major contributor to cognitive function in HIV+VS women, while T cell exhaustion, inflammatory response indicative of depressive/psychiatric disorders, microglial activity, and cytokine signaling predicted both global and domain-specific performance for HIV− women. Our findings suggest that immune signatures may be useful diagnostic, prognostic, and immunotherapeutic targets predictive of subsequent cognitive performance. Importantly, they also provide insight into common and distinct inflammatory mechanisms underlying cognition in HIV− and HIV+VS women.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Linear Predictive Approaches Separate Field Potentials in Animal Model of Parkinson's Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) causes impaired movement and cognition. PD can involve profound changes in cortical and subcortical brain activity as measured by electroencephalography or intracranial recordings of local field potentials (LFP). Such signals can adaptively guide deep-brain stimulation (DBS) as part of PD therapy. However, adaptive DBS requires the identification of triggers of neuronal activity dependent on real time monitoring and analysis. Current methods do not always identify PD-related signals and can entail delays. We test an alternative approach based on linear predictive coding (LPC), which fits autoregressive (AR) models to time-series data. Parameters of these AR models can be calculated by fast algorithms in real time. We compare LFPs from the striatum in an animal model of PD with dopamine depletion in the absence and presence of the dopamine precursor levodopa, which is used to treat motor symptoms of PD. We show that in dopamine-depleted mice a first order AR model characterized by a single LPC parameter obtained by LFP sampling at 1 kHz for just 1 min can distinguish between levodopa-treated and saline-treated mice and outperform current methods. This suggests that LPC may be useful in online analysis of neuronal signals to guide DBS in real time and could contribute to DBS-based treatment of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Subthalamic Single Cell and Oscillatory Neural Dynamics of a Dyskinetic Medicated Patient With Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00391</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Single cell neuronal activity (SUA) and local field potentials (LFP) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of unmedicated Parkinson's disease (PD) patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery have been well-characterized during microelectrode recordings (MER). However, there is limited knowledge about the changes in the firing patterns and oscillations above and within the territories of STN after the intake of dopaminergic medication. Here, for the first time, we report the STN single cell and oscillatory neural dynamics in a medicated patient with idiopathic PD using intraoperative MER. We recorded LFP and SUA with microelectrodes at various depths during bilateral STN-DBS electrode implantation. We isolated 26 neurons in total and observed that tonic and irregular firing patterns of individual neurons predominated throughout the territories of STN. While burst-type firings have been well-characterized in the dorsal territories of STN in unmedicated patients, interestingly, this activity was not observed in our medicated subject. LFP recordings lacked the excessive beta (8–30 Hz) activity, characteristic of the unmedicated state and signal energy was mainly dominated by slow oscillations below 8 Hz. We observed sharp gamma oscillations between 70 and 90 Hz within and above the STN. Despite the presence of a broadband high frequency activity in 200–400 Hz range, no cross-frequency interaction in the form of phase-amplitude coupling was noted between low and high frequency oscillations of LFPs. While our results are in agreement with the previously reported LFP recordings from the DBS lead in medicated PD patients, the sharp gamma peak present throughout the depth recordings and the lack of bursting firings after levodopa intake have not been reported before. The lack of bursting in SUA, the lack of excessive beta activity and cross frequency coupling between HFOs and lower rhythms further validate the link between bursting firing regime of neurons and pathological oscillatory neural activity in PD-STN. Overall, these observations not only validate the existing literature on the PD electrophysiology in healthy/medicated animal models but also provide insights regarding the underlying electro-pathophysiology of levodopa-induced dyskinesias in PD patients through demonstration of multiscale relationships between single cell firings and field potentials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Speech-induced suppression is the normal, relative amplitude reduction of the auditory evoked potential for self-, compared to externally-generated, auditory stimulation. It remains controversial as to whether adults who stutter exhibit expected auditory modulation during speech; some studies have reported a significant difference between stuttering and fluent groups in speech-induced suppression during speech movement planning, while others have not. We compared auditory evoked potentials (N1 component) for auditory feedback arising from one’s own voice (Speaking condition) with passive listening to a recording of one’s own voice (Listening condition) in 24 normally-fluent speakers and 16 adults who stutter under various delayed auditory feedback (DAF) time conditions (100 ms, 200 ms, 500 ms, and 1,000 ms). We presented the participant’s own voice with a delay, immediately after presenting it without a delay. Our working hypothesis was that the shorter the delay time, the more likely the delayed sound is perceived as self-generated. Therefore, shorter delay time conditions are proposed to result in relatively enhanced suppression of the auditory system. Results showed that in fluent speakers, the shorter the delay time, the more the auditory evoked potential in the Speaking condition tended to be suppressed. In the Listening condition, there was a larger evoked potential with shorter delay times. As a result, speech-induced suppression was only significant at the short delay time conditions of 100 and 200 ms. Adults who stutter did not show the opposing changes in the Speaking and Listening conditions seen in the fluent group. Although the evoked potential in the Listening condition tended to decrease as the delay time increased, that in the Speaking condition did not show a distinct trend, and there was a significant suppression only at 200 ms delay. For the 200 ms delay condition, speakers with more severe stuttering showed significantly greater speech-induced suppression than those with less severe stuttering. This preliminary study suggests our methods for investigating evoked potentials by presenting own voice with a delay may provide a clue as to the nature of auditory modulation in stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Investigating the Added Value of FreeSurfer’s Manual Editing Procedure for the Study of the Reading Network in a Pediatric Population</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Insights into brain anatomy are important for the early detection of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as dyslexia. FreeSurfer is one of the most frequently applied automatized software tools to study brain morphology. However, quality control of the outcomes provided by FreeSurfer is often ignored and could lead to wrong statistical inferences. Additional manual editing of the data may be a solution, although not without a cost in time and resources. Past research in adults on comparing the automatized method of FreeSurfer with and without additional manual editing indicated that although editing may lead to significant differences in morphological measures between the methods in some regions, it does not substantially change the sensitivity to detect clinical differences. Given that automated approaches are more likely to fail in pediatric—and inherently more noisy—data, we investigated in the current study whether FreeSurfer can be applied fully automatically or additional manual edits of T1-images are needed in a pediatric sample. Specifically, cortical thickness and surface area measures with and without additional manual edits were compared in six regions of interest (ROIs) of the reading network in 5-to-6-year-old children with and without dyslexia. Results revealed that additional editing leads to statistical differences in the morphological measures, but that these differences are consistent across subjects and that the sensitivity to reveal statistical differences in the morphological measures between children with and without dyslexia is not affected, even though conclusions of marginally significant findings can differ depending on the method used. Thereby, our results indicate that additional manual editing of reading-related regions in FreeSurfer has limited gain for pediatric samples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The perceptron learning algorithm and its multiple-layer extension, the backpropagation algorithm, are the foundations of the present-day machine learning revolution. However, these algorithms utilize a highly simplified mathematical abstraction of a neuron; it is not clear to what extent real biophysical neurons with morphologically-extended non-linear dendritic trees and conductance-based synapses can realize perceptron-like learning. Here we implemented the perceptron learning algorithm in a realistic biophysical model of a layer 5 cortical pyramidal cell with a full complement of non-linear dendritic channels. We tested this biophysical perceptron (BP) on a classification task, where it needed to correctly binarily classify 100, 1,000, or 2,000 patterns, and a generalization task, where it was required to discriminate between two “noisy” patterns. We show that the BP performs these tasks with an accuracy comparable to that of the original perceptron, though the classification capacity of the apical tuft is somewhat limited. We concluded that cortical pyramidal neurons can act as powerful classification devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Light Up the Brain: The Application of Optogenetics in Cell-Type Specific Dissection of Mouse Brain Circuits</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The exquisite intricacies of neural circuits are fundamental to an animal’s diverse and complex repertoire of sensory and motor functions. The ability to precisely map neural circuits and to selectively manipulate neural activity is critical to understanding brain function and has, therefore been a long-standing goal for neuroscientists. The recent development of optogenetic tools, combined with transgenic mouse lines, has endowed us with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision in circuit analysis. These advances greatly expand the scope of tractable experimental investigations. Here, in the first half of the review, we will present applications of optogenetics in identifying connectivity between different local neuronal cell types and of long-range projections with both in vitro and in vivo methods. We will then discuss how these tools can be used to reveal the functional roles of these cell-type specific connections in governing sensory information processing, and learning and memory in the visual cortex, somatosensory cortex, and motor cortex. Finally, we will discuss the prospect of new optogenetic tools and how their application can further advance modern neuroscience. In summary, this review serves as a primer to exemplify how optogenetics can be used in sophisticated modern circuit analyses at the levels of synapses, cells, network connectivity and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Contribution of 5-HT2 Receptors to the Control of the Spinal Locomotor System in Intact Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Applying serotonergic (5-HT) agonists or grafting of fetal serotonergic cells into the spinal cord improves locomotion after spinal cord injury. Little is known about the role of 5-HT receptors in the control of voluntary locomotion, so we administered inverse agonists of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Cyproheptadine; Cypr), 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; neutral antagonist (Volinanserin; Volin), 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2C&lt;/sub&gt; neutral antagonist (SB 242084), and 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/2C&lt;/sub&gt; inverse agonist (SB 206553) receptors intrathecally in intact rats and monitored their effects on unrestrained locomotion. An intrathecal cannula was introduced at the low thoracic level and pushed caudally until the tip reached the L2/L3 or L5/L6 spinal segments. Locomotor performance was evaluated using EMG activity of hindlimb muscles during locomotion on a 2 m long runway. Motoneuron excitability was estimated using EMG recordings during dorsi- and plantar flexion at the ankle. Locomotion was dramatically impaired after the blockage of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. The effect of Cypr was more pronounced than that of Volin since in the L5/L6 rats Cypr (but not Volin) induced significant alteration of the strength of interlimb coordination followed by total paralysis. These agents significantly decreased locomotor EMG amplitude and abolished or substantially decreased stretch reflexes. Blocking 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/2C&lt;/sub&gt; receptors had no effect either on locomotion or reflexes. We suggest that in intact rats serotonin controls timing and amplitude of muscle activity by acting on 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors on both CPG interneurons and motoneurons, while 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/2C&lt;/sub&gt; receptors are not involved in control of the locomotor pattern in lumbar spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Regeneration Through in vivo Cell Fate Reprogramming for Neural Repair</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) has very limited regenerative capacity upon neural injuries or under degenerative conditions. In recent years, however, significant progress has been made on in vivo cell fate reprogramming for neural regeneration. Resident glial cells can be reprogrammed into neuronal progenitors and mature neurons in the CNS of adult mammals. In this review article, we briefly summarize the current knowledge on innate adult neurogenesis under pathological conditions and then focus on induced neurogenesis through cell fate reprogramming. We discuss how the reprogramming process can be regulated and raise critical issues requiring careful considerations to move the field forward. With emerging evidence, we envision that fate reprogramming-based regenerative medicine will have a great potential for treating neurological conditions such as brain injury, spinal cord injury (SCI), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and retinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: CX3CL1 Induces Vertebral Microvascular Barrier Dysfunction via the Src/P115-RhoGEF/ROCK Signaling Pathway</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Trans-endothelial migration (TEM) of cancer cells is a critical step in metastasis. Micro-vascular barrier disruptions of distant organs play important roles in tumor cells TEM. The spine is a preferred site for multiple cancer cell metastases. Our previous study found that vertebral spongy bone was rich in CX3CL1 and that CX3CL1 can attract fractalkine receptor-expressing tumor cells to the spine. In the present study, we determined whether CX3CL1 was involved in vertebral micro-vascular barrier disruption and promoted tumor cell TEM after circulating tumor cells were arrested in the vertebral micro-vasculature. We examined the role of CX3CL1 in the barrier function of vertebral micro-vascular endothelial cells (VMECs) and explored the molecular mechanisms of CX3CL1-induced VMEC barrier disruption. Our results demonstrated that CX3CL1 led to F-actin formation and ZO-1 disruption in VMECs and induced the vertebral micro-vascular barrier disruption. Importantly, we found that the activation of the Src/P115-RhoGEF/ROCK signaling pathway plays an important role in CX3CL1-induced VMEC stress fiber formation, ZO-1 disruption and then vertebral micro-vascular barrier hyper-permeability. Inhibiting Src/P115-RhoGEF/ROCK signaling in VMECs effectively blocked CX3CL1-induced vertebral vascular endothelial dysfunction and subsequent tumor cell TEM. The results of this study and our previous study indicate that in addition to its chemotaxis, CX3CL1 plays a critical role in regulating vertebral micro-vascular barrier function and tumor cell TEM. CX3CL1 induced VMECs stress fiber formation, ZO-1 disruption and then vascular endothelial hyperpermeability via activation of the Src/P115-RhoGEF/ROCK signaling pathway. The inhibition of the Src/P115-RhoGEF/ROCK signaling pathway in VMECs effectively blocked tumor cells TEMs in vertebral spongy bone and maybe a potential therapeutic strategy for spine metastases in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Going the Extra (Synaptic) Mile: Excitotoxicity as the Road Toward Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00090</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00090</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Excitotoxicity is a phenomenon that describes the toxic actions of excitatory neurotransmitters, primarily glutamate, where the exacerbated or prolonged activation of glutamate receptors starts a cascade of neurotoxicity that ultimately leads to the loss of neuronal function and cell death. In this process, the shift between normal physiological function and excitotoxicity is largely controlled by astrocytes since they can control the levels of glutamate on the synaptic cleft. This control is achieved through glutamate clearance from the synaptic cleft and its underlying recycling through the glutamate-glutamine cycle. The molecular mechanism that triggers excitotoxicity involves alterations in glutamate and calcium metabolism, dysfunction of glutamate transporters, and malfunction of glutamate receptors, particularly N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDAR). On the other hand, excitotoxicity can be regarded as a consequence of other cellular phenomena, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, physical neuronal damage, and oxidative stress. Regardless, it is known that the excessive activation of NMDAR results in the sustained influx of calcium into neurons and leads to several deleterious consequences, including mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, impairment of calcium buffering, the release of pro-apoptotic factors, among others, that inevitably contribute to neuronal loss. A large body of evidence implicates NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity as a central mechanism in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and epilepsy. In this review article, we explore different causes and consequences of excitotoxicity, discuss the involvement of NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity and its downstream effects on several neurodegenerative disorders, and identify possible strategies to study new aspects of these diseases that may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic approaches. With the understanding that excitotoxicity is a common denominator in neurodegenerative diseases and other disorders, a new perspective on therapy can be considered, where the targets are not specific symptoms, but the underlying cellular phenomena of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Squamous trans-differentiation of pancreatic cancer cells promotes stromal inflammation</title>

	<description>A highly aggressive subset of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas undergo trans-differentiation into the squamous lineage during disease progression. Here, we investigated whether squamous trans-differentiation of human and mouse pancreatic cancer cells can influence the phenotype of non-neoplastic cells in the tumor microenvironment. Conditioned media experiments revealed that squamous pancreatic cancer cells secrete factors that recruit neutrophils and convert pancreatic stellate cells into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that express inflammatory cytokines at high levels. We use gain- and loss-of-function approaches to show that squamous-subtype pancreatic tumor models become enriched with neutrophils and inflammatory CAFs in a p63-dependent manner. These effects occur, at least in part, through p63-mediated activation of enhancers at pro-inflammatory cytokine loci, which includes &lt;i&gt;IL1A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CXCL1&lt;/i&gt; as key targets. Taken together, our findings reveal enhanced tissue inflammation as a consequence of squamous trans-differentiation in pancreatic cancer, thus highlighting an instructive role of tumor cell lineage in reprogramming the stromal microenvironment.</description>

	<title>eLife: Dominant Vibrio cholerae phage exhibits lysis inhibition sensitive to disruption by a defensive phage satellite</title>

	<description>Bacteria, bacteriophages that prey upon them, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) compete in dynamic environments, evolving strategies to sense the milieu. The first discovered environmental sensing by phages, lysis inhibition, has only been characterized and studied in the limited context of T-even coliphages. Here, we discover lysis inhibition in the etiological agent of the diarrheal disease cholera, &lt;i&gt;Vibrio cholerae,&lt;/i&gt; infected by ICP1, a phage ubiquitous in clinical samples. This work identifies the ICP1-encoded holin, &lt;i&gt;teaA,&lt;/i&gt; and antiholin, &lt;i&gt;arrA,&lt;/i&gt; that mediate lysis inhibition. Further, we show that an MGE, the defensive phage satellite PLE, collapses lysis inhibition. Through &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;ysis &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;nhibition &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;isruption a conserved PLE protein, LidI, is sufficient to limit the phage produced from infection, bottlenecking ICP1. These studies link a novel incarnation of the classic lysis inhibition phenomenon with conserved defensive function of a phage satellite in a disease context, highlighting the importance of lysis timing during infection and parasitization.</description>

	<title>eLife: The switch-like expression of Heme-regulated kinase 1 mediates neuronal proteostasis following proteasome inhibition</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/52714</link>
	<description>We examined the feedback between the major protein degradation pathway, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), and protein synthesis in rat and mouse neurons. When protein degradation was inhibited, we observed a coordinate dramatic reduction in nascent protein synthesis in neuronal cell bodies and dendrites. The mechanism for translation inhibition involved the phosphorylation of eIF2α, surprisingly mediated by eIF2α kinase 1, or heme-regulated kinase inhibitor (HRI). Under basal conditions, neuronal expression of HRI is barely detectable. Following proteasome inhibition, HRI protein levels increase owing to stabilization of HRI and enhanced translation, likely via the increased availability of tRNAs for its rare codons. Once expressed, HRI is constitutively active in neurons because endogenous heme levels are so low; HRI activity results in eIF2α phosphorylation and the resulting inhibition of translation. These data demonstrate a novel role for HRI in neurons that senses and responds to compromised function of the proteasome to restore proteostasis.</description>

	<description>Activation of the kappa opioid receptor ( KOR ) contributes to the aversive properties of stress, and modulates key neuronal circuits underlying many neurobehavioral disorders. KOR agonists directly inhibit ventral tegmental area ( VTA )dopaminergic neurons, contributing to aversive responses [1,2] ; therefore, selective KOR antagonists represent a novel therapeutic approach to restore circuit function. We used whole cell electrophysiology in acute rat midbrain slices to evaluate pharmacological properties of four novel KOR antagonists: BTRX-335140, BTRX -395750, PF -04455242, and JNJ-67953964. Each compound concentration-dependently reduced the outward current induced by the KOR selective agonist U- 69,593. BTRX -335140 and BTRX -395750 fully blocked U-69,593 currents (IC 50 = 1.3 {+/-} 0.9 and 4.6 {+/-} 0.9 nM, respectively). JNJ-67953964 showed an IC 50 of 0.3 {+/-} 1.3 nM. PF- 04455242 ( IC 50 = 19.6 {+/-} 16 nM) exhibited partial antagonist activity ( ~ 60% maximal blockade ) .In 50% of neurons, 1 m M PF -04455242 generated an outward current independent of KOR activation. BTRX-335140 (10 nM) did not affect responses to saturating concentrations of the mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonist DAMGO or the delta opioid receptor (DOR) agonist DPDPE, while JNJ-67953964 (10 nM) partially blocked DAMGO responses and had no effect on DPDPE responses. Importantly, BTRX -335140 (10 nM) rapidly washed out with complete recovery of U-69,593 responses within 10 min. Collectively, we show electrophysiological evidence of key differences amongst KOR antagonists that could impact their therapeutic potential and have not been observed using recombinant systems. The results of this study demonstrate the value of characterizing compounds in native neuronal tissue and within disorder- relevant circuits implicated in neurobehavioral disorders.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Activates Glial Cells and Inhibits Neurogenesis after Pneumococcal Meningitis</title>

	<description>Pneumococcal meningitis (PM) causes damage to the hippocampus, a brain structure critically involved in learning and memory. Hippocampal injury - which compromises neurofunctional outcome - occurs as apoptosis of progenitor cells and immature neurons of the hippocampal dentate granule cell layer thereby impairing the regenerative capacity of the hippocampal stem cell niche. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) harbours the potential to modulate the proliferative activity of this neuronal stem cell niche. In this study, specific rTMS protocols - namely continuous and intermittent theta burst stimulation (cTBS and iTBS) - were applied on infant rats microbiologically cured from PM by five days of antibiotic treatment. Following two days of exposure to TBS, differential gene expression was analysed by whole transcriptome analysis using RNAseq. cTBS provoked a prominent effect in inducing differential gene expression in the cortex and the hippocampus, whereas iTBS only affect gene expression in the cortex. TBS induced polarisation of microglia and astrocytes towards an inflammatory phenotype, while reducing neurogenesis, neuroplasticity and regeneration. cTBS was further found to induce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro . We conclude that cTBS intensified neuroinflammation after PM, which translated into increased release of pro-inflammatory mediators thereby inhibiting neuroregeneration.</description>

	<description>Cognitive impairments can be a significant problem after a traumatic brain injury (TBI), which affects millions worldwide each year. There is a need for establish reproducible cognitive assays in rodents to better understand disease mechanisms and to develop therapeutic interventions towards treating TBI-induced impairments. Our goal was to validate and standardize the radial arm water maze (RAWM) test as an assay to screen for cognitive impairments caused by TBI. RAWM is a visuo-spatial learning test, originally designed for use with rats, and later adapted for mice. The present study investigates whether test procedures, such us the presence of extra-maze cues influences learning and memory performance. C57BL/6 mice were tested in an 8-arm RAWM using a four-day protocol. We demonstrated that two days of training, exposing the mice to extra-maze cues and a visible platform, influenced learning and memory performance. Mice that did not receive training performed poorer compared to mice trained. To further validate our RAWM protocol, we used scopolamine.We, also, demonstrated that a single mild closed head injury (CHI) caused deficits in this task at two weeks post-CHI. Our data supported the use of 7 trials per day and a spaced training protocol as key factor to unmask memory impairment following CHI. Here, we provide a detailed standard operating procedure for RAWM test, which can be applied to a variety of mouse models including neurodegenerative diseases and pathology, as well as when pharmacological approaches are used.</description>

	<description>The central pattern generator (CPG) for locomotion is set of pacemaker neurons endowed with inherent bursting driven by the persistent sodium current ( I NaP ). How they proceed to regulate the locomotor rhythm remained unknown. Here, in neonatal rodents, we identified a persistent potassium current, critical in regulating pacemakers and locomotion speed. This current recapitulates features of the M-current ( I M ); a subthreshold non-inactivating outward current blocked by XE991 and enhanced by ICA73. Immunostaining and mutant mice highlight an important role of axonal Kv7.2 channels in mediating I M . Pharmacological modulation of I M regulates the emergence and the frequency regime of both pacemaker and CPG activities, and controls the speed of locomotion. Computational models captured these results and show howed an interplay between I M and I NaP that endows the locomotor CPG with rhythmogenic properties. Overall, this study provides fundamental insights into how I M and I NaP work in tandem to set the speed of locomotion.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Circuits for integrating learnt and innate valences in the fly brain</title>

	<description>Animal behavior is shaped both by evolution and by individual experience. In many species parallel brain pathways are thought to encode innate and learnt behavior drives and as a result may link the same sensory cue to different actions if innate and learnt drives are in opposition. How these opposing drives are integrated into a single coherent action is not well understood. In insects, the Mushroom Body Output Neurons (MBONs) and the Lateral Horn Neurons (LHNs) are thought to provide the learnt and innate drives, respectively. However their patterns of convergence and the mechanisms by which their outputs are used to select actions are not well understood. We used electron microscopy reconstruction to comprehensively map the downstream targets of all MBONs in Drosophila larva and characterise their patterns of convergence with LHNs. We discovered convergence neurons that receive direct input from MBONs and LHNs and compare opposite behaviour drives. Functional imaging and optogenetic manipulation suggest these convergence neurons compute the overall predicted value of approaching or avoiding an odor and mediate action selection. Our study describes the circuit mechanisms allowing integration of opposing drives from parallel olfactory pathways.</description>

	<description>Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is an extracellular signaling molecule involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes. Yet, in situ characterization of the spatiotemporal dynamic of extracellular ATP is still challenging due to the lack of sensor with appropriate specificity, sensitivity and kinetics. Here we report the development of biosensors based on the fusion of cation permeable ATP receptors (P2X) to genetically encoded calcium sensors (GECI). By combining the features of P2X receptors with the high signal to noise ratio of GECIs, we generated ultrasensitive green and red fluorescent sniffers that detect nanomolar ATP concentrations in situ and also enable the tracking of P2X receptor activity. We provide the proof of concept that these sensors can dynamically track ATP release evoked by neuronal depolarization or by extracellular hypotonicity. Targeting these P2X-based biosensors to diverse cell types should advance our knowledge of extracellular ATP dynamics in vivo.</description>

	<description>Maps of the synapses made and neurotransmitters released by all neurons in model systems such as C. elegans have left still unresolved how neural circuits integrate and respond to neurotransmitter signals. Using the egg-laying circuit of C. elegans as a model, we mapped which cells express each of the 26 neurotransmitter G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) of this organism and also genetically analyzed the functions of all 26 GPCRs. We found that individual neurons express many distinct receptors, epithelial cells often express neurotransmitter receptors, and receptors are often positioned to receive extrasynaptic signals. The egg-laying circuit appears to use redundancy and compensation to achieve functional robustness, as receptor knockouts reveal few defects; however, increasing receptor signaling through overexpression more efficiently reveals receptor functions. This map of neurotransmitter GPCR expression and function in the egg-laying circuit provides a model for understanding GPCR signaling in other neural circuits.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Autonomic activity during a daytime nap facilitates working memory improvement</title>

	<description>Recent investigations have implicated the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in higher-order executive functions. These actions are purported to occur through ANS modulation of the prefrontal cortex, with parasympathetic activity during wake associated with working memory ability (WM). Compared with wake, sleep is a period with substantially greater parasympathetic tone. Recent work has reported that sleep may also contribute to improvement in WM. Here, we examined the role of cardiac parasympathetic activity during sleep on WM improvement in healthy young adults. Participants were tested in an operation span task (OSpan) in the morning and evening, and during the inter-test period subjects either experienced a nap or wake. We measured high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV) as an index of cardiac, parasympathetic activity during both wake and sleep. Participants showed the expected boost in parasympathetic activity during nap, compared with wake, as well as greater WM improvement after a nap compared with an equivalent period awake. Furthermore, parasympathetic activity during sleep, but not wake, was significantly correlated with WM improvement. Together these results indicate that the natural boost in parasympathetic activity during sleep has substantial benefits to gains in prefrontal executive function in young adults. We present a conceptual model illustrating the interaction between sleep, autonomic activity, and prefrontal brain function, and highlight open research questions that will facilitate understanding of the factors that contribute to executive abilities in young adults, as well as in cognitive aging.

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Autonomic/Central Coupling Boosts Working Memory in Healthy Young Adults</title>

	<description>Working memory (WM) is an executive function that can improve with training. However, the precise mechanism for this improvement is not known. Studies have shown greater WM gains after a period of sleep than a similar period of wake (Kuriyama et al. 2008a; Zinke, Noack, and Born 2018), with WM improvement correlated with slow wave activity (SWA; 0.5-1Hz) during slow wave sleep (SWS) (Sattari et al. 2019; Pugin et al. 2015; Ferrarelli et al. 2019). A different body of literature has suggested an important role for autonomic activity during wake for WM (Hansen et al. 2004; Mosley, Laborde, and Kavanagh 2018). A recent study from our group reported that the temporal coupling of autonomic and central events (ACEs) during sleep was associated with memory consolidation (Naji et al. 2019). We found that heart rate bursts (HR bursts) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep are accompanied by increases in SWA and sigma (12-15Hz) power, as well as increases in the high-frequency (HF) component of the RR interval, reflecting vagal rebound. In addition, ACEs predict long-term, episodic memory improvement. Building on these previous results, we examined whether ACEs may also contribute to gains in WM. We tested 104 young adults in an operation span task (OSPAN) in the morning and evening, with either a nap (with electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG)) or wake between testing sessions. We identified HR bursts in the ECG and replicated the increases in SWA and sigma prior to peak of the HR burst, as well as vagal rebound after the peak. Furthermore, we showed sleep-dependent WM improvement, which was predicted by ACE activity. Using regression analyses, we discovered that significantly more variance in WM improvement could be explained with ACE variables than with overall sleep activity not time-locked with ECG. These results provide the first evidence that coordinated autonomic and central events play a significant role in sleep-related WM improvement and implicate the potential of autonomic interventions during sleep for cognitive enhancement.</description>

	<description>Many studies have highlighted the difficulty inherent to the clinical application of fundamental neuroscience knowledge based on machine learning techniques. It is difficult to generalize machine learning brain markers to the data acquired from independent imaging sites, mainly due to large site differences in functional magnetic resonance imaging. We address the difficulty of finding a generalizable major depressive disorder (MDD) brain network markers which would distinguish patients from healthy controls (a classifier) or would predict symptom severity (a prediction model) based on resting state functional connectivity patterns. For the discovery dataset with 713 participants from 4 imaging sites, we removed site differences using our recently developed harmonization method and developed a machine learning MDD brain network markers. The classifier achieved 70% generalization accuracy, and the prediction model moderately well predicted symptom severity for an independent validation dataset with 449 participants from 4 different imaging sites. Finally, we found common 2 functional connections between those related to MDD diagnosis and those related to depression symptoms. The successful generalization to the perfectly independent dataset acquired from multiple imaging sites is novel and ensures scientific reproducibility and clinical applicability.</description>

	<description>Multivesicular release (MVR) allows retinal bipolar cells to transmit visual signals as changes in both the rate and amplitude of synaptic events. How do neuromodulators reguate this vesicle code? By imaging larval zebrafish, we find that the variability of calcium influx is a major source of synaptic noise. Dopamine increases synaptic gain up to 15-fold while Substance P reduces it 7-fold, both by acting on the presynaptic calcium transient to alter the distribution of amplitudes of multivesicular events. An increase in gain is accompanied by a decrease in the temporal precision of transmission and a reduction in the efficiency with which vesicles transfer visual information. The decrease in gain caused by Substance P was also associated with a shift in temporal filtering from band-pass to low-pass. This study demonstrates how neuromodulators act on the synaptic transformation of the visual signal to alter the way information is coded with vesicles.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Mask, the Drosophila Ankyrin Repeat and KH domain-containing protein, regulates microtubule dynamics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.22.056051v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.22.056051v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Proper regulation of microtubule (MT) dynamics is vital for essential cellular processes and many neuronal activities, including axonal transport and synaptic growth and remodeling. Here we demonstrate that Mask negatively regulates MT stability and maintains a balanced MT length and architecture in both fly larval muscles and motor neurons. In larval muscles, loss of mask increases MT length, and altering mask genetically modifies the Tau-induced MT fragmentation. In motor neurons, loss of mask function reduces the number of End-Binding Protein 1 (EB1)-positive MT plus-ends in the axons and results in overexpansion of the presynaptic terminal at larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJ). mask shows strong genetic interaction with stathmin (stai), a neuronal modulator of MT dynamics, in regulation of axon transportation and synaptic terminal stability. The structure/function analysis on Mask suggests that Mask's action in regulating MT stability does not depend on the nucleotide-binding function of its KH domain. Furthermore, through a proteomic approach, we found that Mask physically interacts with Jupiter, an MT stabilizing factor. The MT localization of Jupiter in the axons inversely correlates with Mask levels, suggesting that Mask may modulate MT stability by inhibiting the association of Jupiter to MTs.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Item recognition and lure discrimination in younger and older adults are supported by alpha/beta desynchronization</title>

	<description>Our episodic memories vary in their specificity, ranging from a mere sense of familiarity to detailed recollection of the initial experience. Recent work suggests that alpha/beta desynchronization promotes information flow through the cortex, tracking the richness in detail of recovered memory representations. At the same time, as we age, memories become less vivid and detailed, which may be reflected in age-related reductions in alpha/beta desynchronization during retrieval. To understand age differences in the specificity of episodic memories, we investigated differences in alpha/beta desynchronization between younger (18-26 years, n = 31) and older (65-76 years, n = 28) adults during item recognition and lure discrimination. Alpha/beta desynchronization increased linearly with the demand for memory specificity, i.e., the requirement to retrieve details for an accurate response, across retrieval situations (correct rejections &amp;lt; item recognition &amp;lt; lure discrimination). Stronger alpha/beta desynchronization was related to memory success, as indicated by reliable activation differences between correct and incorrect memory responses. In line with the assumption of a loss of mnemonic detail in older age, older adults had more difficulties than younger adults to discriminate lures from targets. Importantly, they also showed a reduced modulation of alpha/beta desynchronization across retrieval demands. Together, these results extend previous findings by demonstrating that alpha/beta desynchronization dissociates between item recognition and the retrieval of highly detailed memories as required in lure discrimination, and that age-related impairments in episodic retrieval are accompanied by attenuated modulations in the alpha/beta band. Thus, we provide novel findings suggesting that alpha/beta desynchronization tracks mnemonic specificity and that changes in these oscillatory mechanisms may underlie age-related declines in episodic memory.</description>

	<description>Microdeletions and microduplications of the 16p11.2 chromosomal locus are associated with syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders and reciprocal physiological conditions such as macro/microcephaly and high/low body mass index. To facilitate cellular and molecular investigations of these phenotypes, 65 clones of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were generated from 13 individuals with 16p11.2 copy number variations (CNVs). Cortical neural progenitor cells derived from these hiPSCs were profiled using RNA-Seq, which identified alterations in radial glial gene expression that precede morphological abnormalities reported at later neurodevelopmental stages. Moreover, a customizable bioinformatic strategy for the detection of random integration and expression of reprogramming vectors was developed and leveraged towards identifying a subset of footprint-free hiPSC clones that are available by request from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative. This publicly available resource of 65 human hiPSC clones can serve as a powerful medium for probing the etiology of developmental disorders associated with 16p11.2 CNVs</description>

	<description>A goal in addiction research is to distinguish forms of neuroplasticity that are involved in the transition to addiction from those involved in mere drug taking. Animal models of drug self-administration are essential in this context. Here, we compared in male rats two cocaine self-administration procedures that differ in the extent to which they evoke addiction-like behaviours. We measured both incentive motivation for cocaine using progressive ratio procedures, and cocaine-induced c-fos mRNA expression, a marker of neuronal activity. Rats self-administered intravenous cocaine (0.25 mg/kg/infusion) for seven daily 6-hour sessions. One group had intermittent access (IntA; 6 minutes ON, 26 minutes OFF x 12) to rapid infusions (delivered over 5 seconds). This models the temporal kinetics of human cocaine use and produces robust addiction-like behaviour. The other group had Long access (LgA) to slower infusions (90 seconds). This produces high levels of intake without promoting robust addiction-like behaviour. LgA-90s rats took twice as much cocaine as IntA-5s rats did, but IntA-5s rats showed greater incentive motivation for the drug. Following a final self-administration session, we quantified c-fos mRNA expression in corticostriatal regions. Compared to LgA-90s rats, IntA-5s rats had more cocaine-induced c-fos mRNA in the orbitofrontal and prelimbic cortices and the caudate-putamen. Thus, a cocaine self-administration procedure (intermittent intake of rapid infusions) that promotes increased incentive motivation for the drug also enhances cocaine-induced gene regulation in corticostriatal regions. This suggests that increased drug-induced recruitment of these regions could contribute to the neural and behavioural plasticity underlying the transition to addiction.</description>

	<description>We present the reliability of ultra-high field T2* MRI at 7T, as part of the UK7T Network's &quot;Travelling Heads&quot; study. T2*-weighted MRI images can be processed to produce quantitative susceptibility maps (QSM) and R2* maps. These reflect iron and myelin concentrations, which are altered in many pathophysiological processes. The relaxation parameters of human brain tissue are such that R2* mapping and QSM show particularly strong gains in contrast-to-noise ratio at ultra-high field (7T) vs clinical field strengths (1.5 - 3T). We aimed to determine the inter-subject and inter-site reproducibility of QSM and R2* mapping at 7T, in readiness for future multi-site clinical studies. Methods: Ten healthy volunteers were scanned with harmonised single- and multi-echo T2*-weighted gradient echo pulse sequences. Participants were scanned five times at each &quot;home&quot; site and once at each of four other sites. The five sites had 1x Philips, 2x Siemens Magnetom, and 2x Siemens Terra scanners. QSM and R2* maps were computed with the Multi-Scale Dipole Inversion (MSDI) algorithm (https://github.com/fil-physics/Publication-Code). Results were assessed in relevant subcortical and cortical regions of interest (ROIs) defined manually or by the MNI152 standard space. Results and Discussion: Mean susceptibility ({chi}) and R2* values agreed broadly with literature values in all ROIs. The inter-site within-subject standard deviation was 0.001-0.005 ppm ({chi}) and 0.0005-0.001 ms-1 (R2*). For {chi} this is 21-95% better than 3T reports, and 15-124% better for R2*. The median ICC from within- and cross-site R2* data was 0.98 and 0.91, respectively. Multi-echo QSM had greater variability vs single-echo QSM especially in areas with large B0 inhomogeneity such as the inferior frontal cortex. Across sites, R2* values were more consistent than QSM in subcortical structures due to differences in B0-shimming. On a between-subject level, our measured {chi} and R2* cross-site variance is comparable to within-site variance in the literature, suggesting that it is reasonable to pool data across sites using our harmonised protocol. Conclusion: The harmonized UK7T protocol and pipeline delivers over a 2-fold improvement in the coefficient of reproducibility for QSM and R2* at 7T compared to previous reports of multi-site reproducibility at 3T. These protocols are ready for use in multi-site clinical studies at 7T.</description>

	<description>Pediatric brain tumor survivors experience significant cognitive sequelae from their diagnosis and treatment. The exact mechanisms of these injuries are poorly understood, and validated predictors of cognitive outcome are lacking. The current study aims to determine if there are abnormalities in functional brain network organization and cognitive performance in pediatric brain tumor patients, measured via resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) and the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery, respectively. Further, we assess potential relationships between changes in brain network architecture and behavior in the patients. Patients ages 4-18 years old with diagnosis of a brain tumor underwent awake rsfMRI during regularly scheduled clinical imaging and were tested with the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery. Overall, functional brain network organization was significantly different in patients compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Network integrity within the dorsal attention network was particularly affected, with 86% of patients having connectivity strength 2+ SD below the mean of controls (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Moreover, cognitive testing of patients demonstrated significant impairments in multiple domains, including attention (p &amp;lt; 0.05, FDR corrected). Finally, a significant amount of variance of age-adjusted total composite scores from the Toolbox was explained by changes in segregation between the dorsal attention and default mode networks as well as sex (R2 = 0.52, p &amp;lt; 0.05). Pediatric brain tumor patients demonstrated statistically significant deficits in multiple cognitive domains and multiple abnormalities in brain network architecture. Thus, rsfMRI may provide insight into neural systems that underlie these changes in cognitive function, suggesting that these metrics may serve as a biomarker for cognitive performance.</description>

	<description>Roughly half of all individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience cognitive impairment, but there are no approved treatments that target this aspect of the disease. Recent studies link reduced brain N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) levels to impaired cognition in various neurological diseases, including MS. NAAG levels are regulated by glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), which hydrolyzes the neuropeptide to N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and glutamate. Although several GCPII inhibitors, such as 2-(phosphonomethyl)-pentanedioic acid (2-PMPA), elevate brain NAAG levels and restore cognitive function in preclinical studies when given at high systemic doses or via direct brain injection, no GCPII inhibitors are clinically available due to poor bioavailability and limited brain penetration. Systemic hydroxyl dendrimers (~4 nm) have been successfully used to enhance brain delivery of drugs selectively to activated glia. We recently discovered that GCPII is highly upregulated in activated microglia after brain injury. To determine if dendrimer conjugation could enhance the brain delivery of GCPII inhibitors, specifically in the context of MS, we attached 2-PMPA to hydroxyl polyamidoamicne (PAMAM) dendrimers (D-2PMPA) using a highly efficient click chemistry approach. Targeted uptake of D-2PMPA into activated glia was subsequently confirmed in glial cultures where it showed robust anti-inflammatory activity, including an elevation in TGF and a reduction in TNF. Given these positive effects, D-2PMPA (20mg/kg) or vehicle dendrimer were dosed twice weekly to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-immunized mice starting at disease onset (therapeutic paradigm). D-2PMPA significantly improved cognition in EAE as assessed by Barnes maze performance, even though physical severity was not impacted. Glial target engagement was confirmed, as CD11b+ enriched cells isolated from hippocampi in D-2PMPA-treated mice exhibited almost complete loss of GCPII activity. These data demonstrate the utility of hydroxyl dendrimers to enhance brain penetration and support the development of D-2PMPA to treat cognitive impairment in MS.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Tonic GABAergic activity facilitates dendritic calcium signaling and short-term plasticity</title>

	<description>Brain activity is highly regulated by GABAergic activity, which acts via synaptic GABAARs to suppress somatic spike generation as well as dendritic synaptic integration and calcium signaling. Tonic GABAergic conductances mediated by extrasynaptic receptors can also inhibit neuronal excitability and spike output, though the consequences for dendritic calcium signaling are unclear. Here, we use 2-photon calcium imaging in cortical pyramidal neurons and computational modeling to show that high affinity GABAARs containing an a5 subunit mediate a tonic hyperpolarization of the dendritic membrane potential, resulting in deinactivation of voltage-gated calcium channels and a paradoxical boosting of action potential-evoked calcium influx. We also find that GABAergic enhancement of calcium signaling modulates short-term synaptic plasticity, augmenting depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition. These results demonstrate a novel role for GABA in the control of dendritic activity and suggest a mechanism for differential modulation of electrical and biochemical signaling.</description>

	<description>Microglia interact with neurons to facilitate synapse plasticity; however, signal transducers between microglia and neuron remain unknown. Here, using in vitro organotypic hippocampal slice cultures and transient MCAO in genetically-engineered mice in vivo, we report that at 24 h post-ischemia microglia release BDNF to downregulate glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission within the penumbra area. Analysis of the CA1 hippocampal formation in vitro shows that proBDNF and mBDNF downregulate dendritic spine and gephyrin scaffold stability through p75NTR and TrkB receptors respectively. Post-MCAO, we report that in the penumbra and in the corresponding contralateral hemisphere similar neuroplasticity occur through microglia activation and gephyrin phosphorylation at Ser268, Ser270. Targeted deletion of the Bdnf gene in microglia or GphnS268A/S270A (phospho-null) point-mutations protect against ischemic brain damage, neuroinflamation and synapse downregulation post-MCAO. Collectively, we report a new unanticipated role for gephyrin phosphorylation in inflammation and microglia activation for neuroprotective plasticity after transient ischemia.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Intrinsic, dynamic and effective connectivity among large-scale brain networks modulated by oxytocin</title>

	<description>The neuropeptide oxytocin is a key modulator of social-emotional behavior and its intranasal administration can influence the functional connectivity of brain networks involved in the control of attention, emotion and reward reported in humans. However, no studies have systematically investigated the effects oxytocin on dynamic or directional aspects of functional connectivity. The present study employed a novel computational framework to investigate these latter aspects in 15 oxytocin-sensitive regions using data from randomized placebo-controlled between-subject resting state functional MRI studies incorporating 200 healthy subjects. Results showed that oxytocin extensively modulated effective connectivity both between and within emotion, reward, salience and social cognition processing networks and their interactions with the default mode network, but had no effect on the frequency of dynamic changes. Top-down control over emotional processing regions such as the amygdala was particularly affected. Oxytocin effects were also sex-dependent, being more extensive in males. Overall, these findings suggest that modulatory effects of oxytocin on both within- and between-network interactions may underlie its functional influence on social-emotional behaviors, although in a sex-dependent manner. Furthermore, they demonstrate a useful approach to determining pharmacological influences on resting state effective connectivity and support oxytocin's potential therapeutic use in psychiatric disorders.</description>

	<description>Brain cerebral cortical architecture encoding regionally differential dendritic arborization and synaptic formation at birth underlies human behavior emergence at 2 years of age. Brain changes in 0-2 years are most dynamic across lifespan. Effective prediction of future behavior with brain microstructure at birth will reveal structural basis of behavioral emergence in typical development, and identify biomarkers for early detection and tailored intervention in atypical development. Here, we aimed to evaluate the neonate whole-brain cortical microstructure quantified by diffusion MRI for predicting future behavior. We found that individual cognitive and language functions assessed at age of 2 years were robustly predicted by neonate cortical microstructure using support vector regression. Remarkably, cortical regions contributing heavily to the prediction models exhibited distinctive functional selectivity for cognition and language. These findings highlight regional cortical microstructure at birth as potential sensitive biomarker in predicting future neurodevelopmental outcomes and identifying individual risks of brain disorders.</description>

	<description>Diverse types of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons (PyNs) mediate the myriad processing streams and output channels of the cerebral cortex, yet all derive from neural progenitors of the embryonic dorsal telencephalon. Here, we establish genetic strategies and tools for dissecting and fate mapping PyN subpopulations based on their developmental and molecular programs. We leverage key transcription factors and effector genes to systematically target the temporal patterning programs in progenitors and differentiation programs in postmitotic neurons. We generated over a dozen of temporally inducible mouse Cre and Flp knock-in driver lines to enable combinatorial targeting of major progenitor types and projection classes. Intersectional converter lines confer viral access to specific subsets defined by developmental origin, marker expression, anatomical location and projection targets. These strategies establish an experimental framework for multi-modal characterization of PyN subpopulations and tracking their developmental trajectories toward elucidating the organization and assembly of cortical processing networks and output channels.</description>

	<description>The brain neuromodulatory systems heavily influence behavioral and cognitive processes. Previous work has shown that norepinephrine (NE), a classic neuromodulator mainly derived from the locus coeruleus (LC), enhances neuronal responses to sensory stimuli. However, the role of the LC-NE system in modulating perceptual task performance is not well understood. In addition, systemic perturbation of NE signaling has often been proposed to specifically target the LC in functional studies, yet the assumption that localized (specific) and systemic (nonspecific) perturbations of LC-NE have the same behavioral impact remains largely untested. In this study, we trained mice to perform a head-fixed, quantitative tactile detection task, and administered an 2 adrenergic receptor agonist or antagonist to pharmacologically down- or up-regulate LC-NE activity, respectively. We addressed the outstanding question of how bidirectional perturbations of LC-NE activity affect tactile detection, and tested whether localized and systemic drug treatments exert the same behavioral effects. We found that both localized and systemic suppression of LC-NE impaired tactile detection by reducing motivation. Surprisingly, while locally activating LC-NE enabled mice to perform in a near-optimal regime, systemic activation impaired behavior by promoting impulsivity. Our results demonstrate that localized silencing and activation of LC-NE differentially affect tactile detection, and that localized and systemic NE activation induce distinct behavioral changes.</description>

	<description>A powerful paradigm to identify the neural correlates of consciousness is binocular rivalry, wherein a constant visual stimulus evokes a varying conscious percept. It has recently been suggested that activity modulations observed during rivalry could represent the act of report rather than the conscious percept itself. Here, we performed single-unit recordings from face patches in macaque inferotemporal (IT) cortex using a no-report paradigm in which the animal's conscious percept was inferred from eye movements. We found high proportions of IT neurons represented the conscious percept even without active report. Population activity in single trials, measured using a new 128-site Neuropixels-like electrode, was more weakly modulated by rivalry than by physical stimulus transitions, but nevertheless allowed decoding of the changing conscious percept. These findings suggest that macaque face patches encode both the physical stimulus and the animal's conscious visual percept, and the latter encoding does not require active report.</description>

	<description>Being able to replicate real experiments with computational simulations is a unique opportunity to refine and validate models with experimental data and redesign the experiments based on simulations. However, since it is technically demanding to model all components of an experiment, traditional approaches to modeling reduce the experimental setups as much as possible. In this study, our goal is to replicate all the relevant features of an experiment on motor control and motor rehabilitation after stroke. To this aim, we propose an approach that allows continuous integration of new experimental data into a computational modeling framework. First, results show that we could reproduce experimental object displacement with high accuracy via the simulated embodiment in the virtual world by feeding a spinal cord model with experimental registration of the cortical activity. Second, by using computational models of multiple granularities, our preliminary results show the possibility of simulating several features of the brain after stroke, from the local alteration in neuronal activity to long-range connectivity remodeling. Finally, strategies are proposed to merge the two pipelines. We further suggest that additional models could be integrated into the framework thanks to the versatility of the proposed approach, thus allowing many researchers to achieve continuously improved experimental design.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Presynaptic APP levels and synaptic homeostasis are regulated by Akt phosphorylation of Huntingtin</title>

	<description>Studies have suggested that amyloid precursor protein (APP) regulates synaptic homeostasis, but the evidence has not been consistent. In particular, signaling pathways controlling APP transport to the synapse in axons and dendrites remain to be identified. Having previously shown that Huntingtin (HTT), the scaffolding protein involved in Huntington's disease, regulates neuritic transport of APP, we used a microfluidic corticocortical neuronal network-on-a-chip to examine APP transport and localization to the pre- and post-synaptic compartments. We found that HTT, upon phosphorylation by the Ser/Thr kinase Akt, regulates APP transport in axons but not dendrites. Expression of an unphosphorylatable HTT decreased axonal anterograde transport of APP, reduced presynaptic APP levels, and increased synaptic density. Ablating in vivo HTT phosphorylation in APPPS1 mice, which overexpress APP, reduced presynaptic APP levels, restored synapse number and improved learning and memory. The Akt-HTT pathway and axonal transport of APP thus regulate APP presynaptic levels and synapse homeostasis.</description>

Until now, existing methods for identifying lncRNA related miRNA sponge modules mainly rely on lncRNA related miRNA sponge interaction networks, which may not provide a full picture of miRNA sponging activities in biological conditions. Hence there is a strong need of new computational methods to identify lncRNA related miRNA sponge modules. In this work, we propose a framework, LMSM, to identify LncRNA related MiRNA Sponge Modules from heterogeneous data. To understand the miRNA sponging activities in biological conditions, LMSM uses gene expression data to evaluate the influence of the shared miRNAs on the clustered sponge lncRNAs and mRNAs. We have applied LMSM to the human breast cancer (BRCA) dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). As a result, we have found that the majority of LMSM modules are significantly implicated in BRCA and most of them are BRCA subtype-specific. Most of the mediating miRNAs act as crosslinks across different LMSM modules, and all of LMSM modules are statistically significant. Multi-label classification analysis shows that the performance of LMSM modules is significantly higher than baseline’s performance, indicating the biological meanings of LMSM modules in classifying BRCA subtypes. The consistent results suggest that LMSM is robust in identifying lncRNA related miRNA sponge modules. Moreover, LMSM can be used to predict miRNA targets. Finally, LMSM outperforms a graph clustering-based strategy in identifying BRCA-related modules. Altogether, our study shows that LMSM is a promising method to investigate modular regulatory mechanism of sponge lncRNAs from heterogeneous data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/l-ra7e3ldqI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Electrical stimulation of neural systems is a key tool for understanding neural dynamics and ultimately for developing clinical treatments. Many applications of electrical stimulation affect large populations of neurons. However, computational models of large networks of spiking neurons are inherently hard to simulate and analyze. We evaluate a reduced mean-field model of excitatory and inhibitory adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (AdEx) neurons which can be used to efficiently study the effects of electrical stimulation on large neural populations. The rich dynamical properties of this basic cortical model are described in detail and validated using large network simulations. Bifurcation diagrams reflecting the network’s state reveal asynchronous up- and down-states, bistable regimes, and oscillatory regions corresponding to fast excitation-inhibition and slow excitation-adaptation feedback loops. The biophysical parameters of the AdEx neuron can be coupled to an electric field with realistic field strengths which then can be propagated up to the population description. We show how on the edge of bifurcation, direct electrical inputs cause network state transitions, such as turning on and off oscillations of the population rate. Oscillatory input can frequency-entrain and phase-lock endogenous oscillations. Relatively weak electric field strengths on the order of 1 V/m are able to produce these effects, indicating that field effects are strongly amplified in the network. The effects of time-varying external stimulation are well-predicted by the mean-field model, further underpinning the utility of low-dimensional neural mass models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7zMWipN6ZMc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Converging theories suggest that organisms learn and exploit probabilistic models of their environment. However, it remains unclear how such models can be learned in practice. The open-ended complexity of natural environments means that it is generally infeasible for organisms to model their environment comprehensively. Alternatively, &lt;i&gt;action-oriented&lt;/i&gt; models attempt to encode a parsimonious representation of adaptive agent-environment interactions. One approach to learning action-oriented models is to learn online in the presence of goal-directed behaviours. This constrains an agent to behaviourally relevant trajectories, reducing the diversity of the data a model need account for. Unfortunately, this approach can cause models to prematurely converge to sub-optimal solutions, through a process we refer to as a &lt;i&gt;bad-bootstrap&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we exploit the normative framework of &lt;i&gt;active inference&lt;/i&gt; to show that efficient action-oriented models can be learned by balancing goal-oriented and epistemic (&lt;i&gt;information-seeking&lt;/i&gt;) behaviours in a principled manner. We illustrate our approach using a simple agent-based model of bacterial chemotaxis. We first demonstrate that learning via goal-directed behaviour indeed constrains models to behaviorally relevant aspects of the environment, but that this approach is prone to sub-optimal convergence. We then demonstrate that epistemic behaviours facilitate the construction of accurate and comprehensive models, but that these models are not tailored to any specific behavioural niche and are therefore less efficient in their use of data. Finally, we show that active inference agents learn models that are parsimonious, tailored to action, and which avoid bad bootstraps and sub-optimal convergence. Critically, our results indicate that models learned through active inference can support adaptive behaviour in spite of, and indeed &lt;i&gt;because of&lt;/i&gt;, their departure from veridical representations of the environment. Our approach provides a principled method for learning adaptive models from limited interactions with an environment, highlighting a route to sample efficient learning algorithms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kVx4Eq3TDIk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The network architecture of an ecological community describes the structure of species interactions established in a given place and time. It has been suggested that this architecture presents unique features for each type of ecological interaction: e.g., nested and modular architectures would correspond to mutualistic and antagonistic interactions, respectively. Recently, Michalska-Smith and Allesina (2019) proposed a computational challenge to test whether it is indeed possible to differentiate ecological interactions based on network architecture. Contrary to the expectation, they found that this differentiation is practically impossible, moving the question to why it is not possible to differentiate ecological interactions based on their network architecture alone. Here, we show that this differentiation becomes possible by adding the local environmental information where the networks were sampled. We show that this can be explained by the fact that environmental conditions are a confounder of ecological interactions and network architecture. That is, the lack of association between network architecture and type of ecological interactions changes by conditioning on the local environmental conditions. Additionally, we find that environmental conditions are linked to the stability of ecological networks, but the direction of this effect depends on the type of interaction network. This suggests that the association between ecological interactions and network architectures exists, but cannot be fully understood without attention to the environmental conditions acting upon them.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xleeyv_OWW0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A massive number of biological entities, such as genes and mutations, are mentioned in the biomedical literature. The capturing of the semantic relatedness of biological entities is vital to many biological applications, such as protein-protein interaction prediction and literature-based discovery. Concept embeddings—which involve the learning of vector representations of concepts using machine learning models—have been employed to capture the semantics of concepts. To develop concept embeddings, named-entity recognition (NER) tools are first used to identify and normalize concepts from the literature, and then different machine learning models are used to train the embeddings. Despite multiple attempts, existing biomedical concept embeddings generally suffer from suboptimal NER tools, small-scale evaluation, and limited availability. In response, we employed high-performance machine learning-based NER tools for concept recognition and trained our concept embeddings, BioConceptVec, via four different machine learning models on ~30 million PubMed abstracts. BioConceptVec covers over 400,000 biomedical concepts mentioned in the literature and is of the largest among the publicly available biomedical concept embeddings to date. To evaluate the validity and utility of BioConceptVec, we respectively performed two intrinsic evaluations (identifying related concepts based on drug-gene and gene-gene interactions) and two extrinsic evaluations (protein-protein interaction prediction and drug-drug interaction extraction), collectively using over 25 million instances from nine independent datasets (17 million instances from six intrinsic evaluation tasks and 8 million instances from three extrinsic evaluation tasks), which is, by far, the most comprehensive to our best knowledge. The intrinsic evaluation results demonstrate that BioConceptVec consistently has, by a large margin, better performance than existing concept embeddings in identifying similar and related concepts.

	<title>eNeuro: Components of Endocannabinoid Signaling System Are Expressed in the Perinatal Mouse Cerebellum and Required for Its Normal Development</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling system (ECS), encompassing cannabinoid receptors and enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of the endogenous cannabinoid signaling lipids, is highly expressed in the cerebellar cortex of adult humans and rodents. In addition to their well-established role in neuromodulation, eCBs have been shown to play key roles in aspects of neurodevelopment in the fore- and mid-brain, including neurogenesis, cell migration, and synapse specification. However, little is known about the role of ECS in cerebellar development. In this study, we conducted immunohistochemical characterization of ECS components through key stages of cerebellar development in mice using antibodies for 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) synthetizing and degrading enzymes and the major brain cannabinoid receptor, cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), in combination with cerebellar cell markers. Our results reveal a temporally, spatially, and cytologically dynamic pattern of expression. Production, receptor binding, and degradation of eCBs are tightly controlled, thus localization of eCB receptors and the complementary cannabinoid signaling machinery determines the direction, duration, and ultimately the outcome of eCB signaling. To gain insights into the role of eCB signaling in cerebellar development, we characterized gross anatomy of cerebellar midvermis in CB1 knock-out (CB1 KO) mice, as well as their performance in cerebellar-influenced motor tasks. Our results show persistent and selective anatomic and behavioral alterations in CB1 KOs. Consequently, the insights gained from this study lay down the foundation for investigating specific cellular and molecular mechanisms regulated by eCB signaling during cerebellar development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Differential Scaling of Synaptic Molecules within Functional Zones of an Excitatory Synapse during Homeostatic Plasticity</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Homeostatic scaling is a form of synaptic plasticity where individual synapses scale their strengths to compensate for global suppression or elevation of neuronal activity. This process can be studied by measuring miniature EPSP (mEPSP) amplitudes and frequencies following the regulation of activity in neuronal cultures. Here, we demonstrate a quantitative approach to characterize multiplicative synaptic scaling using immunolabelling of hippocampal neuronal cultures treated with tetrodotoxin (TTX) or bicuculline to extract scaling factors for various synaptic proteins. This approach allowed us to directly examine the scaling of presynaptic and postsynaptic scaffolding molecules along with neurotransmitter receptors in primary cultures from mouse and rat hippocampal neurons. We show robust multiplicative scaling of synaptic scaffolding molecules namely, Shank2, PSD95, Bassoon, and AMPA receptor subunits and quantify their scaling factors. We use super-resolution microscopy to calculate scaling factors of surface expressed GluA2 within functional zones of the synapse and show that there is differential and correlated scaling of GluA2 levels within the spine, the postsynaptic density (PSD), and the perisynaptic regions. Our method opens a novel paradigm to quantify relative molecular changes of synaptic proteins within distinct subsynaptic compartments from a large number of synapses in response to alteration of neuronal activity, providing anatomic insights into the intricacies of variability in strength of individual synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Effect of Stimulus-Dependent Spike Timing on Population Coding of Sound Location in the Owls Auditory Midbrain</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In the auditory system, the spectrotemporal structure of acoustic signals determines the temporal pattern of spikes. Here, we investigated this effect in neurons of the barn owl’s auditory midbrain (&lt;i&gt;Tyto furcata&lt;/i&gt;) that are selective for auditory space and whether it can influence the coding of sound direction. We found that in the nucleus where neurons first become selective to combinations of sound localization cues, reproducibility of spike trains across repeated trials of identical sounds, a metric of across-trial temporal fidelity of spiking patterns evoked by a stimulus, was maximal at the sound direction that elicited the highest firing rate. We then tested the hypothesis that this stimulus-dependent patterning resulted in rate co-modulation of cells with similar frequency and spatial selectivity, driving stimulus-dependent synchrony of population responses. Tetrodes were used to simultaneously record multiple nearby units in the optic tectum (OT), where auditory space is topographically represented. While spiking of neurons in OT showed lower reproducibility across trials compared with upstream nuclei, spike-time synchrony between nearby OT neurons was highest for sounds at their preferred direction. A model of the midbrain circuit explained the relationship between stimulus-dependent reproducibility and synchrony, and demonstrated that this effect can improve the decoding of sound location from the OT output. Thus, stimulus-dependent spiking patterns in the auditory midbrain can have an effect on spatial coding. This study reports a functional connection between spike patterning elicited by spectrotemporal features of a sound and the coding of its location.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;A fundamental challenge in studying principles of organization used by the olfactory system to encode odor concentration information has been identifying comprehensive sets of activated odorant receptors (ORs) across a broad concentration range inside freely behaving animals. In mammals, this has recently become feasible with high-throughput sequencing-based methods that identify populations of activated ORs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. In this study, we characterized the mouse OR repertoires activated by the two odorants, acetophenone (ACT) and 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT), from 0.01% to 100% (v/v) as starting concentrations using phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 capture followed by RNA-Seq. We found Olfr923 to be one of the most sensitive ORs that is enriched by ACT. Using a mouse line that genetically labels Olfr923-positive axons, we provided evidence that ACT activates the Olfr923 glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Through molecular dynamics stimulations, we identified amino acid residues in the Olfr923 binding cavity that facilitate ACT binding. This study sheds light on the active process by which unique OR repertoires may collectively facilitate the discrimination of odorant concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: An Indexing Theory for Working Memory Based on Fast Hebbian Plasticity</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Working memory (WM) is a key component of human memory and cognition. Computational models have been used to study the underlying neural mechanisms, but neglected the important role of short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) interactions for WM. Here, we investigate these using a novel multiarea spiking neural network model of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and two parietotemporal cortical areas based on macaque data. We propose a WM indexing theory that explains how PFC could associate, maintain, and update multimodal LTM representations. Our simulations demonstrate how simultaneous, brief multimodal memory cues could build a temporary joint memory representation as an &quot;index&quot; in PFC by means of fast Hebbian synaptic plasticity. This index can then reactivate spontaneously and thereby also the associated LTM representations. Cueing one LTM item rapidly pattern completes the associated uncued item via PFC. The PFC–STM network updates flexibly as new stimuli arrive, thereby gradually overwriting older representations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Unique Organization of Actin Cytoskeleton in Magnocellular Vasopressin Neurons in Normal Conditions and in Response to Salt-Loading</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) are intrinsically osmosensitive and can be activated by increases in blood osmolality, triggering the release of antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (VP) to promote water retention. Hence, the activity of magnocellular VP neurons is one of the key elements contributing to the regulation of body fluid homeostasis in healthy organisms. Chronic exposure to high dietary salt leads to excessive activation of VP neurons, thereby elevating levels of circulating VP, which can cause increases in blood pressure contributing to salt-dependent hypertension. However, the molecular basis underlying high-salt diet-induced hyperactivation of magnocellular VP neurons remains not fully understood. Previous studies suggest that magnocellular neurosecretory neurons contain a subcortical layer of actin filaments and pharmacological stabilization of this actin network potentiates osmotically-induced activation of magnocellular neurons. Using super-resolution imaging &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;, we investigated the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in rat MNCs under normal physiological conditions and after a chronic increase in blood osmolality following 7 d of salt-loading (SL). We found that, in addition to the subcortical layer of actin filaments, magnocellular VP neurons are endowed with a unique network of cytoplasmic actin filaments throughout their somata. Moreover, we revealed that the density of both subcortical and cytoplasmic actin networks in magnocellular VP neurons is dramatically increased following SL. These results suggest that increased osmo-responsiveness of VP neurons following chronic exposure to high dietary salt may be mediated by the modulation of unique actin networks in magnocellular VP neurons, possibly contributing to elevated blood pressure in this condition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Disjoint principal component analysis by constrained binary particle swarm optimization. (arXiv:2004.10701v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10701</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we propose an alternative method to the disjoint principal
component analysis. The method consists of a principal component analysis with
constraints, which allows us to determine disjoint components that are linear
combinations of disjoint subsets of the original variables. The proposed method
is named constrained binary optimization by particle swarm disjoint principal
component analysis, since it is based on the particle swarm optimization. The
method uses stochastic optimization to find solutions in cases of high
computational complexity. The algorithm associated with the method starts
generating randomly a particle population which iteratively evolves until
attaining a global optimum which is function of the disjoint components.
Numerical results are provided to confirm the quality of the solutions attained
by the proposed method. Illustrative examples with real data are conducted to
show the potential applications of the method.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Foraging is a fundamental behavior as animals' search for food is crucial for
their survival. Patch leaving is a canonical foraging behavior, but classic
theoretical conceptions of patch leaving decisions lack some key naturalistic
details. Optimal foraging theory provides general rules for when an animal
should leave a patch, but does not provide mechanistic insights about how those
rules change with the structure of the environment. Such a mechanistic
framework would aid in designing quantitative experiments to unravel behavioral
and neural underpinnings of foraging. To address these shortcomings, we develop
a normative theory of patch foraging decisions. Using a Bayesian approach, we
treat patch leaving behavior as a statistical inference problem. We derive the
animals' optimal decision strategies in both non-depleting and depleting
environments. A majority of these cases can be analyzed explicitly using
methods from stochastic processes. Our behavioral predictions are expressed in
terms of the optimal patch residence time and the decision rule by which an
animal departs a patch. We also extend our theory to a hierarchical model in
which the forager learns the environmental food resource distribution. The
quantitative framework we develop will therefore help experimenters move from
analyzing trial based behavior to continuous behavior without the loss of
quantitative rigor. Our theoretical framework both extends optimal foraging
theory and motivates a variety of behavioral and neuroscientific experiments
investigating patch foraging behavior.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain dynamics can exhibit narrow-band nonlinear oscillations and
multistability. For a subset of disorders of consciousness and motor control,
we hypothesize that some symptoms originate from the inability to spontaneously
transition from one attractor to another. Using external perturbations, such as
electrical pulses delivered by deep brain stimulation devices, it may be
possible to induce such transition out of the pathological attractors. However,
the induction of transition may be non-trivial, rendering the current open-loop
stimulation strategies insufficient. In order to develop next-generation neural
stimulators that can intelligently learn to induce attractor transitions, we
require a platform to test the efficacy of such systems. To this end, we
designed an analog circuit as a model for the multistable brain dynamics. The
circuit spontaneously oscillates stably on two periods as an instantiation of a
3-dimensional continuous-time gated recurrent neural network. To discourage
simple perturbation strategies such as constant or random stimulation patterns
from easily inducing transition between the stable limit cycles, we designed a
state-dependent nonlinear circuit interface for external perturbation. We
demonstrate the existence of nontrivial solutions to the transition problem in
our circuit implementation.

network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons of Hodgkin and Huxley type
inspired by the visual cortex V1. The model emphasizes an approach combining a
driven stochastic drive for each neuron and recurrent inputs resulting from the
network activity. After a review of the dynamics of a single HH equation, for
both deterministic and stochastic driven case, we proceed to the analysis of
the network. Our numerical analysis highlights emergent properties such as
partial synchronization and synchronization, waves of excitability, and
oscillations in the gamma-band frequency.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: No evidence that epilepsy impacts criticality in pre-seizure single-neuron activity of human cortex. (arXiv:2004.10642v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epileptic seizures are characterized by abnormal and excessive neural
activity, where cortical network dynamics seem to become unstable. However,
most of the time, during seizure-free periods, cortex of epilepsy patients
shows perfectly stable dynamics. This raises the question of how recurring
instability can arise in the light of this stable default state. In this work,
we examine two potential scenarios of seizure generation: (i) epileptic
cortical areas might generally operate closer to instability, which would make
epilepsy patients generally more susceptible to seizures, or (ii) epileptic
cortical areas might drift systematically towards instability before seizure
onset. We analyzed single-unit spike recordings from both the epileptogenic
(focal) and the nonfocal cortical hemispheres of 20 epilepsy patients. We
quantified the distance to instability in the framework of criticality, using a
novel estimator, which enables an unbiased inference from a small set of
recorded neurons. Surprisingly, we found no evidence for either scenario:
Neither did focal areas generally operate closer to instability, nor were
seizures preceded by a drift towards instability. In fact, our results from
both pre-seizure and seizure-free intervals suggest that despite epilepsy,
human cortex operates in the stable, slightly subcritical regime, just like
cortex of other healthy mammalians.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10558</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many cooperative physical tasks require that individuals play specialized
roles (e.g., leader-follower). Humans are adept cooperators, negotiating these
roles and transitions between roles innately. Yet how roles are delegated and
reassigned is not well understood. Using a genetic algorithm, we evolve
simulated agents to explore a space of feasible role-switching policies.
Applying these switching policies in a cooperative manual task, agents process
visual and haptic cues to decide when to switch roles. We then analyze the
evolved virtual population for attributes typically associated with
cooperation: load sharing and temporal coordination. We find that the best
performing dyads exhibit high temporal coordination (anti-synchrony). And in
turn, anti-synchrony is correlated to symmetry between the parameters of the
cooperative agents. These simulations furnish hypotheses as to how human
cooperators might mediate roles in dyadic tasks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper investigates how often the popular configurations of Differential
Evolution generate solutions outside the feasible domain. Following previous
publications in the field, we argue that what the algorithm does with such
solutions and how often this has to happen is important for the overall
performance of the algorithm and interpretation of results. Significantly more
solutions than what is usually assumed by practitioners have to undergo some
sort of 'correction' to conform with the definition of the problem's search
domain. A wide range of popular Differential Evolution configurations is
considered in this study. Conclusions are made regarding the effect the
Differential Evolution components and parameter settings have on the
distribution of percentages of infeasible solutions generated in a series of
independent runs. Results shown in this study suggest strong dependencies
between percentages of generated infeasible solutions and every aspect
mentioned above. Further investigation of the distribution of percentages of
generated infeasible solutions is required.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10424</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are general-purpose problem solvers that
usually perform an unbiased search. This is reasonable and desirable in a
black-box scenario. For combinatorial optimization problems, often more
knowledge about the structure of optimal solutions is given, which can be
leveraged by means of biased search operators. We consider the Minimum Spanning
Tree (MST) problem in a single- and multi-objective version, and introduce a
biased mutation, which puts more emphasis on the selection of edges of low rank
in terms of low domination number. We present example graphs where the biased
mutation can significantly speed up the expected runtime until (Pareto-)optimal
solutions are found. On the other hand, we demonstrate that bias can lead to
exponential runtime if heavy edges are necessarily part of an optimal solution.
However, on general graphs in the single-objective setting, we show that a
combined mutation operator which decides for unbiased or biased edge selection
in each step with equal probability exhibits a polynomial upper bound -- as
unbiased mutation -- in the worst case and benefits from bias if the
circumstances are favorable.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Significance: Imaging neural activity in myelinated tissue using optical
coherence tomography (OCT) creates exciting possibilities for functional
imaging in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Aim: To investigate
changes in OCT images in response to evoked neural activity in sciatic nerve of
rat in vitro. Approach: M-scans were obtained on peripheral nerves of rat using
a swept source polarisation sensitive OCT system, while a nerve cuff acquired
electrical neural recordings. From a total of 10 subjects: 3 had no stimulation
(controls), 3 had paw stimulation, and 4 had nerve stimulation. Changes in the
OCT signal intensity, phase retardation, phase, and frequency spectra were
calculated for each subject and reference samples of a mirror and microspheres
in solution. Results: Observed changes in intensity in 3 paw stimulation and 2
nerve stimulation subjects and changes in frequency spectra amplitude in 2 paw
stimulation subjects were above the reference noise level and were temporally
consistent with osmotic swelling from ion currents during neural activity.
Conclusion: Light scattering changes produced by osmotic swelling, which have
previously been characterized in squid and crab nerve, are also thought to
occur in myelinated fibres on a scale which is detectable using OCT.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce a learning-based strategy for multi-modal registration of images
acquired with any modality, without requiring real data during training. While
classical registration methods can accurately align multi-modal image pairs,
they solve a costly optimization problem for every new pair of images.
Learning-based techniques are fast at test time, but can only register images
of the specific anatomy and modalities they were trained on. In contrast, our
approach leverages a generative model to synthesize label maps and gray-scale
images that expose a network to a wide range of anatomy and contrast during
training. We demonstrate that this strategy enables robust registration of
arbitrary modalities, without the need to retrain for a new modality.
Critically, we show that input labels need not be of actual anatomy: training
on randomly synthesized shapes, or supervoxels, results in competitive
registration performance and makes the network agnostic to anatomy and
contrast, all while eradicating the need for real data. We present extensive
experiments demonstrating that this strategy enables registration of modalities

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Effective Reinforcement Learning through Evolutionary Surrogate-Assisted Prescription. (arXiv:2002.05368v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is now significant historical data available on decision making in
organizations, consisting of the decision problem, what decisions were made,
and how desirable the outcomes were. Using this data, it is possible to learn a
surrogate model, and with that model, evolve a decision strategy that optimizes
the outcomes. This paper introduces a general such approach, called
Evolutionary Surrogate-Assisted Prescription, or ESP. The surrogate is, for
example, a random forest or a neural network trained with gradient descent, and
the strategy is a neural network that is evolved to maximize the predictions of
the surrogate model. ESP is further extended in this paper to sequential
decision-making tasks, which makes it possible to evaluate the framework in
reinforcement learning (RL) benchmarks. Because the majority of evaluations are
done on the surrogate, ESP is more sample efficient, has lower variance, and
lower regret than standard RL approaches. Surprisingly, its solutions are also
better because both the surrogate and the strategy network regularize the
decision-making behavior. ESP thus forms a promising foundation to decision
optimization in real-world problems.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Biological sex classification with structural MRI data shows increased misclassification in transgender women. (arXiv:1911.10617v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transgender individuals (TIs) show brain structural alterations that differ
from their biological sex as well as their perceived gender. To substantiate
evidence that the brain structure of TIs differs from male and female, we use a
combined multivariate and univariate approach. Gray matter segments resulting
from voxel-based morphometry preprocessing of $N = 1753$ cisgender (CG) healthy
participants were used to train ($N=1402$) and validate (20 % hold-out; $N =
351$) a support-vector machine classifying the biological sex. As a second
validation, we classified $N = 1104$ patients with depression. A third
validation was performed using the matched CG sample of the transgender women
(TWs) application-sample. Subsequently, the classifier was applied to $N = 26$
TWs. Finally, we compared brain volumes of CG-men, women and TW-pre/post
treatment (cross-sex hormone treatment) in a univariate analysis controlling
for sexual orientation, age and total brain volume. The application of our
biological sex classifier to the transgender sample resulted in a significantly
lower true positive rate (TPR) (TPR-male = 56.0 %). The TPR did not differ
between CG-individuals with (TPR-male = 86.9 %) and without depression
(TPR-male = 88.5 %). The univariate analysis of the transgender
application-sample revealed that TW-pre/post treatment show brain structural
differences from CG-women and CG-men in the putamen and insula, as well as the
whole-brain analysis. Our results support the hypothesis that brain structure
in TW differs from brain structure of their biological sex (male) as well as
their perceived gender (female). This finding substantiates evidence that TIs
show specific brain structural alterations leading to a different pattern of
brain structure than CG-individuals.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Inducing Partner Preference in Mice by Chemogenetic Stimulation of CA2 Hippocampal Subfield</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00061</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social recognition is fundamental for social decision making and the establishment of long-lasting affiliative behaviors in behaviorally complex social groups. It is a critical step in establishing a selective preference for a social partner or group member. C57BL/6J lab mice do not form monogamous relationships, and typically do not show prolonged social preferences for familiar mice. The CA2 hippocampal subfield plays a crucial role in social memory and optogenetic stimulation of inputs to the dorsal CA2 field during a short memory acquisition period can enhance and extend social memories in mice. Here, we show that partner preference in mice can be induced by chemogenetic selective stimulation of the monosynaptic projections from the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) to the CA2 during the cohabitation period. Specifically, male mice spend more time in social contact, grooming and huddling with the partner compared to a novel female. Preference was not induced by prolonging the cohabitation period and allowing more time for social interactions and males to sire pups with the familiar female. These results suggest that PVN-to-CA2 projections are part of an evolutionarily conserved neural circuitry underlying the formation of social preference and may promote behavioral changes with appropriate stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Merosin deficient Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (MDC1A), or LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-RD), is a recessive disorder resulting from mutations in the LAMA2 gene, encoding for the alpha-2 chain of laminin-211. The disease is predominantly characterized by progressive muscular dystrophy affecting patient motor function and reducing life expectancy. However, LAMA2-RD also comprises a developmentally-associated dysmyelinating neuropathy that contributes to the disease progression, in addition to brain abnormalities; the latter often underappreciated. In this brief review, we present data supporting the impact of peripheral neuropathy in the LAMA2-RD phenotype, including both mouse models and human studies. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying nerve abnormalities and involved in the laminin-211 pathway, which affects axon sorting, ensheathing and myelination. We conclude with some final considerations of consequences on nerve regeneration and potential therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Measures of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) activity have been shown to be sensitive to cognitive function and disease state. However, there is growing evidence that variations in vigilance can lead to pronounced and spatially widespread differences in resting-state brain activity. Unless properly accounted for, differences in vigilance can give rise to changes in resting-state activity that can be misinterpreted as primary cognitive or disease-related effects. In this paper, we examine in detail the link between vigilance and rsfMRI measures, such as signal variance and functional connectivity. We consider how state changes due to factors such as caffeine and sleep deprivation affect both vigilance and rsfMRI measures and review emerging approaches and methodological challenges for the estimation and interpretation of vigilance effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Meta-Analysis of Gray Matter Differences Between Bilinguals and Monolinguals</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Bilingualism is of great interest to the neuroscience of language, and understanding the anatomical changes associated with second language learning help inform theories of bilingual advantage across the lifespan. While the literature on structural differences between bilinguals and monolinguals is robust, relatively few studies of gray matter (GM) have directly compared bilinguals with monolinguals in a whole-brain analysis. Overall, this and heterogeneity of study samples and methodology have led to a lack of clear anatomical support for major theories. Here, we engage in an activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies of GM for cases that directly compare bilingual and monolingual subjects in a whole-brain analysis. The analysis (sixteen foci, from ten contrasts across eight studies) resulted in one cluster located primarily within the anterior lobe of the right cerebellum. However, when the one pediatric study was removed, the analysis revealed no consistent results across the studies included in this meta-analysis. This suggests that for VBM studies of bilingual and monolingual adults there is considerable heterogeneity of results that complicate the understanding of the bilingual brain. Future studies will need to include larger, more well-defined samples and interrogate more fine-grained anatomical features such as cortical thickness and surface area in order to more fully examine the anatomical changes associated with bilingualism across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Agency and Performance of Reach-to-Grasp With Modified Control of a Virtual Hand: Implications for Rehabilitation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study investigated how modified control of a virtual hand executing reach-to-grasp affects functional performance and agency (perception of control). The objective of this work was to demonstrate positive relationships between reaching performance and grasping agency and motivate greater consideration of agency in movement rehabilitation. We hypothesized that agency and performance have positive correlation across varying control modes of the virtual hand. In this study, each participant controlled motion of a virtual hand through motion of his or her own hand. Control of the virtual hand was modified according to a specific control mode. Each mode involved the virtual hand moving at a modified speed, having noise, or including a level of automation. These specific modes represent potential control features to adapt for a rehabilitation device such as a prosthetic arm and hand. In this study, significant changes in agency and performance were observed across the control modes. Overall, a significant positive relationship (p &amp;lt; 0.001) was observed between the primary performance metric of reach (tracking a minimum path length trajectory) and an implicit measurement of agency (intentional binding). Intentional binding was assessed through participant perceptions of time-intervals between grasp contact and a sound event. Other notable findings include improved movement efficiency (increased smoothness, reduced acceleration) during expression of higher agency and shift toward greater implicit versus explicit agency with higher control speed. Positively relating performance and agency incentivizes control adaptation of powered movement devices, such as prostheses or exoskeletons, to maximize both user engagement and functional performance. Agency-based approaches may foster user-device integration at a cognitive level and facilitate greater clinical retention of the device. Future work should identify robust and automated methods to adapt device control for increased agency. Objectives include how virtual reality (VR) may identify optimal control of real-world devices and assessing real-time agency from neurophysiological signals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Contextual Integration in Cortical and Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that neurons can represent sensory input using probability distributions and neural circuits can perform probabilistic inference. Lateral connections between neurons have been shown to have non-random connectivity and modulate responses to stimuli within the classical receptive field. Large-scale efforts mapping local cortical connectivity describe cell type specific connections from inhibitory neurons and like-to-like connectivity between excitatory neurons. To relate the observed connectivity to computations, we propose a neuronal network model that approximates Bayesian inference of the probability of different features being present at different image locations. We show that the lateral connections between excitatory neurons in a circuit implementing contextual integration in this should depend on correlations between unit activities, minus a global inhibitory drive. The model naturally suggests the need for two types of inhibitory gates (normalization, surround inhibition). First, using natural scene statistics and classical receptive fields corresponding to simple cells parameterized with data from mouse primary visual cortex, we show that the predicted connectivity qualitatively matches with that measured in mouse cortex: neurons with similar orientation tuning have stronger connectivity, and both excitatory and inhibitory connectivity have a modest spatial extent, comparable to that observed in mouse visual cortex. We incorporate lateral connections learned using this model into convolutional neural networks. Features are defined by supervised learning on the task, and the lateral connections provide an unsupervised learning of feature context in multiple layers. Since the lateral connections provide contextual information when the feedforward input is locally corrupted, we show that incorporating such lateral connections into convolutional neural networks makes them more robust to noise and leads to better performance on noisy versions of the MNIST dataset. Decomposing the predicted lateral connectivity matrices into low-rank and sparse components introduces additional cell types into these networks. We explore effects of cell-type specific perturbations on network computation. Our framework can potentially be applied to networks trained on other tasks, with the learned lateral connections aiding computations implemented by feedforward connections when the input is unreliable and demonstrate the potential usefulness of combining supervised and unsupervised learning techniques in real-world vision tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: GABAergic Input From the Basal Forebrain Promotes the Survival of Adult-Born Neurons in the Mouse Olfactory Bulb</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A unique feature of the olfactory system is the continuous generation and integration of new neurons throughout adulthood. Adult-born neuron survival and integration is dependent on activity and sensory experience, which is largely mediated by early synaptic inputs that adult-born neurons receive upon entering the olfactory bulb (OB). As in early postnatal development, the first synaptic inputs onto adult-born neurons are GABAergic. However, the specific sources of early synaptic GABA and the influence of specific inputs on adult-born neuron development are poorly understood. Here, we use retrograde and anterograde viral tracing to reveal robust GABAergic projections from the basal forebrain horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB) to the granule cell layer (GCL) and glomerular layer (GL) of the mouse OB. Whole-cell electrophysiological recordings indicate that these projections target interneurons in the GCL and GL, including adult-born granule cells (abGCs). Recordings from birth-dated abGCs reveal a developmental time course in which HDB GABAergic input onto abGCs emerges as the neurons first enter the OB, and strengthens throughout the critical period of abGC development. Finally, we show that removing GABAergic signaling from HDB neurons results in decreased abGC survival. Together these data show that GABAergic projections from the HDB synapse onto immature abGCs in the OB to promote their survival through the critical period, thus representing a source of long-range input modulating plasticity in the adult OB.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Sonic Hedgehog Signaling Agonist (SAG) Triggers BDNF Secretion and Promotes the Maturation of GABAergic Networks in the Postnatal Rat Hippocampus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling plays critical roles during early central nervous system development, such as neural cell proliferation, patterning of the neural tube and neuronal differentiation. While Shh signaling is still present in the postnatal brain, the roles it may play are, however, largely unknown. In particular, Shh signaling components are found at the synaptic junction in the maturing hippocampus during the first two postnatal weeks. This period is characterized by the presence of ongoing spontaneous synaptic activity at the cellular and network levels thought to play important roles in the onset of neuronal circuit formation and synaptic plasticity. Here, we demonstrate that non-canonical Shh signaling increases the frequency of the synchronized electrical activity called Giant Depolarizing Potentials (GDP) and enhances spontaneous GABA post-synaptic currents in the rodent hippocampus during the early postnatal period. This effect is mediated specifically through the Shh co-receptor Smoothened via intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signal and the activation of the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway. Given the importance of these spontaneous events on neuronal network maturation and refinement, this study opens new perspectives for Shh signaling on the control of early stages of postnatal brain maturation and physiology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Exercise Attenuates Brain Aging by Rescuing Down-Regulated Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling in Aged Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Down-regulated Wnt signaling is involved in brain aging with declined cognitive capacity due to its modulation on neuronal function and synaptic plasticity. However, the molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In the present study, the naturally aged rat model was established by feeding rats from 6 months old to 21 months old. The cognitive capacity of aged rats was compared with young rats as the controls and the aged rats upon 12-week exercise interventions including treadmill running, resistance exercise, and alternating exercise with resistance exercise and treadmill running. Wnt signaling was examined in hippocampal tissues of the rats from different groups. Results indicated that the expression of Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) as an antagonist of Wnt signal pathway, the activation of GSK-3β, and the hyperphosphorylated Tau were markedly increased as the extension of age. Meanwhile, higher p-β-catenin&lt;sup&gt;Ser33, 37, Thr41&lt;/sup&gt; promoted neuronal degradation of aged rats. In contrast, three kinds of exercise interventions rescued the abnormal expression of DKK-1 and synaptophysin such as PSD-93 and PSD-95 in hippocampal tissues of the aged rats; especially 12-week treadmill running suppressed DKK-1 up-regulation, GSK-3β activation, β-catenin phosphorylation, and hyperphosphorylated Tau. In addition, the down-regulated PI3K/AKT and Wnt signal pathways were observed in aged rats, but could be reversed by resistance exercise and treadmill running. Moreover, the increased Bax and reduced Bcl-2 levels in hippocampal tissues of aged rats were also reversed upon treadmill running intervention. Taken together, down-regulated Wnt signaling suppressed PI3K/Akt signal pathway, aggravated synaptotoxicity, induced neuron apoptosis, and accelerated cognitive impairment of aged rats. However, exercise interventions, especially treadmill running, can attenuate their brain aging process via restoring Wnt signaling and corresponding targets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Serotonin signaling by maternal neurons upon stress ensures progeny survival</title>

	<description>Germ cells are vulnerable to stress. Therefore, how organisms protect their future progeny from damage in a fluctuating environment is a fundamental question in biology. We show that in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, serotonin released by maternal neurons during stress ensures the viability and stress resilience of future offspring. Serotonin acts through a signal transduction pathway conserved between &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; and mammalian cells to enable the transcription factor HSF1 to alter chromatin in soon-to-be fertilized germ cells by recruiting the histone chaperone FACT, displacing histones, and initiating protective gene expression. Without serotonin release by maternal neurons, FACT is not recruited by HSF1 in germ cells, transcription occurs but is delayed, and progeny of stressed &lt;i&gt;C. elegans &lt;/i&gt;mothers fail to complete development. These studies uncover a novel mechanism by which stress sensing by neurons is coupled to transcription response times of germ cells to protect future offspring.</description>

	<description>The basal ganglia have been implicated in action selection and timing, but the relative contributions of the striatonigral (direct) and striatopallidal (indirect) pathways to these functions remain unclear. We investigated the effects of optogenetic stimulation of D1+ (direct) and A2A+ (indirect) neurons in the ventrolateral striatum in head-fixed mice on a fixed time reinforcement schedule. Direct pathway stimulation initiates licking, whereas indirect pathway stimulation suppresses licking and results in rebound licking after stimulation. Moreover, direct and indirect pathways also play distinct roles in timing. Direct pathway stimulation produced a resetting of the internal timing process, whereas indirect pathway stimulation transiently paused timing, and proportionally delayed the next bout of licking. Our results provide evidence for the continuous and opposing contributions of the direct and indirect pathways in the production and timing of reward-guided behavior.</description>

	<title>eLife: R-spondin signalling is essential for the maintenance and differentiation of mouse nephron progenitors</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53895</link>
	<description>During kidney development, WNT/b-catenin signalling has to be tightly controlled to ensure proliferation and differentiation of nephron progenitor cells. Here we show in mice that the signalling molecules RSPO1 and RSPO3 act in a functionally redundant manner to permit WNT/b-catenin signalling and their genetic deletion leads to a rapid decline of nephron progenitors. By contrast, tissue specific deletion in cap mesenchymal cells abolishes mesenchyme to epithelial transition (MET) that is linked to a loss of &lt;i&gt;Bmp7&lt;/i&gt; expression, absence of SMAD1/5 phosphorylation and a concomitant failure to activate &lt;i&gt;Lef1, Fgf8&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wnt4, &lt;/i&gt;thus explaining the observed phenotype on a molecular level. Surprisingly, the full knockout of LGR4/5/6, the cognate receptors of R-spondins, only mildly affects progenitor numbers, but does not interfere with MET. Taken together our data demonstrate key roles for R-spondins in permitting stem cell maintenance and differentiation and reveal &lt;i&gt;Lgr&lt;/i&gt;-dependent and independent functions for these ligands during kidney formation.</description>

	<title>eLife: High-fat diet enhances starvation-induced hyperactivity via sensitizing hunger-sensing neurons in Drosophila</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.53103</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53103</link>
	<description>The function of the central nervous system to regulate food intake can be disrupted by sustained metabolic challenges such as high-fat diet (HFD), which may contribute to various metabolic disorders. Previously, we showed that a group of octopaminergic (OA) neurons mediated starvation-induced hyperactivity, an important aspect of food-seeking behavior (Yu et al., 2016). Here we find that HFD specifically enhances this behavior. Mechanistically, HFD increases the excitability of these OA neurons to a hunger hormone named adipokinetic hormone (AKH), via increasing the accumulation of AKH receptor (AKHR) in these neurons. Upon HFD, excess dietary lipids are transported by a lipoprotein LTP to enter these OA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;AKHR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons via the cognate receptor LpR1, which in turn suppresses autophagy-dependent degradation of AKHR. Taken together, we uncover a mechanism that links HFD, neuronal autophagy, and starvation-induced hyperactivity, providing insight in the reshaping of neural circuitry under metabolic challenges and the progression of metabolic diseases.</description>

	<description>Understanding why identical stimuli give differing neuronal responses and percepts is a central challenge in research on attention and consciousness. Ongoing oscillations reflect functional states that bias processing of incoming signals through amplitude and phase. It is not known, however, whether the effect of phase or amplitude on stimulus processing depends on the long-term global dynamics of the networks generating the oscillations. Here, we show, using a computational model, that the ability of networks to regulate stimulus response based on pre-stimulus activity requires near-critical dynamics—a dynamical state that emerges from networks with balanced excitation and inhibition, and that is characterized by scale-free fluctuations. We also find that networks exhibiting critical oscillations produce differing responses to the largest range of stimulus intensities. Thus, the brain may bring its dynamics close to the critical state whenever such network versatility is required.</description>

	<description>Neuroligins (Nlgns) are adhesion proteins mediating trans-synaptic contacts in neurons. However, conflicting results around their role in synaptic differentiation arise from the various techniques used to manipulate Nlgn expression level. Orthogonally to these approaches, we triggered here the phosphorylation of endogenous Nlgn1 in CA1 mouse hippocampal neurons using a photoactivatable tyrosine kinase receptor (optoFGFR1). Light stimulation for 24 hr selectively increased dendritic spine density and AMPA-receptor-mediated EPSCs in wild-type neurons, but not in Nlgn1 knock-out neurons or when endogenous Nlgn1 was replaced by a non-phosphorylatable mutant (Y782F). Moreover, light stimulation of optoFGFR1 partially occluded LTP in a Nlgn1-dependent manner. Combined with computer simulations, our data support a model by which Nlgn1 tyrosine phosphorylation promotes the assembly of an excitatory post-synaptic scaffold that captures surface AMPA receptors. This optogenetic strategy highlights the impact of Nlgn1 intracellular signaling in synaptic differentiation and potentiation, while enabling an acute control of these mechanisms.</description>

	<description>Studies on evoked responses in Parkinson's disease (PD) may be useful for elucidating the etiology and quantitative evaluation of PD. However, in previous studies, the association between evoked responses and detailed motor symptoms or cognitive functions has not been clear. This study investigated the characteristics of the visual (VEF), auditory (AEF), and somatosensory (SEF) evoked magnetic fields in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and the correlations between evoked fields and the patient's clinical characteristics, motor symptoms, and cognitive functions. Twenty patients with PD and 10 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited as participants. We recorded VEF, AEF, and SEF, collected clinical characteristics, performed physical examinations, and administered 10 cognitive tests. We investigated differences in the latencies of the evoked fields between patients with PD and HCs. We also evaluated the correlation of the latencies with motor symptoms and cognitive functioning. There were significant differences between the two groups in 6 of the cognitive tests, all of which suggested mild cognitive impairment in patients with PD. The latencies of the VEF N75m, P100m, N145m, AEF P50m, P100m, and SEF P60m components were greater in the patients with PD than in the HCs. The latencies mainly correlated with medication and motor symptoms, less so with cognitive tests, with some elements of the correlations remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. In conclusion, the latencies of the VEF, AEF, and SEF were greater in PD patients than in HCs and were mainly correlated with medication and motor symptoms rather than cognitive functioning. Findings from this study suggest that evoked fields may reflect basal ganglia functioning and are candidates for assessing motor symptoms or the therapeutic effects of medication in patients with PD.</description>

	<description>T he visual system is highly sensitive to spatial context for encod ing luminance patterns. Context sensitivity inspired the proposal of many neural mechanisms for explaining t he perception of luminance (brightness) . Here we propose a novel computational model for e stimating the brightness of many visual illusions. W e hypothesize that many aspects of brightness can be explained by a predictive coding mechanism which reduces the redundan cy in edge representations on the one hand, while non-redundant activity is enhanced on the other (response equalization). Response equalization is implemented with a dynamic filtering process , which (dynamically) adapts to each input image. Dynamic filtering is applied to the responses of complex cells in order to build a gain control map. The gain control map then acts on simple cell responses before they are used to create a brightness map via activity propagation. Our approach is s uccessful in predicting many challenging visual illusions, including contrast effect s , assimilation, and reverse contrast.</description>

	<description>Co-registration of electroencephalography (EEG) and eye movements is becoming increasingly popular, as technology advances. This new method has several advantages, including the possibility of testing non-verbal populations and infants. However, eye movements can create artefacts in EEG data. Previous methods to remove eye-movement artefacts, have used high-pass filters before data processing. However, the role of filter settings for eye-artefact exclusion has not directly been investigated. The current study examined the effect of filter settings on EEG recorded in a dataset containing task-relevant eye movements. Part 1 models the effects of filters on eye-movement artifacts and part 2 demonstrates this effect on an EEG dataset containing task-relevant eye-movements. It shows that high-pass filters can lead to significant distortions and create artificial responses that are unrelated to the target. In conclusion, high-pass filter settings of 0.1 or lower can be recommended for EEG studies involving task-relevant eye movements.</description>

Author summary &lt;p&gt;Recent work has indicated that anthropogenic pollution of floral-scent may have negative impacts on bumblebee foraging behavior. We need quantitative tools to both measure how much pollution of a learned floral-odor bumblebees can tolerate and identify which scent-pollutants are problematic. This study used encoding characteristics of insect olfactory systems to develop a new paradigm for quantifying complex odors. This ‘Compounds Without Borders’ method builds multidimensional vectors of scents based on physiologically relevant physical characteristics of component odorant-compounds. The angular distance between CWB-vectors then provides a single quantitative variable describing how similar (or dissimilar) two complex odors are. This angular representation of odor similarity is predictive of bumblebees’ behavior in an associative odor learning task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ctFPWr22uUU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Mosquitoes are important vectors for pathogens that infect humans and other vertebrate animals. Some aspects of adult mosquito behavior and mosquito ecology play an important role in determining the capacity of vector populations to transmit pathogens. Here, we re-examine factors affecting the transmission of pathogens by mosquitoes using a new approach. Unlike most previous models, this framework considers the behavioral states and state transitions of adult mosquitoes through a sequence of activity bouts. We developed a new framework for individual-based simulation models called MBITES (Mosquito Bout-based and Individual-based Transmission Ecology Simulator). In MBITES, it is possible to build models that simulate the behavior and ecology of adult mosquitoes in exquisite detail on complex resource landscapes generated by spatial point processes. We also developed an ordinary differential equation model which is the Kolmogorov forward equations for models developed in MBITES under a specific set of simplifying assumptions. While mosquito infection and pathogen development are one possible part of a mosquito’s state, that is not our main focus. Using extensive simulation using some models developed in MBITES, we show that vectorial capacity can be understood as an emergent property of simple behavioral algorithms interacting with complex resource landscapes, and that relative density or sparsity of resources and the need to search can have profound consequences for mosquito populations’ capacity to transmit pathogens.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4RoPuWiOonc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Transient appearance of Ca2+‐permeable AMPA receptors is crucial for the production of repetitive LTP‐induced synaptic enhancement (RISE) in cultured hippocampal slices</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23206?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have previously shown that repetitive induction of long‐term potentiation (LTP) by glutamate (100 μM, 3 min, three times at 24‐hr intervals) provoked long‐lasting synaptic enhancement accompanied by synaptogenesis in rat hippocampal slice cultures, a phenomenon termed RISE (repetitive LTP‐induced synaptic enhancement). Here, we examined the role of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;‐permeable (CP) AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in the establishment of RISE. We first found a component sensitive to the Joro‐spider toxin (JSTX), a blocker of CP‐AMPARs, in a field EPSP recorded from CA3‐CA1 synapses at 2–3 days after stimulation, but this component was not found for 9–10 days. We also observed that rectification of AMPAR‐mediated current appeared only 2–3 days after stimulation, using a whole‐cell patch clamp recording from CA1 pyramidal neurons. These findings indicate that CP‐AMPAR is transiently expressed in the developing phase of RISE. The blockade of CP‐AMPARs by JSTX for 24 hr at this developing phase inhibited RISE establishment, accompanied by the loss of small synapses at the ultrastructural level. These results suggest that transiently induced CP‐AMPARs play a critical role in synaptogenesis in the developing phase of long‐lasting hippocampal synaptic plasticity, RISE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precuneus (PreC; Brodmann area 7), a key hub within the default mode network (DMN) displays amyloid and tau‐containing neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology during the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PreC layer III projection neurons contain lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D (CatD), 14)a marker of neurons vulnerable to NFT pathology. Here we applied single population laser capture microdissection coupled with custom‐designed microarray profiling to determine the genetic signature of PreC CatD‐positive‐layer III neurons accrued from postmortem tissue obtained from the Rush Religious Orders Study (RROS) cases with a premortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Expression profiling revealed significant differential expression of key transcripts in MCI and AD compared to NCI that underlie signaling defects, including dysregulation of genes within the endosomal‐lysosomal and autophagy pathways, cytoskeletal elements, AD‐related genes, ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, cholinergic enzyme and receptors, markers of monoamine neurotransmission as well as steroid‐related transcripts. Pervasive defects in both MCI and AD were found in select transcripts within these key gene ontology categories, underscoring the vulnerability of these corticocortical neurons during the onset and progression of dementia. Select PreC dysregulated genes detected via custom‐designed microarray analysis were validated using qPCR. In summary, expression profiling of CatD positive PreC layer III neurons revealed significant dysregulation of a mosaic of genes in MCI and AD that were not previously appreciated in terms of their indication of systems‐wide signaling defects in a key hub of the DMN.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Altered synaptic function is thought to play a role in many neurodegenerative diseases, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms for synaptic dysfunction. The squid giant synapse (SGS) is a classical model for studying synaptic electrophysiology and ultrastructure, as well as molecular mechanisms of neurotransmission. Here, we conduct a multidisciplinary study of synaptic actions of misfolded human G85R-SOD1 causing familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). G85R-SOD1, but not WT-SOD1, inhibited synaptic transmission, altered presynaptic ultrastructure, and reduced both the size of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles and mobility from the reserved pool (RP) to the RRP. Unexpectedly, intermittent high-frequency stimulation (iHFS) blocked inhibitory effects of G85R-SOD1 on synaptic transmission, suggesting aberrant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling may underlie G85R-SOD1 toxicity. Ratiometric Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging showed significantly increased presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; induced by G85R-SOD1 that preceded synaptic dysfunction. Chelating Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; using EGTA prevented synaptic inhibition by G85R-SOD1, confirming the role of aberrant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in mediating G85R-SOD1 toxicity. These results extended earlier findings in mammalian motor neurons and advanced our understanding by providing possible molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets for synaptic dysfunctions in ALS as well as a unique model for further studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: The Impact of Steroid Activation of TRPM3 on Spontaneous Activity in the Developing Retina</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In the central nervous system, melastatin transient receptor potential (TRPM) channels function as receptors for the neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate (PregS). The expression and function of TRPM3 has been explored in adult retina, although its role during development is unknown. We found, during the second postnatal week in mice, TRPM3 immunofluorescence labeled distinct subsets of inner retinal neurons, including a subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), similar to what has been reported in the adult. Labeling for a TRPM3 promoter-driven reporter confirmed expression of the TRPM3 gene in RGCs and revealed additional expression in nearly all Müller glial cells. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we show that PregS and the synthetic TRPM3 agonist CIM0216 (CIM) induced prolonged calcium transients in RGCs, which were mostly absent in TRPM3 knock-out (KO) mice. These prolonged calcium transients were not associated with strong membrane depolarizations but induced c-Fos expression. To elucidate the impact of PregS-activation of TRPM3 on retinal circuits we took two sets of physiological measurements. First, PregS induced a robust increase in the frequency but not amplitude of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (PSCs). This increase was absent in the TRPM3 KO mice. Second, PregS induced a small increase in cell participation and duration of retinal waves, but this modulation persisted in TRPM3 KO mice, indicating PregS was acting on wave generating circuits independent of TRPM3 channels. Though baseline frequency of retinal waves was slightly reduced in the TRPM3 KO mice, other properties of waves were indistinguishable from wildtype. Together, these results indicate that the presence of neurosteroids impact spontaneous synaptic activity and retinal waves during development via both TRPM3-dependent and independent mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dysregulation of the retromer complex system in Down syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25752?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25752?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Down syndrome (DS) patients develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology by age 40. Although this increased susceptibility to AD in DS is thought to be primarily due to triplication of the amyloid precursor protein located on chromosome 21, the precise molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Recent evidence has implicated defective protein sorting and trafficking secondary to deficiencies in retromer complex proteins in AD pathogenesis. Thus, the objective of the present study is to assess the retromer complex system in DS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human post‐mortem brain tissue and fibroblasts from subjects with DS and healthy controls were examined for the various retromer protein components using western blot analysis and RT‐qPCR.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retromer recognition core proteins were significantly decreased in DS fibroblasts, and in both the hippocampi and cortices of young (age 15‐40 years old) and aged (40‐65 years old) DS subjects compared to controls. Correlation analyses showed a significant inverse relationship between recognition core proteins and levels of soluble forms of Aβ 1‐40 and 1‐42 in both hippocampus (n=33, Spearman=‐0.59 to ‐0.38, p≤0.03 for VPS35, VPS26, VPS29, and VPS26B) and cortex tissue (n=57, Spearman=‐0.46 to ‐0.27, p≤0.04 for VPS35, VPS26, and VPS29) of the same patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that dysregulation of the retromer complex system is an early event in the development of the AD‐like pathology and cognitive decline in DS, and for this reason the system could represent a novel potential therapeutic target for DS.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Extra‐Axial Inflammatory Signal in Parameninges in Migraine with Visual Aura</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25731?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25731?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortical spreading depression (CSD) underlies the neurobiology of migraine with aura (MWA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal studies reveal networks of microvessels linking brain–meninges–bone marrow. CSD activates the trigeminovascular system, evoking a meningeal inflammatory response. Accordingly, this study examines the upregulation of an inflammatory marker in extra‐axial tissues in migraine with visual aura.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used simultaneously acquired &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C‐PBR28 positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging data of 18kDa translocator protein (an inflammatory marker) in MWA patients (n = 11) who experienced headaches and visual aura in the preceding month. We measured mean tracer uptake (standardized uptake value ratio [SUVR]) in 4 regions of interest comprising the meninges plus the adjacent overlying skull bone (parameningeal tissues [PMT]). These data were compared to healthy controls and patients with pain (chronic low back pain).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MWA had significantly higher mean SUVR in PMT overlying occipital cortex than both other groups, although not in the PMT overlying 3 other cortical areas. A positive correlation was also found between the number of visual auras and tracer uptake in occipital PMT.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong persistent extra‐axial inflammatory signal was found in meninges and calvarial bone overlying the occipital lobe in migraine with visual auras. Our findings are reminiscent of CSD‐induced meningeal inflammation and provide the first imaging evidence implicating inflammation in the pathophysiology of migraine meningeal symptoms. We suspect that this inflammatory focus results from a signal that migrates from underlying brain and if so, may implicate newly discovered bridging vessels that crosstalk between brain and skull marrow, a finding of potential relevance to migraine and other neuroinflammatory brain disorders.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Activatable Fluorescence Imaging of Macrophages in Cerebral Aneurysms Using Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Conjugated With Indocyanine Green</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00370</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00370</link>
	<description>Background and Purpose&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation is involved in the formation and enlargement of cerebral aneurysms (CAs), with macrophages playing a key role in the process. The present study evaluated visualization of macrophages present in CAs using an activatable fluorescent probe (IONP-ICG) comprising an iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) conjugated with indocyanine green (ICG).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;IONP-ICG was intravenously administered to 15-week-old CA model rats (n = 8), and ex vivo near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging and histological assessment of exposed CAs and cerebral arteries were performed 48 h later. Similar evaluations were performed in the control group, which included CA model rats given IONPs or ICG (n = 8 each).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;ICG-derived NIRF signals were detected in three IONP-ICG group rats but not in IONP or ICG control groups. Among the three rats that exhibited signals, NIRF signal accumulation was observed in the CA of two rats and at the site of hemodynamic stress in the left posterior cerebral artery in one rat. Histologically, NIRF signals correlated strongly with macrophage localization. A total of 13 CAs formed in the IONP-ICG group. The number of macrophages in the CA wall was significantly greater in the two CAs that exhibited NIRF signals compared to the remaining 11 CAs that did not (P = 0.037). Moreover, all 11 CAs that did not exhibit NIRF signals were iron-negative, while the two CAs that exhibited NIRF signals were both iron-positive (P = 0.013).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;NIRF imaging using an activatable IONP-ICG probe is feasible for detecting the macrophage-rich regions in CAs and the cerebral artery wall, which is considered an early lesion in the process of CA formation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Spillover Effect of Autonomy Frustration on Human Motivation and Its Electrophysiological Representation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00134</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00134</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is a commonplace that some people may adopt a controlling style, which brings about autonomy frustration to others. Existing studies on autonomy frustration mainly examined its effect in the primary thwarting context, ignoring its potential spillover to subsequent activities. In this study, we examined whether prior autonomy frustration would have a sustaining negative impact on one’s motivation in another autonomy-supportive activity that follows. In this electrophysiological study, participants worked on two irrelevant tasks organized by two different experimenters. We adopted a between-group design and manipulated participants’ autonomy frustration by providing varied audio instructions during Session 1. In Session 2, all participants were instructed to complete a moderately difficult task that is autonomy-supportive instead, and we observed a less pronounced reward positivity (RewP) difference wave and a smaller P300 in the autonomy-frustration group compared with the control group. These findings suggested that the negative influence of autonomy frustration is longstanding and that it can undermine one’s motivation and attention in a following activity that is autonomy-supportive itself. Thus, our findings provided original neutral evidence for the adverse intertemporal effect of autonomy frustration, and suggested important practical implications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Topological View of Flows Inside the BOLD Spontaneous Activity of the Human Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00034</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spatio-temporal brain activities with variable delay detectable in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) give rise to highly reproducible structures, termed cortical lag threads, that propagate from one brain region to another. Using a computational topology of data approach, we found that persistent, recurring blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals in triangulated rs-fMRI videoframes display previously undetected topological findings, i.e., vortex structures that cover brain activated regions. Measure of persistence of vortex shapes in BOLD signal propagation is carried out in terms of Betti numbers that rise and fall over time during spontaneous activity of the brain. Importantly, a topology of data given in terms of geometric shapes of BOLD signal propagation offers a practical approach in coping with and sidestepping massive noise in neurodata, such as unwanted dark (low intensity) regions in the neighborhood of non-zero BOLD signals. Our findings have been codified and visualized in plots able to track the non-trivial BOLD signals that appear intermittently in a sequence of rs-fMRI videoframes. The end result of this tracking of changing lag structures is a so-called persistent barcode, which is a pictograph that offers a convenient visual means of exhibiting, comparing, and classifying brain activation patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: An Investigation of the Free Energy Principle for Emotion Recognition</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00030</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00030</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper offers a prospectus of what might be achievable in the development of emotional recognition devices. It provides a conceptual overview of the free energy principle; including Markov blankets, active inference, and—in particular—a discussion of selfhood and theory of mind, followed by a brief explanation of how these concepts can explain both neural and cultural models of emotional inference. The underlying hypothesis is that emotion recognition and inference devices will evolve from state-of-the-art deep learning models into active inference schemes that go beyond marketing applications and become adjunct to psychiatric practice. Specifically, this paper proposes that a second wave of emotion recognition devices will be equipped with an emotional lexicon (or the ability to epistemically search for one), allowing the device to resolve uncertainty about emotional states by actively eliciting responses from the user and learning from these responses. Following this, a third wave of emotional devices will converge upon the user's generative model, resulting in the machine and human engaging in a reciprocal, prosocial emotional interaction, i.e., sharing a generative model of emotional states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Subthalamic Nucleus (STh) is an oval-shaped diencephalic structure located ventrally to the thalamus, playing a fundamental role in the circuitry of the basal ganglia. In addition to being involved in the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington’s and Parkinson’s disease, the STh is one of the target nuclei for deep brain stimulation. However, most of the anatomical evidence available derives from non-human primate studies. In this review, we will present the topographical and morphological organization of the nucleus and its connections to structurally and functionally related regions of the basal ganglia circuitry. We will also highlight the importance of additional research in humans focused on validating STh connectivity, cytoarchitectural organization, and its functional subdivision.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Nodal and Planar Cell Polarity signaling cooperate to regulate zebrafish convergence and extension gastrulation movements</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.54445</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54445</link>
	<description>During vertebrate gastrulation, convergence &amp;amp; extension (C&amp;amp;E) of the primary anteroposterior (AP) embryonic axis is driven by polarized mediolateral (ML) cell intercalations and is influenced by AP axial patterning. Nodal signaling is essential for patterning of the AP axis while Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling polarizes cells with respect to this axis, but how these two signaling systems interact during C&amp;amp;E is unclear. We find that the neuroectoderm of Nodal-deficient zebrafish gastrulae exhibits reduced C&amp;amp;E cell behaviors, which require Nodal signaling in both cell- and non-autonomous fashions. PCP signaling is partially active in Nodal-deficient embryos and its inhibition exacerbates their C&amp;amp;E defects. Within otherwise naïve zebrafish blastoderm explants, however, Nodal induces C&amp;amp;E in a largely PCP-dependent manner, arguing that Nodal acts both upstream of and in parallel with PCP during gastrulation to cooperatively regulate embryonic axis extension.</description>

	<title>eLife: Spatiotemporally precise optogenetic activation of sensory neurons in freely walking Drosophila</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.54183</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54183</link>
	<description>Previous work has characterized how walking &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; coordinate the movements of individual limbs (DeAngelis, Zavatone-Veth, and Clark, 2019). To understand the circuit basis of this coordination, one must characterize how sensory feedback from each limb affects walking behavior. However, it has remained difficult to manipulate neural activity in individual limbs of freely moving animals. Here, we demonstrate a simple method for optogenetic stimulation with body side-, body segment-, and limb-specificity that does not require real-time tracking. Instead, we activate at random, precise locations in time and space and use post hoc analysis to determine behavioral responses to specific activations. Using this method, we have characterized limb coordination and walking behavior in response to transient activation of mechanosensitive bristle neurons and sweet-sensing chemoreceptor neurons. Our findings reveal that activating these neurons has opposite effects on turning, and that activations in different limbs and body regions produce distinct behaviors.</description>

	<title>eLife: Partial loss of CFIm25 causes learning deficits and aberrant neuronal alternative polyadenylation</title>

	<description>We previously showed that &lt;i&gt;NUDT21&lt;/i&gt;-spanning copy-number variations (CNVs) are associated with intellectual disability (Gennarino et al., 2015). However, the patients’ CNVs also included other genes. To determine if reduced &lt;i&gt;NUDT21&lt;/i&gt; function alone can cause disease, we generated &lt;i&gt;Nudt21&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice to mimic &lt;i&gt;NUDT21&lt;/i&gt;-deletion patients. We found that although these mice have 50% reduced &lt;i&gt;Nudt21&lt;/i&gt; mRNA, they only have 30% less of its cognate protein, CFIm25. Despite this partial protein-level compensation, the &lt;i&gt;Nudt21&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice have learning deficits, cortical hyperexcitability, and misregulated alternative polyadenylation (APA) in their hippocampi. Further, to determine the mediators driving neural dysfunction in humans, we partially inhibited &lt;i&gt;NUDT21&lt;/i&gt; in human stem cell-derived neurons to reduce CFIm25 by 30%. This induced APA and protein level misregulation in hundreds of genes, a number of which cause intellectual disability when mutated. Altogether, these results show that disruption of &lt;i&gt;NUDT21&lt;/i&gt;-regulated APA events in the brain can cause intellectual disability.</description>

	<description>Emerging evidence indicates that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can cause neurological complications. We provide a brief overview of these recent observations and discuss some of their possible implications. In particular, given the global dimension of the current pandemic, we highlight the need to consider the possible long-term impact of COVID-19, potentially including neurological and neurodegenerative disorders.</description>

	<description>Homeostatic plasticity rules are well described for glutamatergic synapses but less clear for GABAergic synapses. In this issue of Neuron, Pan-Vazquez et al. (2020) leverage the precise targeting of chandelier-to-pyramidal cell connectivity to understand how homeostatic plasticity regulates GABAergic synapses, showing that these synapses maintain homeostatic rules even as they flip from exciting to inhibiting pyramidal cells.</description>

The growth of the malaria parasite &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; in human blood causes all the symptoms of malaria. To proliferate, non-motile parasites must have access to susceptible red blood cells, which they invade using pairs of parasite ligands and host receptors that define invasion pathways. Parasites can switch invasion pathways, and while this flexibility is thought to facilitate immune evasion, it may also reflect the heterogeneity of red blood cell surfaces within and between hosts. Host genetic background affects red blood cell structure, for example, and red blood cells also undergo dramatic changes in morphology and receptor density as they age. The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; consequences of both the accessibility of susceptible cells, and their heterogeneous susceptibility, remain unclear. Here, we measured invasion of laboratory strains of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; relying on distinct invasion pathways into red blood cells of different ages. We estimated invasion efficiency while accounting for red blood cell accessibility to parasites. This approach revealed different tradeoffs made by parasite strains between the fraction of cells they can invade and their invasion rate into them, and we distinguish “specialist” strains from “generalist” strains in this context. We developed a mathematical model to show that generalist strains would lead to higher peak parasitemias &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; compared to specialist strains with similar overall proliferation rates. Thus, the ecology of red blood cells may play a key role in determining the rate of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; parasite proliferation and malaria virulence.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EkcZZAKB4Vg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Structural and molecular insight into the pH-induced low-permeability of the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.2 through dewetting of the water cavity</title>

Understanding the gating mechanism of ion channel proteins is key to understanding the regulation of cell signaling through these channels. Channel opening and closing are regulated by diverse environmental factors that include temperature, electrical voltage across the channel, and proton concentration. Low permeability in voltage-gated potassium ion channels (Kv) is intimately correlated with the prolonged action potential duration observed in many acidosis diseases. The Kv channels consist of voltage-sensing domains (S1–S4 helices) and central pore domains (S5–S6 helices) that include a selectivity filter and water-filled cavity. The voltage-sensing domain is responsible for the voltage-gating of Kv channels. While the low permeability of Kv channels to potassium ion is highly correlated with the cellular proton concentration, it is unclear how an intracellular acidic condition drives their closure, which may indicate an additional pH-dependent gating mechanism of the Kv family. Here, we show that two residues E327 and H418 in the proximity of the water cavity of Kv1.2 play crucial roles as a pH switch. In addition, we present a structural and molecular concept of the pH-dependent gating of Kv1.2 in atomic detail, showing that the protonation of E327 and H418 disrupts the electrostatic balance around the S6 helices, which leads to a straightening transition in the shape of their axes and causes dewetting of the water-filled cavity and closure of the channel. Our work offers a conceptual advancement to the regulation of the pH-dependent gating of various voltage-gated ion channels and their related biological functions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5aEdI3jnfI8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: A salt-induced kinase is required for the metabolic regulation of sleep</title>

Many lines of evidence point to links between sleep regulation and energy homeostasis, but mechanisms underlying these connections are unknown. During &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; sleep, energetic stores are allocated to nonneural tasks with a resultant drop in the overall fat stores and energy charge. Mutants lacking KIN-29, the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; homolog of a mammalian Salt-Inducible Kinase (SIK) that signals sleep pressure, have low ATP levels despite high-fat stores, indicating a defective response to cellular energy deficits. Liberating energy stores corrects adiposity and sleep defects of &lt;i&gt;kin-29&lt;/i&gt; mutants. &lt;i&gt;kin-29&lt;/i&gt; sleep and energy homeostasis roles map to a set of sensory neurons that act upstream of fat regulation as well as of central sleep-controlling neurons, suggesting hierarchical somatic/neural interactions regulating sleep and energy homeostasis. Genetic interaction between &lt;i&gt;kin-29&lt;/i&gt; and the histone deacetylase &lt;i&gt;hda-4&lt;/i&gt; coupled with subcellular localization studies indicate that KIN-29 acts in the nucleus to regulate sleep. We propose that KIN-29/SIK acts in nuclei of sensory neuroendocrine cells to transduce low cellular energy charge into the mobilization of energy stores, which in turn promotes sleep.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/WJY3KcJFlug&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neuroanatomical and neurophysiological mechanisms of acoustic and weakly electric signaling in synodontid catfish&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9cc6877d-1c48-4db9-9de6-30d4d5c2431f/cne24920-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synodontid catfishes use an Elastic Spring Apparatus, including protractor muscles, to produce electric discharges or sounds. Anatomical characterization, together with motoneuron patch‐clamp recordings and protractor muscle EMGs suggest that adaptive changes in peripheral and central characters underlie the transition from an ancestral sound to a derived electric discharge producing system.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To what extent do modifications in the nervous system and peripheral effectors contribute to novel behaviors? Using a combination of morphometric analysis, neuroanatomical tract‐tracing, and intracellular neuronal recording, we address this question in a sound‐producing and a weakly electric species of synodontid catfish, &lt;i&gt;Synodontis grandiops&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Synodontis nigriventris&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. The same peripheral mechanism, a bilateral pair of protractor muscles associated with vertebral processes (elastic spring mechanism), is involved in both signaling systems. Although there were dramatic species differences in several morphometric measures, electromyograms provided strong evidence that simultaneous activation of paired protractor muscles accounts for an individual sound and electric discharge pulse. While the general architecture of the neural network and the intrinsic properties of the motoneuron population driving each target was largely similar, differences could contribute to species‐specific patterns in electromyograms and the associated pulse repetition rate of sounds and electric discharges. Together, the results suggest that adaptive changes in both peripheral and central characters underlie the transition from an ancestral sound to a derived electric discharge producing system, and thus the evolution of a novel communication channel among synodontid catfish. Similarities with characters in other sonic and weakly electric teleost fish provide a striking example of convergent evolution in functional adaptations underlying the evolution of the two signaling systems among distantly related taxa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Clinical and MRI Outcome Predictors in Pediatric Anti‐NMDA Receptor Encephalitis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25754?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25754?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate disease symptoms, clinical and MRI findings and to perform longitudinal volumetric MRI analyses in a European multi‐center cohort of pediatric anti‐NMDAR encephalitis (NMDARE) patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied 38 children with NMDARE (median age 12.9years, range:1‐18) and a total of 82 MRI scans for volumetric MRI analyses compared to matched healthy controls. Mixed‐effect models and brain volume z‐scores were applied to estimate longitudinal brain volume development. Ordinal logistic regression and ordinal mixed models were used to predict disease outcome and severity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial MRI scans showed abnormal findings in 15/38(39.5%) patients, mostly white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensities. Volumetric MRI analyses revealed reductions of whole brain, grey matter as well as hippocampal and basal ganglia volumes in NMDARE children. Longitudinal mixed‐effect models and z‐score transformation showed failure of age‐expected brain growth in patients. Importantly, patients with abnormal MRI findings at onset were more likely to have poor outcome (PCPC score&amp;gt;1, incidence rate ratio (IIR)[95%CI]: 3.50[1.31‐9.31], p=0.012) compared to patients with normal MRI. Ordinal logistic regression models corrected for time from onset confirmed abnormal MRI at onset OR[95%CI]: 9.90[2.51, 17.28]; p=0.009), a presentation with sensorimotor deficits (13.71[2.68, 24.73]; p=0.015), and a treatment delay &amp;gt;4 weeks (5.15[0.47, 9.82]; p=0.031) as independent predictors of poor clinical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children with NMDARE exhibit significant brain volume loss and failure of age‐expected brain growth. Abnormal MRI findings, a clinical presentation with sensorimotor deficits, and a treatment delay &amp;gt;4 weeks are associated with worse clinical outcome. These characteristics represent promising prognostic biomarkers in pediatric NMDARE.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Serial section electron microscopy (ssEM), a technique where volumes of tissue can be anatomically reconstructed by imaging consecutive tissue slices, has proven to be a powerful tool for the investigation of brain anatomy. Between the process of cutting the slices, or &quot;sections,&quot; and imaging them, however, handling 10°–10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; delicate sections remains a bottleneck in ssEM, especially for batches in the &quot;mesoscale&quot; regime, i.e., 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; sections. We present a tissue section handling device that transports and positions sections, accurately and repeatability, for automated, robotic section pick-up and placement onto an imaging substrate. The device interfaces with a conventional ultramicrotomy diamond knife, accomplishing in-line, exact-constraint trapping of sections with 100-μm repeatability. An associated mathematical model includes capillary-based and Stokes-based forces, accurately describing observed behavior and fundamentally extends the modeling of water-air interface forces. Using the device, we demonstrate and describe the limits of reliable handling of hundreds of slices onto a variety of electron and light microscopy substrates without significant defects (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8 datasets composed of 126 serial sections in an automated fashion with an average loss rate and throughput of 0.50% and 63 s/section, respectively. In total, this work represents an automated mesoscale serial sectioning system for scalable 3D-EM connectomics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Mitf Links Neuronal Activity and Long-Term Homeostatic Intrinsic Plasticity</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Neuroplasticity forms the basis for neuronal circuit complexity and differences between otherwise similar circuits. We show that the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (&lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt;) plays a central role in intrinsic plasticity of olfactory bulb (OB) projection neurons. Mitral and tufted (M/T) neurons from &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice are hyperexcitable, have a reduced A-type potassium current (I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) and exhibit reduced expression of &lt;i&gt;Kcnd3&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes a potassium voltage-gated channel subunit (Kv4.3) important for generating the I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, expression of the &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Kcnd3&lt;/i&gt; genes is activity dependent in OB projection neurons and the MITF protein activates expression from &lt;i&gt;Kcnd3&lt;/i&gt; regulatory elements. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice have changes in olfactory habituation and have increased habituation for an odorant following long-term exposure, indicating that regulation of &lt;i&gt;Kcnd3&lt;/i&gt; is pivotal for long-term olfactory adaptation. Our findings show that &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt; acts as a direct regulator of intrinsic homeostatic feedback and links neuronal activity, transcriptional changes and neuronal function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Plant auxin response factor (ARF) transcription factors are an important class of key transcriptional modulators in auxin signaling. Despite the well-studied roles of ARF transcription factors in plant growth and development, it is largely unknown whether, and how, ARF transcription factors may be involved in plant resistance to pathogens.

	<description>Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), a mosquito-borne icosahedral alphavirus found mainly in North America, causes human and equine neurotropic infections. EEEV neurovirulence is influenced by the interaction of the viral envelope protein E2 with heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans from the host’s plasma membrane during virus entry.

	<description>Microtubules (MTs) are essential components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton that serve as “highways” for intracellular trafficking. In addition to the well-known active transport of cargo by motor proteins, many MT-binding proteins seem to adopt diffusional motility as a transportation mechanism.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: ATPase Domain AFG3L2 Mutations Alter OPA1 Processing and Cause Optic Neuropathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25723?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25723?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is the most common inherited optic neuropathy, with a prevalence of 1:12,000 to 1:25,000. &lt;i&gt;OPA1&lt;/i&gt; mutations are found in 70% of DOA patients, with a significant number remaining undiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We screened 286 index cases presenting optic atrophy, negative for &lt;i&gt;OPA1&lt;/i&gt; mutations, by targeted next generation sequencing or whole exome sequencing. Pathogenicity and molecular mechanisms of the identified variants were studied in yeast and patient‐derived fibroblasts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve cases (4%) were found to carry novel variants in &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2,&lt;/i&gt; a gene that has been associated with autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia 28 (SCA28). Half of cases were familial with a dominant inheritance, whereas the others were sporadic, including &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; mutations. Biallelic mutations were found in 3 probands with severe syndromic optic neuropathy, acting as recessive or phenotype‐modifier variants. All the DOA‐associated &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2&lt;/i&gt; mutations were clustered in the ATPase domain, whereas SCA28‐associated mutations mostly affect the proteolytic domain. The pathogenic role of DOA‐associated &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2&lt;/i&gt; mutations was confirmed in yeast, unraveling a mechanism distinct from that of SCA28‐associated &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2&lt;/i&gt; mutations. Patients' fibroblasts showed abnormal OPA1 processing, with accumulation of the fission‐inducing short forms leading to mitochondrial network fragmentation, not observed in SCA28 patients' cells.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates that mutations in &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2&lt;/i&gt; are a relevant cause of optic neuropathy, broadening the spectrum of clinical manifestations and genetic mechanisms associated with &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2&lt;/i&gt; mutations, and underscores the pivotal role of OPA1 and its processing in the pathogenesis of DOA.

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Gelatinase Biosensor Reports Cellular Remodeling During Epileptogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00015</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00015</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epileptogenesis is the gradual process responsible for converting a healthy brain into an epileptic brain. This process can be triggered by a wide range of factors, including brain injury or tumors, infections, and status epilepticus. Epileptogenesis results in aberrant synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation and seizure-induced cell death. As Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a crucial role in cellular plasticity by remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM), gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) were recently highlighted as key players in epileptogenesis. In this work, we engineered a biosensor to report in situ gelatinase activity in a model of epileptogenesis. This biosensor encompasses a gelatinase-sensitive activatable cell penetrating peptide (ACPP) coupled to a TAMRA fluorophore, allowing fluorescence uptake in cells displaying endogenous gelatinase activities. In a preclinical mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the intrahippocampal kainate injection, ACPPs revealed a localized distribution of gelatinase activities, refining temporal cellular changes during epileptogenesis. The activity was found particularly but not only in the ipsilateral hippocampus, starting from the CA1 area and spreading to dentate gyrus from the early stages throughout chronic epilepsy, notably in neurons and microglial cells. Thus, our work shows that ACPPs are suitable molecular imaging probes for detecting the spatiotemporal pattern of gelatinase activity during epileptogenesis, suggesting their possible use as vectors to target cellular reactive changes with treatment for epileptogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: A Family of Laminin α2 Chain-Deficient Mouse Mutants: Advancing the Research on LAMA2-CMD</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The research on laminin α2 chain-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-CMD) advanced rapidly in the last few decades, largely due to availability of good mouse models for the disease and a strong interest in preclinical studies from scientists all over the world. These mouse models continue to provide a solid platform for understanding the LAMA2-CMD pathology. In addition, they enable researchers to test laborious, necessary routines, but also the most creative scientific approaches in order to design therapy for this devastating disorder. In this review we present animals belonging to the laminin α2 chain-deficient “dy/dy” mouse family (dy/dy, dy&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;/dy&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;, dy&lt;sup&gt;3K&lt;/sup&gt;/dy&lt;sup&gt;3K&lt;/sup&gt;, dy&lt;sup&gt;W&lt;/sup&gt;/dy&lt;sup&gt;W&lt;/sup&gt;, et al.) and a summary of the scientific progress they facilitated. We also raise a few questions that need to be addressed in order to maximize the usefulness of laminin α2 murine mutants and to further advance the LAMA2-CMD studies. We believe that research opportunities offered by the mouse models for LAMA2-CMD will continuously support our efforts to find a treatment for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Experience Creates the Multisensory Transform in the Superior Colliculus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00018</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00018</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although the ability to integrate information across the senses is compromised in some individuals for unknown reasons, similar defects have been observed when animals are reared without multisensory experience. The experience-dependent development of multisensory integration has been studied most extensively using the visual-auditory neuron of the cat superior colliculus (SC) as a neural model. In the normally-developed adult, SC neurons react to concordant visual-auditory stimuli by integrating their inputs in real-time to produce non-linearly amplified multisensory responses. However, when prevented from gathering visual-auditory experience, their multisensory responses are no more robust than their responses to the individual component stimuli. The mechanisms operating in this defective state are poorly understood. Here we examined the responses of SC neurons in “naïve” (i.e., dark-reared) and “neurotypic” (i.e., normally-reared) animals on a millisecond-by-millisecond basis to determine whether multisensory experience changes the operation by which unisensory signals are converted into multisensory outputs (the “multisensory transform”), or whether it changes the dynamics of the unisensory inputs to that transform (e.g., their synchronization and/or alignment). The results reveal that the major impact of experience was on the multisensory transform itself. Whereas neurotypic multisensory responses exhibited non-linear amplification near their onset followed by linear amplification thereafter, the naive responses showed no integration in the initial phase of the response and a computation consistent with competition in its later phases. The results suggest that multisensory experience creates an entirely new computation by which convergent unisensory inputs are used cooperatively to enhance the physiological salience of cross-modal events and thereby facilitate normal perception and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) seriously affects a patient’s quality of life, and it is urgent to find a method that can effectively alleviate the PHN of the upper extremity.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To observe the Efficacy of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) to cervical nerve root for PHN in upper extremity under CT guidance.&lt;/p&gt;Study Design&lt;p&gt;Retrospective comparative study.&lt;/p&gt;Setting&lt;p&gt;Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Fifty patients with PHN in upper extremity were enrolled in Pain Management. Patients were randomized into two groups: cervical nerve root block (A group, n = 25) and cervical nerve root PRF (B group, n = 25). At each observation time, the general characteristics, visual analog scale (VAS), quality of life scores assessment (SF-36), the total efficacy rate, dosage of antiepileptic and narcotic analgesics, and the incidence of complications were followed up.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with the preoperative, the postoperative VAS decreased, the physical component summary (PCS) and the mental component summary (MCS) increased in both groups (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The differences between group B and group A were statistically significant after 1 month, which could be maintained for 1 year (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The total efficacy rate of group A and group B was 52.0% and 80.0% at 1 Year, respectively. The total efficacy rate of group B was higher than that of group A (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The dosage of antiepileptic and narcotic analgesics in group B decreased significantly, and the decline was significant compared with group A (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The incidence of complications between the two groups were similar (P &amp;gt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;CT-guided PRF to cervical nerve root for the treatment of PHN in the upper extremity is safe and effective. PRF can replicate the location of pain, precise positioning, reduce trauma, and increased pain relief rate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Concurrent Imaging of Markers of Current Flow and Neurophysiological Changes During tDCS</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00374</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite being a popular neuromodulation technique, clinical translation of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is hampered by variable responses observed within treatment cohorts. Addressing this challenge has been difficult due to the lack of an effective means of mapping the neuromodulatory electromagnetic fields together with the brain’s response. In this study, we present a novel imaging technique that provides the capability of concurrently mapping markers of tDCS currents, as well as the brain’s response to tDCS. A dual-echo echo-planar imaging (DE-EPI) sequence is used, wherein the phase of the acquired MRI-signal encodes the tDCS current induced magnetic field, while the magnitude encodes the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast. The proposed technique was first validated in a custom designed phantom. Subsequent test–retest experiments in human participants showed that tDCS-induced magnetic fields can be detected reliably in vivo. The concurrently acquired BOLD data revealed large-scale networks characteristic of a brain in resting-state as well as a ‘cathodal’ and an ‘anodal’ resting-state component under each electrode. Moreover, ‘cathodal’s BOLD-signal was observed to significantly decrease with the applied current at the group level in all datasets. With its ability to image markers of electromagnetic cause as well as neurophysiological changes, the proposed technique may provide an effective means to visualize neural engagement in tDCS at the group level. Our technique also contributes to addressing confounding factors in applying BOLD fMRI concurrently with tDCS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Modulation on Glutamic Pathway of Frontal-Striatum-Thalamus by rs11146020 and rs3813296 Gene Polymorphism in First-Episode Negative Schizophrenia</title>

	<description>Objectives&lt;p&gt;The frontal-striatum-thalamus pathway is important in the glutamic neural circuit. The hypofunction of GRIN1 and GRIA2 subunits from glutamic receptors has been hypothesized as the primary process in the etiology of schizophrenia. Identified gene polymorphism involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia may uncover relevant mechanism pathways.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We selected two loci of rs11146020 and rs3813296 distributed in GRIN1 and GRIA2 genes and tested their main and interaction effects on causality connections and structural characteristics in the frontal-striatum-thalamus pathway in 55 Han Chinese first-episode negative schizophrenia patients.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We found that: (1) rs11146020 has a significant main effect on the causality connections between the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and rs3813296 mainly influences those of the descending pathway from the prefrontal cortex to the striatum; (2) interaction effect of rs11146020 and rs3813296 on causality connections are located in the ascending pathway from the pallidum to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; and (3) the two loci have effects on the volumes of several regions of this pathway.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our results suggested there is modulation on glutamic frontal-striatum-thalamus pathway by rs11146020 and rs3813296 gene polymorphism. Patients with different genotypes have different neuroimaging characteristics, which indirectly reminded clinicians those patients should receive different clinical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: A New Approach for Noise Suppression in Cochlear Implants: A Single-Channel Noise Reduction Algorithm1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00301</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cochlea “translates” the in-air vibrational acoustic “language” into the spikes of neural “language” that are then transmitted to the brain for auditory understanding and/or perception. During this intracochlear “translation” process, high resolution in time–frequency–intensity domains guarantees the high quality of the input neural information for the brain, which is vital for our outstanding hearing abilities. However, cochlear implants (CIs) have coarse artificial coding and interfaces, and CI users experience more challenges in common acoustic environments than their normal-hearing (NH) peers. Noise from sound sources that a listener has no interest in may be neglected by NH listeners, but they may distract a CI user. We discuss the CI noise-suppression techniques and introduce noise management for a new implant system. The monaural signal-to-noise ratio estimation-based noise suppression algorithm “eVoice,” which is incorporated in the processors of Nurotron&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Enduro&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;, was evaluated in two speech perception experiments. The results show that speech intelligibility in stationary speech-shaped noise can be significantly improved with eVoice. Similar results have been observed in other CI devices with single-channel noise reduction techniques. Specifically, the mean speech reception threshold decrease in the present study was 2.2 dB. The Nurotron society already has more than 10,000 users, and eVoice is a start for noise management in the new system. Future steps on non-stationary-noise suppression, spatial-source separation, bilateral hearing, microphone configuration, and environment specification are warranted. The existing evidence, including our research, suggests that noise-suppression techniques should be applied in CI systems. The artificial hearing of CI listeners requires more advanced signal processing techniques to reduce brain effort and increase intelligibility in noisy settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Human Cerebrospinal Fluid Induces Neuronal Excitability Changes in Resected Human Neocortical and Hippocampal Brain Slices</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00283</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human cerebrospinal fluid (hCSF) has proven advantageous over conventional medium for culturing both rodent and human brain tissue. In addition, increased activity and synchrony, closer to the dynamic states exclusively recorded in vivo, were reported in rodent slices and cell cultures switching from artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) to hCSF. This indicates that hCSF possesses properties that are not matched by the aCSF, which is generally used for most electrophysiological recordings. To evaluate the possible significance of using hCSF as an electrophysiological recording medium, also for human brain tissue, we compared the network and single-cell firing properties of human brain slice cultures during perfusion with hCSF and aCSF. For measuring the overall activity from a majority of neurons within neocortical and hippocampal human slices, we used a microelectrode array (MEA) recording technique with 252 electrodes covering an area of 3.2 × 3.2 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. A second CMOS-based MEA with 4225 sensors on a 2 × 2 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area was used for detailed mapping of action potential waveforms and cell identification. We found that hCSF increased the number of active electrodes and neurons and the firing rate of the neurons in the slices and induced an increase in the numbers of single channel and population bursts. Interestingly, not only an increase in the overall activity in the slices was observed, but a reconfiguration of the network could also be detected with specific activation and inactivation of subpopulations of neuronal ensembles. In conclusion, hCSF is an important component to consider for future human brain slice studies, especially for experiments designed to mimic parts of physiology and disease observed in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Hypothesis and Theory: A Pathophysiological Concept of Stroke-Induced Acute Phase Response and Increased Intestinal Permeability Leading to Secondary Brain Damage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00272</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00272</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gut integrity impairment leading to increased intestinal permeability (IP) is hypothesized to be a trigger of critically illness. Approximately 15–20% of human ischemic stroke (IS) victims require intensive care, including patients with impaired level of consciousness or a high risk for developing life-threatening cerebral edema. Local and systemic inflammatory reactions are a major component of the IS pathophysiology and can significantly aggravate brain tissue damage. Intracerebral inflammatory processes following IS have been well studied. Until now, less is known about systemic inflammatory responses and IS consequences apart from a frequently observed post-IS immunosuppression. Here, we provide a hypothesis of a crosstalk between systemic acute phase response (APR), IP and potential secondary brain damage during acute and subacute IS stages supported by preliminary experimental data. Alterations of the acute phase proteins (APPs) C-reactive protein and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and serum level changes of antibodies directed against Escherichia coli-cell extract antigen (IgA-, IgM-, and IgG-anti-E. coli) were investigated at 1, 2, and 7 days following IS in ten male sheep. We found an increase of both APPs as well as a decrease of all anti-E. coli antibodies within 48 h following IS. This may indicate an early systemic APR and increased IP, and underlines the importance of the increasingly recognized gut-brain axis and of intestinal antigen release for systemic immune responses in acute and subacute stroke stages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Nrf2 and Ferroptosis: A New Research Direction for Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00267</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a kind of regulated cell death (RCD) caused by the redox state disorder of intracellular microenvironment controlled by glutathione (GSH) peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which is inhibited by iron chelators and lipophilic antioxidants. In addition to classical regulatory mechanisms, new regulatory factors for ferroptosis have been discovered in recent years, such as the P53 pathway, the activating transcription factor (ATF)3/4 pathway, Beclin 1 (BECN1) pathway, and some non-coding RNA. Ferroptosis is closely related to cancer treatment, neurodegenerative diseases, ischemia–reperfusion of organ, neurotoxicity, and others, in particular, in the field of neurodegenerative diseases treatment has aroused people’s interest. The nuclear factor E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2/NFE2L2) has been proved to play a key role in neurodegenerative disease treatment and ferroptosis regulation. Ferroptosis promotes the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, while the expression of Nrf2 and its target genes (Ho-1, Nqo-1, and Trx) has been declined with aging; therefore, there is still insufficient evidence for ferroptosis and Nrf2 regulatory networks in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will provide a brief overview of ferroptosis regulatory mechanisms, as well as an emphasis on the mechanism of Nrf2 regulating ferroptosis. We also highlight the role of ferroptosis and Nrf2 during the process of neurodegenerative diseases and investigate a theoretical basis for further research on the relationship between Nrf2 and ferroptosis in the process of neurodegenerative diseases treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Disentangling the Amyloid Pathways: A Mechanistic Approach to Etiology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00256</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00256</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyloids are fibrillar protein aggregates associated with diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), type II diabetes and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. The process of amyloid polymerization involves three pathological protein transformations; from natively folded conformation to the cross-β conformation, from biophysically soluble to insoluble, and from biologically functional to non-functional. While amyloids share a similar cross-β conformation, the biophysical transformation can either take place spontaneously via a homogeneous nucleation mechanism (HON) or catalytically on an exogenous surface via a heterogeneous nucleation mechanism (HEN). Here, we postulate that the different nucleation pathways can serve as a mechanistic basis for an etiological classification of amyloidopathies, where hereditary forms generally follow the HON pathway, while sporadic forms follow seed-induced (prions) or surface-induced (including microbially induced) HEN pathways. Critically, the conformational and biophysical amyloid transformation results in loss-of-function (LOF) of the original natively folded and soluble protein. This LOF can, at least initially, be the mechanism of amyloid toxicity even before amyloid accumulation reaches toxic levels. By highlighting the important role of non-protein species in amyloid formation and LOF mechanisms of toxicity, we propose a generalized mechanistic framework that could help better understand the diverse etiology of amyloid diseases and offer new opportunities for therapeutic interventions, including replacement therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Intrastriatal Administration of Exosome-Associated Pathological Alpha-Synuclein Is Not Sufficient by Itself to Cause Pathology Transmission</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00246</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;α-Synuclein (α-syn) has been genetically and biochemically linked to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). There is accumulating evidence that misfolded α-syn species spread between cells in a prion-like manner and seed the aggregation of endogenous protein in the recipient cells. Exosomes have been proposed to mediate the transfer of misfolded α-syn and thus facilitate disease transmission, although the pathological mechanism remains elusive. Here, we investigated the seeding capacity of exosome-associated α-syn, in vivo. Disease-associated α-syn was present in exosome fractions isolated from transgenic A53T mouse brain. However, following intrastriatal injection of such exosomes in wild-type (wt) mice, we were not able to detect any accumulation of endogenous α-syn. In addition, recombinant fibrillar α-syn, when loaded to isolated brain exosomes, induced minor pathological α-syn brain accumulation at 7 months post injection. These data suggest that exosomes neutralize the effect of toxic α-syn species and raise additional questions on their paracrine modulatory role in disease transmission.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Dynamic Responses of Monetary and Social Reward Processes in Adolescents</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adolescence is an essential developmental period characterized by reward-related processes. The current study investigated the development of monetary and social reward processes in adolescents compared with that in children and adults; furthermore, it assessed whether adolescents had different levels of sensitivity to various types of rewards. Two adapted incentive delay tasks were employed for each participant, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. The behavioral results showed that both monetary and social rewards could motivate response speed, and participants were more accurate under the monetary reward condition than under the social reward condition. The behavioral performances of individuals increased with age. For the ERP data, the cue-P3, target-P2, target-P3 and feedback-related negativity (FRN) components were investigated to identify reward motivation, emotional arousal, attention allocation and feedback processing. Children and adolescents showed higher motivation (larger cue-P3) to rewards than adults. Adolescents showed larger emotional responses to rewards; that is, they had larger target-P2 amplitudes than adults and shorter target-P2 latencies than children. Children showed stronger emotional reactivity for monetary rewards than for social rewards. All age groups had stronger attentional control (larger target-P3) under the monetary reward condition than under the social reward condition. The present study sheds light on the neurodevelopment of reward processes in children, adolescents and adults and shows that various reward process stages demonstrate different age-related and reward-type-related characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Path Integration Changes as a Cognitive Marker for Vascular Cognitive Impairment?—A Pilot Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00131</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00131</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Path integration spatial navigation processes are emerging as promising cognitive markers for prodromal and clinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, such path integration changes have been less explored in Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI), despite neurovascular change being a major contributing factor to dementia and potentially AD. In particular, the sensitivity and specificity of path integration impairments in VCI compared to AD is unclear. In the current pilot study, we explore path integration performance in early-stage AD and VCI patient groups and hypothesize that: (i) medial parietal mediated egocentric processes will be more affected in VCI; and (ii) medial temporal mediated allocentric processes will be more affected in AD. This cross-sectional study included early-stage VCI patients (n = 9), AD patients (n = 10) and healthy age-matched controls (n = 20). All participants underwent extensive neuropsychological testing, as well as spatial navigation testing. The spatial navigation tests included the virtual reality “Supermarket” task assessing egocentric (body-based) and allocentric (map-based) navigation as well as the “Clock Orientation” test assessing egocentric and path integration processes. Results showed that egocentric integration processes are only impaired in VCI, potentially distinguishing it from AD. However, in contrast to our prediction, allocentric integration was not more impaired in AD compared to VCI. These preliminary findings suggest limited specificity of allocentric integration deficits between VCI and AD. By contrast, egocentric path integration deficits emerge as more specific to VCI, potentially allowing for more specific diagnostic and treatment outcome measures for vascular impairment in dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Species Classification for Neuroscience Literature Based on Span of Interest Using Sequence-to-Sequence Learning Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Large-scale neuroscience literature call for effective methods to mine the knowledge from species perspective to link the brain and neuroscience communities, neurorobotics, computing devices, and AI research communities. Structured knowledge can motivate researchers to better understand the functionality and structure of the brain and link the related resources and components. However, the abstracts of massive scientific works do not explicitly mention the species. Therefore, in addition to dictionary-based methods, we need to mine species using cognitive computing models that are more like the human reading process, and these methods can take advantage of the rich information in the literature. We also enable the model to automatically distinguish whether the mentioned species is the main research subject. Distinguishing the two situations can generate value at different levels of knowledge management. We propose SpecExplorer project which is used to explore the knowledge associations of different species for brain and neuroscience. This project frees humans from the tedious task of classifying neuroscience literature by species. Species classification task belongs to the multi-label classification which is more complex than the single-label classification due to the correlation between labels. To resolve this problem, we present the sequence-to-sequence classification framework to adaptively assign multiple species to the literature. To model the structure information of documents, we propose the hierarchical attentive decoding (HAD) to extract span of interest (SOI) for predicting each species. We create three datasets from PubMed and PMC corpora. We present two versions of annotation criteria (mention-based annotation and semantic-based annotation) for species research. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves improvements in the final results. Finally, we perform species-based analysis of brain diseases, brain cognitive functions, and proteins related to the hippocampus and provide potential research directions for certain species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Cerebral Hemodynamic Responses to the Sensory Conflict Between Visual and Rotary Vestibular Stimuli: An Analysis With a Multichannel Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) System</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory conflict among visual, vestibular, and somatosensory information induces vertiginous sensation and postural instability. To elucidate the cognitive mechanisms of the integration between the visual and vestibular cues in humans, we analyzed the cortical hemodynamic responses during sensory conflict between visual and horizontal rotatory vestibular stimulation using a multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system. The subjects sat on a rotatory chair that was accelerated at 3°/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 20 s to the right or left, kept rotating at 60°/s for 80 s, and then decelerated at 3°/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 20 s. The subjects were instructed to watch white stripes projected on a screen surrounding the chair during the acceleration and deceleration periods. The white stripes moved in two ways; in the “congruent” condition, the stripes moved in the opposite direction of chair rotation at 3°/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e., natural visual stimulation), whereas in the “incongruent” condition, the stripes moved in the same direction of chair rotation at 3°/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e., conflicted visual stimulation). The cortical hemodynamic activity was recorded from the bilateral temporoparietal regions. Statistical analyses using NIRS-SPM software indicated that hemodynamic activity increased in the bilateral temporoparietal junctions (TPJs) and human MT+ complex, including the medial temporal (MT) area and medial superior temporal (MST) area in the incongruent condition. Furthermore, the subjective strength of the vertiginous sensation was negatively correlated with hemodynamic activity in the dorsal part of the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) in and around the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). These results suggest that sensory conflict between the visual and vestibular stimuli promotes cortical cognitive processes in the cortical network consisting of the TPJ, the medial temporal gyrus (MTG), and IPS, which might contribute to self-motion perception to maintain a sense of balance or equilibrioception during sensory conflict.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Histological Confirmation of Myelinated Neural Filaments Within the Tip of the Neurotrophic Electrode After a Decade of Neural Recordings</title>

	<description>Aim&lt;p&gt;Electrodes that provide brain to machine or computer interfacing must survive the lifetime of the person to be considered an acceptable prosthetic. The electrodes may be external such as with electroencephalographic (EEG), internal extracortical such as electrocorticographic (ECoG) or intracortical.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Most intracortical electrodes are placed close to the neuropil being recorded and do not survive years of recording. However, the Neurotrophic Electrode is placed within the cortex and the neuropil grows inside and through the hollow tip of the electrode and is thus trapped inside. Highly flexible coiled lead wires minimize the strain on the electrode tip. Histological analysis includes immunohistochemical detection of neurofilaments and the absence of gliosis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;This configuration led to a decade long recording in this locked-in person. At year nine, the neural activity underwent conditioning experiments indicating that the neural activity was functional and not noise. This paper presents data on the histological analysis of the tissue inside the electrode tip after 13 years of implantation.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This paper is a singular example of histological analysis after a decade of recording. The histological analysis laid out herein is strong evidence that the brain can grow neurites into the electrode tip and record for a decade. This is profoundly important in the field of brain to machine or computer interfacing by implying that long term electrodes should incorporate some means of growing the neuropil into the electrode rather than placing the electrode into the neuropil.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Cross-Dataset Variability Problem in EEG Decoding With Deep Learning</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cross-subject variability problems hinder practical usages of Brain-Computer Interfaces. Recently, deep learning has been introduced into the BCI community due to its better generalization and feature representation abilities. However, most studies currently only have validated deep learning models for single datasets, and the generalization ability for other datasets still needs to be further verified. In this paper, we validated deep learning models for eight MI datasets and demonstrated that the cross-dataset variability problem weakened the generalization ability of models. To alleviate the impact of cross-dataset variability, we proposed an online pre-alignment strategy for aligning the EEG distributions of different subjects before training and inference processes. The results of this study show that deep learning models with online pre-alignment strategies could significantly improve the generalization ability across datasets without any additional calibration data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Intrinsic and Synaptic Properties Shaping Diverse Behaviors of Neural Dynamics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00026</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The majority of neurons in the neuronal system of the brain have a complex morphological structure, which diversifies the dynamics of neurons. In the granular layer of the cerebellum, there exists a unique cell type, the unipolar brush cell (UBC), that serves as an important relay cell for transferring information from outside mossy fibers to downstream granule cells. The distinguishing feature of the UBC is that it has a simple morphology, with only one short dendritic brush connected to its soma. Based on experimental evidence showing that UBCs exhibit a variety of dynamic behaviors, here we develop two simple models, one with a few detailed ion channels for simulation and the other one as a two-variable dynamical system for theoretical analysis, to characterize the intrinsic dynamics of UBCs. The reasonable values of the key channel parameters of the models can be determined by analysis of the stability of the resting membrane potential and the rebound firing properties of UBCs. Considered together with a large variety of synaptic dynamics installed on UBCs, we show that the simple-structured UBCs, as relay cells, can extend the range of dynamics and information from input mossy fibers to granule cells with low-frequency resonance and transfer stereotyped inputs to diverse amplitudes and phases of the output for downstream granule cells. These results suggest that neuronal computation, embedded within intrinsic ion channels and the diverse synaptic properties of single neurons without sophisticated morphology, can shape a large variety of dynamic behaviors to enhance the computational ability of local neuronal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Distinct Synchronous Network Activity During the Second Postnatal Week of Medial Entorhinal Cortex Development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00091</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) contains specialized cell types whose firing is tuned to aspects of an animal’s position and orientation in the environment, reflecting a neuronal representation of space. The spatially tuned firing properties of these cells quickly emerge during the third postnatal week of development in rodents. Spontaneous synchronized network activity (SSNA) has been shown to play a crucial role in the development of neuronal circuits prior to week 3. SSNA in MEC is well described in rodents during the first postnatal week, but there are little data about its development immediately prior to eye opening and spatial exploration. Furthermore, existing data lack single-cell resolution and are not integrated across layers. In this study, we addressed the question of whether the characteristics and underlying mechanisms of SSNA during the second postnatal week resemble that of the first week or whether distinct features emerge during this period. Using a combined calcium imaging and electrophysiology approach in vitro, we confirm that in mouse MEC during the second postnatal week, SSNA persists and in fact peaks, and is dependent on ionotropic glutamatergic signaling. However, SSNA differs from that observed during the first postnatal week in two ways: First, EC does not drive network activity in the hippocampus but only in neighboring neocortex (NeoC). Second, GABA does not drive network activity but influences it in a manner that is dependent both on age and receptor type. Therefore, we conclude that while there is a partial mechanistic overlap in SSNA between the first and second postnatal weeks, unique mechanistic features do emerge during the second week, suggestive of different or additional functions of MEC within the hippocampal-entorhinal circuitry with increasing maturation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Quantitative Imaging of Changes in Astrocytic and Neuronal Adenosine Triphosphate Using Two Different Variants of ATeam</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00080</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00080</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Genetically encoded nanosensors such as the FRET-based adenosine triphosphate (ATP) sensor ATeam enable the measurement of changes in ATP levels inside cells, promoting our understanding of metabolic interactions between astrocytes and neurons. The sensors are usually well characterized in vitro but display altered properties when expressed inside cells, precluding a meaningful conversion of changes in FRET ratios into changes in intracellular ATP concentrations ([ATP]) on the basis of their in vitro properties. Here, we present an experimental strategy for the intracellular calibration of two different variants of ATeam in organotypic tissue slice culture of the mouse brain. After cell-type-specific expression of the sensors in astrocytes or neurons, slices were first perfused with a saline containing the saponin β-escin to permeabilize plasma membranes for ATP. Next, cells were depleted of ATP by perfusion with ATP-free saline containing metabolic inhibitors. Finally, ATP was re-added at defined concentrations and resulting changes in the FRET ratio recorded. When employing this protocol, ATeam1.03 expressed in astrocytes reliably responds to changes in [ATP], exhibiting an apparent K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; of 9.4 mM. The high-affinity sensor ATeam1.03&lt;sup&gt;YEMK&lt;/sup&gt; displayed a significantly lower intracellular K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; of 2.7 mM. On the basis of these calibrations, we found that induction of a recurrent neuronal network activity resulted in an initial transient increase in astrocytic [ATP] by ~0.12 mM as detected by ATeam1.03&lt;sup&gt;YEMK&lt;/sup&gt;, a result confirmed using ATeam1.03. In neurons, in contrast, [ATP] immediately started to decline upon initiation of a network activity, amounting to a decrease by an average of 0.29 mM after 2 min. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ATeam1.03&lt;sup&gt;YEMK&lt;/sup&gt; and ATeam1.03 display a significant increase in their apparent K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; when expressed inside cells as compared with in vitro. Moreover, they show that both ATeam variants enable the quantitative detection of changes of astrocytic and neuronal [ATP] in the physiological range. ATeam1.03&lt;sup&gt;YEMK&lt;/sup&gt;, however, seems preferable because its K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; is close to baseline ATP levels. Finally, our data support the idea that synchronized neuronal activity initially stimulates the generation of ATP in astrocytes, presumably through increased glycolysis, whereas ATP levels in neurons decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Stability in the Face of Change: Lifelong Experience-Dependent Plasticity in the Sensory Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00076</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00076</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Plasticity is a fundamental property of the nervous system that enables its adaptations to the ever-changing environment. Heightened plasticity typical for developing circuits facilitates their robust experience-dependent functional maturation. This plasticity wanes during adolescence to permit the stabilization of mature brain function, but abundant evidence supports that adult circuits exhibit both transient and long-term experience-induced plasticity. Cortical plasticity has been extensively studied throughout the life span in sensory systems and the main distinction between development and adulthood arising from these studies is the concept that passive exposure to relevant information is sufficient to drive robust plasticity early in life, while higher-order attentional mechanisms are necessary to drive plastic changes in adults. Recent work in the primary visual and auditory cortices began to define the circuit mechanisms that govern these processes and enable continuous adaptation to the environment, with transient circuit disinhibition emerging as a common prerequisite for both developmental and adult plasticity. Drawing from studies in visual and auditory systems, this review article summarizes recent reports on the circuit and cellular mechanisms of experience-driven plasticity in the developing and adult brains and emphasizes the similarities and differences between them. The benefits of distinct plasticity mechanisms used at different ages are discussed in the context of sensory learning, as well as their relationship to maladaptive plasticity and neurodevelopmental brain disorders. Knowledge gaps and avenues for future work are highlighted, and these will hopefully motivate future research in these areas, particularly those about the learning of complex skills during development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Distinct Components in the Right Extended Frontal Aslant Tract Mediate Language and Working Memory Performance: A Tractography-Informed VBM Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00021</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00021</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The extended frontal aslant tract (exFAT) is a tractography-based extension of the frontal aslant tract (FAT) which has been shown to be related with language and working memory performance in healthy human adults, but whether those functional implications map to structurally separate regions along its trajectory is still an open question. We present a tractography-informed Voxel-Based Morphometry procedure capable of detecting local tract-specific structural differences in white matter regions and apply it in two maximum variation sampling studies by comparing local differences in diffusion-derived microstructural parameters and fiber density along the exFAT territory between top performers and bottom performers in language and working memory tasks. In the right hemisphere we were able to detect, without prior constraints, a vertical frontal aslant component approximating the original FAT trajectory whose fiber density was significantly correlated with language (but not working memory) performance and an anterior cluster component corresponding to a distinct anterior frontal aslant component whose fiber density was significantly correlated with working memory (but not language) performance. The reported sub-division of the exFAT territory describes a set of frontal connections that are compatible with previously reported results on the Broca’s territory and frontal cortex hierarchical organization along an anterior-posterior gradient, suggesting that the exFAT could be part of a common neuroanatomical scaffold where language and working memory functions are integrated in the healthy human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Calsequestrins New Calcium Store Markers of Adult Zebrafish Cerebellum and Optic Tectum</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00015</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Calcium stores in neurons are heterogeneous in compartmentalization and molecular composition. Danio rerio (zebrafish) is an animal model with a simply folded cerebellum similar in cellular organization to that of mammals. The aim of the study was to identify new endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium store markers in zebrafish adult brain with emphasis on cerebellum and optic tectum. By quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we found three RNA transcripts coding for the intra-ER calcium binding protein calsequestrin: casq1a, casq1b, and casq2. In brain homogenates, two isoforms were detected by mass spectrometry and western blotting. Fractionation experiments of whole brain revealed that Casq1a and Casq2 were enriched in a heavy fraction containing ER microsomes and synaptic membranes. By in situ hybridization, we found the heterogeneous expression of casq1a and casq2 mRNA to be compatible with the cellular localization of calsequestrins investigated by immunofluorescence. Casq1 was expressed in neurogenic differentiation 1 expressing the granule cells of the cerebellum and the periventricular zone of the optic tectum. Casq2 was concentrated in parvalbumin expressing Purkinje cells. At a subcellular level, Casq1 was restricted to granular cell bodies, and Casq2 was localized in cell bodies, dendrites, and axons. Data are discussed in relation to the differential cellular and subcellular distribution of other cerebellum calcium store markers and are evaluated with respect to the putative relevance of calsequestrins in the neuron-specific functional activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cilostazol, a Phosphodiesterase 3 Inhibitor, Moderately Attenuates Behaviors Depending on Sex in the Ts65Dn Mouse Model of Down Syndrome</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;People with Down syndrome, which is a trisomy of chromosome 21, exhibit intellectual disability from infancy and neuropathology similar to Alzheimer’s disease, such as amyloid plaques, from an early age. Recently, we showed that cilostazol, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3, promotes the clearance of amyloid β and rescues cognitive deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. The objective of the present study was to examine whether cilostazol improves behaviors in the most widely used animal model of Down syndrome, i.e., Ts65Dn mice. Mice were supplemented with cilostazol from the fetal period until young adulthood. Supplementation significantly ameliorated novel-object recognition in Ts65Dn females and partially ameliorated sensorimotor function as determined by the rotarod test in Ts65Dn females and hyperactive locomotion in Ts65Dn males. Cilostazol supplementation significantly shortened swimming distance in Ts65Dn males in the Morris water maze test, suggesting that the drug improved cognitive function, although it did not shorten swimming duration, which was due to decreased swimming speed. Thus, this study suggests that early supplementation with cilostazol partially rescues behavioral abnormalities seen in Down syndrome and indicates that the effects are sex-dependent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mitochondrial Homeostasis and Signaling in Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra leads to a progressive, long-term decline of movement and other non-motor deficits. The symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) often appear later in the course of the disease, when most of the functional dopaminergic neurons have been lost. The late onset of the disease, the severity of the illness, and its impact on the global health system demand earlier diagnosis and better targeted therapy. PD etiology and pathogenesis are largely unknown. There are mutations in genes that have been linked to PD and, from these complex phenotypes, mitochondrial dysfunction emerged as central in the pathogenesis and evolution of PD. In fact, several PD-associated genes negatively impact on mitochondria physiology, supporting the notion that dysregulation of mitochondrial signaling and homeostasis is pathogenically relevant. Derangement of mitochondrial homeostatic controls can lead to oxidative stress and neuronal cell death. Restoring deranged signaling cascades to and from mitochondria in PD neurons may then represent a viable opportunity to reset energy metabolism and delay the death of dopaminergic neurons. Here, we will highlight the relevance of dysfunctional mitochondrial homeostasis and signaling in PD, the molecular mechanisms involved, and potential therapeutic approaches to restore mitochondrial activities in damaged neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Gaussian Graphical Models Reveal Inter-Modal and Inter-Regional Conditional Dependencies of Brain Alterations in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00099</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00099</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a sequence of pathological changes, which are commonly assessed in vivo using various brain imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). Currently, the most approaches to analyze statistical associations between regions and imaging modalities rely on Pearson correlation or linear regression models. However, these models are prone to spurious correlations arising from uninformative shared variance and multicollinearity. Notably, there are no appropriate multivariate statistical models available that can easily integrate dozens of multicollinear variables derived from such data, being able to utilize the additional information provided from the combination of data sources. Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) can estimate the conditional dependency from given data, which is conceptually expected to closely reflect the underlying causal relationships between various variables. Hence, we applied GGMs to assess multimodal regional brain alterations in AD. We obtained data from N = 972 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The mean amyloid load (AV45-PET), glucose metabolism (FDG-PET), and gray matter volume (MRI) were calculated for each of the 108 cortical and subcortical brain regions. GGMs were estimated using a Bayesian framework for the combined multimodal data and the resulted conditional dependency networks were compared to classical covariance networks based on Pearson correlation. Additionally, graph-theoretical network statistics were calculated to determine network alterations associated with disease status. The resulting conditional dependency matrices were much sparser (≈10% density) than Pearson correlation matrices (≈50% density). Within imaging modalities, conditional dependency networks yielded clusters connecting anatomically adjacent regions. For the associations between different modalities, only few region-specific connections were detected. Network measures such as small-world coefficient were significantly altered across diagnostic groups, with a biphasic u-shape trajectory, i.e., increased small-world coefficient in early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), similar values in late MCI, and decreased values in AD dementia patients compared to cognitively normal controls. In conclusion, GGMs removed commonly shared variance among multimodal measures of regional brain alterations in MCI and AD, and yielded sparser matrices compared to correlation networks based on the Pearson coefficient. Therefore, GGMs may be used as alternative to thresholding-approaches typically applied to correlation networks to obtain the most informative relations between variables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Glucocerebrosidase Defects as a Major Risk Factor for Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Heterozygous mutations of the GBA1 gene, encoding for lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), occur in a considerable percentage of all patients with sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD), varying between 8% and 12% across the world. Genome wide association studies have confirmed the strong correlation between PD and GBA1 mutations, pointing to this element as a major risk factor for PD, possibly the most important one after age. The pathobiological mechanisms underlying the link between a defective function of GCase and the development of PD are still unknown and are currently the focus of intense investigation in the community of pre-clinical and clinical researchers in the PD field. A major controversy regards the fact that, despite the unequivocal correlation between the presence of GBA1 mutations and the risk of developing PD, only a minority of asymptomatic carriers with GBA1 mutations convert to PD in their lifetime. GBA1 mutations reduce the enzymatic function of GCase, impairing lysosomal efficiency and the cellular ability to dispose of pathological alpha-synuclein. Changes in the cellular lipidic content resulting from the accumulation of glycosphingolipids, triggered by lysosomal dysfunction, may contribute to the pathological modification of alpha-synuclein, due to its ability to interact with cell membrane lipids. Mutant GCase can impair mitochondrial function and cause endoplasmic reticulum stress, thereby impacting on cellular energy production and proteostasis. Importantly, reduced GCase activity is associated with clear activation of microglia, a major mediator of neuroinflammatory response within the brain parenchyma, which points to neuroinflammation as a major consequence of GCase dysfunction. In this present review article, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of GBA1 mutations in PD development and their phenotypic correlations. We also discuss the potential role of the GCase pathway in the search for PD biomarkers that may enable the development of disease modifying therapies. Answering these questions will aid clinicians in offering more appropriate counseling to the patients and their caregivers and provide future directions for PD preclinical research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Development and Evaluation of Maze-Like Puzzle Games to Assess Cognitive and Motor Function in Aging and Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is currently a need for engaging, user-friendly, and repeatable tasks for assessment of cognitive and motor function in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. This study evaluated the feasibility of a maze-like Numberlink puzzle game in assessing differences in game-based measures of cognition and motor function due to age and neurodegenerative diseases. Fifty-five participants, including young (18–31 years, n = 18), older (64–79 years, n = 14), and oldest adults (86–98 years, n = 14), and patients with Parkinson’s (59–76 years, n = 4) and Huntington’s disease (HD; 35–66 years, n = 5) played different difficulty levels of the Numberlink puzzle game and completed usability questionnaires and tests for psychomotor, attentional, visuospatial, and constructional and executive function. Analyses of Numberlink game-based cognitive (solving time and errors) and motor [mean velocity and movement direction changes (MDC)] performance metrics revealed statistically significant differences between age groups and between patients with HD and older adults. However, patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) did not differ from older adults. Correlational analyses showed significant associations between game-based performance and movement metrics and performance on neuropsychological tests for psychomotor, attentional, visuospatial, and constructional and executive function. Furthermore, varying characteristics of the Numberlink puzzle game succeeded in creating graded difficulty levels. Findings from this study support recent suggestions that data from a maze-like puzzle game provide potential “digital biomarkers” to assess changes in psychomotor, visuoconstructional, and executive function related to aging and neurodegeneration. In particular, game-based movement measures from the maze-like puzzle Numberlink games are promising as a tool to monitor the progression of motor impairment in neurodegenerative diseases. Further studies are needed to more comprehensively establish the cognitive validity and test–retest reliability of using Numberlink puzzles as a valid cognitive assessment tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Some neurons have stimulus responses that are stable over days, whereas other neurons have highly plastic stimulus responses. Using a recurrent network model, we explore whether this could be due to an underlying diversity in their synaptic plasticity. We find that, in a network with diverse learning rates, neurons with fast rates are more coupled to population activity than neurons with slow rates. This plasticity-coupling link predicts that neurons with high population coupling exhibit more long-term stimulus response variability than neurons with low population coupling. We substantiate this prediction using recordings from the Allen Brain Observatory, finding that a neuron's population coupling is correlated with the plasticity of its orientation preference. Simulations of a simple perceptual learning task suggest a particular functional architecture: a stable 'backbone' of stimulus representation formed by neurons with low population coupling, on top of which lies a flexible substrate of neurons with high population coupling.</description>

	<title>eLife: A single power stroke by ATP binding drives substrate translocation in a heterodimeric ABC transporter</title>

	<description>ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters constitute the largest family of primary active transporters, responsible for many physiological processes and human maladies. However, the mechanism how chemical energy of ATP facilitates translocation of chemically diverse compounds across membranes is poorly understood. Here, we advance the quantitative mechanistic understanding of the heterodimeric ABC transporter TmrAB, a functional homolog of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) by single-turnover analyses at single-liposome resolution. We reveal that a single conformational switch by ATP binding drives unidirectional substrate translocation. After this power stroke, ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release launch the return to the resting state, which facilitates nucleotide exchange and a new round of substrate binding and translocation. In contrast to hitherto existing steady-state assays, our single-turnover approach uncovers the power stroke in substrate translocation and the tight chemomechanical coupling in these molecular machines.</description>

	<description>Centering and decentering of cellular components is essential for internal organization of cells and their ability to perform basic cellular functions such as division and motility. How cells achieve proper localization of their organelles is still not well-understood, especially in large cells such as oocytes. Here, we study actin-based positioning mechanisms in artificial cells with persistently contracting actomyosin networks, generated by encapsulating cytoplasmic &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; egg extracts into cell-sized ‘water-in-oil’ droplets. We observe size-dependent localization of the contraction center, with a symmetric configuration in larger cells and a polar one in smaller cells. Centering is achieved via a hydrodynamic mechanism based on Darcy friction between the contracting network and the surrounding cytoplasm. During symmetry breaking, transient attachments to the cell boundary drive the contraction center to a polar location. The centering mechanism is cell-cycle dependent and weakens considerably during interphase. Our findings demonstrate a robust, yet tunable, mechanism for subcellular localization.</description>

	<title>eLife: A discrete subtype of neural progenitor crucial for cortical folding in the gyrencephalic mammalian brain</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54873</link>
	<description>An increase in the diversity of neural progenitor subtypes and folding of the cerebral cortex are characteristic features which appeared during the evolution of the mammalian brain. Here, we show that the expansion of a specific subtype of neural progenitor is crucial for cortical folding. We found that outer radial glial (oRG) cells can be subdivided by HOPX expression in the gyrencephalic cerebral cortex of ferrets. Compared with HOPX-negative oRG cells, HOPX-positive oRG cells had high self-renewal activity and were accumulated in prospective gyral regions. Using our in vivo genetic manipulation technique for ferrets, we found that the number of HOPX-positive oRG cells and their self-renewal activity were regulated by sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. Importantly, suppressing Shh signaling reduced HOPX-positive oRG cells and cortical folding, while enhancing it had opposing effects. Our results reveal a novel subtype of neural progenitor important for cortical folding in gyrencephalic mammalian cerebral cortex.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54462</link>
	<description>Seasonal migration is a taxonomically widespread behaviour that integrates across many traits. The European blackcap exhibits enormous variation in migration and is renowned for research on its evolution and genetic basis. We assembled a reference genome for blackcaps and obtained whole genome resequencing data from individuals across its breeding range. Analyses of population structure and demography suggested divergence began ~30,000 ya, with evidence for one admixture event between migrant and resident continent birds ~5000 ya. The propensity to migrate, orientation and distance of migration all map to a small number of genomic regions that do not overlap with results from other species, suggesting that there are multiple ways to generate variation in migration. Strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were located in regulatory regions of candidate genes that may serve as major regulators of the migratory syndrome. Evidence for selection on shared variation was documented, providing a mechanism by which rapid changes may evolve.</description>

	<title>eLife: Dual orexin and MCH neuron-ablated mice display severe sleep attacks and cataplexy</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54275</link>
	<description>Orexin/hypocretin-producing and melanin-concentrating hormone-producing (MCH) neurons are co-extensive in the hypothalamus and project throughout the brain to regulate sleep/wakefulness. Ablation of orexin neurons decreases wakefulness and results in a narcolepsy-like phenotype, whereas ablation of MCH neurons increases wakefulness. Since it is unclear how orexin and MCH neurons interact to regulate sleep/wakefulness, we generated transgenic mice in which both orexin and MCH neurons could be ablated. Double-ablated mice exhibited increased wakefulness and decreased both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep. Double-ablated mice showed severe cataplexy compared with orexin neuron-ablated mice, suggesting that MCH neurons normally suppress cataplexy. Double-ablated mice also showed frequent sleep attacks with elevated spectral power in the delta and theta range, a unique state that we call ‘delta-theta sleep’. Together, these results indicate a functional interaction between orexin and MCH neurons in vivo that suggests the synergistic involvement of these neuronal populations in the sleep/wakefulness cycle.</description>

	<title>eLife: A neuropeptide regulates fighting behavior in Drosophila melanogaster</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54229</link>
	<description>Aggressive behavior is regulated by various neuromodulators such as neuropeptides and biogenic amines. Here we found that the neuropeptide &lt;i&gt;Drosulfakinin (Dsk&lt;/i&gt;) modulates aggression in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. Knock-out of &lt;i&gt;Dsk&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Dsk&lt;/i&gt; receptor &lt;i&gt;CCKLR-17D1&lt;/i&gt; reduced aggression. Activation and inactivation of Dsk-expressing neurons increased and decreased male aggressive behavior, respectively. Moreover, data from transsynaptic tracing, electrophysiology and behavioral epistasis reveal that Dsk-expressing neurons function downstream of a subset of P1 neurons (&lt;i&gt;P1&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;-splitGAL4&lt;/i&gt;) to control fighting behavior. In addition, winners show increased calcium activity in Dsk-expressing neurons. Conditional overexpression of Dsk promotes social dominance, suggesting a positive correlation between Dsk signaling and winning effects. The mammalian ortholog CCK has been implicated in mammal aggression, thus our work suggests a conserved neuromodulatory system for the modulation of aggressive behavior.</description>

	<description>The &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; ventral nerve cord (VNC) receives and processes descending signals from the brain to produce a variety of coordinated locomotor outputs. It also integrates sensory information from the periphery and sends ascending signals to the brain. We used single-cell transcriptomics to generate an unbiased classification of cellular diversity in the VNC of five-day old adult flies. We produced an atlas of 26,000 high-quality cells, representing more than 100 transcriptionally distinct cell types. The predominant gene signatures defining neuronal cell types reflect shared developmental histories based on the neuroblast from which cells were derived, as well as their birth order. The relative position of cells along the anterior-posterior axis could also be assigned using adult Hox gene expression. This single-cell transcriptional atlas of the adult fly VNC will be a valuable resource for future studies of neurodevelopment and behavior.</description>

	<title>eLife: Vascular permeability in retinopathy is regulated by VEGFR2 Y949 signaling to VE-cadherin</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.54056</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54056</link>
	<description>Edema stemming from leaky blood vessels is common in eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Whereas therapies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) can suppress leakage, side-effects include vascular rarefaction and geographic atrophy. By challenging mouse models representing different steps in VEGFA/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2)-induced vascular permeability, we show that targeting signaling downstream of VEGFR2 pY949 limits vascular permeability in retinopathy induced by high oxygen or by laser-wounding. Although suppressed permeability is accompanied by reduced pathological neoangiogenesis in oxygen-induced retinopathy, similarly sized lesions leak less in mutant mice, separating regulation of permeability from angiogenesis,. Strikingly, vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin phosphorylation at the Y685, but not Y658, residue is reduced when VEGFR2 pY949 signaling is impaired. These findings support a mechanism whereby VE-cadherin Y685 phosphorylation is selectively associated with excessive vascular leakage. Therapeutically, targeting VEGFR2-regulated VE-cadherin phosphorylation could suppress edema while leaving other VEGFR2-dependent functions intact.</description>

	<title>eLife: Slo2 potassium channel function depends on RNA editing-regulated expression of a SCYL1 protein</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.53986</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53986</link>
	<description>Slo2 potassium channels play important roles in neuronal function, and their mutations in humans may cause epilepsies and cognitive defects. However, it is largely unknown how Slo2 is regulated by other proteins. Here we show that the function of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; Slo2 (SLO-2) depends on &lt;i&gt;adr-1&lt;/i&gt;, a gene important to RNA editing. ADR-1 promotes SLO-2 function not by editing the transcripts of &lt;i&gt;slo-2&lt;/i&gt; but those of &lt;i&gt;scyl-1&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes an orthologue of mammalian SCYL1. Transcripts of &lt;i&gt;scyl-1&lt;/i&gt; are greatly decreased in &lt;i&gt;adr-1&lt;/i&gt; mutants due to deficient RNA editing at a single adenosine in their 3'-UTR. SCYL-1 physically interacts with SLO-2 in neurons. Single-channel open probability (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) of neuronal SLO-2 is ~50% lower in &lt;i&gt;scyl-1 &lt;/i&gt;knockout mutant than wild type. Moreover, human Slo2.2/Slack &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is doubled by SCYL1 in a heterologous expression system. These results suggest that SCYL-1/SCYL1 is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of Slo2 channels.</description>

	<title>eLife: EphA7 promotes myogenic differentiation via cell-cell contact</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53689</link>
	<description>The conversion of proliferating skeletal muscle precursors (myoblasts) to terminally-differentiated myocytes is a critical step in skeletal muscle development and repair. We show that EphA7, a juxtacrine signaling receptor, is expressed on myocytes during embryonic and fetal myogenesis and on nascent myofibers during muscle regeneration in vivo. In &lt;i&gt;EphA7&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice, hindlimb muscles possess fewer myofibers at birth, and those myofibers are reduced in size and have fewer myonuclei and reduced overall numbers of precursor cells throughout postnatal life. Adult &lt;i&gt;EphA7&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice have reduced numbers of satellite cells and exhibit delayed and protracted muscle regeneration, and satellite cell-derived myogenic cells from &lt;i&gt;EphA7&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice are delayed in their expression of differentiation markers in vitro. Exogenous EphA7 extracellular domain will rescue the null phenotype in vitro, and will also enhance commitment to differentiation in WT cells. We propose a model in which EphA7 expression on differentiated myocytes promotes commitment of adjacent myoblasts to terminal differentiation.</description>

	<description>Platelet-neutrophil interactions are important for innate immunity, but also contribute to the pathogenesis of deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction and stroke. Here we report that, under flow, von Willebrand factor/glycoprotein Iba-dependent platelet 'priming' induces integrin a&lt;sub&gt;IIb&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; activation that, in turn, mediates neutrophil and T-cell binding. Binding of platelet a&lt;sub&gt;IIb&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to SLC44A2 on neutrophils leads to mechanosensitive-dependent production of highly prothrombotic neutrophil extracellular traps. A polymorphism in &lt;i&gt;SLC44A2&lt;/i&gt; (rs2288904-A) present in 22% of the population causes an R154Q substitution in an extracellular loop of SLC44A2 that is protective against venous thrombosis results in severely impaired binding to both activated a&lt;sub&gt;IIb&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;3 &lt;/sub&gt;and&lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;VWF-primed platelets. This was confirmed using neutrophils homozygous for the &lt;i&gt;SLC44A2&lt;/i&gt; R154Q polymorphism. Taken together, these data reveal a previously unreported mode of platelet-neutrophil crosstalk, mechanosensitive NET production, and provide mechanistic insight into the protective effect of the &lt;i&gt;SLC44A2&lt;/i&gt; rs2288904-A polymorphism in venous thrombosis.</description>

	<description>HLA-restricted T cell responses can induce antitumor effects in cancer patients. Previous human T cell research has largely focused on the few HLA alleles prevalent in a subset of ethnic groups. Here, using a panel of newly developed peptide-exchangeable peptide/HLA multimers and artificial antigen-presenting cells for 25 different class I alleles and greater than 800 peptides, we systematically and comprehensively mapped shared antigenic epitopes recognized by tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) from eight melanoma patients for all their class I alleles. We were able to determine the specificity, on average, of 12.2% of the TILs recognizing a mean of 3.1 shared antigen-derived epitopes across HLA-A, B, and C. Furthermore, we isolated a number of cognate T cell receptor genes with tumor reactivity. Our novel strategy allows for a more complete examination of the immune response and development of novel cancer immunotherapy not limited by HLA allele prevalence or tumor mutation burden.</description>

	<description>The World Health Organization has included three bunyaviruses posing an increasing threat to human health on the Blueprint list of viruses likely to cause major epidemics and for which no, or insufficient countermeasures exist. Here, we describe a broadly applicable strategy, based on llama-derived single-domain antibodies (VHHs), for the development of bunyavirus biotherapeutics. The method was validated using the zoonotic Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV), an emerging pathogen of ruminants, as model pathogens. VHH building blocks were assembled into highly potent neutralizing complexes using bacterial superglue technology. The multimeric complexes were shown to reduce and prevent virus-induced morbidity and mortality in mice upon prophylactic administration. Bispecific molecules engineered to present two different VHHs fused to an Fc domain were further shown to be effective upon therapeutic administration. The presented VHH-based technology holds great promise for the development of bunyavirus antiviral therapies.</description>

High-level TNF-α-inducing HPAIVs inhibit importin-α3 mRNA transcription by interfering with its promoter activity. Thus, HPAIVs may evade antiviral immunity in the respiratory tract by generating a bottleneck in importin-α3 availability.</description>

	<description>Chromosome 16p11.2 duplications dramatically increase schizophrenia risk. In this study, Bristow et al. show that the mutation in mice suppresses GABAergic neuron gene expression, disrupts activity in hippocampal-orbitofrontal-amygdaloid circuitry, and compromises sociability and cognitive function. This supports the concept that impairment of this network is a core component of schizophrenia.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Semidán Robaina-Estévez, Zoran Nikoloski&lt;/p&gt;

Biological networks across scales exhibit hierarchical organization that may constrain network function. Yet, understanding how these hierarchies arise due to the operational constraint of the networks and whether they impose limits to molecular phenotypes remains elusive. Here we show that metabolic networks include a hierarchy of reactions based on a natural flux ordering that holds for every steady state. We find that the hierarchy of reactions is reflected in experimental measurements of transcript, protein and flux levels of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; under various growth conditions as well as in the catalytic rate constants of the corresponding enzymes. Our findings point at resource partitioning and a fine-tuning of enzyme levels in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; to respect the constraints imposed by the network structure at steady state. Since reactions in upper layers of the hierarchy impose an upper bound on the flux of the reactions downstream, the hierarchical organization of metabolism due to the flux ordering has direct applications in metabolic engineering.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qQph3EDddVU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Methodological challenges in translational drug response modeling in cancer: A systematic analysis with FORESEE</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Lisa-Katrin Schätzle, Ali Hadizadeh Esfahani, Andreas Schuppert&lt;/p&gt;

Translational models directly relating drug response specific processes that can be observed &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to their &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; role in cancer patients constitute a crucial part of the development of personalized medication. Unfortunately, current studies often focus on the optimization of isolated model characteristics instead of examining the overall modeling workflow and the interplay of the individual model components. Moreover, they are often limited to specific data sets only. Therefore, they are often confined by the irreproducibility of the results and the non-transferability of the approaches into other contexts. In this study, we present a thorough investigation of translational models and their ability to predict the drug responses of cancer patients originating from diverse data sets using the R-package FORESEE. By systematically scanning the modeling space for optimal combinations of different model settings, we can determine models of extremely high predictivity and work out a few modeling guidelines that promote simplicity. Yet, we identify noise within the data, sample size effects, and drug unspecificity as factors that deteriorate the models’ robustness. Moreover, we show that cell line models of high accuracy do not necessarily excel in predicting drug response processes in patients. We therefore hope to motivate future research to consider &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; aspects more carefully to ultimately generate deeper insights into applicable precision medicine.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IvU2KaKPQNI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Expression of quasi-equivalence and capsid dimorphism in the Hepadnaviridae</title>

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a leading cause of liver disease. The capsid is an essential component of the virion and it is therefore of interest how it assembles and disassembles. The capsid protein is unusual both for its rare fold and that it polymerizes according to two different icosahedral symmetries, causing the polypeptide chain to exist in seven quasi-equivalent environments: A, B, and C in AB and CC dimers in T = 3 capsids, and A, B, C, and D in AB and CD dimers in T = 4 capsids. We have compared the two capsids by cryo-EM at 3.5 Å resolution. To ensure a valid comparison, the two capsids were prepared and imaged under identical conditions. We find that the chains have different conformations and potential energies, with the T = 3 C chain having the lowest. Three of the four quasi-equivalent dimers are asymmetric with respect to conformation and potential energy; however, the T = 3 CC dimer is symmetrical and has the lowest potential energy although its intra-dimer interface has the least free energy of formation. Of all the inter-dimer interfaces, the CB interface has the least area and free energy, in both capsids. From the calculated energies of higher-order groupings of dimers discernible in the lattices we predict early assembly intermediates, and indeed we observe such structures by negative stain EM of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assembly reactions. By sequence analysis and computational alanine scanning we identify key residues and motifs involved in capsid assembly. Our results explain several previously reported observations on capsid assembly, disassembly, and dimorphism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1gKDlqd1oAs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Recent years have seen rising incidence of dengue and large outbreaks of Zika and chikungunya, which are all caused by viruses transmitted by &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes. In most settings, the primary intervention against &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt;-transmitted viruses is vector control, such as indoor, ultra-low volume (ULV) spraying. Targeted indoor residual spraying (TIRS) has the potential to more effectively impact &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt;-borne diseases, but its implementation requires careful planning and evaluation. The optimal time to deploy these interventions and their relative epidemiological effects are, however, not well understood. We used an agent-based model of dengue virus transmission calibrated to data from Iquitos, Peru to assess the epidemiological effects of these interventions under differing strategies for deploying them. Specifically, we compared strategies where spray application was initiated when incidence rose above a threshold based on incidence in recent years to strategies where spraying occurred at the same time(s) each year. In the absence of spraying, the model predicted 361,000 infections [inter-quartile range (IQR): 347,000–383,000] in the period 2000–2010. The ULV strategy with the fewest median infections was spraying twice yearly, in March and October, which led to a median of 172,000 infections [IQR: 158,000–183,000], a 52% reduction from baseline. Compared to spraying once yearly in September, the best threshold-based strategy utilizing ULV had fewer median infections (254,000 vs. 261,000), but required more spraying (351 vs. 274 days). For TIRS, the best strategy was threshold-based, which led to the fewest infections of all strategies tested (9,900; [IQR: 8,720–11,400], a 94% reduction), and required fewer days spraying than the equivalent ULV strategy (280). Although spraying twice each year is likely to avert the most infections, our results indicate that a threshold-based strategy can become an alternative to better balance the translation of spraying effort into impact, particularly if used with a residual insecticide.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QKd-nkAFWE0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Sequential sampling models such as the drift diffusion model (DDM) have a long tradition in research on perceptual decision-making, but mounting evidence suggests that these models can account for response time (RT) distributions that arise during reinforcement learning and value-based decision-making. Building on this previous work, we implemented the DDM as the choice rule in inter-temporal choice (temporal discounting) and risky choice (probability discounting) using hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation. We validated our approach in data from nine patients with focal lesions to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex / medial orbitofrontal cortex (vmPFC/mOFC) and nineteen age- and education-matched controls. Model comparison revealed that, for both tasks, the data were best accounted for by a variant of the drift diffusion model including a non-linear mapping from value-differences to trial-wise drift rates. Posterior predictive checks confirmed that this model provided a superior account of the relationship between value and RT. We then applied this modeling framework and 1) reproduced our previous results regarding temporal discounting in vmPFC/mOFC patients and 2) showed in a previously unpublished data set on risky choice that vmPFC/mOFC patients exhibit increased risk-taking relative to controls. Analyses of DDM parameters revealed that patients showed substantially increased non-decision times and reduced response caution during risky choice. In contrast, vmPFC/mOFC damage abolished neither scaling nor asymptote of the drift rate. Relatively intact value processing was also confirmed using DDM mixture models, which revealed that in both groups &amp;gt;98% of trials were better accounted for by a DDM with value modulation than by a null model without value modulation. Our results highlight that novel insights can be gained from applying sequential sampling models in studies of inter-temporal and risky decision-making in cognitive neuroscience.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4-f6shlX5Ys&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Analytical forms for neuronal firing rates are important theoretical tools for the analysis of network states. Since the 1960s, the majority of approaches have treated neurons as being electrically compact and therefore isopotential. These approaches have yielded considerable insight into how single-cell properties affect network activity; however, many neuronal classes, such as cortical pyramidal cells, are electrically extended objects. Calculation of the complex flow of electrical activity driven by stochastic spatio-temporal synaptic input streams in these structures has presented a significant analytical challenge. Here we demonstrate that an extension of the level-crossing method of Rice, previously used for compact cells, provides a general framework for approximating the firing rate of neurons with spatial structure. Even for simple models, the analytical approximations derived demonstrate a surprising richness including: independence of the firing rate to the electrotonic length for certain models, but with a form distinct to the point-like leaky integrate-and-fire model; a non-monotonic dependence of the firing rate on the number of dendrites receiving synaptic drive; a significant effect of the axonal and somatic load on the firing rate; and the role that the trigger position on the axon for spike initiation has on firing properties. The approach necessitates only calculating the mean and variances of the non-thresholded voltage and its rate of change in neuronal structures subject to spatio-temporal synaptic fluctuations. The combination of simplicity and generality promises a framework that can be built upon to incorporate increasing levels of biophysical detail and extend beyond the low-rate firing limit treated in this paper.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/y8Nf5bPog3Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Visualization of two architectures in class-II CAP-dependent transcription activation</title>

Transcription activation by cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CAP) is the classic paradigm of transcription regulation in bacteria. CAP was suggested to activate transcription on class-II promoters via a recruitment and isomerization mechanism. However, whether and how it modifies RNA polymerase (RNAP) to initiate transcription remains unclear. Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of an intact &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; class-II CAP-dependent transcription activation complex (CAP-TAC) with and without de novo RNA transcript. The structures reveal two distinct architectures of TAC and raise the possibility that CAP binding may induce substantial conformational changes in all the subunits of RNAP and transiently widen the main cleft of RNAP to facilitate DNA promoter entering and formation of the initiation open complex. These structural changes vanish during further RNA transcript synthesis. The observations in this study may reveal a possible on-pathway intermediate and suggest a possibility that CAP activates transcription by inducing intermediate state, in addition to the previously proposed stabilization mechanism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/IL2sq4EEp9s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Interhemispheric connections between olfactory bulbs improve odor detection</title>

Interhemispheric connections enable interaction and integration of sensory information in bilaterian nervous systems and are thought to optimize sensory computations. However, the cellular and spatial organization of interhemispheric networks and the computational properties they mediate in vertebrates are still poorly understood. Thus, it remains unclear to what extent the connectivity between left and right brain hemispheres participates in sensory processing. Here, we show that the zebrafish olfactory bulbs (OBs) receive direct interhemispheric projections from their contralateral counterparts in addition to top-down inputs from the contralateral zebrafish homolog of olfactory cortex. The direct interhemispheric projections between the OBs reach peripheral layers of the contralateral OB and retain a precise topographic organization, which directly connects similarly tuned olfactory glomeruli across hemispheres. In contrast, interhemispheric top-down inputs consist of diffuse projections that broadly innervate the inhibitory granule cell layer. Jointly, these interhemispheric connections elicit a balance of topographically organized excitation and nontopographic inhibition on the contralateral OB and modulate odor responses. We show that the interhemispheric connections in the olfactory system enable the modulation of odor response and contribute to a small but significant improvement in the detection of a reproductive pheromone when presented together with complex olfactory cues by potentiating the response of the pheromone selective neurons. Taken together, our data show a previously unknown function for an interhemispheric connection between chemosensory maps of the olfactory system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Jo-Gyw42cMs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Resident microbial communities inhibit growth and antibiotic-resistance evolution of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; in human gut microbiome samples</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000465</guid>

Countering the rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens requires improved understanding of how resistance emerges and spreads in individual species, which are often embedded in complex microbial communities such as the human gut microbiome. Interactions with other microorganisms in such communities might suppress growth and resistance evolution of individual species (e.g., via resource competition) but could also potentially accelerate resistance evolution via horizontal transfer of resistance genes. It remains unclear how these different effects balance out, partly because it is difficult to observe them directly. Here, we used a gut microcosm approach to quantify the effect of three human gut microbiome communities on growth and resistance evolution of a focal strain of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. We found the resident microbial communities not only suppressed growth and colonisation by focal &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; but also prevented it from evolving antibiotic resistance upon exposure to a beta-lactam antibiotic. With samples from all three human donors, our focal &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; strain only evolved antibiotic resistance in the absence of the resident microbial community, even though we found resistance genes, including a highly effective resistance plasmid, in resident microbial communities. We identified physical constraints on plasmid transfer that can explain why our focal strain failed to acquire some of these beneficial resistance genes, and we found some chromosomal resistance mutations were only beneficial in the absence of the resident microbiota. This suggests, depending on in situ gene transfer dynamics, interactions with resident microbiota can inhibit antibiotic-resistance evolution of individual species.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7BukWKQPzEA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Different Mismatch Concepts for Magnetic Resonance Imaging–Guided Thrombolysis in Unknown Onset Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25730?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25730?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the prevalence of the perfusion‐weighted imaging (PWI)–diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) mismatch and response to intravenous thrombolysis in the WAKE‐UP trial.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a prespecified post hoc analysis of ischemic stroke patients screened for DWI–fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) mismatch in WAKE‐UP who underwent PWI. We defined PWI‐DWI mismatch as ischemic core volume &amp;lt; 70ml, mismatch volume &amp;gt; 10ml, and mismatch ratio &amp;gt; 1.2. Primary efficacy end point was a modified Rankin Scale score of 0–1 at 90 days, adjusted for age and symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 1,362 magnetic resonance imaging–screened patients, 431 underwent PWI. Of these, 57 (13%) had a double mismatch, 151 (35%) only a DWI‐FLAIR mismatch, and 54 (13%) only a PWI‐DWI mismatch. DWI‐FLAIR mismatch was more prevalent than PWI‐DWI mismatch (48%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 43–53% vs 26%, 95% CI = 22–30%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Screening for either one of the mismatch profiles resulted in a yield of 61% (95% CI = 56–65%). Prevalence of PWI‐DWI mismatch was similar in patients with (27%) or without (24%) DWI‐FLAIR mismatch (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.52). In an exploratory analysis in the small subgroup of 208 randomized patients with PWI, PWI‐DWI mismatch status did not modify the treatment response (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; for interaction = 0.73).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluating both the DWI‐FLAIR and PWI‐DWI mismatch patterns in patients with unknown time of stroke onset will result in the highest yield of thrombolysis treatment. The treatment benefit of alteplase in patients with a DWI‐FLAIR mismatch seems to be driven not merely by the presence of a PWI‐DWI mismatch, although this analysis was underpowered.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mean Oxygen Saturation during Sleep Is Related to Specific Brain Atrophy Pattern</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25728?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much controversy about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effects of sleep‐disordered breathing on the brain. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between markers of sleep‐related hypoxemia and brain anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used data from a large‐scale cohort from the general population (n = 775, 50.6% males, age range = 45–86 years, mean age = 60.3 ± 9.9) that underwent full polysomnography and brain magnetic resonance imaging to correlate respiratory variables with regional brain volume estimates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, gender, and cardiovascular risk factors, only mean oxygen saturation during sleep was associated with bilateral volume of hippocampus (right: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001; left: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), thalamus (right: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; left: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), putamen (right: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001; left: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001), and angular gyrus (right: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011; left: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001). We observed the same relationship in left hemispheric amygdala (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.010), caudate (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008), inferior frontal gyrus (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004), and supramarginal gyrus (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003). The other respiratory variables—lowest oxygen saturation, percentage of sleep time with oxygen saturation &amp;lt; 90%, apnea–hypopnea index, and oxygen desaturation index—did not show any significant association with brain volumes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower mean oxygen saturation during sleep was associated with atrophy of cortical and subcortical brain areas known for high sensitivity to oxygen supply. Their vulnerability to hypoxemia may contribute to behavioral phenotype and cognitive decline in patients with sleep‐disordered breathing. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Central afferents to the nucleus of the solitary tract in rats and mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24927?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) regulates life‐sustaining functions ranging from appetite and digestion to heart rate and breathing. It is also the brain’s primary sensory nucleus for visceral sensations relevant to symptoms in medical and psychiatric disorders. To better understand which neurons may exert top‐down control over the NTS, here we provide a brain‐wide map of all neurons that project axons directly to the caudal, viscerosensory NTS, focusing on a medial subregion with aldosterone‐sensitive HSD2 neurons. Injecting an axonal tracer (cholera toxin b) into the NTS produces a similar pattern of retrograde labeling in rats and mice. The paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), lateral hypothalamic area, and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) contain the densest concentrations of NTS‐projecting neurons. PVH afferents are glutamatergic (express &lt;i&gt;Slc17a6&lt;/i&gt;/Vglut2) and are distinct from neuroendocrine PVH neurons. CeA afferents are GABAergic (express &lt;i&gt;Slc32a1&lt;/i&gt;/Vgat) and are distributed largely in the medial CeA subdivision. Other retrogradely labeled neurons are located in a variety of brain regions, including the cerebral cortex (insular and infralimbic areas), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, periaqueductal gray, Barrington’s nucleus, Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus, hindbrain reticular formation, and rostral NTS. Similar patterns of retrograde labeling result from tracer injections into different NTS subdivisions, with dual retrograde tracing revealing that many afferent neurons project axon collaterals to both the lateral and medial NTS subdivisions. This information provides a roadmap for studying descending axonal projections that may influence visceromotor systems and visceral “mind–body” symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A Prospective Study of Acute Blood‐Based Biomarkers for Sport‐Related Concussion</title>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25725?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prospectively characterize changes in serum proteins following sport‐related concussion and determine whether candidate biomarkers discriminate concussed athletes from controls and are associated with duration of symptoms following concussion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High school and collegiate athletes were enrolled between 2015 and 2018. Blood was collected at preinjury baseline and within 6 hours (early acute) and at 24 to 48 hours (late acute) following concussion in football players (n = 106), matched uninjured football players (n = 84), and non–contact‐sport athletes (n = 50). Glial fibrillary acidic protein, ubiquitin c‐terminal hydrolase‐L1, S100 calcium binding protein B, alpha‐II‐spectrin breakdown product 150, interleukin 6, interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, and c‐reactive protein were measured in serum. Linear models assessed changes in protein concentrations over time. Receiver operating curves quantified the discrimination of concussed athletes from controls. A Cox proportional hazard model determined whether proteins were associated with symptom recovery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All proteins except glial fibrillary acidic protein and c‐reactive protein were significantly elevated at the early acute phase postinjury relative to baseline and both control groups and discriminated concussed athletes from controls with areas under the curve of 0.68 to 0.84. The candidate biomarkers also significantly improved the discrimination of concussed athletes from noncontact controls compared to symptom severity alone. Glial fibrillary acidic protein was elevated postinjury relative to baseline in concussed athletes with a loss of consciousness or amnesia. Finally, early acute levels of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist were associated with the number of days to symptom recovery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain injury and inflammatory proteins show promise as objective diagnostic biomarkers for sport‐related concussion, and inflammatory markers may provide prognostic value. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: The Neural Dynamics of Individual Differences in Episodic Autobiographical Memory</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The ability to mentally travel to specific events from one’s past, dubbed episodic autobiographical memory (E-AM), contributes to adaptive functioning. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying its typical interindividual variation remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we capitalize on existing evidence that successful performance on E-AM tasks draws on the ability to visualize past episodes and reinstate their unique spatiotemporal context. Hence, here, we test whether features of the brain’s functional architecture relevant to perceptual versus conceptual processes shape individual differences in both self-rated E-AM and laboratory-based episodic memory (EM) for random visual scene sequences (visual EM). We propose that superior subjective E-AM and visual EM are associated with greater similarity in static neural organization patterns, potentially indicating greater efficiency in switching, between rest and mental states relevant to encoding perceptual information. Complementarily, we postulate that impoverished subjective E-AM and visual EM are linked to dynamic brain organization patterns implying a predisposition towards semanticizing novel perceptual information. Analyses were conducted on resting state and task-based fMRI data from 329 participants (160 women) in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) who completed visual and verbal EM assessments, and an independent gender diverse sample (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 59) who self-rated their E-AM. Interindividual differences in subjective E-AM were linked to the same neural mechanisms underlying visual, but not verbal, EM, in general agreement with the hypothesized static and dynamic brain organization patterns. Our results suggest that higher E-AM entails more efficient processing of temporally extended information sequences, whereas lower E-AM entails more efficient semantic or gist-based processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Duman, the Elizabeth Mears and House Jameson Professor of Psychiatry, Professor of Neuroscience at the Yale University School of Medicine and Director of the Abraham Ribicoff Research Facilities of the Connecticut Mental Health Center, died unexpectedly of a heart attack on 1 February 2020 while hiking near his home in Guilford, CT. Dr Duman was about to turn 65 years old. He was a member of the US National Academy of Medicine and received many honors for his research on mood disorders, including the Colvin Prize, from the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, and the Anna-Monika Foundation Prize.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/THfSofJB8-s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>More often than not, action potentials fail to trigger neurotransmitter release. And even when neurotransmitter is released, the resulting change in synaptic conductance is highly variable. Given the energetic cost of generating and propagating action potentials, and the importance of information transmission across synapses, this seems both wasteful and inefficient. However, synaptic noise arising from variable transmission can improve, in certain restricted conditions, information transmission.</description>

	<description>Bartolo and Averbeck show that primates infer changes in reward contingencies, consistent with Bayesian inference strategies, incorporating knowledge about task structure to quickly adjust their behavior. Posterior probability estimates correlate with neural ensemble activity in prefrontal cortex, suggesting that the brain implements Bayesian-like mechanisms for state inference.</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Chemospecific Deficits in Taste Sensitivity Following Bilateral or Right Hemispheric Gustatory Cortex Lesions in Rats.&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0833c403-68d2-4456-a2b5-e965abc8ed96/cne24928-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a taste signal detection task with a specialized gustometer, we found that extensive lesions bilaterally in the rat gustatory cortex (BGCX), or in the right GC (not shown), impair taste sensitivity (significant shift of EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) for NaCl but not for maltodextrin (Maltrin) or citric acid relative the sham‐operated rats (SHAM).  In addition to suggesting some degree of laterality of function in GC with respect to NaCl detection, these findings add to growing evidence suggesting that gustatory sites outside of GC can maintain normal taste sensitivity for select stimuli.  



&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our prior studies showed bilateral gustatory cortex (GC) lesions significantly impair taste sensitivity to salts (NaCl and KCl) and quinine (“bitter”) but not to sucrose (“sweet”). The range of qualitative tastants tested here has been extended in a theoretically relevant way to include the maltodextrin, Maltrin, a preferred stimulus by rats thought to represent a unique taste quality, and the “sour” stimulus citric acid; NaCl was also included as a positive control. Male rats (Sprague‐Dawley) with histologically confirmed neurotoxin‐induced bilateral (BGCX, n=13), or right (LGCX, n=13) or left (RGCX, n=9) unilateral GC lesions and sham‐operated controls (SHAM, n=16) were trained to discriminate a tastant from water in an operant two‐response detection task. A mapping system was used to determine placement, size, and symmetry (when bilateral) of the lesion. BGCX significantly impaired taste sensitivity to NaCl, as expected, but not to Maltrin or citric acid, emulating our prior results with sucrose. However, in the case of citric acid, there was some disruption in performance at higher concentrations. Interestingly, RGCX, but not LGCX, also significantly impaired taste sensitivity, but only to NaCl, suggesting some degree of lateralized function. Taken together with our prior findings, extensive bilateral lesions in GC do not disrupt basic taste signal detection to all taste stimuli uniformly. Moreover, GC lesions do not preclude the ability of rats to learn and perform the task, clearly demonstrating that, in its absence, other brain regions are able to maintain sensory‐discriminative taste processing, albeit with attenuated sensitivity for select stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;

Mediation analysis with high-dimensional DNA methylation markers is important in identifying epigenetic pathways between environmental exposures and health outcomes. There have been some methodology developments of mediation analysis with high-dimensional mediators. However, high-dimensional mediation analysis methods for time-to-event outcome data are still yet to be developed. To address these challenges, we propose a new high-dimensional mediation analysis procedure for survival models by incorporating sure independent screening and minimax concave penalty techniques for variable selection, with the Sobel and the joint method for significance test of indirect effect. The simulation studies show good performance in identifying correct biomarkers, false discovery rate control, and minimum estimation bias of the proposed procedure. We also apply this approach to study the causal pathway from smoking to overall survival among lung cancer patients potentially mediated by 365,307 DNA methylations in the TCGA lung cancer cohort. Mediation analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model estimates that patients who have serious smoking history increase the risk of lung cancer through methylation markers including cg21926276, cg27042065, and cg26387355 with significant hazard ratios of 1.2497(95%CI: 1.1121, 1.4045), 1.0920(95%CI: 1.0170, 1.1726), and 1.1489(95%CI: 1.0518, 1.2550), respectively. The three methylation sites locate in the three genes which have been showed to be associated with lung cancer event or overall survival. However, the three CpG sites (cg21926276, cg27042065 and cg26387355) have not been reported, which are newly identified as the potential novel epigenetic markers linking smoking and survival of lung cancer patients. Collectively, the proposed high-dimensional mediation analysis procedure has good performance in mediator selection and indirect effect estimation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tK75AlvMauI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) comprise over 90% of cells in the striatum. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; MSNs display coherent burst firing cell assembly activity patterns, even though isolated MSNs do not burst fire intrinsically. This activity is important for the learning and execution of action sequences and is characteristically dysregulated in Huntington’s Disease (HD). However, how dysregulation is caused by the various neural pathologies affecting MSNs in HD is unknown. Previous modeling work using simple cell models has shown that cell assembly activity patterns can emerge as a result of MSN inhibitory network interactions. Here, by directly estimating MSN network model parameters from single unit spiking data, we show that a network composed of much more physiologically detailed MSNs provides an excellent quantitative fit to wild type (WT) mouse spiking data, but only when network parameters are appropriate for the striatum. We find the WT MSN network is situated in a regime close to a transition from stable to strongly fluctuating network dynamics. This regime facilitates the generation of low-dimensional slowly varying coherent activity patterns and confers high sensitivity to variations in cortical driving. By re-estimating the model on HD spiking data we discover network parameter modifications are consistent across three very different types of HD mutant mouse models (YAC128, Q175, R6/2). In striking agreement with the known pathophysiology we find feedforward excitatory drive is reduced in HD compared to WT mice, while recurrent inhibition also shows phenotype dependency. We show that these modifications shift the HD MSN network to a sub-optimal regime where higher dimensional incoherent rapidly fluctuating activity predominates. Our results provide insight into a diverse range of experimental findings in HD, including cognitive and motor symptoms, and may suggest new avenues for treatment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Te8nacmED6U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The main neuronal population of the striatum are GABAergic medium spiny neurons. Calbindin is preferentially expressed in medium spiny neurons involved in the indirect pathway. The perinatal asphyxia (PA) group showed a significant decrease in calbindin neurons and a paradoxical increase in neurons estimated by NeuN staining. Moreover, Calretinin+ cells, a specific subpopulation of GABAergic neurons, showed an increase caused by perinatal asphyxia. Deep hypothermia reversed most of these alterations probably by protecting calbindin neurons.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Region‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐specific expression of Na,K‐ATPase alpha and beta subunit isoforms in the mouse brain</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Region‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐specific expression of Na,K‐ATPase alpha and beta subunit isoforms in the mouse brain&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/cd293a00-25fd-47b7-a05f-c21a2818d998/cne24924-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na,K‐ATPase comprises α (&lt;i&gt;Atp1a&lt;/i&gt;), β (&lt;i&gt;Atp1b&lt;/i&gt;), and FXYD subunits, and each subunit has isoforms. &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization for α and β subunit isoforms revealed regional‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐specific expression of the isoforms in the mouse brain. The photograph shows &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; (red) and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; (green) expression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (stained with DAPI, blue).


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na,K‐ATPase is a ubiquitous molecule contributing to the asymmetrical distribution of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions across the plasma membrane and maintenance of the membrane potential, a prerequisite of neuronal activity. Na,K‐ATPase comprises three subunits (α, β, and FXYD). The α subunit has four isoforms in mice, with three of them (α1, α2, and α3) expressed in the brain. However, the functional and biological significances of the different brain isoforms remain to be fully elucidated. Recent studies have revealed the association of &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt;, a gene encoding α3 subunit, with neurological disorders. To map the cellular distributions of the α subunit isoforms and their coexpression patterns, we evaluated the mRNA expression of &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Atp1a2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; by &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization in the mouse brain. &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; were expressed in neurons, whereas &lt;i&gt;Atp1a2&lt;/i&gt; was almost exclusively expressed in glial cells. Most neurons coexpressed &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt;, with highly heterogeneous expression levels across the brain regions and neuronal subtypes. We identified parvalbumin‐expressing GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus, somatosensory cortex, and retrosplenial cortex as an example of a neuronal subtype expressing low &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; and high &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt;. The expression of &lt;i&gt;Atp1b&lt;/i&gt; isoforms was also heterogeneous across brain regions and cellular subtypes. The parvalbumin‐expressing neurons expressed a high level of &lt;i&gt;Atp1b1&lt;/i&gt; and a low level of &lt;i&gt;Atp1b2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Atp1b3&lt;/i&gt;. These findings provide basic information on the region‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐dependent expression of Na,K‐ATPase α and β subunit isoforms, as well as a rationale for the selective involvement of neurons expressing high levels of &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; in neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eNeuro: Differential Effects of Nasal Inflammation and Odor Deprivation on Layer-Specific Degeneration of the Mouse Olfactory Bulb</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Harmful environmental agents cause nasal inflammation, and chronic nasal inflammation induces a loss of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and reversible atrophy of the olfactory bulb (OB). Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying this inflammation-induced OB atrophy by histologically and biochemically comparing the OB changes in mouse models of nasal inflammation and odor deprivation. In addition, we examined whether odor stimulation is necessary for OB recovery from atrophy. One group of adult male C57BL/6 mice was administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) unilaterally for 10 weeks to induce nasal inflammation (control animals received saline), and a second group received unilateral naris closures (NCs) for 10 weeks of odor deprivation. The OBs atrophied in both models, but odor deprivation shrank the glomerular, external plexiform, mitral, and granule cell layers (GCLs), whereas the olfactory nerve, glomerular, and external plexiform layers (EPLs) atrophied as a result of nasal inflammation. Additionally, nasal inflammation, but not odor deprivation, caused neuroinflammation in the OB, inducing glial activation and elevated expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and TNFα. After 10 weeks of nasal inflammation, mice were housed for another 10 weeks with no additional treatment or with unilateral NC. Nasal inflammation and glial activation subsided in both groups, but glomerular and EPLs recovered only in those with no additional treatment. Our findings demonstrate that nasal inflammation and odor deprivation differentially induce layer-specific degeneration in the OB, that loss of OSN activity rather than neuroinflammation is a major cause of inflammation-induced OB atrophy, and that odor stimulation is required for OB recovery from atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Localized Calcium Signaling and the Control of Coupling at Cx36 Gap Junctions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A variety of electrical synapses are capable of activity-dependent plasticity, including both activity-dependent potentiation and activity-dependent depression. In several types of neurons, activity-dependent electrical synapse plasticity depends on changes in the local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; environment. To enable study of local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling that regulates plasticity, we developed a GCaMP Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; biosensor fused to the electrical synapse protein Connexin 36 (Cx36). Cx36-GCaMP transfected into mammalian cell cultures formed gap junctions at cell-cell boundaries and supported Neurobiotin tracer coupling that was regulated by protein kinase A signaling in the same way as Cx36. Cx36-GCaMP gap junctions robustly reported local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increases in response to addition of a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ionophore with increases in fluorescence that recovered during washout. Recovery was strongly dependent on Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; exchange activity. In cells transfected with NMDA receptor subunits, Cx36-GCaMP revealed transient and concentration-dependent increases in local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; on brief application of glutamate. In HeLa cells, glutamate application increased Cx36-GCaMP tracer coupling through a mechanism that depended in part on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity. This potentiation of coupling did not require exogenous expression of glutamate receptors, but could be accomplished by endogenously expressed glutamate receptors with pharmacological characteristics reminiscent of NMDA and kainate receptors. Analysis of RNA Sequencing data from HeLa cells confirmed expression of NMDA receptor subunits NR1, NR2C, and NR3B. In summary, Cx36-GCaMP is an effective tool to measure changes in the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; microenvironment around Cx36 gap junctions. Furthermore, HeLa cells can serve as a model system to study glutamate receptor-driven potentiation of electrical synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The intercollicular region, which lies between the inferior and superior colliculi in the midbrain, contains neurons that respond to auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli. Golgi studies have been used to parse this region into three distinct nuclei: the intercollicular tegmentum (ICt), the rostral pole of the inferior colliculus (ICrp), and the nucleus of the brachium of the IC (NBIC). Few reports have focused on these nuclei, especially the ICt and the ICrp, possibly due to lack of a marker that distinguishes these areas and is compatible with modern methods. Here, we show that staining for GABAergic cells (magenta) and perineuronal nets (green) differentiates these intercollicular nuclei in guinea pigs.

Here, we found that staining for GABAergic cells and perineuronal nets differentiates these intercollicular nuclei in guinea pigs. Further, we found that the proportions of four subtypes of GABAergic cells differentiate intercollicular nuclei from each other and from adjacent inferior collicular subdivisions. Our results support earlier studies that suggest distinct morphology and functions for intercollicular nuclei, and provide staining methods that differentiate intercollicular nuclei and are compatible with most modern techniques. We hope that this will help future studies to further characterize the intercollicular region.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Ghost Attractors in Spontaneous Brain Activity: Recurrent Excursions Into Functionally-Relevant BOLD Phase-Locking States</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00020</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functionally relevant network patterns form transiently in brain activity during rest, where a given subset of brain areas exhibits temporally synchronized BOLD signals. To adequately assess the biophysical mechanisms governing intrinsic brain activity, a detailed characterization of the dynamical features of functional networks is needed from the experimental side to constrain theoretical models. In this work, we use an open-source fMRI dataset from 100 healthy participants from the Human Connectome Project and analyze whole-brain activity using Leading Eigenvector Dynamics Analysis (LEiDA), which serves to characterize brain activity at each time point by its whole-brain BOLD phase-locking pattern. Clustering these BOLD phase-locking patterns into a set of k states, we demonstrate that the cluster centroids closely overlap with reference functional subsystems. Borrowing tools from dynamical systems theory, we characterize spontaneous brain activity in the form of trajectories within the state space, calculating the Fractional Occupancy and the Dwell Times of each state, as well as the Transition Probabilities between states. Finally, we demonstrate that within-subject reliability is maximized when including the high frequency components of the BOLD signal (&amp;gt;0.1 Hz), indicating the existence of individual fingerprints in dynamical patterns evolving at least as fast as the temporal resolution of acquisition (here TR = 0.72 s). Our results reinforce the mechanistic scenario that resting-state networks are the expression of erratic excursions from a baseline synchronous steady state into weakly-stable partially-synchronized states – which we term ghost attractors. To better understand the rules governing the transitions between ghost attractors, we use methods from dynamical systems theory, giving insights into high-order mechanisms underlying brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to form memories in the brain is needed for daily functions, and its impairment is associated with human mental disorders. Evidence indicates that long-term memory (LTM)-related processes such as its consolidation, extinction and forgetting involve changes of synaptic efficacy produced by alterations in neural transmission and morphology. Modulation of the morphology and number of dendritic spines has been proposed to contribute to changes in neuronal transmission mediating such LTM-related processes. Rac GTPase activity is regulated by synaptic activation and it can affect spine morphology by controlling actin-regulatory proteins. Recent evidence shows that changes in Rac GTPase activity affect memory consolidation, extinction, erasure and forgetting and can affect spine morphology in brain areas that mediate these behaviors. Altered Rac GTPase activity is associated with abnormal spine morphology and brain disorders. By affecting Rac GTPase activity we can further understand the roles of spine morphogenesis in memory. Moreover, manipulation of Rac GTPase activity may serve as a therapeutic tool for the treatment of memory-related brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Transgenic Cross-Referencing of Inhibitory and Excitatory Interneuron Populations to Dissect Neuronal Heterogeneity in the Dorsal Horn</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The superficial dorsal horn (SDH, LI-II) of the spinal cord receives and processes multimodal sensory information from skin, muscle, joints, and viscera then relay it to the brain. Neurons within the SDH fall into two broad categories, projection neurons and interneurons. The later can be further subdivided into excitatory and inhibitory types. Traditionally, interneurons within the SDH have been divided into overlapping groups according to their neurochemical, morphological and electrophysiological properties. Recent clustering analyses, based on molecular transcript profiles of cells and nuclei, have predicted many more functional groups of interneurons than expected using traditional approaches. In this study, we used electrophysiological and morphological data obtained from genetically-identified excitatory (vGLUT2) and inhibitory (vGAT) interneurons in transgenic mice to cluster cells into groups sharing common characteristics and subsequently determined how many clusters can be assigned by combinations of these properties. Consistent with previous reports, we show differences exist between excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in terms of their excitability, nature of the ongoing excitatory drive, action potential (AP) properties, sub-threshold current kinetics, and morphology. The resulting clusters based on statistical and unbiased assortment of these data fell well short of the numbers of molecularly predicted clusters. There was no clear characteristic that in isolation defined a population, rather multiple variables were needed to predict cluster membership. Importantly though, our analysis highlighted the appropriateness of using transgenic lines as tools to functionally subdivide both excitatory and inhibitory interneuron populations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Sleep State Modulates Resting-State Functional Connectivity in Neonates</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The spontaneous cerebral activity that gives rise to resting-state networks (RSNs) has been extensively studied in infants in recent years. However, the influence of sleep state on the presence of observable RSNs has yet to be formally investigated in the infant population, despite evidence that sleep modulates resting-state functional connectivity in adults. This effect could be extremely important, as most infant neuroimaging studies rely on the neonate to remain asleep throughout data acquisition. In this study, we combine functional near-infrared spectroscopy with electroencephalography to simultaneously monitor sleep state and investigate RSNs in a cohort of healthy term born neonates. During active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) our newborn neonates show functional connectivity patterns spatially consistent with previously reported RSN structures. Our three independent functional connectivity analyses revealed stronger interhemispheric connectivity during AS than during QS. In turn, within hemisphere short-range functional connectivity seems to be enhanced during QS. These findings underline the importance of sleep state monitoring in the investigation of RSNs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Evidence for Structural and Functional Alterations of Frontal-Executive and Corticolimbic Circuits in Late-Life Depression and Relationship to Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia: A Systematic Review</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Depression is a risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease and Related Dementia (ADRD). We conducted a systematic review between 2008 and October 2018, to evaluate the evidence for a conceptual mechanistic model linking depression and ADRD, focusing on frontal-executive and corticolimbic circuits. We focused on two neuroimaging modalities: diffusion-weighted imaging measuring white matter tract disruptions and resting-state functional MRI measuring alterations in network dynamics in late-life depression (LLD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and LLD+MCI vs. healthy control (HC) individuals. Our data synthesis revealed that in some but not all studies, impairment of both frontal-executive and corticolimbic circuits, as well as impairment of global brain topology was present in LLD, MCI, and LLD+MCI vs. HC groups. Further, posterior midline regions (posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus) appeared to have the most structural and functional alterations in all patient groups. Future cohort and longitudinal studies are required to address the heterogeneity of findings, and to clarify which subgroups of people with LLD are at highest risk for developing MCI and ADRD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Visual Feedback Modulates Aftereffects and Electrophysiological Markers of Prism Adaptation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00138</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prism adaptation (PA) is both a model for visuomotor learning and a promising treatment for visuospatial neglect after stroke. The task involves reaching for targets while prism glasses horizontally displace the visual field. Adaptation is hypothesized to occur through two processes: strategic recalibration, a rapid self-correction of pointing errors; and spatial realignment, a more gradual adjustment of visuomotor reference frames that produce prism aftereffects (i.e., reaching errors upon glasses removal in the direction opposite to the visual shift). While aftereffects can ameliorate neglect, not all patients respond to PA, and the neural mechanisms underlying successful adaptation are unclear. We investigated the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the P300 event-related potential (ERP) components as candidate markers of strategic recalibration and spatial realignment, respectively. Healthy young adults wore prism glasses and performed memory-guided reaching toward vertical-line targets. ERPs were recorded in response to three different between-subject error feedback conditions at screen-touch: view of hand and target (Experiment 1), view of hand only (Experiment 2), or view of lines to mark target and hand position (view of hand occluded; Experiment 3). Conditions involving a direct view of the hand-produced stronger aftereffects than indirect hand feedback, and also evoked a P300 that decreased in amplitude as adaptation proceeded. Conversely, the FRN was only seen in conditions involving target feedback, even when aftereffects were smaller. Since conditions producing stronger aftereffects were associated with a phase-sensitive P300, this component may index a “context-updating” realignment process critical for strong aftereffects, whereas the FRN may reflect an error monitoring process related to strategic recalibration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Training on an Appetitive Trace-Conditioning Task Increases Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis and the Expression of Arc, Erk and CREB Proteins in the Dorsal Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00089</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) plays an essential role in hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation. Increased neurogenesis enhances learning, whereas its ablation causes memory impairment. In contrast, few reports suggest that neurogenesis reduces after learning. Although the interest in exploring the role of adult neurogenesis in learning has been growing, the evidence is still limited. The role of the trace- and delay-appetitive-conditioning on AHN and its underlying mechanism are not known. The consolidation of trace-conditioned memory requires the hippocampus, but delay-conditioning does not. Moreover, the dorsal hippocampus (DH) and ventral hippocampus (VH) may have a differential role in these two conditioning paradigms. Here, we have investigated the changes in: (A) hippocampal cell proliferation and their progression towards neuronal lineage; and (B) expression of Arc, Erk1, Erk2, and CREB proteins in the DH and VH after trace- and delay-conditioning in the rat. The number of newly generated cells significantly increased in the trace-conditioned but did not change in the delay-conditioned animals compared to the control group. Similarly, the expression of Arc protein significantly increased in the DH but not in the VH after trace-conditioning. Nonetheless, it remains unaltered in the delay-conditioned group. The expression of pErk1, pErk2, and pCREB also increased in the DH after trace-conditioning. Whereas, the expression of only pErk1 pErk2 and pCREB proteins increased in the VH after delay-conditioning. Our results suggest that appetitive trace-conditioning enhances AHN. The increased DH neuronal activation and pErk1, pErk2, and pCREB in the DH may be playing an essential role in learning-induced cell-proliferation after appetitive trace-conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Intracellular Trafficking Mechanisms of Synaptic Dysfunction in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00072</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive memory loss. Although AD neuropathological hallmarks are extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular tau tangles, the best correlate of disease progression is synapse loss. What causes synapse loss has been the focus of several researchers in the AD field. Synapses become dysfunctional before plaques and tangles form. Studies based on early-onset familial AD (eFAD) models have supported that synaptic transmission is depressed by β-amyloid (Aβ) triggered mechanisms. Since eFAD is rare, affecting only 1% of patients, research has shifted to the study of the most common late-onset AD (LOAD). Intracellular trafficking has emerged as one of the pathways of LOAD genes. Few studies have assessed the impact of trafficking LOAD genes on synapse dysfunction. Since endocytic traffic is essential for synaptic function, we reviewed Aβ-dependent and independent mechanisms of the earliest synaptic dysfunction in AD. We have focused on the role of intraneuronal and secreted Aβ oligomers, highlighting the dysfunction of endocytic trafficking as an Aβ-dependent mechanism of synapse dysfunction in AD. Here, we reviewed the LOAD trafficking genes APOE4, ABCA7, BIN1, CD2AP, PICALM, EPH1A, and SORL1, for which there is a synaptic link. We conclude that in eFAD and LOAD, the earliest synaptic dysfunctions are characterized by disruptions of the presynaptic vesicle exo- and endocytosis and of postsynaptic glutamate receptor endocytosis. While in eFAD synapse dysfunction seems to be triggered by Aβ, in LOAD, there might be a direct synaptic disruption by LOAD trafficking genes. To identify promising therapeutic targets and biomarkers of the earliest synaptic dysfunction in AD, it will be necessary to join efforts in further dissecting the mechanisms used by Aβ and by LOAD genes to disrupt synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Resveratrol Derivatives as Potential Treatments for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive loss of neurons in different regions of the nervous system. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are the two most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, and the symptoms associated with these pathologies are closely related to the regions that are most affected by the process of neurodegeneration. Despite their high prevalence, currently, there is no cure or disease-modifying drugs for the treatment of these conditions. In the last decades, due to the need for the development of new treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, several authors have investigated the neuroprotective actions of naturally occurring molecules, such as resveratrol. Resveratrol is a stilbene found in several plants, including grapes, blueberries, raspberries, and peanuts. Studies have shown that resveratrol presents neuroprotective actions in experimental models of AD and PD, however, its clinical application is limited due to its rapid metabolism and low bioavailability. In this context, studies have proposed that structural changes in the resveratrol molecule, including glycosylation, alkylation, halogenation, hydroxylation, methylation, and prenylation could lead to the development of derivatives with enhanced bioavailability and pharmacological activity. Therefore, this review article aims to discuss how resveratrol derivatives could represent viable molecules in the search for new drugs for the treatment of AD and PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Unlike in the healthy mammalian retina, macrophages in retinal degenerative states are not solely comprised of microglia but may include monocyte-derived recruits. Recent studies have applied transgenics, lineage-tracing, and transcriptomics to help decipher the distinct roles of these two cell types in the disease settings of inherited retinal degenerations and age-related macular degeneration. Literature discussed here focuses on the ectopic presence of both macrophage types in the extracellular site surrounding the outer aspect of photoreceptor cells (i.e., the subretinal space), which is crucially involved in the pathobiology.</description>

The activation process of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has been extensively studied, both experimentally and computationally. In particular, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations have proven useful in exploring GPCR conformational space. The typical behaviour of class A GPCRs, when subjected to unbiased MD simulations from their crystallized inactive state, is to fluctuate between inactive and intermediate(s) conformations, even with bound agonist. Fully active conformation(s) are rarely stabilized unless a G protein is also bound. Despite several crystal structures of the adenosine A2a receptor (A2aR) having been resolved in complex with co-crystallized agonists and G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; protein, its agonist-mediated activation process is still not completely understood. In order to thoroughly examine the conformational landscape of A2aR activation, we performed unbiased microsecond-length MD simulations in quadruplicate, starting from the inactive conformation either in apo or with bound agonists: endogenous adenosine or synthetic NECA, embedded in two homogeneous phospholipid membranes: 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoglycerol (DOPG) or 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (DOPC). In DOPC with bound adenosine or NECA, we observe transition to an intermediate receptor conformation consistent with the known adenosine-bound crystal state. In apo state in DOPG, two different intermediate conformations are obtained. One is similar to that observed with bound adenosine in DOPC, while the other is closer to the active state but not yet fully active. Exclusively, in DOPG with bound adenosine or NECA, we reproducibly identify receptor conformations with fully active features, which are able to dock G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; protein. These different receptor conformations can be attributed to the action/absence of agonist and phospholipid-mediated allosteric effects on the intracellular side of the receptor.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NukOdQKdP7w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Metabolism plays an essential role in cell fate decisions. However, the methods used for metabolic characterization and for finding potential metabolic regulators are still based on characterizing cellular metabolic steady-state which is dependent on the extracellular environment. In this work, we hypothesized that the response dynamics of intracellular metabolic pools to extracellular stimuli is controlled in a cell type-specific manner. We applied principles of process dynamics and control to human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) and human neural stem cells (hNSC) subjected to a sudden extracellular glutamine step. The fold-changes of steady-states and the transient profiles of metabolic pools revealed that dynamic responses were reproducible and cell type-specific. Importantly, many amino acids had conserved dynamics and readjusted their steady state concentration in response to the increased glutamine influx. Overall, we propose a novel methodology for systematic metabolic characterization and identification of potential metabolic regulators.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Vf2lqiKUr80&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The metabolic responses of bacteria to dynamic extracellular conditions drives not only the behavior of single species, but also entire communities of microbes. Over the last decade, genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions have assisted in our appreciation of important metabolic determinants of bacterial physiology. These network models have been a powerful force in understanding the metabolic capacity that species may utilize in order to succeed in an environment. Increasingly, an understanding of context-specific metabolism is critical for elucidating metabolic drivers of larger phenotypes and disease. However, previous approaches to use network models in concert with omics data to better characterize experimental systems have met challenges due to assumptions necessary by the various integration platforms or due to large input data requirements. With these challenges in mind, we developed RIPTiDe (Reaction Inclusion by Parsimony and Transcript Distribution) which uses both transcriptomic abundances and parsimony of overall flux to identify the most cost-effective usage of metabolism that also best reflects the cell’s investments into transcription. Additionally, in biological samples where it is difficult to quantify specific growth conditions, it becomes critical to develop methods that require lower amounts of user intervention in order to generate accurate metabolic predictions. Utilizing a metabolic network reconstruction for the model organism &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; str. K-12 substr. MG1655 (iJO1366), we found that RIPTiDe correctly identifies context-specific metabolic pathway activity without supervision or knowledge of specific media conditions. We also assessed the application of RIPTiDe to &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; metatranscriptomic data where &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; was present at high abundances, and found that our approach also effectively predicts metabolic behaviors of host-associated bacteria. In the setting of human health, understanding metabolic changes within bacteria in environments where growth substrate availability is difficult to quantify can have large downstream impacts on our ability to elucidate molecular drivers of disease-associated dysbiosis across the microbiota. Our results indicate that RIPTiDe may have potential to provide understanding of context-specific metabolism of bacteria within complex communities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O_WMeLH3KF0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

As biodiversity loss continues to accelerate, there is a critical need for education and biomonitoring across the globe. Portable technologies allow for in situ molecular biodiversity monitoring that has been historically out of reach for many researchers in habitat nations. In the realm of education, portable tools such as DNA sequencers facilitate in situ hands-on training in real-time sequencing and interpretation techniques. Here, we provide step-by-step protocols as a blueprint for a terrestrial conservation genetics field training program that uses low-cost, portable devices to conduct genomics-based training directly in biodiverse habitat countries.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/5UHGG07zPE8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Encouragement of students across all communities through scientific outreach programs is critical to engaging the next generation, exciting young minds to pursue careers in science and medicine. Herein, we present a uniquely structured and widely influential science outreach program. Founded in 2005, the Duke Chemistry Outreach (DCO) employs a pedagogical approach to outreach that aims to teach its audience a new scientific concept, while instilling a pure enjoyment of science. DCO has performed 583 events reaching over 70,000 participants throughout 2,270 hours, with the majority of events in Durham, the surrounding North Carolinian communities, and across 8 other states. The flexibility and diversity of this outreach program creates a framework amendable for others to adopt in both secondary and higher education settings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qXtW92bkbuE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The number and function of synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) tightly regulates excitatory synaptic transmission. Current evidence suggests that AMPARs are inserted into the postsynaptic membrane during long-term potentiation (LTP) and are removed from the membrane during long-term depression (LTD). Dephosphorylation of GluA1 at Ser-845 and enhanced endocytosis are critical events in the modulation of LTD. Moreover, changes in scaffold proteins from the postsynaptic density (PSD) could be also related to AMPAR regulation in LTD. In the present study we analyzed the effect of chemical LTD (cLTD) on A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP)150 and AMPARs levels in mouse-cultured neurons. We show that cLTD induces AKAP150 protein degradation via proteasome, coinciding with GluA1 dephosphorylation at Ser-845 and endocytosis of GluA1-containing AMPARs. Pharmacological inhibition of proteasome activity, but not phosphatase calcineurin (CaN), reverted cLTD-induced AKAP150 protein degradation. Importantly, AKAP150 silencing induced dephosphorylation of GluA1 Ser-845 and GluA1-AMPARs endocytosis while AKAP150 overexpression blocked cLTD-mediated GluA1-AMPARs endocytosis. Our results provide direct evidence that cLTD-induced AKAP150 degradation by the proteasome contributes to synaptic AMPARs endocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Circulating MicroRNAs as Diagnostic Biomarkers for Motor Neuron Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00354</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Motor neuron disease (MND) is a kind of neurodegenerative disease that selectively invades spinal cord anterior horn cells, brainstem motor neurons, cortical pyramidal cells and the pyramidal tract. The main clinical features are the symptoms and signs of impaired upper and lower motor neurons, manifested as muscle weakness, atrophy and pyramidal tract signs. Histopathology has shown the disappearance of pyramidal cells in the motor cortex, loss of motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and brainstem, and degeneration of the corticospinal tract. Due to the lack of effective treatment methods, the prognosis is generally poor, so it is of great significance to confirm the diagnosis early by various means. However, the current diagnosis of MND mainly relies on the combination of clinical manifestations and neurophysiological examinations, lacking effective means of early diagnosis. Circulating microRNA (CmiRNA) is a kind of stable miRNA molecule in serum, plasma and other body fluids, which has the characteristics of distinct differential expression, sensitive detection and convenient sample collection. As a possible new biomarker of MND, CmiRNA can not only reveal the pathophysiological process of MND, but also monitor disease progression and response to drug therapy. With the development of miRNA detection technology, more and more CmiRNAs as biomarkers with potential diagnostic value have been investigated. In this review, we explored the possibility of circulating samples as different sources of biomarkers for the diagnosis of MND, analyzing the progress of CmiRNA detection techniques, and presenting potential diagnostic MND biomarkers that have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Genetic Association Between Alzheimer’s Disease Risk Variant of the PICALM Gene and EEG Functional Connectivity in Non-demented Adults</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified and validated the association of the PICALM genotype with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The PICALM rs3851179 A allele is thought to have a protective effect, whereas the G allele appears to confer risk for AD. The influence of the PICALM genotype on brain functional connectivity in non-demented subjects remains largely unknown. We examined the association of the PICALM rs3851179 genotype with the characteristics of lagged linear connectivity (LLC) of resting EEG sources in 104 non-demented adults younger than 60 years of age. The EEG analysis was performed using exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA) freeware (Pascual-Marqui et al., 2011). We found that the carriers of the A PICALM allele (PICALM AA and AG genotypes) had higher widespread interhemispheric LLC of alpha sources compared to the carriers of the GG PICALM allele. An exploratory correlation analysis showed a moderate positive association between the alpha LLC interhemispheric characteristics and the corpus callosum size and between the alpha interhemispheric LLC characteristics and the Luria word memory scores. These results suggest that the PICALM rs3851179 A allele provides protection against cognitive decline by facilitating neurophysiological reserve capacities in non-demented adults. In contrast, lower functional connectivity in carriers of the AD risk variant, PICALM GG, suggests early functional alterations in alpha rhythm networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Pushing the Limits of EEG: Estimation of Large-Scale Functional Brain Networks and Their Dynamics Validated by Simultaneous fMRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00323</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00323</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the technique of choice for detecting large-scale functional brain networks and to investigate their dynamics. Because fMRI measures brain activity indirectly, electroencephalography (EEG) has been recently considered a feasible tool for detecting such networks, particularly the resting-state networks (RSNs). However, a truly unbiased validation of such claims is still missing, which can only be accomplished by using simultaneously acquired EEG and fMRI data, due to the spontaneous nature of the activity underlying the RSNs. Additionally, EEG is still poorly explored for the purpose of mapping task-specific networks, and no studies so far have been focused on investigating networks’ dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) with EEG. Here, we started by validating RSNs derived from the continuous reconstruction of EEG sources by directly comparing them with those derived from simultaneous fMRI data of 10 healthy participants, and obtaining an average overlap (quantified by the Dice coefficient) of 0.4. We also showed the ability of EEG to map the facial expressions processing network (FEPN), highlighting regions near the posterior superior temporal sulcus, where the FEPN is anchored. Then, we measured the dFC using EEG for the first time in this context, estimated dFC brain states using dictionary learning, and compared such states with those obtained from the fMRI. We found a statistically significant match between fMRI and EEG dFC states, and determined the existence of two matched dFC states which contribution over time was associated with the brain activity at the FEPN, showing that the dynamics of FEPN can be captured by both fMRI and EEG. Our results push the limits of EEG toward being used as a brain imaging tool, while supporting the growing literature on EEG correlates of (dynamic) functional connectivity measured with fMRI, and providing novel insights into the coupling mechanisms underlying the two imaging techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Downregulation of eEF1A/EFT3-4 Enhances Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration After 6-OHDA Exposure in C. elegans Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the aggregation of α-synuclein protein and selective death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Although the molecular pathogenesis of PD is not completely understood, a recent study has reported that eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) declined in the PD-affected brain. Therefore, the roles of eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 in the prevention of DA neuronal cell death in PD are aimed to be investigated. Herein, by using Caenorhabditis elegans as a PD model, we investigated the role of eft-3/eft-4, the worm homolog of eEF1A1/eEF1A2, on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced DA neuron degeneration. Our results demonstrated that the expressions of eft-3 and eft-4 were decreased in the 6-OHDA-induced worms. RNA interference (RNAi) of eft-3 and eft-4 resulted in dramatic exacerbation of DA neurodegeneration induced by 6-OHDA, as well as aggravated the food-sensing behavior, ethanol avoidance, and decreased lifespan when compared with only 6-OHDA-induced worms. Moreover, downregulation of eft-3/4 in 6-OHDA-induced worms suppressed the expression of the anti-apoptotic genes, including PI3K/age-1, PDK-1/pdk-1, mTOR/let-363, and AKT-1,2/akt-1,2, promoting the expression of apoptotic genes such as BH3/egl-1 and Caspase-9/ced-3. Collectively, these findings indicate that eEF1A plays an important role in the 6-OHDA-induced neurodegeneration through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine protein kinase (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and that eEF1A isoforms may be a novel and effective pro-survival factor in protective DA neurons against toxin-induced neuronal death.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Music Form but Not Music Experience Modulates Motor Cortical Activity in Response to Novel Music</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;External cues, such as music, improve movement performance in persons with Parkinson’s disease. However, research examining the motor cortical mechanisms by which this occurs is lacking. Research using electroencephalography in healthy young adults has revealed that moving to music can modulate motor cortical activity. Moreover, motor cortical activity is further influenced by music experience. It remains unknown whether these effects extend to corticomotor excitability. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to determine the effects of novel music on corticomotor excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a pilot study of healthy young adults. A secondary aim of this study was to determine the influence of music experience on corticomotor excitability. We hypothesized that corticomotor excitability will change during music conditions, and that it will differ in those with formal music training. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous using single-pulse TMS in three conditions: (1) No Music, (2) Music Condition I, and (3) Music Condition II. Both pieces were set to novel MIDI piano instrumentation and part-writing conventions typical of early nineteenth-century Western classical practices. Results revealed Music Condition II (i.e., more relaxing music) compared to rest increased MEP amplitude (i.e., corticomotor excitability). Music Condition II as compared to Music Condition I (i.e., more activating music) reduced MEP variability (i.e., corticomotor variability). Finally, years of formal music training did not significantly influence corticomotor excitability while listening to music. Overall, results revealed that unfamiliar music modulates motor cortical excitability but is dependent upon the form of music and possibly music preference. These results will be used to inform planned studies in healthy older adults and people with Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Measuring Efficiency of Semi-automated Brain Tumor Segmentation by Simulating User Interaction</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, radiologists have crudely quantified tumor extent by measuring the longest and shortest dimension by dragging a cursor between opposite boundary points across a single image rather than full segmentation of the volumetric extent. For algorithmic-based volumetric segmentation, the degree of radiologist experiential involvement varies from confirming a fully automated segmentation, to making a single drag on an image to initiate semi-automated segmentation, to making multiple drags and clicks on multiple images during interactive segmentation. An experiment was designed to test an algorithm that allows various levels of interaction. Given the ground-truth of the BraTS training data, which delimits the brain tumors of 285 patients on multi-spectral MR, a computer simulation mimicked the process that a radiologist would follow to perform segmentation with real-time interaction. Clicks and drags were placed only where needed in response to the deviation between real-time segmentation results and assumed radiologist's goal, as provided by the ground-truth. Results of accuracy for various levels of interaction are presented along with estimated elapsed time, in order to measure efficiency. Average total elapsed time, including loading the study through confirming 3D contours, was 46 s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Attention is the important ability to flexibly control limited computational resources. It has been studied in conjunction with many other topics in neuroscience and psychology including awareness, vigilance, saliency, executive control, and learning. It has also recently been applied in several domains in machine learning. The relationship between the study of biological attention and its use as a tool to enhance artificial neural networks is not always clear. This review starts by providing an overview of how attention is conceptualized in the neuroscience and psychology literature. It then covers several use cases of attention in machine learning, indicating their biological counterparts where they exist. Finally, the ways in which artificial attention can be further inspired by biology for the production of complex and integrative systems is explored.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: A Computational Theory for the Emergence of Grammatical Categories in Cortical Dynamics</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A general agreement in psycholinguistics claims that syntax and meaning are unified precisely and very quickly during online sentence processing. Although several theories have advanced arguments regarding the neurocomputational bases of this phenomenon, we argue that these theories could potentially benefit by including neurophysiological data concerning cortical dynamics constraints in brain tissue. In addition, some theories promote the integration of complex optimization methods in neural tissue. In this paper we attempt to fill these gaps introducing a computational model inspired in the dynamics of cortical tissue. In our modeling approach, proximal afferent dendrites produce stochastic cellular activations, while distal dendritic branches–on the other hand–contribute independently to somatic depolarization by means of dendritic spikes, and finally, prediction failures produce massive firing events preventing formation of sparse distributed representations. The model presented in this paper combines semantic and coarse-grained syntactic constraints for each word in a sentence context until grammatically related word function discrimination emerges spontaneously by the sole correlation of lexical information from different sources without applying complex optimization methods. By means of support vector machine techniques, we show that the sparse activation features returned by our approach are well suited—bootstrapping from the features returned by Word Embedding mechanisms—to accomplish grammatical function classification of individual words in a sentence. In this way we develop a biologically guided computational explanation for linguistically relevant unification processes in cortex which connects psycholinguistics to neurobiological accounts of language. We also claim that the computational hypotheses established in this research could foster future work on biologically-inspired learning algorithms for natural language processing applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Perivascular Unit: This Must Be the Place. The Anatomical Crossroad Between the Immune, Vascular and Nervous System</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Most neurological disorders seemingly have heterogenous pathogenesis, with overlapping contribution of neuronal, immune and vascular mechanisms of brain injury. The perivascular space in the brain represents a crossroad where those mechanisms interact, as well as a key anatomical component of the recently discovered glymphatic pathway, which is considered to play a crucial role in the clearance of brain waste linked to neurodegenerative diseases. The pathological interplay between neuronal, immune and vascular factors can create an environment that promotes self-perpetration of mechanisms of brain injury across different neurological diseases, including those that are primarily thought of as neurodegenerative, neuroinflammatory or cerebrovascular. Changes of the perivascular space can be monitored in humans in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the context of glymphatic clearance, MRI-visible enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) are considered to reflect glymphatic stasis secondary to the perivascular accumulation of brain debris, although they may also represent an adaptive mechanism of the glymphatic system to clear them. EPVS are also established correlates of dementia and cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and are considered to reflect brain inflammatory activity. In this review, we describe the “perivascular unit” as a key anatomical and functional substrate for the interaction between neuronal, immune and vascular mechanisms of brain injury, which are shared across different neurological diseases. We will describe the main anatomical, physiological and pathological features of the perivascular unit, highlight potential substrates for the interplay between different noxae and summarize MRI studies of EPVS in cerebrovascular, neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are key events in signal transduction since they affect protein function by regulating their abundance and/or activity. PTMs involve the covalent attachment of functional groups to specific amino acids. Since they tend to be generally reversible, PTMs serve as regulators of signal transduction pathways. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major signaling proteins that undergo multiple types of PTMs. In this Review, we focus on the opioid receptors, members of GPCR family A, and highlight recent advances in the field that have underscored the importance of PTMs in the functional regulation of these receptors.</description>

	<description>Recent studies on the effects of sleep deprivation on synaptic plasticity have yielded discrepant results. Sleep deprivation studies using novelty exposure as a means to keep animals awake suggests that sleep (compared with wake) leads to widespread reductions in net synaptic strength. By contrast, sleep deprivation studies using approaches avoiding novelty-induced arousal (i.e., gentle handling) suggest that sleep can promote synaptic growth and strengthening. How can these discrepant findings be reconciled? Here, we discuss how varying methodologies for the experimental disruption of sleep (with differential introduction of novel experiences) could fundamentally alter the experimental outcome with regard to synaptic plasticity.</description>

Evolutionarily conserved mechanisms maintain homeostasis of essential elements, and are believed to be highly time-variant. However, current approaches measure elemental biomarkers at a few discrete time-points, ignoring complex higher-order dynamical features. To study dynamical properties of elemental homeostasis, we apply laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to tooth samples to generate 500 temporally sequential measurements of elemental concentrations from birth to 10 years. We applied dynamical system and Information Theory-based analyses to reveal the longest-known attractor system in mammalian biology underlying the metabolism of nutrient elements, and identify distinct and consistent transitions between stable and unstable states throughout development. Extending these dynamical features to disease prediction, we find that attractor topography of nutrient metabolism is altered in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as early as childhood, suggesting these pathways are involved in disease risk. Mechanistic analysis was undertaken in a transgenic mouse model of ALS, where we find similar marked disruptions in elemental attractor systems as in humans. Our results demonstrate the application of a phenomological analysis of dynamical systems underlying elemental metabolism, and emphasize the utility of these measures in characterizing risk of disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c5YPoxjUguA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Nimodipine reduces dysfunction and demyelination in models of multiple sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25749?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment of relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) has not advanced beyond steroid use, which reduces acute loss of function, but has little effect on residual disability. Acute loss of function in an MS model (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; EAE) is partly due to CNS hypoxia, and function can promptly improve upon breathing oxygen. Here we investigate the cause of the hypoxia and whether it is due to a deficit in oxygen supply arising from impaired vascular perfusion. We also explore whether the CNS‐selective vasodilating agent, nimodipine, may provide a therapy to restore function, and protect from demyelination in two MS models.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of methods have been employed to measure basic cardiovascular physiology, spinal oxygenation, mitochondrial function and tissue perfusion in EAE.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report that the tissue hypoxia in EAE is associated with a profound hypoperfusion of the inflamed spinal cord. Treatment with nimodipine restores spinal oxygenation and can rapidly improve function. Nimodipine therapy also reduces demyelination in both EAE, and a model of the early MS lesion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss of function in EAE, and demyelination in EAE and the model early MS lesion, appear to be due, at least in part, to tissue hypoxia due to local spinal hypoperfusion. Therapy to improve blood flow not only protects neurological function, but also reduces demyelination. We conclude that nimodipine could be repurposed to offer substantial clinical benefit in MS.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eNeuro: Development of Perineuronal Nets during Ontogeny Correlates with Sensorimotor Vocal Learning in Canaries</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0361-19.2020?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Songbirds are a powerful model to study vocal learning given that aspects of the underlying behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms are analogous in many ways to mechanisms involved in speech learning. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) represent one of the mechanisms controlling the closing of sensitive periods for vocal learning in the songbird brain. In zebra finches, PNN develop around parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons in selected song control nuclei during ontogeny and their development is delayed if juveniles are deprived of a tutor. However, song learning in zebra finches takes place during a relatively short period of development, and it is difficult to determine whether PNN development correlates with the end of the sensory or the sensorimotor learning period. Canaries have a longer period of sensorimotor vocal learning, spanning over their first year of life so that it should be easier to test whether PNN development correlates with the end of sensory or sensorimotor vocal learning. Here, we quantified PNN around PV-interneurons in the brain of male canaries from hatching until the first breeding season and analyzed in parallel the development of their song. PNN development around PV-interneurons specifically took place and their number reached its maximum around the end of the sensorimotor learning stage, well after the end of sensory vocal learning, and correlated with song development. This suggests that PNN are specifically involved in the termination of the sensitive period for sensorimotor vocal learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Antiepileptic Drug Teratogenicity and De Novo Genetic Variation Load</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25724?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25724?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms by which antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) cause birth defects (BDs) are unknown. Data suggest that AED‐induced BDs may result from a genome‐wide increase of de novo variants in the embryo, a mechanism that we investigated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole exome sequencing data from child–parent trios were interrogated for de novo single‐nucleotide variants/indels (dnSNVs/indels) and de novo copy number variants (dnCNVs). Generalized linear models were applied to assess de novo variant burdens in children exposed prenatally to AEDs (AED‐exposed children) versus children without BDs not exposed prenatally to AEDs (AED‐unexposed unaffected children), and AED‐exposed children with BDs versus those without BDs, adjusting for confounders. Fisher exact test was used to compare categorical data.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty‐seven child–parent trios were included: 10 with AED‐exposed children with BDs, 46 with AED‐exposed unaffected children, and 11 with AED‐unexposed unaffected children. The dnSNV/indel burden did not differ between AED‐exposed children and AED‐unexposed unaffected children (median dnSNV/indel number/child [range] = 3 [0–7] vs 3 [1–5], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.50). Among AED‐exposed children, there were no significant differences between those with BDs and those unaffected. Likely deleterious dnSNVs/indels were detected in 9 of 67 (13%) children, none of whom had BDs. The proportion of cases harboring likely deleterious dnSNVs/indels did not differ significantly between AED‐unexposed and AED‐exposed children. The dnCNV burden was not associated with AED exposure or birth outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study indicates that prenatal AED exposure does not increase the burden of de novo variants, and that this mechanism is not a major contributor to AED‐induced BDs. These results can be incorporated in routine patient counseling. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Techniques for Obtaining High-quality Recordings in Electrocochleography</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00018</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00018</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There are several technical challenges to obtaining high-quality recordings of cochlear potentials in human electrocochleography (ECochG). These challenges include electrical artifacts from devices such as acoustic transducers, biological artifacts from excessive myogenic and electroencephalographic potentials, and issues associated with the placement of a tympanic membrane (TM) electrode on the eardrum. This article presents approaches for dealing with these challenges for ECochG measurement using a TM electrode. Emphasis is placed on eliminating stimulus artifact, optimizing the placement of the electrode, and comparing a custom-made electrode with a commercially-available electrode. This comparison revealed that the custom-made electrode results in greater subject comfort, superior ease of placing the electrode on the eardrum, and larger compound action potential (CAP) amplitudes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Lysophospholipids and Their G-Coupled Protein Signaling in Alzheimer’s Disease: From Physiological Performance to Pathological Impairment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00058</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00058</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Lysophospholipids (LPLs) are bioactive signaling lipids that are generated from phospholipase-mediated hydrolyzation of membrane phospholipids (PLs) and sphingolipids (SLs). Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are two of the best-characterized LPLs which mediate a variety of cellular physiological responses via specific G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) mediated signaling pathways. Considerable evidence now demonstrates the crucial role of LPA and S1P in neurodegenerative diseases, especially in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Dysfunction of LPA and S1P metabolism can lead to aberrant accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuroinflammation and ultimately neuronal death. Summarizing LPA and S1P signaling profile may aid in profound health and pathological processes. In the current review, we will introduce the metabolism as well as the physiological roles of LPA and S1P in maintaining the normal functions of the nervous system. Given these pivotal functions, we will further discuss the role of dysregulation of LPA and S1P in promoting AD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Circulating Exosomal miRNA as Diagnostic Biomarkers of Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00053</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00053</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a group of diseases caused by chronic and progressive degeneration of neural tissue. The main pathological manifestations are neuronal degeneration and loss in the brain and/or spinal cord. Common NDDs include Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), Huntington disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The complicated pathological characteristics and different clinical manifestations of NDDs result in a lack of sensitive and efficient diagnostic methods. In addition, no sensitive biomarkers are available to monitor the course of NDDs, predict their prognosis, and monitor the therapeutic response. Despite extensive research in recent years, analysis of amyloid β (Aβ) and α-synuclein has failed to effectively improve NDD diagnosis. Although recent studies have indicated circulating miRNAs as promising diagnostic biomarkers of NDDs, the miRNA in the peripheral circulation is susceptible to interference by other components, making circulating miRNA results less consistent. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles with a diameter of approximately 30–100 nm that transport proteins, lipids, mRNA, and miRNA. Because recent studies have shown that exosomes have a double-membrane structure that can resist ribonuclease in the blood, giving exosomal miRNA high stability and making them resistant to degradation, they may become an ideal biomarker of circulating fluids. In this review, we discuss the applicability of circulating exosomal miRNAs as biomarkers, highlight the technical aspects of exosomal miRNA analysis, and review studies that have used circulating exosomal miRNAs as candidate diagnostic biomarkers of NDDs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Activated Protein C Attenuates Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis Progression by Enhancing Vascular Integrity and Suppressing Microglial Activation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00333</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00333</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Activated protein C (APC), a serine protease with antithrombotic effects, protects in animal models of ischemic stroke by suppressing inflammation and enhancing vascular integrity, angiogenesis, neurogenesis and neuroprotection. A small number of animal studies suggest it might also have therapeutic potential in multiple sclerosis (MS), though results have been mixed. Based on these conflicting data, the goals of this study were to clarify the therapeutic potential of APC in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS and to determine mechanistically how APC mediates this protective effect.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The protective potential of APC was examined in a chronic progressive model of EAE. Vascular breakdown, tight junction protein expression and vascular expression of fibronectin and α5β1 integrin as well as vascularity and glial activation were analyzed using immunofluorescence (IF) of spinal cord sections taken from mice with established EAE. The direct influence of APC on microglial activation was evaluated in vitro by a combination of morphology and MMP-9 expression.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;APC attenuated the progression of EAE, and this was strongly associated at the histopathological level with reduced levels of leukocyte infiltration and concomitant demyelination. Further analysis revealed that APC reduced vascular breakdown which was associated with maintained endothelial expression of the tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). In addition, APC suppressed microglial activation in this EAE model and in vitro studies revealed that APC strongly inhibited microglial activation at both the morphological level and by the expression of the pro-inflammatory protease MMP-9.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These findings build on the work of others in demonstrating strong therapeutic potential for APC in the treatment of inflammatory demyelinating disease and suggest that enhancement of vascular integrity and suppression of microglial activation may be important mediators of this protection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Retinal alterations have recently been associated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Rhodopsin is a G-protein coupled receptor found in the rod cells of the retina. As a biomarker associated with retinal thinning and degeneration, it bears potential in the early detection and monitoring of several neurodegenerative diseases. In this review article, we summarize the findings of correlations between rhodopsin and several neurodegenerative disorders as well as the potential of a novel technique, cSLO, in the quantification of rhodopsin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mapping the cytoarchitecture of the whole brain can reveal the organizational logic of neural systems. However, this remains a significant challenge, especially for gyrencephalic brains with a large volume. Here we propose an integrated pipeline for generating a cytoarchitectonic atlas with single-cell resolution of the whole brain. To analyze a large-volume brain, we used a modified en-bloc Nissl staining protocol to achieve uniform staining of large-scale brain specimens from ferret (Mustela putorius furo). By combining whole-brain imaging and big data processing, we established strategies for parsing cytoarchitectural information at a voxel resolution of 0.33 μm × 0.33 μm × 1 μm and terabyte-scale data analysis. Using the cytoarchitectonic datasets for adult ferret brain, we identified giant pyramidal neurons in ferret brains and provide the first report of their morphological diversity, neurochemical phenotype, and distribution patterns in the whole brain in three dimensions. This pipeline will facilitate studies on the organization and development of the mammalian brains, from that of rodents to the gyrencephalic brains of ferret and even primates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A Constrained ICA-EMD Model for Group Level fMRI Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00221</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00221</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Independent component analysis (ICA), being a data-driven method, has been shown to be a powerful tool for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis. One drawback of this multivariate approach is that it is not, in general, compatible with the analysis of group data. Various techniques have been proposed to overcome this limitation of ICA. In this paper, a novel ICA-based workflow for extracting resting-state networks from fMRI group studies is proposed. An empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is used, in a data-driven manner, to generate reference signals that can be incorporated into a constrained version of ICA (cICA), thereby eliminating the inherent ambiguities of ICA. The results of the proposed workflow are then compared to those obtained by a widely used group ICA approach for fMRI analysis. In this study, we demonstrate that intrinsic modes, extracted by EMD, are suitable to serve as references for cICA. This approach yields typical resting-state patterns that are consistent over subjects. By introducing these reference signals into the ICA, our processing pipeline yields comparable activity patterns across subjects in a mathematically transparent manner. Our approach provides a user-friendly tool to adjust the trade-off between a high similarity across subjects and preserving individual subject features of the independent components.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Cue Valence Influences the Effects of Cue Uncertainty on ERP Responses to Emotional Events</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00140</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Individuals often predict consequences, particularly emotional consequences, according to emotional or non-emotional signals conveyed by environmental cues (i.e., emotional and non-emotional cues, respectively). Some of these cues signify the consequences with certainty (i.e., certain cues), whereas others do not (i.e., uncertain cues). Several event-related potential (ERP) studies regarding non-emotional cues have suggested that the effects of cue uncertainty on attention to emotional events occur in both perception and evaluation processes. However, due to the limitations of previous studies, it is unclear what the effects of cue uncertainty would be in an emotional cue condition. Moreover, it is uncertain whether the effects of cue uncertainty are affected by cue valence (i.e., emotional and non-emotional cues). To address these questions, we asked participants to view cues and then to view emotional (positive or negative) pictures. The cues either did or did not indicate the emotional content of the picture. In the emotional cue condition, happy and fearful faces were used as certain cues indicating upcoming positive and negative pictures, respectively, and neutral faces were used as uncertain cues. In the non-emotional cue condition, scrambled faces outlined in red and blue indicated upcoming positive and negative pictures, respectively, and scrambled faces outlined in green served as uncertain cues. The results showed that for negative pictures, ERP responses in a time range between 60 and 1,000 ms were shifted to a more negative direction in a certain condition than in the uncertain condition when the cues were emotional. However, the effect was the reverse for positive pictures. This effect of cue uncertainty was similar in the non-emotional cue—negative condition. In contrast, there was no effect of cue uncertainty in the non-emotional cue—positive condition. Therefore, the findings indicate that cue uncertainty modulates attention toward emotional events when the events are signified by emotional cues. The findings may also suggest that cue valence modulates the effects of cue uncertainty on attention to emotional events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Processing Mechanism of Mental Calculation Based on Cerebral Oscillatory Changes: A Comparison Between Abacus Experts and Novices</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00137</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00137</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Abacus experts could mentally calculate fast some mathematical operations using multi-digit numbers. The temporal dynamics of abacus mental calculation are still unknown although some behavioral and neuroimaging studies have suggested a visuospatial and visuomotor neural process during abacus mental calculation. Therefore, this contribution aims to clarify the significant similarities and the differences between experts and novices by investigating calculation-induced neuromagnetic responses based on cerebral oscillatory changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twelve to 13 healthy abacus experts and 17 non-experts participated in two experimental paradigms using non-invasive neuromagnetic measurements. In experiments 1 and 2, the spatial distribution of oscillatory changes presented mental calculations and temporal frequency profiles during addition while examining multiplication tasks. The MEG data were analyzed using synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) with an adaptive beamformer to calculate the group average of the spatial distribution of oscillatory changes and their temporal frequency profiles in source-level analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Using a group average of the spatial distribution of oscillatory changes, we observed some common brain activities in both right-handed abacus experts and non-experts. In non-experts, we detected the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral Intraparietal sulcus (IPS); whereas in experts, detected the bilateral parieto-occipital sulcus (POS), right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and left sensorimotor areas mainly. Based on the findings generated, we could propose calculation processing models for both abacus experts and non- experts conveniently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The proposed model of calculation processing in abacus experts and novices revealed that the novices could calculate logically depending on numerical processing in the left IPS. In contrast, abacus experts are utilizing spatial processing using a memorized imaginary abacus, which distributed over the bilateral hemispheres in the IFG and sensorimotor areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Processing False Beliefs in Preschool Children and Adults: Developing a Set of Custom Tasks to Test the Theory of Mind in Neuroimaging and Behavioral Research</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The theory of mind (ToM) is the ability to attribute mental states to others and is extremely important for social functioning. It has been widely examined in both behavioral and neuroimaging research, usually with the use of the many versions of the false-belief (FB) task. However, there is still not enough evidence from studies on the neurodevelopmental mechanisms of ToM mostly because of methodological limitations: lack of selectivity, mismatch of experimental and control tasks, and focusing on participants older than 6 years old. In the current study, we attempted to develop a computerized tool for ToM assessment suitable for both behavioral and neuriomaging testing in preschoolers. We designed a version of the classic change-of-location task with custom visuals and three fine-tuned conditions: FB, true-belief, and no-belief (NB). The usability of the task for further application in neurodevelopmental research was tested with three methods: first, behaviorally, with the use of a touch screen on a group of 75 children, followed by a functional MRI (fMRI) study on 13 adults, and a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) study on 19 preschool children. In line with our expectations, on the behavioral level, our task elicited the all-or-none performance in preschoolers. There was also a progression of performance with age in the FB condition. On the neural level, we observed the activation of structures involved in the ToM brain network in response to our task in both adults and children. The results therefore suggest that our task can be a useful tool for studying ToM development and its neural underpinnings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain-Based Binary Communication Using Spatiotemporal Features of fNIRS Responses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00113</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;“Locked-in” patients lose their ability to communicate naturally due to motor system dysfunction. Brain-computer interfacing offers a solution for their inability to communicate by enabling motor-independent communication. Straightforward and convenient in-session communication is essential in clinical environments. The present study introduces a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based binary communication paradigm that requires limited preparation time and merely nine optodes. Eighteen healthy participants performed two mental imagery tasks, mental drawing and spatial navigation, to answer yes/no questions during one of two auditorily cued time windows. Each of the six questions was answered five times, resulting in five trials per answer. This communication paradigm thus combines both spatial (two different mental imagery tasks, here mental drawing for “yes” and spatial navigation for “no”) and temporal (distinct time windows for encoding a “yes” and “no” answer) fNIRS signal features for information encoding. Participants’ answers were decoded in simulated real-time using general linear model analysis. Joint analysis of all five encoding trials resulted in an average accuracy of 66.67 and 58.33% using the oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR) hemoglobin signal respectively. For half of the participants, an accuracy of 83.33% or higher was reached using either the HbO signal or the HbR signal. For four participants, effective communication with 100% accuracy was achieved using either the HbO or HbR signal. An explorative analysis investigated the differentiability of the two mental tasks based solely on spatial fNIRS signal features. Using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) group single-trial accuracies of 58.33% (using 20 training trials per task) and 60.56% (using 40 training trials per task) could be obtained. Combining the five trials per run using a majority voting approach heightened these MVPA accuracies to 62.04 and 75%. Additionally, an fNIRS suitability questionnaire capturing participants’ physical features was administered to explore its predictive value for evaluating general data quality. Obtained questionnaire scores correlated significantly (r = -0.499) with the signal-to-noise of the raw light intensities. While more work is needed to further increase decoding accuracy, this study shows the potential of answer encoding using spatiotemporal fNIRS signal features or spatial fNIRS signal features only.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Pregabalin as a Pain Therapeutic: Beyond Calcium Channels</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00083</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00083</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Initially developed to generate new treatments for epilepsy, gabapentin, and pregabalin (“gabapentinoids”) were engineered to mimic the action of GABA and to modulate GABA metabolism. Rather than their intended pharmacological action on GABA neurotransmission, instead, they exhibit a high affinity for the α2δ-1 and α2δ-2 subunits of voltage-activated calcium channels, wherein binding of gabapentinoids inhibits cellular calcium influx and attenuates neurotransmission. Despite a lack of activity on GABA levels, gabapentin and pregabalin are effective at suppressing seizures and subsequently approved as a new class of antiepileptic therapy for partial-onset epilepsy. Through the same hypothesized molecular mechanism and by controlling neuronal hyperexcitability, gabapentinoids demonstrate clear efficacy in pain management, which has arguably been their most extensively prescribed application to date. In this review, we focus on pregabalin as a second-generation gabapentinoid widely employed in the treatment of a variety of pain conditions. We also discuss the wider functional roles of α2δ subunits and the contributions that pregabalin might play in affecting physiological and pathophysiological processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Role of BDNF on Neural Plasticity in Depression</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00082</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00082</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Using behavioral, pharmacological, and molecular methods, lots of studies reveal that depression is closely related to the abnormal neural plasticity processes occurring in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system such as the hippocampus and amygdala. Meanwhile, functions of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the other neurotrophins in the pathogenesis of depression are well known. The maladaptive neuroplastic in depression may be related to alterations in the levels of neurotrophic factors, which play a central role in plasticity. Enhancement of neurotrophic factors signaling has great potential in therapy for depression. This review highlights the relevance of neurotrophic factors mediated neural plasticity and pathophysiology of depression. These studies reviewed here may suggest new possible targets for antidepressant drugs such as neurotrophins, their receptors, and relevant signaling pathways, and agents facilitating the activation of gene expression and increasing the transcription of neurotrophic factors in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: How Human Is Human Connectional Neuroanatomy?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The structure of the human brain has been studied extensively. Despite all the knowledge accrued, direct information about connections, from origin to termination, in the human brain is extremely limited. Yet there is a widespread misperception that human connectional neuroanatomy is well-established and validated. In this article, we consider what is known directly about human structural and connectional neuroanatomy. Information on neuroanatomical connections in the human brain is derived largely from studies in non-human experimental models in which the entire connectional pathway, including origins, course, and terminations, is directly visualized. Techniques to examine structural connectivity in the human brain are progressing rapidly; nevertheless, our present understanding of such connectivity is limited largely to data derived from homological comparisons, particularly with non-human primates. We take the position that an in-depth and more precise understanding of human connectional neuroanatomy will be obtained by a systematic application of this homological approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this review article, we will describe the recent advances made towards understanding the molecular and cell biological mechanisms of electrical synapse formation. New evidence indicates that electrical synapses, which are gap junctions between neurons, can have complex molecular compositions including protein asymmetries across joined cells, diverse morphological arrangements, and overlooked similarities with other junctions, all of which indicate new potential roles in neurodevelopmental disease. Aquatic organisms, and in particular the vertebrate zebrafish, have proven to be excellent models for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of electrical synapse formation. Zebrafish will serve as our main exemplar throughout this review and will be compared with other model organisms. We highlight the known cell biological processes that build neuronal gap junctions and compare these with the assemblies of adherens junctions, tight junctions, non-neuronal gap junctions, and chemical synapses to explore the unknown frontiers remaining in our understanding of the critical and ubiquitous electrical synapse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Serum Magnesium and Cognitive Function Among Qatari Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00101</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00101</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Previous studies found that low blood magnesium increases the risk of several diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diabetes, and hypertension. These ailments are associated with declined cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: We aimed to examine the association between serum magnesium and cognitive function among Qatari adults. In addition, we assessed the interaction relation between low serum magnesium, hypertension, and diabetes in relation to cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Data from 1,000 Qatari participants aged ≥20 years old who participated in the Qatar Biobank (QBB) Study were analyzed. Serum magnesium was measured by an automated calorimetric method and suboptimal magnesium was characterized by &amp;lt;0.85 mmol/l. Cognitive function was determined by measuring the mean reaction time (MRT) based on a computer-based, self-administered test. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine the relation between serum magnesium concentrations and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The prevalence of suboptimal magnesium was 57.1%. Across the four quartiles of serum magnesium from the lowest to the highest, the regression coefficients (95% CI) for MRT were 0 (reference), −17.8, −18.3, and −31.9 (95% CI 2.4–3.1; p for trend 0.05). The presence of hypertension and diabetes significantly increased the MRT. Women with suboptimal magnesium and hypertension had the highest MRT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The prevalence of suboptimal magnesium is high in Qatar. There was a direct association between serum magnesium and cognitive function. Low magnesium concentrations were associated with a longer MRT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: A New Rat Model of Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion Resulting in Early-Stage Vascular Cognitive Impairment</title>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Currently, most models of vascular cognitive impairment are established by occluding the carotid arteries uni- or bilaterally to reduce the cerebral blood flow mimicking chronic cerebral hypoxia. Due to the sudden blood flow interruption, a gradual narrowing of the carotid artery cannot be completely imitated. This paper aims to establish a bilateral carotid stenosis model with mild cognitive dysfunction and mild white matter changes to simulate patients with vascular predementia.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Aged Wistar rats (18 months old) underwent either bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) or occlusion (BCAO) surgery or a sham operation (control group). The cerebral blood flow in the frontal cortex was measured using Doppler flowmetry. Thirty days after surgery, cognitive function impairments were determined with the Morris water maze; cerebral magnetic resonance imaging was performed to detect changes in fractional anisotropy to assess white matter injuries, and histological studies were performed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The aged rats in the BCAS group showed a more gradual cerebral blood flow reduction and a lower mortality rate (11%) compared to rats in the BCAO group. The water maze test revealed a more marginal impairment affecting spatial learning and memory in rats with BCAS than in rats with BCAO. Diffusion tensor imaging detected white matter injuries in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of BCAS rats. Particularly, a small portion of nerve fibers of the lateral somatosensory cortex was significantly different between rats of the BCAO and BCAS groups. In the BCAS group, the microscopic structure of the hippocampal CA1 region changed slightly after 30 days and sustained a slight mitochondrial crista crack. Fluorescence staining indicated that the number of GFAP-positive cells was increased in rat brains of the BCAS group, and this phenomenon was even more pronounced in the BCAO group. The hnRNPA2/B1 and GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R-α1 expression levels were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of rats with BCAS compared to those of controls.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Severe bilateral carotid stenosis induced mild cognitive dysfunction and slight structural changes in the brains of aged rats. Thus, a chronic cerebral hypoperfusion model was successfully established.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hypertension is recognized as a risk factor for Alzheimer disease, but the causal link remains undetermined. Although astrocytes and microglia play an important role in maintaining the neurovascular unit, astrocytes and microglia have been understudied in comorbid models of hypertension and Alzheimer disease. In this study, male transgenic Fischer 344 rats (TgAPP21) overexpressing a pathogenic human amyloid precursor protein received 8 weeks of Angiotensin II infusion to increase blood pressure, and the rats were evaluated for astrocytosis, microgliosis, and cognitive function. A linear relationship between astrocytosis and blood pressure was observed in the corpus callosum and cingulum of wildtype rats, with hypertensive wildtype rats matching the elevated baseline astrocytosis seen in normotensive transgenic rats. In contrast, hypertensive transgenic rats did not demonstrate a further increase of astrocytosis, suggesting a deficient response. Angiotensin II infusion did not affect activation of microglia, which were elevated in the white matter and hippocampus of transgenic rats. Angiotensin II infusion did impair both wildtype and transgenic rats’ executive functions in the Morris Water Maze. These results present important implications for the interaction between hypertension and pathogenic human amyloid precursor protein expression, as Angiotensin II infusion produced cognitive impairments in both genotypes, but transgenic rats were additionally impaired in developing a normal astrocytic response to elevated blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>A number of prenatal experiences are associated with adverse outcomes after birth, ranging from cardiovascular problems to psychiatric disease. Prenatal stress is associated with neurodevelopmental alterations that persist after birth and manifest at the behavioral level, for example, increased fearfulness, and at the physiological one, that is, brain structural and functional changes. Understanding the mechanisms that drive these lasting effects may help in preventing long-term negative outcomes of prenatal stress.</description>

	<description>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a largely heritable, multistage prenatal disorder that impacts a child’s ability to perceive and react to social information. Most ASD risk genes are expressed prenatally in many ASD-relevant brain regions and fall into two categories: broadly expressed regulatory genes that are expressed in the brain and other organs, and brain-specific genes. In trimesters one to three (Epoch-1), one set of broadly expressed (the majority) and brain-specific risk genes disrupts cell proliferation, neurogenesis, migration, and cell fate, while in trimester three and early postnatally (Epoch-2) another set (the majority being brain specific) disrupts neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and the ‘wiring’ of the cortex.</description>

Historically, the majority of statistical association methods have been designed assuming availability of SNP-level information. However, modern genetic and sequencing data present new challenges to access and sharing of genotype-phenotype datasets, including cost of management, difficulties in consolidation of records across research groups, etc. These issues make methods based on SNP-level summary statistics particularly appealing. The most common form of combining statistics is a sum of SNP-level squared scores, possibly weighted, as in burden tests for rare variants. The overall significance of the resulting statistic is evaluated using its distribution under the null hypothesis. Here, we demonstrate that this basic approach can be substantially improved by decorrelating scores prior to their addition, resulting in remarkable power gains in situations that are most commonly encountered in practice; namely, under heterogeneity of effect sizes and diversity between pairwise LD. In these situations, the power of the traditional test, based on the added squared scores, quickly reaches a ceiling, as the number of variants increases. Thus, the traditional approach does not benefit from information potentially contained in any additional SNPs, while our decorrelation by orthogonal transformation (DOT) method yields steady gain in power. We present theoretical and computational analyses of both approaches, and reveal causes behind sometimes dramatic difference in their respective powers. We showcase DOT by analyzing breast cancer and cleft lip data, in which our method strengthened levels of previously reported associations and implied the possibility of multiple new alleles that jointly confer disease risk.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tWoupzt8V7I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: ScalaFlux: A scalable approach to quantify fluxes in metabolic subnetworks</title>

&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-metabolic flux analysis (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-MFA) allows metabolic fluxes to be quantified in living organisms and is a major tool in biotechnology and systems biology. Current &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-MFA approaches model label propagation starting from the extracellular &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-labeled nutrient(s), which limits their applicability to the analysis of pathways close to this metabolic entry point. Here, we propose a new approach to quantify fluxes through any metabolic subnetwork of interest by modeling label propagation directly from the metabolic precursor(s) of this subnetwork. The flux calculations are thus purely based on information from within the subnetwork of interest, and no additional knowledge about the surrounding network (such as atom transitions in upstream reactions or the labeling of the extracellular nutrient) is required. This approach, termed ScalaFlux for SCALAble metabolic FLUX analysis, can be scaled up from individual reactions to pathways to sets of pathways. ScalaFlux has several benefits compared with current &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-MFA approaches: greater network coverage, lower data requirements, independence from cell physiology, robustness to gaps in data and network information, better computational efficiency, applicability to rich media, and enhanced flux identifiability. We validated ScalaFlux using a theoretical network and simulated data. We also used the approach to quantify fluxes through the prenyl pyrophosphate pathway of &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; mutants engineered to produce phytoene, using a dataset for which fluxes could not be calculated using existing approaches. A broad range of metabolic systems can be targeted with minimal cost and effort, making ScalaFlux a valuable tool for the analysis of metabolic fluxes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/i5lyyQXk8Fc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A molecular odorant transduction model and the complexity of spatio-temporal encoding in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; antenna</title>

Over the past two decades, substantial amount of work has been conducted to characterize different odorant receptors, neuroanatomy and odorant response properties of the early olfactory system of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. Yet many odorant receptors remain only partially characterized, and the odorant transduction process and the axon hillock spiking mechanism of the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) have yet to be fully determined. Identity and concentration, two key characteristics of the space of odorants, are encoded by the odorant transduction process. Detailed molecular models of the odorant transduction process are, however, scarce for fruit flies. To address these challenges we advance a comprehensive model of fruit fly OSNs as a cascade consisting of an odorant transduction process (OTP) and a biophysical spike generator (BSG). We model odorant identity and concentration using an odorant-receptor binding rate tensor, modulated by the odorant concentration profile, and an odorant-receptor dissociation rate tensor, and quantitatively describe the mechanics of the molecular ligand binding/dissociation of the OTP. We model the BSG as a Connor-Stevens point neuron. The resulting spatio-temporal encoding model of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; antenna provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the neural code of both odorant identity and odorant concentration and advances the state-of-the-art in a number of ways. First, it quantifies on the molecular level the spatio-temporal level of complexity of the transformation taking place in the antennae. The concentration-dependent spatio-temporal code at the output of the antenna circuits determines the level of complexity of olfactory processing in the downstream neuropils, such as odorant recognition and olfactory associative learning. Second, the model is biologically validated using multiple electrophysiological recordings. Third, the model demonstrates that the currently available data for odorant-receptor responses only enable the estimation of the affinity of the odorant-receptor pairs. The odorant-dissociation rate is only available for a few odorant-receptor pairs. Finally, our model calls for new experiments for massively identifying the odorant-receptor dissociation rates of relevance to flies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FlzLSYrp04s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Small lesions of the dorsal or ventral hippocampus subregions are associated with distinct impairments in working memory and reference memory retrieval, and combining them attenuates the acquisition rate of spatial reference memory</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of the hippocampus in spatial learning is well established, but the precise relative contributions by the dorsal (septal) and ventral (temporal) subregions remain unresolved. One debate revolves around the extent to which the ventral hippocampus contributes to spatial navigation and learning. Here, separate small subtotal lesions of dorsal hippocampus or ventral hippocampus alone (destroying 18.9 and 28.5% of total hippocampal volume, respectively) spared reference memory acquisition in the water maze. By contrast, combining the two subtotal lesions significantly reduced the rate of acquisition across days. This constitutes evidence for synergistic integration between dorsal and ventral hippocampus in mice. Evidence that ventral hippocampus contributes to spatial/navigation learning also emerged early on during the retention probe test as search preference was reduced in mice with ventral lesions alone or combined lesions. The small ventral lesions also led to anxiolysis in the elevated plus maze and over‐generalization of the conditioned freezing response to a neutral context. Similar effects of comparable magnitudes were seen in mice with combined lesions, suggesting that they were largely due to the small ventral damage. By contrast, small dorsal lesions were uniquely associated with a severe spatial working memory deficit in the water maze. Taken together, both dorsal and ventral poles of the hippocampus contribute to efficient spatial navigation in mice: While the integrity of dorsal hippocampus is necessary for spatial working memory, the acquisition and retrieval of spatial reference memory are modulated by the ventral hippocampus. Although the impairments following ventral damage (alone or in combination with dorsal damage) were less substantial, a wider spectrum of spatial learning, including context conditioning, was implicated. Our results encourage the search for integrative mechanism between dorsal and ventral hippocampus in spatial learning. Candidate neural substrates may include dorsoventral longitudinal connections and reciprocal modulation via overlapping polysynaptic networks beyond hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Longitudinal assessment of multiple sclerosis with the brain‐age paradigm</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25746?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the natural course of MS, the brain is exposed to ageing as well as disease effects. Brain ageing can be modelled statistically; the so‐called ‘brain‐age’ paradigm. Here, we evaluated whether brain‐predicted age difference (brain‐PAD) was sensitive to the presence of MS, clinical progression and future outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a longitudinal, multi‐centre sample of 3,565 MRI scans, in 1,204 MS and clinically‐isolated syndrome (CIS) patients and 150 healthy controls (mean follow‐up time: patients 3.41 years, healthy controls 1.97 years), we measured ‘brain‐predicted age’ using T1‐weighted MRI. We compared brain‐PAD between MS and CIS patients and healthy controls, and between disease subtypes. Relationships between brain‐PAD and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) were explored.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MS patients had markedly higher brain‐PAD than healthy controls (mean brain‐PAD +10.3 years [95% CI 8.5, 12.1] versus 4.3 years [−2.1, 6.4], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). The highest brain‐PADs were in secondary‐progressive MS (+19.4 years [17.1, 21.9]). Brain‐PAD at study entry predicted time‐to‐disability progression (hazard ratio 1.02 [1.01, 1.03], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001); though normalised brain volume was a stronger predictor. Greater annualised brain‐PAD increases were associated with greater annualised EDSS score (r = 0.26, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain‐age paradigm is sensitive to MS‐related atrophy and clinical progression. A higher brain‐PAD at baseline was associated with more rapid disability progression and the rate of change in brain‐PAD related to worsening disability. Potentially, ‘brain‐age’ could be used as a prognostic biomarker in early‐stage MS, to track disease progression or stratify patients for clinical trial enrolment.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Hippocampus: Cardiorespiratory fitness predicts effective connectivity between the hippocampus and default mode network nodes in young adults</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodent and human studies examining the relationship between aerobic exercise, brain structure, and brain function indicate that the hippocampus (HC), a brain region critical for episodic memory, demonstrates striking plasticity in response to exercise. Beyond the hippocampal memory system, human studies also indicate that aerobic exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are associated with individual differences in large‐scale brain networks responsible for broad cognitive domains. Examining network activity in large‐scale resting‐state brain networks may provide a link connecting the observed relationships between aerobic exercise, hippocampal plasticity, and cognitive enhancement within broad cognitive domains. Previously, CRF has been associated with increased functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN), specifically in older adults. However, how CRF relates to the magnitude and directionality of connectivity, or effective connectivity, between the HC and other DMN nodes remains unknown. We used resting‐state fMRI and conditional Granger causality analysis (CGCA) to test the hypothesis that CRF positively predicts effective connectivity between the HC and other DMN nodes in healthy young adults. Twenty‐six participants (ages 18–35 years) underwent a treadmill test to determine CRF by estimating its primary determinant, maximal oxygen uptake (V&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2max&lt;/sub&gt;), and a 10‐min resting‐state fMRI scan to examine DMN effective connectivity. We identified the DMN using group independent component analysis and examined effective connectivity between nodes using CGCA. Linear regression analyses demonstrated that CRF significantly predicts causal influence from the HC to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and lateral temporal cortex and to the HC from the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. The observed relationship between CRF and hippocampal effective connectivity provides a link between the rodent literature, which demonstrates a relationship between aerobic exercise and hippocampal plasticity, and the human literature, which demonstrates a relationship between aerobic exercise and CRF and the enhancement of broad cognitive domains including, but not limited to, memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Hippocampal gamma rhythms during Y‐maze navigation in the juvenile rat</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neurobiology of postnatal hippocampal development in rodents is receiving increased attention as a means to address neurodevelopmental questions and to better understand the neural code(s) for spatial navigation in adulthood. We previously showed that spontaneous alternation (SA) in a Y‐maze, which emerges at the end of the third postnatal week, was related to changes in fast glutamatergic synaptic transmission. In adults, oscillations in the hippocampal local field potential (LFP) (i.e., theta, 4–12 Hz; slow gamma, 25–55 Hz; and fast gamma, 65–100 Hz) have been shown to coordinate the activity of spatially tuned cell types in the hippocampus during route planning and execution. Other investigators have shown that theta activity matures during the first month of life. However, relationships between developmental alterations in gamma oscillations and cognitive function have not been investigated in juveniles, and the impact of developmental changes in excitatory synaptic transmission on network activity remains unclear. We implanted rats at postnatal day 14 to record LFPs from the synaptic layer of area CA1 during Y‐maze exploration at postnatal Days 18, 19, 23, and 24. The positive allosteric modulator of AMPA receptors, CX614, or vehicle was administered prior to each test. We found that slow gamma peak frequency, but not peak power, remained constant across this age range. Fast gamma event rate increased with increasing age, while peak frequency decreased. AMPA receptor modulation impacted slow and fast gamma differently at different ages. Furthermore, gamma events showed relationships with novelty and movement speed that differed based on gamma sub‐band (slow vs. fast). These results support the presence of environmentally‐driven gamma oscillations in hippocampal network activity prior to the end of the third postnatal week of development. Differential refinement of slow and fast gamma occurring across the subsequent week supports involvement in the emergence of spatial navigation ability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Improving fitness increases dentate gyrus/CA3 volume in the hippocampal head and enhances memory in young adults</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Converging evidence suggests a relationship between aerobic exercise and hippocampal neuroplasticity that interactively impacts hippocampally dependent memory. The majority of human studies have focused on the potential for exercise to reduce brain atrophy and attenuate cognitive decline in older adults, whereas animal studies often center on exercise‐induced neurogenesis and hippocampal plasticity in the dentate gyrus (DG) of young adult animals. In the present study, initially sedentary young adults (18–35 years) participated in a moderate‐intensity randomized controlled exercise intervention trial (&lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/a&gt;; NCT02057354) for a duration of 12 weeks. The aims of the study were to investigate the relationship between change in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) as determined by estimated 
&lt;sub&gt;MAX&lt;/sub&gt;, hippocampally dependent mnemonic discrimination, and change in hippocampal subfield volume. Results show that improving CRF after exercise training is associated with an increased volume in the left DG/CA3 subregion in young adults. Consistent with previous studies that found exercise‐induced increases in anterior hippocampus in older adults, this result was specific to the hippocampal head, or most anterior portion, of the subregion. Our results also demonstrate a positive relationship between change in CRF and change in corrected accuracy for trials requiring the highest level of discrimination on a putative behavioral pattern separation task. This relationship was observed in individuals who were initially lower‐fit, suggesting that individuals who show greater improvement in their CRF may receive greater cognitive benefit. This work extends animal models by providing evidence for exercise‐induced neuroplasticity specific to the neurogenic zone of the human hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene and protein expressions are key determinants of cellular function. Neurons are the building blocks of brain circuits, yet the relationship between their molecular identity and the spatial distribution of their dendritic inputs and axonal outputs remains incompletely understood. The open‐source knowledge base &lt;a href=&quot;http://hippocampome.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;Hippocampome.org&lt;/a&gt; amasses such transcriptomic data from the scientific literature for morphologically defined neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation: dentate gyrus, CA3, CA2, CA1, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex. Positive, negative, or mixed expression reports were initially obtained from published articles directly connecting molecular evidence to neurons with known axonal and dendritic patterns across hippocampal layers. Here, we supplement this information by collating, formalizing, and leveraging relational expression inferences that link a gene or protein expression or lack thereof to that of another molecule or to an anatomical location. With these additional interpretations, we freely release online a comprehensive human‐ and machine‐readable molecular profile for more than 100 neuron types in &lt;a href=&quot;http://hippocampome.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;Hippocampome.org&lt;/a&gt;. Analysis of these data ascertains the ability to distinguish unequivocally most neuron types in each of the major subdivisions of the hippocampus based on currently known biochemical markers. Moreover, grouping neuron types by expression similarity reveals eight superfamilies characterized by a few defining molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Meta‐analytic and functional connectivity evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging for an anterior to posterior gradient of function along the hippocampal axis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23164?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is considerable evidence from non‐human animal studies that the anterior and posterior regions of the hippocampus have different anatomical connections and support different behavioural functions. Although there are some recent human studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that have addressed this idea directly in the memory and spatial processing domains and provided support for it, there has been no broader meta‐analysis of the fMRI literature to determine if there is consistent evidence for functional dissociations in anterior and posterior hippocampus across all of the different cognitive domains in which the hippocampus participates. The purpose of this review is to address this gap in our knowledge using three approaches. One approach involved PubMed searches to identify relevant fMRI papers reporting hippocampal activation during episodic encoding and retrieval, semantic retrieval, working memory, spatial navigation, simulation/scene construction, transitive inference, and social cognition tasks. The second was to use a large meta‐analytic database (neurosynth) to find text terms and coactivation maps associated with the anterior and posterior hippocampal regions identified in the literature search. The third approach was to contrast the resting‐state functional connectivity of the anterior and posterior hippocampal regions using a publicly available database that includes a large sample of adults. These three approaches provided converging evidence that not only are cognitive processes differently distributed along the hippocampal axis, but there also are distinct areas coactivated and functionally connected with the anterior and posterior segments. This anterior/posterior distinction involving multiple cognitive domains is consistent with the animal literature and provides strong support from fMRI for the idea of functional dissociations across the long axis of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Functional responses of the hippocampus to hyperexcitability depend on directed, neuron‐specific KCNQ2 K+ channel plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23163?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M‐type (KCNQ2/3) K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels play dominant roles in regulation of active and passive neuronal discharge properties such as resting membrane potential, spike‐frequency adaptation, and hyper‐excitatory states. However, plasticity of M‐channel expression and function in nongenetic forms of epileptogenesis are still not well understood. Using transgenic mice with an EGFP reporter to detect expression maps of KCNQ2 mRNA, we assayed hyperexcitability‐induced alterations in KCNQ2 transcription across subregions of the hippocampus. Pilocarpine and pentylenetetrazol chemoconvulsant models of seizure induction were used, and brain tissue examined 48 hr later. We observed increases in KCNQ2 mRNA in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons after chemoconvulsant‐induced hyperexcitability at 48 hr, but no significant change was observed in dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells. Using chromogenic in situ hybridization assays, changes to KCNQ3 transcription were not detected after hyper‐excitation challenge, but the results for KCNQ2 paralleled those using the KCNQ2‐mRNA reporter mice. In mice 7 days after pilocarpine challenge, levels of KCNQ2 mRNA were similar in all regions to those from control mice. In brain‐slice electrophysiology recordings, CA1 pyramidal neurons demonstrated increased M‐current amplitudes 48 hr after hyperexcitability; however, there were no significant changes to DG granule cell M‐current amplitude. Traumatic brain injury induced significantly greater KCNQ2 expression in the hippocampal hemisphere that was ipsilateral to the trauma. In vivo, after a secondary challenge with subconvulsant dose of pentylenetetrazole, control mice were susceptible to tonic–clonic seizures, whereas mice administered the M‐channel opener retigabine were protected from such seizures. This study demonstrates that increased excitatory activity promotes KCNQ2 upregulation in the hippocampus in a cell‐type specific manner. Such novel ion channel expressional plasticity may serve as a compensatory mechanism after a hyperexcitable event, at least in the short term. The upregulation described could be potentially leveraged in anticonvulsant enhancement of KCNQ2 channels as therapeutic target for preventing onset of epileptogenic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;A key goal in hippocampal research is to understand how neuronal activity is generated and organized across hippocampal subregions to enable memory formation and retrieval. Neuronal activity in CA2 is regulated by spatial and social investigation as well as by novelty (Mankin et al., 2015; Alexander et al., 2016), and CA2 activity controls population oscillatory activity in the slow  and ripple ranges within hippocampus (Kay et al., 2016; Oliva et al., 2016; Boehringer et al., 2017; Alexander et al., 2018). CA2 neurons are also required for social recognition memory (Stevenson and Caldwell, 2012; Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014; Smith et al., 2016). Because CA1 exhibits layer-specific organization (Scheffer-Teixeira et al., 2012; Lasztóczi and Klausberger, 2014, 2016) reflective of its inputs (Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2012; Schomburg et al., 2014), and because CA2 activity controls CA1 slow  (Alexander et al., 2018), we hypothesized that silencing CA2 would affect CA1 slow  in a layer-specific manner during investigation of a novel social stimulus. While recording from CA1, we leveraged molecular tools to selectively target and inhibit CA2 pyramidal cells using inhibitory DREADDs while subject mice investigated novel animals or objects. We found that CA2 inhibition reduced slow  power during investigation of a novel animal and fast  power during both novel object and animal investigation in a manner reflective of the CA2 axonal projection zones within CA1. Our results suggest that CA2 contributes to CA1 slow and fast  oscillations in a stimulus-specific manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Profilin 1 knockdown prevents ischemic brain damage by promoting M2 microglial polarization associated with the RhoA/ROCK pathway&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b2ab45aa-2226-4039-8934-88a7a89bfa09/jnr24607-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential molecular mechanism by which pfn1 regulates microglia polarization and hypoxia/ischemia injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microglial polarization to the anti‐inflammatory M2 phenotype is essential in resolving neuroinflammation, making it a promising therapeutic strategy for stroke intervention. The actin cytoskeleton is known to be important for the physiological functions of microglia, including migration and phagocytosis. Profilin 1 (PFN1), an actin‐binding protein, is involved in the dynamic transformation and reorganization of actin. However, the role of PFN1 in microglial polarization and ischemia/reperfusion injury is unclear. The role of PFN1 on microglial polarization was examined &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; in BV2 microglial cells subjected to oxygen‐glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGDR) and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in male mice after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Knockdown of PFN1 inhibited M1 microglial polarization and promoted M2 microglia polarization 48 hr after OGDR stimulation in BV2 cells and 7 days after MCAO‐induced injury in male mice. RhoA/ROCK pathway was involved in the regulation of PFN1 during microglial polarization. Knockdown of PFN1 also significantly attenuated brain infarcts and edema, improved cerebral blood flow and neurological deficits in MCAO‐injured mice. Inhibition of PFN1 effectively protected the brain against ischemia/reperfusion injuries by promoting M2 microglial polarization &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Differences in behavior between surface and cave Astyanax mexicanus may be mediated by changes in catecholamine signaling</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Differences in behavior between surface and cave Astyanax mexicanus may be mediated by changes in catecholamine signaling&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/cc6edc0e-e859-4aa6-991b-77893c0a3b6c/cne24923-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teleost fish &lt;i&gt;Astyanax mexicanus&lt;/i&gt; is extant in an ancestral surface form (right) and derived cave forms (left). Adaptation to life in nutrient poor caves without predation increased exploratory foraging behaviors and decreased aversion to potential predatory cues in the cavefishes. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry revealed larger catecholaminergic neurons in regions of the cave &lt;i&gt;Astyanax&lt;/i&gt; brain that may mediate these changes in behavior.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Astyanax mexicanus&lt;/i&gt; is a teleost fish that is in the process of allopatric speciation. Ancestral &lt;i&gt;Astyanax&lt;/i&gt; are found in surface rivers and derived blind forms are found in cave systems. Adaptation to life in nutrient poor caves without predation includes the evolution of enhanced food seeking behaviors and loss of defensive responses. These behavioral adaptations may be mediated by changes in catecholaminergic control systems in the brain. We examined the distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase, a conserved precursor for the synthesis of the catecholamines dopamine and noradrenaline, in the brains of surface and cave &lt;i&gt;Astyanax&lt;/i&gt; using immunohistochemistry. We found differences in tyrosine hydroxylase staining in regions that are associated with non‐visual sensory perception, motor control, endocrine release, and attention. These differences included significant increases in the diameters of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive soma in cave &lt;i&gt;Astyanax&lt;/i&gt; in the olfactory bulb, basal telencephalon, preoptic nuclei, ventral thalamus, posterior tuberculum, and locus coeruleus. These increases in modulation by dopamine and noradrenaline likely indicate changes in behavioral control that underlie adaptations to the cave environment.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Polygenic Multiple Sclerosis Risk and Population‐Based Childhood Brain Imaging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25717?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25717?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease with a substantial genetic component and immune‐mediated neurodegeneration. Patients with MS show structural brain differences relative to individuals without MS, including smaller regional volumes and alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure. Whether genetic risk for MS is associated with brain structure during early neurodevelopment remains unclear. In this study, we explore the association between MS polygenic risk scores (PRS) and brain imaging outcomes from a large, population‐based pediatric sample to gain insight into the underlying neurobiology of MS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 8‐ to 12‐year‐old genotyped participants from the Generation R Study in whom T1‐weighted volumetric (n = 1,136) and/or diffusion tensor imaging (n = 1,088) had been collected. PRS for MS were calculated based on a large genome‐wide association study of MS (n = 41,505) and were regressed on regional volumes, global and tract‐specific fractional anisotropy (FA), and global mean diffusivity using linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No associations were observed for the regional volumes. We observed a positive association between the MS PRS and global FA (β = 0.098, standard error [SE] = 0.030, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 1.08 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;). Tract‐specific analyses showed higher FA and lower radial diffusivity in several tracts. We replicated our findings in an independent sample of children (n = 186) who were scanned in an earlier phase (global FA; β = 0.189, SE = 0.072, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 9.40 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to show that greater genetic predisposition for MS is associated with higher global brain WM FA at an early age in the general population. Our results suggest a preadolescent time window within neurodevelopment in which MS risk variants act upon the brain. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:774–787&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neurophysiological Signatures of Motor Impairment in Patients with Rett Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25712?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25712?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X‐linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder due to pathogenic mutations in the &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt; gene. Motor impairment constitutes the core diagnostic feature of RTT. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated alteration of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and aberrant synaptic plasticity at the cortical level. We aimed to understand neurobiological mechanisms underlying motor deficit by assessing in vivo synaptic plasticity and E/I balance in the primary motor cortex (M1).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 14 patients with typical RTT, 9 epilepsy control patients, and 11 healthy controls, we applied paired‐pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols to evaluate the excitation index, a biomarker reflecting the contribution of inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in M1. Intermittent TMS‐theta burst stimulation was used to probe long‐term potentiation (LTP)‐like plasticity in M1. Motor impairment, assessed by ad hoc clinical scales, was correlated with neurophysiological metrics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTT patients displayed a significant increase of the excitation index (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003), as demonstrated by the reduction of short‐interval intracortical inhibition and increase of intracortical facilitation, suggesting a shift toward cortical excitation likely due to GABAergic dysfunction. Impairment of inhibitory circuits was also confirmed by the reduction of long‐interval intracortical inhibition (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002). LTP‐like plasticity in M1 was abolished (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008) and scaled with motor disability (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TMS is a method that can be used to assess cortical motor function in RTT patients. Our findings support the introduction of TMS measures in clinical and research settings to monitor the progression of motor deficit and response to treatment. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:763–773&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Robust Markers and Sample Sizes for Multicenter Trials of Huntington Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25709?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25709?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identification of sensitive biomarkers is essential to validate therapeutics for Huntington disease (HD). We directly compare structural imaging markers across the largest collective imaging HD dataset to identify a set of imaging markers robust to multicenter variation and to derive upper estimates on sample sizes for clinical trials in HD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used 1 postprocessing pipeline to retrospectively analyze T1‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 624 participants at 3 time points, from the PREDICT‐HD, TRACK‐HD, and IMAGE‐HD studies. We used mixed effects models to adjust regional brain volumes for covariates, calculate effect sizes, and simulate possible treatment effects in disease‐affected anatomical regions. We used our model to estimate the statistical power of possible treatment effects for anatomical regions and clinical markers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a set of common anatomical regions that have similarly large standardized effect sizes (&amp;gt;0.5) between healthy control and premanifest HD (PreHD) groups. These included subcortical, white matter, and cortical regions and nonventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We also observed a consistent spatial distribution of effect size by region across the whole brain. We found that multicenter studies were necessary to capture treatment effect variance; for a 20% treatment effect, power of &amp;gt;80% was achieved for the caudate (n = 661), pallidum (n = 687), and nonventricular CSF (n = 939), and, crucially, these imaging markers provided greater power than standard clinical markers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings provide the first cross‐study validation of structural imaging markers in HD, supporting the use of these measurements as endpoints for both observational studies and clinical trials. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:751–762&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Expanding use of immune‐checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) underscores the importance of accurate diagnosis and timely management of neurological immune‐related adverse events (irAE‐N). We evaluate the real‐world frequency, phenotypes, co‐occurring immune‐related adverse events (irAEs), and long‐term outcomes of severe, grade III to V irAE‐N at a tertiary care center over 6 years. We analyze how our experience supports published literature and professional society guidelines. We also discuss these data with regard to common clinical scenarios, such as combination therapy, ICI rechallenge and risk of relapse of irAE‐N, and corticosteroid taper, which are not specifically addressed by current guidelines and/or have limited data. Recommendations for management and future irAE‐N reporting are outlined. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:659–669&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dopaminergic Depletion, β‐Amyloid Burden, and Cognition in Lewy Body Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25707?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25707?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aimed to determine the association between striatal dopaminergic depletion, cerebral β‐amyloid deposition, and cognitive dysfunction in Lewy body disease (LBD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cross‐sectional study recruited 48 LBD patients (30 with dementia, 18 with mild cognitive impairment) and 15 control subjects from a university‐based hospital. We measured the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) activity and regional β‐amyloid burden using &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;‐(3‐[&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fluoropropyl)‐2β‐carbon ethoxy‐3β‐(4‐iodophenyl) nortropane (FP‐CIT) positron emission tomography (PET) and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐florbetaben (FBB) PET, respectively. The relationship between striatal FP‐CIT uptake, regional cortical FBB uptake, and cognitive function scores was evaluated using path analyses. We also investigated the effects of striatal FP‐CIT uptake and cortical FBB uptake on the interval between motor symptom and dementia onset.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced striatal FP‐CIT uptake was associated with increased FBB uptake in the posterior cortical regions, most prominently in the occipital cortices. Reduced FP‐CIT uptake in the anterior putamen was associated with visuospatial dysfunction with mediation of increased occipital FBB uptake. Reduced FP‐CIT uptake in the posterior putamen and an increased parietal FBB uptake were independently associated with memory dysfunction. Reduced striatal FP‐CIT uptake was associated with attention, language, and frontal/executive dysfunction, independent of amyloid deposition. Increased FBB uptake, especially in the parietal cortex, was associated with earlier onset of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that occipital β‐amyloid deposition may contribute to the association between striatal dopaminergic depletion and visuospatial dysfunction in LBD patients. Although the effects of reduced DAT activity are more prominent than those of β‐amyloid burden on cognitive dysfunction, the latter affects the onset of cognitive dysfunction. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:739–750&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Connectome‐Based Propagation Model in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25706?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25706?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) continue to rely on survival or functional scales as endpoints, despite the emergence of quantitative biomarkers. Neuroimaging‐based biomarkers in ALS have been shown to detect ALS‐associated pathology in vivo, although anatomical patterns of disease spread are poorly characterized. The objective of this study is to simulate disease propagation using network analyses of cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to predict disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using brain networks of ALS patients (n = 208) and matched controls across longitudinal time points, network‐based statistics unraveled progressive network degeneration originating from the motor cortex and expanding in a spatiotemporal manner. We applied a computational model to the MRI scan of patients to simulate this progressive network degeneration. Simulated aggregation levels at the group and individual level were validated with empirical impairment observed at later time points of white matter and clinical decline using both internal and external datasets.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observe that computer‐simulated aggregation levels mimic true disease patterns in ALS patients. Simulated patterns of involvement across cortical areas show significant overlap with the patterns of empirically impaired brain regions on later scans, at both group and individual levels. These findings are validated using an external longitudinal dataset of 30 patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results are in accordance with established pathological staging systems and may have implications for patient stratification in future clinical trials. Our results demonstrate the utility of computational models in ALS to predict disease progression and underscore their potential as a prognostic biomarker. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:725–738&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Validation of Rapid Magnetic Resonance Myelin Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25705?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25705?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for multiple sclerosis diagnostics but is conventionally not specific to demyelination. Myelin imaging is often hampered by long scanning times, complex postprocessing, or lack of clinical approval. This study aimed to assess the specificity, robustness, and clinical value of Rapid Estimation of Myelin for Diagnostic Imaging, a new myelin imaging technique based on time‐efficient simultaneous T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; relaxometry and proton density mapping in multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid myelin imaging was applied using 3T MRI ex vivo in 3 multiple sclerosis brain samples and in vivo in a prospective cohort of 71 multiple sclerosis patients and 21 age/sex‐matched healthy controls, with scan–rescan repeatability in a subcohort. Disability in patients was assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test at baseline and 2‐year follow‐up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid myelin imaging correlated with myelin‐related stains (proteolipid protein immunostaining and Luxol fast blue) and demonstrated good precision. Multiple sclerosis patients had, relative to controls, lower normalized whole‐brain and normal‐appearing white matter myelin fractions, which correlated with baseline cognitive and physical disability. Longitudinally, these myelin fractions correlated with follow‐up physical disability, even with correction for baseline disability.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid Estimation of Myelin for Diagnostic Imaging provides robust myelin quantification that detects diffuse demyelination in normal‐appearing tissue in multiple sclerosis, which is associated with both cognitive and clinical disability. Because the technique is fast, with automatic postprocessing and US Food and Drug Administration/CE clinical approval, it can be a clinically feasible biomarker that may be suitable to monitor myelin dynamics and evaluate treatments aiming at remyelination. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:710–724&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Sleep Deprivation Affects Tau Phosphorylation in Human Cerebrospinal Fluid</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tau hyperphosphorylation is an early step in tau‐mediated neurodegeneration and is associated with intracellular aggregation of tau as neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal and synaptic loss, and eventual cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer disease. Sleep loss increases the cerebrospinal fluid concentration of amyloid‐β and tau. Using mass spectrometry, we measured tau and phosphorylated tau concentrations in serial samples of cerebrospinal fluid collected from participants who were sleep‐deprived, treated with sodium oxybate, or allowed to sleep normally. We found that sleep loss affected phosphorylated tau differently depending on the modified site. These findings suggest a mechanism for sleep loss to increase risk of Alzheimer disease. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:700–709&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Cancer Risk for Fingolimod, Natalizumab, and Rituximab in Multiple Sclerosis Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25701?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25701?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel, highly effective disease‐modifying therapies have revolutionized multiple sclerosis (MS) care. However, evidence from large comparative studies on important safety outcomes, such as cancer, is still lacking.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this nationwide register‐based cohort study, we linked data from the Swedish MS register to the Swedish Cancer Register and other national health care and census registers. We included 4,187 first‐ever initiations of rituximab, 1,620 of fingolimod, and 1,670 of natalizumab in 6,136 MS patients matched for age, sex, and location to 37,801 non‐MS general population subjects. Primary outcome was time to first invasive cancer.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 78 invasive cancers among treated patients: rituximab 33 (incidence rate [IR] per 10,000 person‐years = 34.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 23.7–48.3), fingolimod 28 (IR = 44.0, 95% CI = 29.2–63.5), and natalizumab 17 (IR = 26.0, 95% CI = 15.1–41.6). The general population IR was 31.0 (95% CI = 27.8–34.4). Adjusting for baseline characteristics, we found no difference in risk of invasive cancer between rituximab, natalizumab, and the general population but a possibly higher risk with fingolimod compared to the general population (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.53, 95% CI = 0.98–2.38) and rituximab (HR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.00–2.84).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this first large comparative study of 3 highly effective MS disease‐modifying therapies, no increased risk of invasive cancer was seen with rituximab and natalizumab, compared to the general population. However, there was a borderline‐significant increased risk with fingolimod, compared to both the general population and rituximab. It was not possible to attribute this increased risk to any specific type of cancer, and further studies are warranted to validate these findings. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:688–699&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: N‐Methyl‐D‐Aspartate Receptor Antibodies in Autoimmune Encephalopathy Alter Oligodendrocyte Function</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25699?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25699?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibodies against neuronal N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis alter neuronal synaptic function and plasticity, but the effects on other cells of the nervous system are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis (preabsorbed or not with GluN1) and a human NMDAR‐specific monoclonal antibody (SSM5) derived from plasma cells of a patient, along the corresponding controls, were used in the studies. To evaluate the activity of oligodendrocyte NMDARs and α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors in vitro after exposure to patients' CSF antibodies or SSM5, we used a functional assay based on cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging. Expression of the glucose transporter (GLUT1) in oligodendrocytes was assessed by immunocytochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NMDAR agonist responses were robustly reduced after preincubation of oligodendrocytes with patients' CSF or SSM5 but remained largely unaltered with the corresponding controls. These effects were NMDAR specific, as patients' CSF did not alter responses to AMPA receptor agonists and was abrogated by preabsorption of CSF with HEK cells expressing GluN1 subunit. Patients' CSF also reduced oligodendrocyte expression of glucose transporter GLUT1 induced by NMDAR activity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibodies from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis specifically alter the function of NMDARs in oligodendrocytes, causing a decrease of expression of GLUT1. Considering that normal GLUT1 expression in oligodendrocytes and myelin is needed to metabolically support axonal function, the findings suggest a link between antibody‐mediated dysfunction of NMDARs in oligodendrocytes and the white matter alterations reported in patients with this disorder. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:670–676&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms of thalamic pathology in multiple sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25743?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25743?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thalamic atrophy is among the earliest brain changes detected in patients with MS and the degree of thalamic atrophy is a strong predictor of disability progression. The causes of thalamic atrophy are not fully understood. We investigate the contributions of thalamic demyelinated lesions, thalamic neuronal loss, and cerebral white matter lesions to thalamic volume.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used postmortem &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; MRI's of 95 subjects with MS to correlate thalamic lesion volumes with global MRI metrics. We histologically characterized thalamic demyelination patterns and compared neuronal loss and neuritic pathology in the thalami with the extremes of volume.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grossly apparent thalamic discolorations in cm‐thick brain slices were T2/FLAIR hyperintense, T1‐hypointense, and appeared as perivascular demyelinated lesions with dystrophic neurons/axons. Subependymal demyelinated lesions with axonal loss and microglial/macrophage activation were also observed. The 12 subjects with the least thalamic volume had a 17.6% reduction of median neuronal density in the dorsomedial/ventrolateral and pulvinar nuclei compared with the 14 subjects with the greatest thalamic volume (p = 0.03). After correcting for age, disease duration, sex and T2 lesion volume, neither total (p = 0.20), ovoid (p = 0.31), or subependymal (p = 0.44) MRI thalamic lesion volumes correlated with thalamic volume. Thalamic volume correlated with cerebral T2 lesion volume (Spearman's rho = −0.65, p &amp;lt; 0.001; p &amp;lt; 0.0001 after correcting for age, disease duration, and sex).&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Faster Cortical Thinning and Surface Area Loss in Presymptomatic and Symptomatic C9orf72 Repeat Expansion Adult Carriers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25748?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25748?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; expansion is the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We examined aging trajectories of cortical thickness (CTh) and surface area in &lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; expansion adult carriers compared to healthy controls to characterize preclinical cerebral changes leading to symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data were obtained from the Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia Initiative. T1‐weighted MRI scans were processed with CIVET 2.1 to extract vertex‐wide CTh and CSA. Symptomatic and presymptomatic subjects were compared to age‐matched controls using mixed‐effects models, controlling for demographic variables. Aging trajectories were compared between carriers and non‐carriers by testing the ‘age by genetic status’ interaction. False‐discovery rate corrections were applied to all vertex‐wide analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sample included 640 scans from 386 subjects, including 54 symptomatic &lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; carriers (72.2% behavioral variant FTD), 83 asymptomatic carriers and 249 controls (age range 18–86). Symptomatic carriers showed fairly symmetric reduction in CTh/CSA in most of the frontal lobes, in addition to large temporo‐parietal areas. Presymptomatic subjects had reduced CTh/CSA in more restricted areas of the medial fronto‐parietal lobes, in addition to scattered lateral fronto‐parieto‐temporal areas. These differences were explained by faster cortical thinning linearly throughout adulthood in a similar anatomical distribution, with differences emerging in the early 30s. CSA reduction was also faster in mutation carriers predominantly in the ventro‐frontal regions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; mutation carriers have faster cortical thinning and surface loss throughout adulthood in regions that show atrophy in symptomatic subjects. This suggests that the pathogenic effects of the mutation lead to structural cerebral changes decades prior to symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Brain Microvascular Pericytes in Vascular Cognitive Impairment and Dementia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00080</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00080</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pericytes are unique, multi-functional mural cells localized at the abluminal side of the perivascular space in microvessels. Originally discovered in 19th century, pericytes had drawn less attention until decades ago mainly due to lack of specific markers. Recently, however, a growing body of evidence has revealed that pericytes play various important roles: development and maintenance of blood–brain barrier (BBB), regulation of the neurovascular system (e.g., vascular stability, vessel formation, cerebral blood flow, etc.), trafficking of inflammatory cells, clearance of toxic waste products from the brain, and acquisition of stem cell-like properties. In the neurovascular unit, pericytes perform these functions through coordinated crosstalk with neighboring cells including endothelial, glial, and neuronal cells. Dysfunction of pericytes contribute to a wide variety of diseases that lead to cognitive impairments such as cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), acute stroke, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and other neurological disorders. For instance, in SVDs, pericyte degeneration leads to microvessel instability and demyelination while in stroke, pericyte constriction after ischemia causes a no-reflow phenomenon in brain capillaries. In AD, which shares some common risk factors with vascular dementia, reduction in pericyte coverage and subsequent microvascular impairments are observed in association with white matter attenuation and contribute to impaired cognition. Pericyte loss causes BBB-breakdown, which stagnates amyloid β clearance and the leakage of neurotoxic molecules into the brain parenchyma. In this review, we first summarize the characteristics of brain microvessel pericytes, and their roles in the central nervous system. Then, we focus on how dysfunctional pericytes contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular cognitive impairment including cerebral ‘small vessel’ and ‘large vessel’ diseases, as well as AD. Finally, we discuss therapeutic implications for these disorders by targeting pericytes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron disease but currently has no effective treatment. Growing evidence suggests that proteome homeostasis underlies ALS pathogenesis. Protein production, trafficking, and degradation all shape the proteome. We present a hypothesis that proposes all genetic lesions associated with ALS (including in mRNA-binding proteins) cause widespread imbalance to an already metastable proteome. The impact of such dysfunction is felt across the entire proteome and is not restricted to a small subset of proteins.</description>

	<description>Steinberg et al. investigate how connections between the central amygdala and the lateral substantia nigra contribute to emotional behaviors. They find that amygdalonigral neurons are activated by salient stimuli and participate in appetitive and aversive learning via connections with nigral GABA and dopamine neurons.</description>

	<description>Ohba et al. show that overexpressed PGAM1 in gliomas binds to the cytoplasmic phosphatase WIP1 and prevents its nuclear translocation and dephosphorylation of the ATM signaling pathway. Silencing PGAM1 releases WIP1 to translocate to the nucleus, resulting in a decrease in ATM signaling and an increase in therapeutic efficacy of irradiation and chemotherapy in glioma.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Improving the coverage of credible sets in Bayesian genetic fine-mapping</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007829</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Anna Hutchinson, Hope Watson, Chris Wallace&lt;/p&gt;

Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of loci associated with human diseases. Bayesian genetic fine-mapping studies aim to identify the specific causal variants within GWAS loci responsible for each association, reporting credible sets of plausible causal variants, which are interpreted as containing the causal variant with some “coverage probability”. Here, we use simulations to demonstrate that the coverage probabilities are over-conservative in most fine-mapping situations. We show that this is because fine-mapping data sets are not randomly selected from amongst all causal variants, but from amongst causal variants with larger effect sizes. We present a method to re-estimate the coverage of credible sets using rapid simulations based on the observed, or estimated, SNP correlation structure, we call this the “adjusted coverage estimate”. This is extended to find “adjusted credible sets”, which are the smallest set of variants such that their adjusted coverage estimate meets the target coverage. We use our method to improve the resolution of a fine-mapping study of type 1 diabetes. We found that in 27 out of 39 associated genomic regions our method could reduce the number of potentially causal variants to consider for follow-up, and found that none of the 95% or 99% credible sets required the inclusion of more variants—a pattern matched in simulations of well powered GWAS. Crucially, our method requires only GWAS summary statistics and remains accurate when SNP correlations are estimated from a large reference panel. Using our method to improve the resolution of fine-mapping studies will enable more efficient expenditure of resources in the follow-up process of annotating the variants in the credible set to determine the implicated genes and pathways in human diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZTeJWkGsGCg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Enhanced production of heterologous proteins by a synthetic microbial community: Conditions and trade-offs</title>

Synthetic microbial consortia have been increasingly utilized in biotechnology and experimental evidence shows that suitably engineered consortia can outperform individual species in the synthesis of valuable products. Despite significant achievements, though, a quantitative understanding of the conditions that make this possible, and of the trade-offs due to the concurrent growth of multiple species, is still limited. In this work, we contribute to filling this gap by the investigation of a known prototypical synthetic consortium. A first &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; strain, producing a heterologous protein, is sided by a second &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; strain engineered to scavenge toxic byproducts, thus favoring the growth of the producer at the expense of diverting part of the resources to the growth of the cleaner. The simplicity of the consortium is ideal to perform an in depth-analysis and draw conclusions of more general interest. We develop a coarse-grained mathematical model that quantitatively accounts for literature data from different key growth phenotypes. Based on this, assuming growth in chemostat, we first investigate the conditions enabling stable coexistence of both strains and the effect of the metabolic load due to heterologous protein production. In these conditions, we establish when and to what extent the consortium outperforms the producer alone in terms of productivity. Finally, we show in chemostat as well as in a fed-batch scenario that gain in productivity comes at the price of a reduced yield, reflecting at the level of the consortium resource allocation trade-offs that are well-known for individual species.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yUpRNtkUMDo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Widefield calcium imaging enables recording of large-scale neural activity across the mouse dorsal cortex. In order to examine the relationship of these neural signals to the resulting behavior, it is critical to demix the recordings into meaningful spatial and temporal components that can be mapped onto well-defined brain regions. However, no current tools satisfactorily extract the activity of the different brain regions in individual mice in a data-driven manner, while taking into account mouse-specific and preparation-specific differences. Here, we introduce Localized semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (LocaNMF), a method that efficiently decomposes widefield video data and allows us to directly compare activity across multiple mice by outputting mouse-specific localized functional regions that are significantly more interpretable than more traditional decomposition techniques. Moreover, it provides a natural subspace to directly compare correlation maps and neural dynamics across different behaviors, mice, and experimental conditions, and enables identification of task- and movement-related brain regions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CDkfhRwyf0Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Generalizing to generalize: Humans flexibly switch between compositional and conjunctive structures during reinforcement learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007720</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas T. Franklin, Michael J. Frank&lt;/p&gt;

Humans routinely face novel environments in which they have to generalize in order to act adaptively. However, doing so involves the non-trivial challenge of deciding which aspects of a task domain to generalize. While it is sometimes appropriate to simply re-use a learned behavior, often adaptive generalization entails recombining distinct components of knowledge acquired across multiple contexts. Theoretical work has suggested a computational trade-off in which it can be more or less useful to learn and generalize aspects of task structure jointly or compositionally, depending on previous task statistics, but it is unknown whether humans modulate their generalization strategy accordingly. Here we develop a series of navigation tasks that separately manipulate the statistics of goal values (“what to do”) and state transitions (“how to do it”) across contexts and assess whether human subjects generalize these task components separately or conjunctively. We find that human generalization is sensitive to the statistics of the previously experienced task domain, favoring compositional or conjunctive generalization when the task statistics are indicative of such structures, and a mixture of the two when they are more ambiguous. These results support a normative “meta-generalization” account and suggests that people not only generalize previous task components but also generalize the statistical structure most likely to support generalization.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jkWq3zlKQgI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Ultralow-frequency neural entrainment to pain</title>

Nervous systems exploit regularities in the sensory environment to predict sensory input, adjust behavior, and thereby maximize fitness. Entrainment of neural oscillations allows retaining temporal regularities of sensory information, a prerequisite for prediction. Entrainment has been extensively described at the frequencies of periodic inputs most commonly present in visual and auditory landscapes (e.g., &amp;gt;0.5 Hz). An open question is whether neural entrainment also occurs for regularities at much longer timescales. Here, we exploited the fact that the temporal dynamics of thermal stimuli in natural environment can unfold very slowly. We show that ultralow-frequency neural oscillations preserved a long-lasting trace of sensory information through neural entrainment to periodic thermo-nociceptive input as low as 0.1 Hz. Importantly, revealing the functional significance of this phenomenon, both power and phase of the entrainment predicted individual pain sensitivity. In contrast, periodic auditory input at the same ultralow frequency did not entrain ultralow-frequency oscillations. These results demonstrate that a functionally significant neural entrainment can occur at temporal scales far longer than those commonly explored. The non-supramodal nature of our results suggests that ultralow-frequency entrainment might be tuned to the temporal scale of the statistical regularities characteristic of different sensory modalities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/KKPxATUxu5Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pre‐mortem Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Diagnoses in Professional Football</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25747?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25747?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American‐style football (ASF) has gained attention because of possible links between repetitive head injury and neurodegenerative diseases. While post‐mortem pathologic changes consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) have been reported in ASF players, there are currently no established pre‐mortem diagnostic criteria for CTE. Nevertheless, presented with symptoms of cognitive impairment, clinicians treating former players may be inclined to suggest CTE without a thorough exploration of comorbid factors that demonstrate similar clinical phenotypes to putative CTE.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey of 3,913 former ASF players aged 24 to 89 who responded by March 2019.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being a post‐mortem diagnosis, 108 players (2.8%) self‐reported clinician‐diagnosed CTE. The percentage of players under age 60 reporting a CTE diagnosis was 2.3%, versus 3.7% in participants age 60 or older. Comorbidities in participants self‐reporting CTE were significantly more common, including sleep apnea, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, indicators of past or current depression, hypertension, prescription pain medication use, heart conditions and low testosterone when compared to non‐CTE respondents. Patterns of reporting for obesity, hypertension, heart conditions or hypercholesterolemia differed between older and younger participants. Cognitive impairment symptoms were significantly higher in participants self‐reporting CTE.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some former professional football players have been clinically diagnosed with CTE, a post‐mortem condition. Comorbidities that can affect cognition were associated with CTE diagnoses in both older and younger players. While underlying neuropathology cannot be ruled out, treatable conditions should be explored in former athletes demonstrating CTE‐linked clinical phenotypes or symptoms as a means of improving cognitive health in these patients.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eNeuro: RatHat: A Self-Targeting Printable Brain Implant System</title>

	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0538-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There has not been a major change in how neuroscientists approach stereotaxic methods in decades. Here, we present a new stereotaxic method that provides an alternative approach to a traditional u-frame stereotaxic device and reduces costs, surgical time, and aids repeatability. The RatHat brain implantation system is a 3D-printable stereotaxic device for rats that is fabricated prior to surgery and fits to the shape of the skull. RatHat builds are directly implanted into the brain without the need for head-leveling or coordinate-mapping during surgery. The RatHat can be used in conjunction with the traditional u-frame stereotaxic device, but does not require the use of a micromanipulator for successful implantations. Each RatHat contains several primary components including the implant for mounting intracranial components, the surgical stencil for targeting drill sites, and the protective cap for preventing damage from impacts and debris. Each component serves a unique function and can be used together or separately. We demonstrate the feasibility of the RatHat in four different proof-of-principle experiments: (1) a three-pole cannula apparatus, (2) an optrode-electrode assembly, (3) a fixed-electrode array, and (4) a tetrode hyperdrive. Implants were successful, durable, and long-lasting (up to nine months). RatHat print files are easily created, can be modified in computer aided design (CAD) software for a variety of applications, and are easily shared, contributing to open science goals and replications. The RatHat has been adapted to multiple experimental paradigms in our lab and should be a useful new way to conduct stereotaxic implant surgeries in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Progressive multiple sclerosis is associated with faster and specific retinal layer atrophy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25738?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25738?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic development in progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) has been hampered by a lack of reliable biomarkers to monitor neurodegeneration. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)‐derived retinal measures have been proposed as promising biomarkers to fulfill this role. However, it is unclear if retinal atrophy persists in PMS, exceeds normal aging, or can be distinguished from relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;178 RRMS, 186 PMS, and 66 control participants were followed with serial OCT for a median follow‐up of 3.7 years.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimated proportion of peri‐papillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) and macular ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thinning in MS attributable to normal aging increased from 42.7% and 16.7% respectively at age 25 years, to 83.7% and 81.1% at age 65 years. However, independent of age, PMS was associated with faster pRNFL (−0.34 ± 0.09%/year; p &amp;lt; 0.001) and GCIPL (−0.27 ± 0.07%/year; p &amp;lt; 0.001) thinning, as compared to RRMS. In both MS and controls, higher baseline age was associated with faster inner (INL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thinning. INL and ONL thinning were independently faster in PMS, as compared to controls (INL:‐0.09 ± 0.04%/year, p = 0.03; ONL:‐0.12 ± 0.06%/year, p = 0.04), and RRMS (INL:‐0.10 ± 0.04%/year, p = 0.01; ONL:‐0.13 ± 0.05%/year, p = 0.01), while they were similar in RRMS and controls. Unlike RRMS, disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs) did not impact rates of retinal layer atrophy in PMS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PMS is associated with faster retinal atrophy independent of age. INL and ONL measures may be novel biomarkers of neurodegeneration in PMS, that appear to be unaffected by conventional DMTs. The effects of aging on rates of retinal layer atrophy should be considered in clinical trials incorporating OCT outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
