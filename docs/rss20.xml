Multi-regional sequencing provides new opportunities to investigate genetic heterogeneity within or between common tumors from an evolutionary perspective. Several state-of-the-art methods have been proposed for reconstructing cancer evolutionary trees based on multi-regional sequencing data to develop models of cancer evolution. However, there have been few studies on comparisons of a set of cancer evolutionary trees. We propose a clustering method (phyC) for cancer evolutionary trees, in which sub-groups of the trees are identified based on topology and edge length attributes. For interpretation, we also propose a method for evaluating the sub-clonal diversity of trees in the clusters, which provides insight into the acceleration of sub-clonal expansion. Simulation showed that the proposed method can detect true clusters with sufficient accuracy. Application of the method to actual multi-regional sequencing data of clear cell renal carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer allowed for the detection of clusters related to cancer type or phenotype. phyC is implemented with R(≥3.2.2) and is available from https://github.com/ymatts/phyC.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4SZEZkHIn9o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Slow diffusive dynamics in a chaotic balanced neural network</title>

It has been proposed that neural noise in the cortex arises from chaotic dynamics in the balanced state: in this model of cortical dynamics, the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to each neuron approximately cancel, and activity is driven by fluctuations of the synaptic inputs around their mean. It remains unclear whether neural networks in the balanced state can perform tasks that are highly sensitive to noise, such as storage of continuous parameters in working memory, while also accounting for the irregular behavior of single neurons. Here we show that continuous parameter working memory can be maintained in the balanced state, in a neural circuit with a simple network architecture. We show analytically that in the limit of an infinite network, the dynamics generated by this architecture are characterized by a continuous set of steady balanced states, allowing for the indefinite storage of a continuous parameter. In finite networks, we show that the chaotic noise drives diffusive motion along the approximate attractor, which gradually degrades the stored memory. We analyze the dynamics and show that the slow diffusive motion induces slowly decaying temporal cross correlations in the activity, which differ substantially from those previously described in the balanced state. We calculate the diffusivity, and show that it is inversely proportional to the system size. For large enough (but realistic) neural population sizes, and with suitable tuning of the network connections, the proposed balanced network can sustain continuous parameter values in memory over time scales larger by several orders of magnitude than the single neuron time scale.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dmVRgyMxy0k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Co-occurring protein phosphorylation are functionally associated</title>

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) add a further layer of complexity to the proteome and regulate a wide range of cellular protein functions. With the increasing number of known PTM sites, it becomes imperative to understand their functional interplays. In this study, we proposed a novel analytical strategy to explore functional relationships between PTM sites by testing their tendency to be modified together (co-occurrence) under the same condition, and applied it to proteome-wide human phosphorylation data collected under 88 different laboratory or physiological conditions. Co-occurring phosphorylation occurs significantly more frequently than randomly expected and include many known examples of cross-talk or functional connections. Such pairs, either within the same phosphoprotein or between interacting partners, are more likely to be in sequence or structural proximity, be phosphorylated by the same kinases, participate in similar biological processes, and show residue co-evolution across vertebrates. In addition, we also found that their co-occurrence states tend to be conserved in orthologous phosphosites in the mouse proteome. Together, our results support that the co-occurring phosphorylation are functionally associated. Comparison with existing methods further suggests that co-occurrence analysis can be a useful complement to uncover novel functional associations between PTM sites.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/e4mrR2lHnOw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Using a DNA polymerase to record intracellular calcium levels has been proposed as a novel neural recording technique, promising massive-scale, single-cell resolution monitoring of large portions of the brain. This technique relies on local storage of neural activity in strands of DNA, followed by offline analysis of that DNA. In simple implementations of this scheme, the time when each nucleotide was written cannot be determined directly by &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt; DNA sequencing; the timing data must be estimated instead. Here, we use a Dynamic Time Warping-based algorithm to perform this estimation, exploiting correlations between neural activity and observed experimental variables to translate DNA-based signals to an estimate of neural activity over time. This algorithm improves the parallelizability of traditional Dynamic Time Warping, allowing several-fold increases in computation speed. The algorithm also provides a solution to several critical problems with the molecular recording paradigm: determining recording start times and coping with DNA polymerase pausing. The algorithm can generally locate DNA-based records to within &amp;lt;10% of a recording window, allowing for the estimation of unobserved incorporation times and latent neural tunings. We apply our technique to an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; motor control neuroscience experiment, using the algorithm to estimate both timings of DNA-based data and the directional tuning of motor cortical cells during a center-out reaching task. We also use this algorithm to explore the impact of polymerase characteristics on system performance, determining the precision of a molecular recorder as a function of its kinetic and error-generating properties. We find useful ranges of properties for DNA polymerase-based recorders, providing guidance for future protein engineering attempts. This work demonstrates a useful general extension to dynamic alignment algorithms, as well as direct applications of that extension toward the development of molecular recorders, providing a necessary stepping stone for future biological work.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tGLlsv46H7c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>DNA replication is a core biological process that occurs in prokaryotic cells at high speeds (∼1 nucleotide residue added per millisecond) and with high fidelity (fewer than one misincorporation event per 107 nucleotide additions).

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The right tool for the right question --- beyond the encoding versus decoding dichotomy. (arXiv:1704.08851v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08851</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08851</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There are two major questions that neuroimaging studies attempt to answer:
First, how are sensory stimuli represented in the brain (which we term the
stimulus-based setting)? And, second, how does the brain generate cognition
(termed the response-based setting)? There has been a lively debate in the
neuroimaging community whether encoding and decoding models can provide
insights into these questions. In this commentary, we construct two simple and
analytically tractable examples to demonstrate that while an encoding model
analysis helps with the former, neither model is appropriate to satisfactorily
answer the latter question. Consequently, we argue that if we want to
understand how the brain generates cognition, we need to move beyond the
encoding versus decoding dichotomy and instead discuss and develop tools that
are specifically tailored to our endeavour.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02703</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02703</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Experimental records of active bundle motility are used to demonstrate the
presence of a low-dimensional chaotic attractor in hair cell dynamics.
Dimensionality tests from dynamic systems theory are applied to estimate the
number of independent variables sufficient for modeling the hair cell response.
Poincare maps are constructed to observe a quasiperiodic transition from chaos
to order with increasing amplitudes of mechanical forcing. The onset of this
transition is accompanied by a reduction of Kolmogorov entropy in the system
and an increase in mutual information between the stimulus and the hair bundle,
indicative of signal detection. A simple theoretical model is used to describe
the observed chaotic dynamics. The model exhibits an enhancement of sensitivity
to weak stimuli when the system is poised in the chaotic regime. We propose
that chaos may play a role in the hair cell's ability to detect low-amplitude
sounds.

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/132506v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We demonstrate a holographic system for simultaneous three-dimensional (3D) two-photon stimulation and imaging of neural activity in the mouse neocortex in vivo with cellular resolution. Dual two-photon excitation paths are implemented with independent 3D targeting for calcium imaging and precision optogenetics. We validate the usefulness of the microscope by photoactivating local pools of interneurons in awake mice visual cortex in 3D, which suppress the nearby pyramidal neurons' response to visual stimuli.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/132423v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We have developed a oblique version of the light sheet microscope to do volumetric imaging of the whole brains at high spatial resolution. Tissue clearing using aqueous techniques reduces the structural rigidity of the brain, To overcome this, we developed a gelatin based re-embedding procedure that makes the brain rigid enough to be sectioned. A few examples of whole brain volumetric images are shown using the oblique light sheet tomography.</description>

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/131698v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/131698v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Optimal brain function depends upon efficient control over the brain entry of blood components; this is provided by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Curiously, some brain-impermeable drugs can still cause behavioral side effects. To investigate this phenomenon, we asked whether the promiscuous drug efflux transporter Mdr1 has dual functions in transporting drugs and endogenous molecules. If this is true, brain-impermeable drugs may cause behavioral side effects by affecting brain levels of endogenous molecules. Using computational, genetic and pharmacologic approaches across diverse organisms we demonstrate that BBB-localized efflux transporters are critical for regulating brain levels of endogenous steroids, and steroid-regulated behaviors (sleep in Drosophila and anxiety in mice). Furthermore, we show that Mdr1-interacting drugs are associated with anxiety-related behaviors in humans. We propose a general mechanism for common behavioral side effects of prescription drugs: pharmacologically challenging BBB efflux transporters disrupts brain levels of endogenous substrates, and implicates the BBB in behavioral regulation.</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Evolution of moments and correlations in non-renewal escape-time processes. (arXiv:1704.08669v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08669</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The theoretical description of non-renewal stochastic systems is a challenge.
Analytical results are often not available or can only be obtained under strong
conditions, limiting their applicability. Also, numerical results have mostly
been obtained by ad-hoc Monte--Carlo simulations, which are usually
computationally expensive when a high degree of accuracy is needed. To gain
quantitative insight into these systems under general conditions, we here
introduce a numerical iterated first-passage time approach based on solving the
time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) to describe the statistics of
non-renewal stochastic systems. We illustrate the approach using
spike-triggered neuronal adaptation in the leaky and perfect integrate-and-fire
model, respectively. The transition to stationarity of first-passage time
moments and their sequential correlations occur on a non-trivial timescale that
depends on all system parameters. Surprisingly this is so for both single
exponential and scale-free power-law adaptation. The method works beyond the
small noise and timescale separation approximations. It shows excellent
agreement with direct Monte Carlo simulations, which allows for the computation
of transient and stationary distributions. We compare different methods to
compute the evolution of the moments and serial correlation coefficients (SCC),
and discuss the challenge of reliably computing the SCC which we find to be
very sensitive to numerical inaccuracies for both the leaky and perfect
integrate-and-fire models. In conclusion, our methods provide a general picture
of non-renewal dynamics in a wide range of stochastic systems exhibiting short
and long-range correlations.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Determining the minimum embedding dimension for state space reconstruction through recurrence networks. (arXiv:1704.08585v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The analysis of observed time series from nonlinear systems is usually done
by making a time-delay reconstruction to unfold the dynamics on a
multi-dimensional state space. An important aspect of the analysis is the
choice of the correct embedding dimension. The conventional procedure used for
this is either the method of false nearest neighbors or the saturation of some
invariant measure, such as, correlation dimension. Here we examine this issue
from a complex network perspective and propose a recurrence network based
measure to determine the acceptable minimum embedding dimension to be used for
such analysis. The measure proposed here is based on the well known
Kullback-Leibler divergence commonly used in information theory. We show that
the measure is simple and direct to compute and give accurate result for short
time series. To show the significance of the measure in the analysis of
practical data, we present the analysis of two EEG signals as examples.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: How the connectivity structure of neuronal networks influences responses to oscillatory stimuli. (arXiv:1704.08372v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08372</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Propagation of oscillatory signals through the cortex and coherence is shaped
by the connectivity structure of neuronal circuits. This study systematically
investigates the network and stimulus properties that shape network responses.
The results show how input to a cortical column model of the primary visual
cortex excites dynamical modes determined by the laminar pattern. Stimulating
the inhibitory neurons in the upper layer reproduces experimentally observed
resonances at gamma frequency whose origin can be traced back to two anatomical
sub-circuits. We develop this result systematically: Initially, we highlight
the effect of stimulus amplitude and filter properties of the neurons on their
response to oscillatory stimuli. Subsequently, we analyze the amplification of
oscillatory stimuli by the effective network structure. We demonstrate that the
amplification of stimuli, as well as their visibility in different populations,
can be explained by specific network patterns. Inspired by experimental results
we ask whether the anatomical origin of oscillations can be inferred by
applying oscillatory stimuli. We find that different network motifs can
generate similar responses to oscillatory input, showing that resonances in the
network response cannot, straightforwardly, be assigned to the motifs they
emerge from. Applying the analysis to a spiking model of a cortical column, we
characterize how the dynamic mode structure, which is induced by the laminar
connectivity, processes external input. In particular, we show that a stimulus
applied to specific populations typically elicits responses of several
interacting modes. The resulting network response is therefore composed of a
multitude of contributions and can therefore neither be assigned to a single
mode nor do the observed resonances necessarily coincide with the intrinsic
resonances of the circuit.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08306</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Information in neural networks is represented as weighted connections, or
synapses, between neurons. This poses a problem as the primary computational
bottleneck for neural networks is the vector-matrix multiply when inputs are
multiplied by the neural network weights. Conventional processing architectures
are not well suited for simulating neural networks, often requiring large
amounts of energy and time. Additionally, synapses in biological neural
networks are not binary connections, but exhibit a nonlinear response function
as neurotransmitters are emitted and diffuse between neurons. Inspired by
neuroscience principles, we present a digital neuromorphic architecture, the
Spiking Temporal Processing Unit (STPU), capable of modeling arbitrary complex
synaptic response functions without requiring additional hardware components.
We consider the paradigm of spiking neurons with temporally coded information
as opposed to non-spiking rate coded neurons used in most neural networks. In
this paradigm we examine liquid state machines applied to speech recognition
and show how a liquid state machine with temporal dynamics maps onto the
STPU-demonstrating the flexibility and efficiency of the STPU for instantiating
neural algorithms.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Continuous parameter working memory in a balanced chaotic neural network. (arXiv:1508.06944v4 [cond-mat.dis-nn] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06944</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06944</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It has been proposed that neural noise in the cortex arises from chaotic
dynamics in the balanced state: in this model of cortical dynamics, the
excitatory and inhibitory inputs to each neuron approximately cancel, and
activity is driven by fluctuations of the synaptic inputs around their mean. It
remains unclear whether neural networks in the balanced state can perform tasks
that are highly sensitive to noise, such as storage of continuous parameters in
working memory, while also accounting for the irregular behavior of single
neurons. Here we show that continuous parameter working memory can be
maintained in the balanced state, in a neural circuit with a simple network
architecture. We show analytically that in the limit of an infinite network,
the dynamics generated by this architecture are characterized by a continuous
set of steady balanced states, allowing for the indefinite storage of a
continuous parameter. In finite networks, we show that the chaotic noise drives
diffusive motion along the approximate attractor, which gradually degrades the
stored memory. We analyze the dynamics and show that the slow diffusive motion
induces slowly decaying temporal cross correlations in the activity, which
differ substantially from those previously described in the balanced state. We
calculate the diffusivity, and show that it is inversely proportional to the
system size. For large enough (but realistic) neural population sizes, and with
suitable tuning of the network connections, the proposed balanced network can
sustain continuous parameter values in memory over time scales larger by
several orders of magnitude than the single neuron time scale.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Mode Of Sucrose Delivery Alters Reward-Related Phasic Dopamine Signals In Nucleus Accumbens</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/132126v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/132126v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine correlates with rewards and reward-predictive cues. However, the mode of reward delivery may have important implications for how reward itself, as well as associated stimuli and behaviours, are encoded by dopamine. We compared two modes of delivery: sucrose pellets, which require goal-directed action for their collection, and intraoral infusions, which require no action. To assess the role of Pavlovian cues in evoking phasic dopamine, rats were trained to associate distinct cues with subsequent delivery of either a sucrose pellet or an intraoral infusion of sucrose solution directly into the mouth. Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry was used to measure phasic dopamine in NAc while rats experienced both cued and uncued rewards within a single session. Behavioural discrimination between pellet-paired and infusion-paired cues was observed with rats making more anticipatory receptacle port entries during pellet-predictive cues than infusion-predictive cues. Both pellet-predictive and infusion-predictive cues evoked dopamine release, however, concordant with the behavioural difference, greater dopamine was evoked by pellet cues than infusion cues. In addition, in cued trials, delivery of pellets increased dopamine above baseline whereas delivery of infusions did not. In uncued trials, both pellets and infusions evoked dopamine release. Responses were generally similar across NAc subregions with core and shell dopamine release appearing qualitatively similar, although dopamine events were broader in shell than in core. Thus, phasic dopamine responses to intraoral infusions and infusion-predictive cues demonstrate a potential role for dopamine in encoding both reward prediction and reward evaluation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: On Neural Code: The Self-Information Processor Disguised As Neuronal Variability?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/132068v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/132068v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>One important goal of BRAIN projects is to crack the neural code: to understand how information is represented in patterns of electrical activity generated by ensembles of neurons. Yet the major stumbling block in the understanding of neural code is neuronal variability - neurons in the brain discharge their spikes with tremendous variability in both the control resting states and across trials within the same experiments. Such on-going spike variability imposes a great conceptual challenge to the classic rate code and/or synchrony-based temporal code. In practice, spike variability is typically removed via over-the-trial averaging methods such as peri-event spike histogram. In contrast to view neuronal variability as a noise problem, here we hypothesize that neuronal variability should be viewed as the self-information processor. Under this conceptual framework, neurons transmit their information by conforming to the basic logic of the statistical Self-Information Theory: spikes with higher-probability inter-spike-intervals (ISI) contain less information, whereas spikes with lower-probability ISIs convey more information, termed as surprisal spikes. In other words, real-time information is encoded not by changes in firing frequency per se, but rather by the probability of spike variability. When these surprisal spikes occur as positive surprisals or negative surprisals in a temporally coordinated manner across populations of cells, they generate cell-assembly neural code to convey discrete quanta of information in real-time. Importantly, such surprisal code can afford not only robust resilience to interference, but also biochemical coupling to energy metabolism, protein synthesis and gene expression at both synaptic sites and cell soma. We describe how this neural self-information theory might be used as a general decoding strategy to uncover various cell assemblies in the brain.</description>

	<description>longitudinals lacking (lola) is among the most complex genes in Drosophila melanogaster, encoding up to twenty protein isoforms and acting as a key transcription factor in axonal pathfinding and neural reprogramming. Most of previous studies employed loss-of-function alleles disrupting common exons of lola, making it difficult to delineate its functions. To address this issue we have generated specific mutations in each isoform using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Our targeted screen allows us to revisit the previously demonstrated roles for few isoforms and to demonstrate a specific function for one variant in axon guidance via activation of the microtubule-associated factor Futsch. Importantly, we also reveal a critical role for a second variant in preventing neurodegeneration via the control of the octopaminergic pathway. This variant is expressed almost exclusively in the octopaminergic cells and is involved in the transcriptional activation of a key enzyme of the pathway. Thus, our comprehensive study greatly expands the functional repertoire of Lola functions, and adds novel insights into the transcriptional regulatory control of neurotransmitter expression in vivo.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/131946v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In many sensory systems the neural signal is coded by multiple parallel pathways, suggesting an evolutionary fitness benefit of general nature. A common pathway splitting is that into ON and OFF cells, responding to stimulus increments and decrements, respectively. According to efficient coding theory, sensory neurons have evolved to an optimal configuration for maximizing information transfer given the structure of natural stimuli and circuit constraints. Using the efficient coding framework, we describe two aspects of neural coding: how to optimally split a population into ON and OFF pathways, and how to allocate the firing thresholds of individual neurons given realistic noise levels, stimulus distributions and optimality measures. We find that populations of ON and OFF neurons convey equal information about the stimulus regardless of the ON/OFF mixture, once the thresholds are chosen optimally, independent of stimulus statistics and noise. However, an equal ON/OFF mixture is the most efficient as it uses the fewest spikes to convey this information. The optimal thresholds and coding efficiency, however, depend on noise and stimulus statistics if information is decoded by an optimal linear readout. With non-negligible noise, mixed ON/OFF populations reap significant advantages compared to a homogeneous population. The best coding performance is achieved by a unique mixture of ON/OFF neurons tuned to stimulus asymmetries and noise. We provide a theory for how different cell types work together to encode the full stimulus range using a diversity of response thresholds. The optimal ON/OFF mixtures derived from the theory accord with certain biases observed experimentally.</description>

	<description>Turtle dorsal cortex provides us with unique insights into cortical processing. It is known to share many features with the mammalian hippocampus and olfactory cortex as well as geniculo-cortical areas in stem amniotes from which mammals evolved. To this end, we have used data from extracellular recordings from microelectrode arrays to study spatial and temporal patterns of responses to visual stimuli as seen in both local field potential and action potentials. We discovered surprisingly large receptive fields, responsiveness to a broad range of stimuli, and high correlation between distant neural ensembles across recording array. Moreover, we found significant response variability regarding latency and strength in the presence of adaptation to both ongoing and visually evoked activity.</description>

	<description>Purpose: The etiology of schizophrenia is extensively debated, and multiple factors have been contended to be involved. A panoramic view of the contributing factors in a genome-wide study can be an effective strategy to provide a comprehensive understanding of its causality. Materials and Methods: GSE53987 dataset downloaded from GEO-database, which comprised mRNA expression data of post-mortem brain tissue across three regions from control and age-matched subjects of schizophrenia (N= Hippocampus (HIP): C-15, T-18, Prefrontal cortex (PFC): C-15, T-19, Associative striatum (STR): C-18, T-18). Bio-conductor  affy package used to compute mRNA expression, and further t-test applied to investigate differential gene expression. The functional and disease association analyses of the derived genes performed using PANTHER Classification System, GeneCards and NCBI database. Results: A set of 40 genes showed significantly altered (p&amp;lt;0.01) expression across all three brain regions (38 protein coding, 2 noncoding). The functional analysis revealed, genes involved in maintaining basic housekeeping functions as catalysis (44.7%), binding (34.2%), and nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity (13.2%), transporter activity (10.50%), enzyme regulation (7.90%), and structural molecule activity (5.3%), and implicated in biological processes and events, and molecular pathways relating basic neuronal functions. The gene set found associated with neoplasm, inflammatory/immune cell, and immunodeficiency/virus-mediated, neurodegenerative and neurological, metabolic, and congenital diseases respectively. Conclusions: The functional analysis of the gene set unravels gross components of the multi-factorial etiology of schizophrenia. The deviant expression of genes maintaining basic cell machinery explains compromised neuronal processing, and associated pathology may involve intricate mechanisms shared with various other diseases.</description>

	<description>The internal brain dynamics that links sensation and action is arguably better studied during animal's natural behaviors. Here we report novel volume imaging and 3D tracking techniques that perform whole brain imaging of neural activities in freely swimming larval zebrafish. We demonstrated the capability of our system through functional imaging of neural activities during visually evoked behavior and prey capture behavior in larval zebrafish.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: 10-Month-Old Infants Are Sensitive To The Time Course Of Perceived Actions: Evidence From A Study Combining Eye-tracking And EEG</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/131516v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Research has shown that infants are able to track a moving target efficiently - even if it is transiently occluded from sight. This basic ability allows prediction of when and where events happen in everyday life. Yet, it is unclear whether, and how, infants internally represent the time course of ongoing movements to derive predictions. In this study, 10-month-old crawlers observed the video of a same-aged crawling baby that was transiently occluded and reappeared in either a temporally continuous or non-continuous manner (i.e., delayed by 500 ms vs. forwarded by 500 ms relative to the real-time movement). Eye movement and rhythmic neural brain activity (EEG) were measured simultaneously. Eye movement analyses showed that infants were sensitive to slight temporal shifts in movement continuation after occlusion. Furthermore, brain activity related to sensorimotor rather than mnemonic processing differed between observation of continuous and non-continuous movements. Early sensitivity to an action's timing may hence be explained within the internal real-time simulation account of action observation. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that 10-month-old infants are well prepared for internal representation of the time course of observed movements that are within the infants' current motor repertoire.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Encoding And Decoding Dynamic Sensory Signals With Recurrent Neural Networks: An Application Of Conceptors To Birdsongs</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/131052v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/131052v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In a constantly changing environment the brain has to make sense of dynamic patterns of sensory input. These patterns can refer to stimuli with a complex and hierarchical structure which has to be inferred from the neural activity of sensory areas in the brain. Such areas were found to be locally recurrently structured as well as hierarchically organized within a given sensory domain. While there is a great body of work identifying neural representations of various sensory stimuli at different hierarchical levels, less is known about the nature of these representations. In this work, we propose a model that describes a way to encode and decode sensory stimuli based on the activity patterns of multiple, recurrently connected neural populations with different receptive fields. We demonstrate the ability of our model to learn and recognize complex, dynamic stimuli using birdsongs as exemplary data. These birdsongs can be described by a 2-level hierarchical structure, i.e. as sequences of syllables. Our model matches this hierarchy by learning single syllables on a first level and sequences of these syllables on a top level. Model performance on recognition tasks is investigated for an increasing number of syllables or songs to recognize and compared to state-of-the-art machine learning approaches. Finally, we discuss the implications of our model for the understanding of sensory pattern processing in the brain. We conclude that the employed encoding and decoding mechanisms might capture general computational principles of how the brain extracts relevant information from the activity of recurrently connected neural populations.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: When do correlations increase with firing rates in recurrent networks?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005506</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrea K. Barreiro, Cheng Ly&lt;/p&gt;

A central question in neuroscience is to understand how noisy firing patterns are used to transmit information. Because neural spiking is noisy, spiking patterns are often quantified via pairwise correlations, or the probability that two cells will spike coincidentally, above and beyond their baseline firing rate. One observation frequently made in experiments, is that correlations can increase systematically with firing rate. Theoretical studies have determined that stimulus-dependent correlations that increase with firing rate can have beneficial effects on information coding; however, we still have an incomplete understanding of what circuit mechanisms do, or do not, produce this correlation-firing rate relationship. Here, we studied the relationship between pairwise correlations and firing rates in recurrently coupled excitatory-inhibitory spiking networks with conductance-based synapses. We found that with stronger excitatory coupling, a positive relationship emerged between pairwise correlations and firing rates. To explain these findings, we used linear response theory to predict the full correlation matrix and to decompose correlations in terms of graph motifs. We then used this decomposition to explain why covariation of correlations with firing rate—a relationship previously explained in feedforward networks driven by correlated input—emerges in some recurrent networks but not in others. Furthermore, when correlations covary with firing rate, this relationship is reflected in low-rank structure in the correlation matrix.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ikUdtITg91g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Two species with similar resource requirements respond in a characteristic way to variations in their habitat—their abundances rise and fall in concert. We use this idea to learn how bacterial populations in the microbiota respond to habitat conditions that vary from person-to-person across the human population. Our mathematical framework shows that habitat fluctuations are sufficient for explaining intra-bodysite correlations in relative species abundances from the Human Microbiome Project. We explicitly show that the relative abundances of closely related species are positively correlated and can be predicted from taxonomic relationships. We identify a small set of functional pathways related to metabolism and maintenance of the cell wall that form the basis of a common resource sharing niche space of the human microbiota.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Wh_9v15ULkA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Personalized glucose forecasting for type 2 diabetes using data assimilation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005232</guid>

Type 2 diabetes leads to premature death and reduced quality of life for 8% of Americans. Nutrition management is critical to maintaining glycemic control, yet it is difficult to achieve due to the high individual differences in glycemic response to nutrition. Anticipating glycemic impact of different meals can be challenging not only for individuals with diabetes, but also for expert diabetes educators. Personalized computational models that can accurately forecast an impact of a given meal on an individual’s blood glucose levels can serve as the engine for a new generation of decision support tools for individuals with diabetes. However, to be useful in practice, these computational engines need to generate accurate forecasts based on limited datasets consistent with typical self-monitoring practices of individuals with type 2 diabetes. This paper uses three forecasting machines: (i) data assimilation, a technique borrowed from atmospheric physics and engineering that uses Bayesian modeling to infuse data with human knowledge represented in a mechanistic model, to generate real-time, personalized, adaptable glucose forecasts; (ii) model averaging of data assimilation output; and (iii) dynamical Gaussian process model regression. The proposed data assimilation machine, the primary focus of the paper, uses a modified dual unscented Kalman filter to estimate states and parameters, personalizing the mechanistic models. Model selection is used to make a personalized model selection for the individual and their measurement characteristics. The data assimilation forecasts are empirically evaluated against actual postprandial glucose measurements captured by individuals with type 2 diabetes, and against predictions generated by experienced diabetes educators after reviewing a set of historical nutritional records and glucose measurements for the same individual. The evaluation suggests that the data assimilation forecasts compare well with specific glucose measurements and match or exceed in accuracy expert forecasts. We conclude by examining ways to present predictions as forecast-derived range quantities and evaluate the comparative advantages of these ranges.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9dbozlTIYLE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Probabilistic Synapses. (arXiv:1410.1029v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1029</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning, especially rapid learning, is critical for survival. However,
learning is hard: a large number of synaptic weights must be set based on
noisy, often ambiguous, sensory information. In such a high-noise regime,
keeping track of probability distributions over weights - not just point
estimates - is the optimal strategy. Here we hypothesize that synapses take
that optimal strategy: they do not store just the mean weight; they also store
their degree of uncertainty - in essence, they put error bars on the weights.
They then use that uncertainty to adjust their learning rates, with higher
uncertainty resulting in higher learning rates. We also make a second,
independent, hypothesis: synapses communicate their uncertainty by linking it
to variability, with more uncertainty leading to more variability. More
concretely, the value of a synaptic weight at a given time is a sample from its
probability distribution. These two hypotheses cast synaptic plasticity as a
problem of Bayesian inference, and thus provide a normative view of learning.
They are consistent with known learning rules, offer an explanation for the
large variability in the size of post-synaptic potentials, and make several
falsifiable experimental predictions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Patterns of interval correlations in neural oscillators with adaptation. (arXiv:1303.1018v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1018</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural firing is often subject to negative feedback by adaptation currents.
These currents can induce strong correlations among the time intervals between
spikes. Here we study analytically the interval correlations of a broad class
of noisy neural oscillators with spike-triggered adaptation of arbitrary
strength and time scale. Our weak-noise theory provides a general relation
between the correlations and the phase-response curve (PRC) of the oscillator,
proves anti-correlations between neighboring intervals for adapting neurons
with type I PRC and identifies a single order parameter that determines the
qualitative pattern of correlations. Monotonically decaying or oscillating
correlation structures can be related to qualitatively different voltage traces
after spiking, which can be explained by the phase plane geometry. At high
firing rates, the long-term variability of the spike train associated with the
cumulative interval correlations becomes small, independent of model details.
Our results are verified by comparison with stochastic simulations of the
exponential, leaky, and generalized integrate-and-fire models with adaptation.

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/131524v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Research on early action perception has documented infants' astounding abilities in tracking, predicting, and understanding other people's actions. Common interpretations of previous findings tend to generalize across a wide range of action stimuli and contexts. In this study, ten-month-old infants repeatedly watched a video of a same-aged crawling baby that was transiently occluded. The video was presented in alternation with videos displaying visually either dissimilar movements (i.e., distorted human, continuous object, and distorted object movements) or similar movements (i.e., delayed or forwarded versions of the crawling video). Eye-tracking behavior and rhythmic neural activity, reflecting attention (posterior alpha), memory (frontal theta), and sensorimotor simulation (central alpha), were concurrently assessed. Results indicate that, when the very same movement was presented in a dissimilar context, it was tracked at more rear parts of the target and posterior alpha activity was elevated, suggesting higher demands on attention-controlled information processing. We conclude that early action perception is not immutable but shaped by the immediate visual context in which it appears, presumably reflecting infants' ability to flexibly adjust stimulus processing to situational affordances.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Avoiding Math On A Rapid Timescale: Emotional Responsivity And Anxious Attention In Math Anxiety</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/131433v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/131433v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Math anxiety (MA) is characterized by negative feelings towards mathematics, resulting in avoidance of math classes and of careers that rely on mathematical skills. Focused on a long timescale, this research may miss important cognitive and affective processes that operate moment-to-moment, changing rapid reactions even when a student simply sees a math problem. Here, using fMRI with an attentional deployment paradigm, we show that MA influences rapid spontaneous emotional and attentional responses to mathematical stimuli upon brief presentation. Critically, participants viewed but did not attempt to solve the problems. Indicating increased threat reactivity to even brief presentations of math problems, increased MA was associated with increased amygdala response during math viewing trials. Functionally and anatomically defined amygdala ROIs yielded similar results, indicating robustness of the finding. Similar to the pattern of vigilance and avoidance observed in specific phobia, behavioral results of the attentional paradigm demonstrated that MA is associated with attentional disengagement for mathematical symbols. This attentional avoidance is specific to math stimuli; when viewing negatively-valenced images, MA is correlated with attentional engagement, similar to other forms of anxiety. These results indicate that even brief exposure to mathematics triggers a neural response related to threat avoidance in highly MA individuals.</description>

	<description>Primates have specialized domains in inferior temporal (IT) cortex that are responsive to particular image categories. Though IT traditionally has been regarded as lacking retinotopy, several recent studies in monkeys have shown that retinotopic maps extend to face patches along the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) in IT cortex. Here, we confirm the presence of visual field maps within and around the lower bank of the STS and extend these prior findings to scene-selective cortex in the ventral-most regions of IT. Within the occipito-temporal sulcus (OTS), we identified two retinotopic areas, OTS1 and OTS2. The polar angle representation of OTS2 was a mirror reversal of the OTS1 representation. These regions contained representations of the contralateral periphery and were selectively active for scene vs. face, body, or object images. The extent of this retinotopy parallels that in humans and shows that the organization of the scene network is preserved across primate species. In addition retinotopic maps were identified in dorsal extrastriate, posterior parietal, and frontal cortex as well as the thalamus, including both the LGN and pulvinar. Taken together, it appears that most, if not all, of the macaque visual system contains organized representations of visual space.</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lesion-deficit association studies are important as they can reveal brain regions essential for specific functions, but sometimes appear to yield conflicting results. We aimed to show how pitfalls of lesions studies can be avoided, and converging results obtained, illustrating from studies of the role of posterior superior temporal gyrus in auditory word comprehension. We review published lesion studies on auditory comprehension and present new data from both acute and chronic stroke that address weaknesses in some previous studies. Results demonstrate how convergence of positive results from diverse lesion studies provides strong evidence for the role of a particular region in a given behavior.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Deafferented Adult Rod Bipolar Cells Create New Synapses with Photoreceptors to Restore Vision</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/17/4635?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Upon degeneration of photoreceptors in the adult retina, interneurons, including bipolar cells, exhibit a plastic response leading to their aberrant rewiring. Photoreceptor reintroduction has been suggested as a potential approach to sight restoration, but the ability of deafferented bipolar cells to establish functional synapses with photoreceptors is poorly understood. Here we use photocoagulation to selectively destroy photoreceptors in adult rabbits while preserving the inner retina. We find that rods and cones shift into the ablation zone over several weeks, reducing the blind spot at scotopic and photopic luminances. During recovery, rod and cone bipolar cells exhibit markedly different responses to deafferentation. Rod bipolar cells extend their dendrites to form new synapses with healthy photoreceptors outside the lesion, thereby restoring visual function in the deafferented retina. Secretagogin-positive cone bipolar cells did not exhibit such obvious dendritic restructuring. These findings are encouraging to the idea of photoreceptor reintroduction for vision restoration in patients blinded by retinal degeneration. At the same time, they draw attention to the postsynaptic side of photoreceptor reintroduction; various bipolar cell types, representing different visual pathways, vary in their response to the photoreceptor loss and in their consequent dendritic restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Loss of photoreceptors during retinal degeneration results in permanent visual impairment. Strategies for vision restoration based on the reintroduction of photoreceptors inherently rely on the ability of the remaining retinal neurons to correctly synapse with new photoreceptors. We show that deafferented bipolar cells in the adult mammalian retina can reconnect to rods and cones and restore retinal sensitivity at scotopic and photopic luminances. Rod bipolar cells extend their dendrites to form new synapses with healthy rod photoreceptors. These findings support the idea that bipolar cells might be able to synapse with reintroduced photoreceptors, thereby restoring vision in patients blinded by retinal degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Presynaptic Group III mGluR Recruits G{beta}{gamma}/SNARE Interactions to Inhibit Synaptic Transmission by Cone Photoreceptors in the Vertebrate Retina</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/17/4618?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;G-protein β subunits (Gβ) interact with presynaptic proteins and regulate neurotransmitter release downstream of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx. To accomplish their roles in sensory signaling, photoreceptor synapses use specialized presynaptic proteins that support neurotransmission at active zone structures known as ribbons. While several G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) influence synaptic transmission at ribbon synapses of cones and other retinal neurons, it is unknown whether Gβ contributes to these effects. We tested whether activation of one particular GPCR, a metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR), can reduce cone synaptic transmission via Gβ in tiger salamander retinas. In recordings from horizontal cells, we found that an mGluR agonist (L-AP4) reduced cone-driven light responses and mEPSC frequency. In paired recordings of cones and horizontal cells, L-AP4 slightly reduced cone I&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; (~10%) and caused a larger reduction in cone-driven EPSCs (~30%). Proximity ligation assay revealed direct interactions between SNAP-25 and Gβ subunits in retinal synaptic layers. Pretreatment with the SNAP-25 cleaving protease BoNT/A inhibited L-AP4 effects on synaptic transmission, as did introduction of a peptide derived from the SNAP-25 C terminus. Introducing Gβ subunits directly into cones reduced EPSC amplitude. This effect was inhibited by BoNT/A, supporting a role for Gβ/SNAP-25 interactions. However, the mGluR-dependent reduction in I&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; was not mimicked by Gβ, indicating that this effect was independent of Gβ. The finding that synaptic transmission at cone ribbon synapses is regulated by Gβ/SNAP-25 interactions indicates that these mechanisms are shared by conventional and ribbon-type synapses. Gβ liberated from other photoreceptor GPCRs is also likely to regulate synaptic transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dynamic regulation of synaptic transmission by presynaptic G-protein coupled receptors shapes information flow through neural circuits. At the first synapse in the visual system, presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) regulate cone photoreceptor synaptic transmission, although the mechanisms and functional impact of this are unclear. We show that mGluRs regulate light response encoding across the cone synapse, accomplished in part by triggering G-protein β subunits (Gβ) interactions with SNAP-25, a core component of the synaptic vesicle fusion machinery. In addition to revealing a role in visual processing, this provides the first demonstration that Gβ/SNAP-25 interactions regulate synaptic function at a ribbon-type synapse, contributing to an emerging picture of the ubiquity of Gβ/SNARE interactions in regulating synaptic transmission throughout the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Synaptotagmin2 (Syt2) Drives Fast Release Redundantly with Syt1 at the Output Synapses of Parvalbumin-Expressing Inhibitory Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/17/4604?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons in the mammalian CNS are specialized for fast transmitter release at their output synapses. However, the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor(s) used by identified inhibitory synapses, including the output synapses of parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons, have only recently started to be addressed. Here, we investigated the roles of Syt1 and Syt2 at two types of fast-releasing inhibitory connections in the mammalian CNS: the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body to lateral superior olive glycinergic synapse, and the basket/stellate cell-Purkinje GABAergic synapse in the cerebellum. We used conditional and conventional knock-out (KO) mouse lines, with viral expression of Cre-recombinase and a light-activated ion channel for optical stimulation of the transduced fibers, to produce Syt1-Syt2 double KO synapses &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Surprisingly, we found that KO of Syt2 alone had only minor effects on evoked transmitter release, despite the clear presence of the protein in inhibitory nerve terminals revealed by immunohistochemistry. We show that Syt1 is weakly coexpressed at these inhibitory synapses and must be genetically inactivated together with Syt2 to achieve a significant reduction and desynchronization of fast release. Thus, our work identifies the functionally relevant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor(s) at fast-releasing inhibitory synapses and shows that two major Syt isoforms can cooperate to mediate release at a given synaptic connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; During synaptic transmission, the influx of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into the presynaptic nerve terminal activates a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor for vesicle fusion, a crucial step in the activity-dependent release of neurotransmitter. Synaptotagmin (Syt) proteins, and especially Syt1 and Syt2, have been identified as the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor at excitatory synapses, but the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor(s) at inhibitory synapses in native brain tissue are not well known. We found that both Syt1 and Syt2 need to be genetically inactivated to cause a significant reduction of activity-evoked release at two types of fast inhibitory synapses in mouse brain. Thus, we identify Syt2 as a functionally important Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor at fast-releasing inhibitory synapses, and show that Syt1 and Syt2 can redundantly control transmitter release at specific brain synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Alcohol Dependence Disrupts Amygdalar L-Type Voltage-Gated Calcium Channel Mechanisms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/17/4593?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/17/4593?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (LTCCs) are implicated in several psychiatric disorders that are comorbid with alcoholism and involve amygdala dysfunction. Within the amygdala, the central nucleus (CeA) is critical in acute alcohol's reinforcing actions, and its dysregulation in human alcoholics drives their negative emotional state and motivation to drink. Here we investigated the specific role of CeA LTCCs in the effects of acute alcohol at the molecular, cellular physiology, and behavioral levels, and their potential neuroadaptation in alcohol-dependent rats. Alcohol increases CeA activity (neuronal firing rates and GABA release) in naive rats by engaging LTCCs, and intra-CeA LTCC blockade reduces alcohol intake in nondependent rats. Alcohol dependence reduces CeA LTCC membrane abundance and disrupts this LTCC-based mechanism; instead, corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 receptors (CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;s) mediate alcohol's effects on CeA activity and drive the escalated alcohol intake of alcohol-dependent rats. Collectively, our data indicate that alcohol dependence functionally alters the molecular mechanisms underlying the CeA's response to alcohol (from LTCC- to CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-driven). This mechanistic switch contributes to and reflects the prominent role of the CeA in the negative emotional state that drives excessive drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The central amygdala (CeA) plays a critical role in the development of alcohol dependence. As a result, much preclinical alcohol research aims to identify relevant CeA neuroadaptions that promote the transition to dependence. Here we report that acute alcohol increases CeA neuronal activity in naive rats by engaging L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) and that intra-CeA LTCC blockade reduces alcohol intake in nondependent rats. Alcohol dependence disrupts this LTCC-based mechanism; instead, corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 receptors (CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;s) mediate alcohol's effects on CeA activity and drive the escalated alcohol intake of alcohol-dependent rats. This switch reflects the important role of the CeA in the pathophysiology of alcohol dependence and represents a new potential avenue for therapeutic intervention during the transition period.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Deficiency in Neuronal TGF-{beta} Signaling Leads to Nigrostriatal Degeneration and Activation of TGF-{beta} Signaling Protects against MPTP Neurotoxicity in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays an important role in the development and maintenance of embryonic dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the midbrain. To study the function of TGF-β signaling in the adult nigrostriatal system, we generated transgenic mice with reduced TGF-β signaling in mature neurons. These mice display age-related motor deficits and degeneration of the nigrostriatal system. Increasing TGF-β signaling in the substantia nigra through adeno-associated virus expressing a constitutively active type I receptor significantly reduces 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration and motor deficits. These results suggest that TGF-β signaling is critical for adult DA neuron survival and that modulating this signaling pathway has therapeutic potential in Parkinson disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We show that reducing Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling promotes Parkinson disease-related pathologies and motor deficits, and increasing TGF-β signaling reduces neurotoxicity of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, a parkinsonism-inducing agent. Our results provide a rationale to pursue a means of increasing TGF-β signaling as a potential therapy for Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Blood Pressure Regulation by the Rostral Ventrolateral Medulla in Conscious Rats: Effects of Hypoxia, Hypercapnia, Baroreceptor Denervation, and Anesthesia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/17/4565?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/17/4565?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Current understanding of the contribution of C1 neurons to blood pressure (BP) regulation derives predominantly from experiments performed in anesthetized animals or reduced &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; preparations. Here, we use ArchaerhodopsinT3.0 (ArchT) loss-of-function optogenetics to explore BP regulation by C1 neurons in intact, unanesthetized rats. Using a lentivirus that expresses ArchT under the Phox2b-activated promoter PRSx8 (PRSx8-ArchT), ~65% of transduced neurons were C1 (balance retrotrapezoid nucleus, RTN). Other rats received CaMKII-ArchT3.0 AAV2 (CaMKII-ArchT), which transduced C1 neurons and larger numbers of unidentified glutamatergic and GABAergic cells. Under anesthesia, ArchT photoactivation reduced sympathetic nerve activity and BP and silenced/strongly inhibited most (7/12) putative C1 neurons. In unanesthetized PRSx8-ArchT-treated rats breathing room air, bilateral ArchT photoactivation caused a very small BP reduction that was only slightly larger under hypercapnia (6% FiCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), but was greatly enhanced during hypoxia (10 and 12% FiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), after sino-aortic denervation, or during isoflurane anesthesia. The degree of hypotension correlated with percentage of ArchT-transduced C1 neurons. ArchT photoactivation produced similar BP changes in CaMKII-ArchT-treated rats. Photoactivation in PRSX8-ArchT rats reduced breathing frequency (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;), whereas &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; increased in CaMKII-ArchT rats. We conclude that the BP drop elicited by ArchT activation resulted from C1 neuron inhibition and was unrelated to breathing changes. C1 neurons have low activity under normoxia, but their activation is important to BP stability during hypoxia or anesthesia and contributes greatly to the hypertension caused by baroreceptor deafferentation. Finally, C1 neurons are marginally activated by hypercapnia and the large breathing stimulation caused by this stimulus has very little impact on resting BP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; C1 neurons are glutamatergic/peptidergic/catecholaminergic neurons located in the medulla oblongata, which may operate as a switchboard for differential, behavior-appropriate activation of selected sympathetic efferents. Based largely on experimentation in anesthetized or reduced preparations, a rostrally located subset of C1 neurons may contribute to both BP stabilization and dysregulation (hypertension). Here, we used Archaerhodopsin-based loss-of-function optogenetics to explore the contribution of these neurons to BP in conscious rats. The results suggest that C1 neurons contribute little to resting BP under normoxia or hypercapnia, C1 neuron discharge is restrained continuously by arterial baroreceptors, and C1 neuron activation is critical to stabilize BP under hypoxia or anesthesia. This optogenetic approach could also be useful to explore the role of C1 neurons during specific behaviors or in hypertensive models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Computational and Neural Basis of Rhythmic Timing in Medial Premotor Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/17/4552?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/17/4552?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neural underpinnings of rhythmic behavior, including music and dance, have been studied using the synchronization-continuation task (SCT), where subjects initially tap in synchrony with an isochronous metronome and then keep tapping at a similar rate via an internal beat mechanism. Here, we provide behavioral and neural evidence that supports a resetting drift-diffusion model (DDM) during SCT. Behaviorally, we show the model replicates the linear relation between the mean and standard-deviation of the intervals produced by monkeys in SCT. We then show that neural populations in the medial premotor cortex (MPC) contain an accurate trial-by-trial representation of elapsed-time between taps. Interestingly, the autocorrelation structure of the elapsed-time representation is consistent with a DDM. These results indicate that MPC has an orderly representation of time with features characteristic of concatenated DDMs and that this population signal can be used to orchestrate the rhythmic structure of the internally timed elements of SCT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The present study used behavioral data, ensemble recordings from medial premotor cortex (MPC) in macaque monkeys, and computational modeling, to establish evidence in favor of a class of drift-diffusion models of rhythmic timing during a synchronization-continuation tapping task (SCT). The linear relation between the mean and standard-deviation of the intervals produced by monkeys in SCT is replicated by the model. Populations of MPC cells faithfully represent the elapsed time between taps, and there is significant trial-by-trial relation between decoded times and the timing behavior of the monkeys. Notably, the neural decoding properties, including its autocorrelation structure are consistent with a set of drift-diffusion models that are arranged sequentially and that are resetting in each SCT tap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: BK Channels Mediate Synaptic Plasticity Underlying Habituation in Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/17/4540?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/17/4540?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Habituation is a basic form of implicit learning and represents a sensory filter that is disrupted in autism, schizophrenia, and several other mental disorders. Despite extensive research in the past decades on habituation of startle and other escape responses, the underlying neural mechanisms are still not fully understood. There is evidence from previous studies indicating that BK channels might play a critical role in habituation. We here used a wide array of approaches to test this hypothesis. We show that BK channel activation and subsequent phosphorylation of these channels are essential for synaptic depression presumably underlying startle habituation in rats, using patch-clamp recordings and voltage-sensitive dye imaging in slices. Furthermore, positive modulation of BK channels &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; can enhance short-term habituation. Although results using different approaches do not always perfectly align, together they provide convincing evidence for a crucial role of BK channel phosphorylation in synaptic depression underlying short-term habituation of startle. We also show that this mechanism can be targeted to enhance short-term habituation and therefore to potentially ameliorate sensory filtering deficits associated with psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Short-term habituation is the most fundamental form of implicit learning. Habituation also represents a filter for inundating sensory information, which is disrupted in autism, schizophrenia, and other psychiatric disorders. Habituation has been studied in different organisms and behavioral models and is thought to be caused by synaptic depression in respective pathways. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, are poorly understood. We here identify, for the first time, a BK channel-dependent molecular synaptic mechanism leading to synaptic depression that is crucial for habituation, and we discuss the significance of our findings for potential treatments enhancing habituation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Early Golgi Abnormalities and Neurodegeneration upon Loss of Presynaptic Proteins Munc18-1, Syntaxin-1, or SNAP-25</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/17/4525?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/17/4525?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The loss of presynaptic proteins Munc18-1, syntaxin-1, or SNAP-25 is known to produce cell death, but the underlying features have not been compared experimentally. Here, we investigated these features in cultured mouse CNS and DRG neurons. Side-by-side comparisons confirmed massive cell death, before synaptogenesis, within 1–4 DIV upon loss of t-SNAREs (syntaxin-1, SNAP-25) or Munc18-1, but not v-SNAREs (synaptobrevins/VAMP1/2/3 using tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT), also in TI-VAMP/VAMP7 knock-out (KO) neurons). A condensed &lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt;Golgi was the first abnormality observed upon Munc18-1 or SNAP-25 loss within 3 DIV. This phenotype was distinct from the Golgi fragmentation observed in apoptosis. Cell death was too rapid after syntaxin-1 loss to study Golgi abnormalities. Syntaxin-1 and Munc18-1 depend on each other for normal cellular levels. We observed that endogenous syntaxin-1 accumulates at the Golgi of Munc18-1 KO neurons. However, expression of a non-neuronal Munc18 isoform that does not bind syntaxin-1, Munc18-3, in Munc18-1 KO neurons prevented cell death and restored normal &lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt;Golgi morphology, but not synaptic transmission or syntaxin-1 targeting. Finally, we observed that DRG neurons are the only Munc18-1 KO neurons that do not degenerate &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. In these neurons, &lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt;Golgi abnormalities were less severe, with no changes in Golgi shape. Together, these data demonstrate that cell death upon Munc18-1, syntaxin-1, or SNAP-25 loss occurs via a degenerative pathway unrelated to the known synapse function of these proteins and involving early &lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt;Golgi abnormalities, distinct from apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study provides new insights in a neurodegeneration pathway triggered by the absence of specific proteins involved in synaptic transmission (syntaxin-1, Munc18-1, SNAP-25), whereas other proteins involved in the same molecular process (synaptobrevins, Munc13–1/2) do not cause degeneration. Massive cell death occurs in cultured neurons upon depleting syntaxin-1, Munc18-1, and/or SNAP-25, well before synapse formation. This study characterizes several relevant cellular phenotypes, especially early &lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt;Golgi abnormalities, distinct from abnormalities observed during apoptosis, and rules out several other phenotypes as causal (defects in syntaxin-1 targeting and synaptic transmission). As proteins, such as syntaxin-1, Munc18-1, or SNAP-25, modulate α-synuclein neuropathy and/or are dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease, understanding this type of neurodegeneration may provide new links between synaptic defects and neurodegeneration in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dynamical Timescale Explains Marginal Stability in Excitability Dynamics</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Action potentials, taking place over milliseconds, are the basis of neural computation. However, the dynamics of excitability over longer, behaviorally relevant timescales remain underexplored. A recent experiment used long-term recordings from single neurons to reveal multiple timescale fluctuations in response to constant stimuli, along with more reliable responses to variable stimuli. Here, we demonstrate that this apparent paradox is resolved if neurons operate in a marginally stable dynamic regime, which we reveal using a novel inference method. Excitability in this regime is characterized by large fluctuations while retaining high sensitivity to external varying stimuli. A new model with a dynamic recovery timescale that interacts with excitability captures this dynamic regime and predicts the neurons' response with high accuracy. The model explains most experimental observations under several stimulus statistics. The compact structure of our model permits further exploration on the network level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Excitability is the basis for all neural computations and its long-term dynamics reveal a complex combination of many timescales. We discovered that neural excitability operates under a marginally stable regime in which the system is dominated by internal fluctuation while retaining high sensitivity to externally varying stimuli. We offer a novel approach to modeling excitability dynamics by assuming that the recovery timescale is itself a dynamic variable. Our model is able to capture a wide range of experimental phenomena using few parameters with significantly higher predictive power than previous models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: SOX9 Is an Astrocyte-Specific Nuclear Marker in the Adult Brain Outside the Neurogenic Regions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/17/4493?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes have in recent years become the focus of intense experimental interest, yet markers for their definitive identification remain both scarce and imperfect. Astrocytes may be recognized as such by their expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, glutamine synthetase, glutamate transporter 1 (GLT1), aquaporin-4, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member L1, and other proteins. However, these proteins may all be regulated both developmentally and functionally, restricting their utility. To identify a nuclear marker pathognomonic of astrocytic phenotype, we assessed differential RNA expression by FACS-purified adult astrocytes and, on that basis, evaluated the expression of the transcription factor SOX9 in both mouse and human brain. We found that SOX9 is almost exclusively expressed by astrocytes in the adult brain except for ependymal cells and in the neurogenic regions, where SOX9 is also expressed by neural progenitor cells. Transcriptome comparisons of SOX9+ cells with GLT1+ cells showed that the two populations of cells exhibit largely overlapping gene expression. Expression of SOX9 did not decrease during aging and was instead upregulated by reactive astrocytes in a number of settings, including a murine model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SOD1G93A), middle cerebral artery occlusion, and multiple mini-strokes. We quantified the relative number of astrocytes using the isotropic fractionator technique in combination with SOX9 immunolabeling. The analysis showed that SOX9+ astrocytes constitute ~10–20% of the total cell number in most CNS regions, a smaller fraction of total cell number than previously estimated in the normal adult brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Astrocytes are traditionally identified immunohistochemically by antibodies that target cell-specific antigens in the cytosol or plasma membrane. We show here that SOX9 is an astrocyte-specific nuclear marker in all major areas of the CNS outside of the neurogenic regions. Based on SOX9 immunolabeling, we document that astrocytes constitute a smaller fraction of total cell number than previously estimated in the normal adult mouse brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Driving Human Motor Cortical Oscillations Leads to Behaviorally Relevant Changes in Local GABAA Inhibition: A tACS-TMS Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/17/4481?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Beta and gamma oscillations are the dominant oscillatory activity in the human motor cortex (M1). However, their physiological basis and precise functional significance remain poorly understood. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to examine the physiological basis and behavioral relevance of driving beta and gamma oscillatory activity in the human M1 using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). tACS was applied using a sham-controlled crossover design at individualized intensity for 20 min and TMS was performed at rest (before, during, and after tACS) and during movement preparation (before and after tACS). We demonstrated that driving gamma frequency oscillations using tACS led to a significant, duration-dependent decrease in local resting-state GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; inhibition, as quantified by short interval intracortical inhibition. The magnitude of this effect was positively correlated with the magnitude of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; decrease during movement preparation, when gamma activity in motor circuitry is known to increase. In addition, gamma tACS-induced change in GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; inhibition was closely related to performance in a motor learning task such that subjects who demonstrated a greater increase in GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; inhibition also showed faster short-term learning. The findings presented here contribute to our understanding of the neurophysiological basis of motor rhythms and suggest that tACS may have similar physiological effects to endogenously driven local oscillatory activity. Moreover, the ability to modulate local interneuronal circuits by tACS in a behaviorally relevant manner provides a basis for tACS as a putative therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Gamma oscillations have a vital role in motor control. Using a combined tACS-TMS approach, we demonstrate that driving gamma frequency oscillations modulates GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; inhibition in the human motor cortex. Moreover, there is a clear relationship between the change in magnitude of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; inhibition induced by tACS and the magnitude of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; inhibition observed during task-related synchronization of oscillations in inhibitory interneuronal circuits, supporting the hypothesis that tACS engages endogenous oscillatory circuits. We also show that an individual's physiological response to tACS is closely related to their ability to learn a motor task. These findings contribute to our understanding of the neurophysiological basis of motor rhythms and their behavioral relevance and offer the possibility of developing tACS as a therapeutic tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cued Memory Retrieval Exhibits Reinstatement of High Gamma Power on a Faster Timescale in the Left Temporal Lobe and Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/17/4472?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Converging evidence suggests that reinstatement of neural activity underlies our ability to successfully retrieve memories. However, the temporal dynamics of reinstatement in the human cortex remain poorly understood. One possibility is that neural activity during memory retrieval, like replay of spiking neurons in the hippocampus, occurs at a faster timescale than during encoding. We tested this hypothesis in 34 participants who performed a verbal episodic memory task while we recorded high gamma (62–100 Hz) activity from subdural electrodes implanted for seizure monitoring. We show that reinstatement of distributed patterns of high gamma activity occurs faster than during encoding. Using a time-warping algorithm, we quantify the timescale of the reinstatement and identify brain regions that show significant timescale differences between encoding and retrieval. Our data suggest that temporally compressed reinstatement of cortical activity is a feature of cued memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We show that cued memory retrieval reinstates neural activity on a faster timescale than was present during encoding. Our data therefore provide a link between reinstatement of neural activity in the cortex and spontaneous replay of cortical and hippocampal spiking activity, which also exhibits temporal compression, and suggest that temporal compression may be a universal feature of memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Regulation of Alcohol Extinction and Cue-Induced Reinstatement by Specific Projections among Medial Prefrontal Cortex, Nucleus Accumbens, and Basolateral Amygdala</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/17/4462?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to inhibit drinking is a significant challenge for recovering alcoholics, especially in the presence of alcohol-associated cues. Previous studies have demonstrated that the regulation of cue-guided alcohol seeking is mediated by the basolateral amygdala (BLA), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, given the high interconnectivity between these structures, it is unclear how mPFC projections to each subcortical structure, as well as projections between BLA and NAc, mediate alcohol-seeking behaviors. Here, we evaluate how cortico-striatal, cortico-amygdalar, and amygdalo-striatal projections control extinction and relapse in a rat model of alcohol seeking. Specifically, we used a combinatorial viral technique to express diphtheria toxin receptors in specific neuron populations based on their projection targets. We then used this strategy to create directionally selective ablations of three distinct pathways after acquisition of ethanol self-administration but before extinction and reinstatement. We demonstrate that ablation of mPFC neurons projecting to NAc, but not BLA, blocks cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking and neither pathway is necessary for extinction of responding. Further, we show that ablating BLA neurons that project to NAc disrupts extinction of alcohol approach behaviors and attenuates reinstatement. Together, these data provide evidence that the mPFC-&amp;gt;NAc pathway is necessary for cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking, expand our understanding of how the BLA-&amp;gt;NAc pathway regulates alcohol behavior, and introduce a new methodology for the manipulation of target-specific neural projections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The vast majority of recovering alcoholics will relapse at least once and understanding how the brain regulates relapse will be key to developing more effective behavior and pharmacological therapies for alcoholism. Given the high interconnectivity of cortical, striatal, and limbic structures that regulate alcohol intake, it has been difficult to disentangle how separate projections between them may control different aspects of these complex behaviors. Here, we demonstrate a new approach for noninvasively ablating each of these pathways and testing their necessity for both extinction and relapse. We show that inputs to the nucleus accumbens from medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala regulate alcohol-seeking behaviors differentially, adding to our understanding of the neural control of alcoholism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Electrocorticographic Dynamics as a Novel Biomarker in Five Models of Epileptogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/17/4450?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Postinjury epilepsy (PIE) is a devastating sequela of various brain insults. While recent studies offer novel insights into the mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis and discover potential preventive treatments, the lack of PIE biomarkers hinders the clinical implementation of such treatments. Here we explored the biomarker potential of different electrographic features in five models of PIE. Electrocorticographic or intrahippocampal recordings of epileptogenesis (from the insult to the first spontaneous seizure) from two laboratories were analyzed in three mouse and two rat PIE models. Time, frequency, and fractal and nonlinear properties of the signals were examined, in addition to the daily rate of epileptiform spikes, the relative power of five frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta, low gamma, and high gamma) and the dynamics of these features over time. During the latent pre-seizure period, epileptiform spikes were more frequent in epileptic compared with nonepileptic rodents; however, this feature showed limited predictive power due to high inter- and intra-animal variability. While nondynamic rhythmic representation failed to predict epilepsy, the dynamics of the theta band were found to predict PIE with a sensitivity and specificity of &amp;gt;90%. Moreover, theta dynamics were found to be inversely correlated with the latency period (and thus predict the onset of seizures) and with the power change of the high-gamma rhythm. In addition, changes in theta band power during epileptogenesis were associated with altered locomotor activity and distorted circadian rhythm. These results suggest that changes in theta band during the epileptogenic period may serve as a diagnostic biomarker for epileptogenesis, able to predict the future onset of spontaneous seizures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Postinjury epilepsy is an unpreventable and devastating disorder that develops following brain injuries, such as traumatic brain injury and stroke, and is often associated with neuropsychiatric comorbidities. As PIE affects as many as 20% of brain-injured patients, reliable biomarkers are imperative before any preclinical therapeutics can find clinical translation. We demonstrate the capacity to predict the epileptic outcome in five different models of PIE, highlighting theta rhythm dynamics as a promising biomarker for epilepsy. Our findings prompt the exploration of theta dynamics (using repeated electroencephalographic recordings) as an epilepsy biomarker in brain injury patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: K+ Channel Kv3.4 Is Essential for Axon Growth by Limiting the Influx of Ca2+ into Growth Cones</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/17/4433?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Membrane excitability in the axonal growth cones of embryonic neurons influences axon growth. Voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (Kv) channels are key factors in controlling membrane excitability, but whether they regulate axon growth remains unclear. Here, we report that Kv3.4 is expressed in the axonal growth cones of embryonic spinal commissural neurons, motoneurons, dorsal root ganglion neurons, retinal ganglion cells, and callosal projection neurons during axon growth. Our &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; (cultured dorsal spinal neurons of chick embryos) and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; (developing chick spinal commissural axons and rat callosal axons) findings demonstrate that knockdown of Kv3.4 by a specific shRNA impedes axon initiation, elongation, pathfinding, and fasciculation. In cultured dorsal spinal neurons, blockade of Kv3.4 by blood depressing substance II suppresses axon growth via an increase in the amplitude and frequency of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx through T-type and L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. Electrophysiological results show that Kv3.4, the major Kv channel in the axonal growth cones of embryonic dorsal spinal neurons, is activated at more hyperpolarized potentials and inactivated more slowly than it is in postnatal and adult neurons. The opening of Kv3.4 channels effectively reduces growth cone membrane excitability, thereby limiting excessive Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx at subthreshold potentials or during Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent action potentials. Furthermore, excessive Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx induced by an optogenetic approach also inhibits axon growth. Our findings suggest that Kv3.4 reduces growth cone membrane excitability and maintains [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; at an optimal concentration for normal axon growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Accumulating evidence supports the idea that impairments in axon growth contribute to many clinical disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, corpus callosum agenesis, Joubert syndrome, Kallmann syndrome, and horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis. Membrane excitability in the growth cone, which is mainly controlled by voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (Cav) and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (Kv) channels, modulates axon growth. The role of Cav channels during axon growth is well understood, but it is unclear whether Kv channels control axon outgrowth by regulating Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx. This report shows that Kv3.4, which is transiently expressed in the axonal growth cones of many types of embryonic neurons, acts to reduce excessive Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx through Cav channels and thus permits normal axon outgrowth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present an error-controlled mesh refinement procedure for needle insertion
simulation and apply it to the simulation of electrode implantation for deep
brain stimulation, including brain shift. Our approach enables to control the
error in the computation of the displacement and stress fields around the
needle tip and needle shaft by suitably refining the mesh, whilst maintaining a
coarser mesh in other parts of the domain. We demonstrate through academic and
practical examples that our approach increases the accuracy of the displacement
and stress fields around the needle without increasing the computational
expense. This enables real-time simulations. The proposed methodology has
direct implications to increase the accuracy and control the computational
expense of the simulation of percutaneous procedures such as biopsy,
brachytherapy, regional anesthesia, or cryotherapy and can be essential to the
development of robotic guidance.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The functional network approach, where fMRI BOLD time series are mapped to
networks depicting functional relationships between brain areas, has opened new
insights into the function of the human brain. In this approach, the choice of
network nodes is of crucial importance. One option is to consider fMRI voxels
as nodes. This results in a large number of nodes, making network analysis and
interpretation of results challenging. A common alternative is to use
pre-defined clusters of anatomically close voxels, Regions of Interest (ROIs).
This approach assumes that voxels within ROIs are functionally similar. Because
these two approaches result in different network structures, it is crucial to
understand what happens to network connectivity when moving from the voxel
level to the ROI level. We show that the consistency of ROIs, defined as the
mean Pearson correlation coefficient between the time series of their voxels,
varies widely in resting-state experimental data. Therefore the assumption of
similar voxel dynamics within each ROI does not generally hold. Further, the
time series of low-consistency ROIs may be highly correlated, resulting in
spurious links in ROI-level networks. Based on these results, we recommend that
averaging BOLD signals over anatomically defined ROIs should be carefully
considered.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Decoding human brain activities via functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) has gained increasing attention in recent years. While encouraging
results have been reported in brain states classification tasks, reconstructing
the details of human visual experience still remains difficult. Two main
challenges that hinder the development of effective models are the perplexing
fMRI measurement noise and the high dimensionality of limited data instances.
Existing methods generally suffer from one or both of these issues and yield
dissatisfactory results. In this paper, we tackle this problem by casting the
reconstruction of visual stimulus as the Bayesian inference of missing view in
a multiview latent variable model. Sharing a common latent representation, our
joint generative model of external stimulus and brain response is not only
&quot;deep&quot; in extracting nonlinear features from visual images, but also powerful
in capturing correlations among voxel activities of fMRI recordings. The
nonlinearity and deep structure endow our model with strong representation
ability, while the correlations of voxel activities are critical for
suppressing noise and improving prediction. We devise an efficient variational
Bayesian method to infer the latent variables and the model parameters. To
further improve the reconstruction accuracy, the latent representations of
testing instances are enforced to be close to that of their neighbours from the
training set via posterior regularization. Experiments on three fMRI recording
datasets demonstrate that our approach can more accurately reconstruct visual
stimuli.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Neurogenesis and multiple plasticity mechanisms enhance associative memory retrieval in a spiking network model of the hippocampus. (arXiv:1704.07526v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal CA3 is crucial for the formation of long-term associative memory.
It has a heavily recurrent connectivity, and memories are thought to be stored
as memory engrams in the CA3. However, despite its importance for memory
storage and retrieval, spiking network models of the CA3 to date are relatively
small-scale, and exist as only proof-of-concept models. Specifically, how
neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus affects memory encoding and retrieval in the
CA3 is not studied in such spiking models. Our work is the first to develop a
biologically plausible spiking neural network model of hippocampal memory
encoding and retrieval, with at least an order-of-magnitude more neurons than
previous models. It is also the first to investigate the effect of neurogenesis
on CA3 memory encoding and retrieval. Using such a model, we first show that a
recently developed plasticity model is crucial for good encoding and retrieval.
Next, we show how neural properties related to neurogenesis and neuronal death
enhance storage and retrieval of associative memories in the CA3. In
particular, we show that without neurogenesis, increasing number of CA3 neurons
are recruited by each new memory stimulus, resulting in a corresponding
increase in inhibition and poor memory retrieval as more memories are encoded.
Neurogenesis, on the other hand, maintains the number of CA3 neurons recruited
per stimulus, and enables the retrieval of recent memories, while forgetting
the older ones. Our model suggests that structural plasticity (provided by
neurogenesis and apoptosis) is required in the hippocampus for memory encoding
and retrieval when the network is overloaded; synaptic plasticity alone does
not suffice. The above results are obtained from an exhaustive study in the
different plasticity models and network parameters.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is a complex network that supports mental function. The
nascent field of network neuroscience applies tools from mathematics to
neuroimaging data in the hopes of shedding light on cognitive function. A
critical question arising from these empirical studies is how to modulate a
human brain network to treat cognitive deficits or enhance mental abilities.
While historically a number of tools have been employed to modulate mental
states (such as cognitive behavioral therapy and brain stimulation),
theoretical frameworks to guide these interventions - and to optimize them for
clinical use - are fundamentally lacking. One promising and as-yet
underexplored approach lies in a sub-discipline of engineering known as network
control theory. Here, we posit that network control fundamentally relates to
mind control, and that this relationship highlights important areas for future
empirical research and opportunities to translate knowledge in practical
domains. We clarify the conceptual intersection between neuroanatomy,
cognition, and control engineering in the context of network neuroscience.
Finally, we discuss the challenges, ethics, and promises of mind control.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce a novel tool for analyzing complex network dynamics, allowing
for cascades of causally-related events, which we call causal webs (c-webs), to
be separated from other non-causally-related events. This tool shows that
traditionally-conceived avalanches may contain mixtures of spatially-distinct
but temporally-overlapping cascades of events, and dynamical disorder or noise.
In contrast, c-webs separate these components, unveiling previously hidden
features of the network and dynamics. We apply our method to mouse cortical
data with resulting statistics which demonstrate for the first time that
neuronal avalanches are not merely composed of causally-related events.

	<description>Development of the forebrain involves the migration of GABAergic interneurons over long distances from ventral into dorsal regions. Although defects in interneuron migration are implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases such as Epilepsy, Autism, and Schizophrenia, model systems to study this process in humans are currently lacking. Here, we describe a method for analyzing human interneuron migration using 3D organoid culture. By fusing cerebral organoids specified toward dorsal and ventral forebrain, we generate a continuous dorsal-ventral axis. Using fluorescent reporters, we demonstrate robust directional GABAergic interneuron migration from ventral into dorsal forebrain. We describe methodology for time lapse imaging of human interneuron migration that is inhibited by the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100. Our results demonstrate that cerebral organoid fusion cultures can model complex interactions between different brain regions. Combined with reprogramming technology, fusions offer a possibility to analyze complex neurodevelopmental defects using cells from neuropsychiatric disease patients, and to test potential therapeutic compounds.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The threshold of binocularity: natural image statistics explain the reduction of visual acuity in peripheral vision.</title>

	<description>Visual acuity is greatest in the centre of the visual field, peaking in the fovea and degrading significantly towards the periphery. The rate of decay of visual performance with eccentricity depends strongly on the stimuli and task used in measurement. While detailed measures of this decay have been made across a broad range of tasks, a comprehensive theoretical account of this phenomenon is lacking. We demonstrate that the decay in visual performance can be attributed to the efficient encoding of binocular information in natural scenes. The efficient coding hypothesis holds that the early stages of visual processing attempt to form an efficient coding of ecologically valid stimuli. Using Independent Component Analysis to learn an efficient coding of stereoscopic images, we show that the ratio of binocular to monocular components varied with eccentricity at the same rate as human stereo acuity and Vernier acuity. Our results demonstrate that the organisation of the visual cortex is dependent on the underlying statistics of binocular scenes and, strikingly, that monocular acuity depends on the mechanisms by which the visual cortex processes binocular information. This result has important theoretical implications for understanding the encoding of visual information in the brain.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Arc Restores Juvenile Plasticity In Adult Mouse Visual Cortex</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/130880v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The molecular basis for the decline in experience-dependent neural plasticity over age remains poorly understood. In visual cortex, the robust plasticity induced in juvenile mice by brief monocular deprivation (MD) during the critical period is abrogated by genetic deletion of Arc, an activity-dependent regulator of excitatory synaptic modification. Here we report that augmenting Arc expression in adult mice prolongs juvenile-like plasticity in visual cortex, as assessed by recordings of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in vivo. A distinguishing characteristic of juvenile OD plasticity is the weakening of deprived-eye responses, believed to be accounted for by the mechanisms of homosynaptic long-term depression (LTD). Accordingly, we also found increased LTD in visual cortex of adult mice with augmented Arc expression, and impaired LTD in visual cortex of juvenile mice that lack Arc or have been treated in vivo with a protein synthesis inhibitor. Further, we found that although activity-dependent expression of Arc mRNA does not change with age, expression of Arc protein is maximal during the critical period and declines in adulthood. Finally, we show that acute augmentation of Arc expression in wild type adult mouse visual cortex is sufficient to restore juvenile-like plasticity. Together, our findings suggest a unifying molecular explanation for the age- and activity-dependent modulation of synaptic sensitivity to deprivation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Individual level reliability of PAS-induced neural plasticity</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/130856v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Objective: We assessed the individual level reliability of neural plasticity changes induced by paired associative stimulation (PAS), which combines peripheral nerve stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation to induce short-term plastic changes in the brain. Methods: For 5 consecutive weeks, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) of 8 healthy subjects were acquired every 10 minutes post-PAS intervention for a period of 60 minutes. The post-PAS MEPs were evaluated against baseline MEPs using permutation and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to determine whether the MEP magnitudes changed after PAS. Moreover, various sample sizes of the MEP data were used to deduce the minimum number of MEPs needed to reliably detect individual propensity to neural plasticity. Results: Group analysis exhibited significant increase in post-PAS MEPs, confirming previous results. While high between-sessions variability was observed at individual level, data show that between 40 to 50 MEPs can reliably assess each subject's responsiveness to PAS. Subjects exhibited three different plasticity patterns: in the modulated hemisphere only, both hemispheres, or neither hemisphere. Conclusions: PAS can reliably assess individual differences in neural plasticity. Significance: A marker of individual plasticity may be useful to predict the effects of a motor rehabilitation, drug or other intervention to increase recovery of function after brain injury.</description>

	<description>Insect nervous systems are proven and powerful model systems for neuroscience research with wide relevance in biology and medicine. However, descriptions of insect brains have suffered from a lack of a complete and uniform nomenclature. Recognising this problem the Insect Brain Name Working Group produced the first agreed hierarchical nomenclature system for the adult insect brain, using Drosophila melanogaster as the reference framework, with other insect taxa considered to ensure greater consistency and expandability (Ito et al., 2014). Ito et al. (2014) purposely focused on the gnathal regions that account for approximately 50% of the adult CNS. We extend this nomenclature system to the sub-gnathal regions of the adult Drosophila nervous system to provide a nomenclature of the so-called ventral nervous system (VNS), which includes the thoracic and abdominal neuromeres that was not included in the original work and contains the neurons that play critical roles underpinning most fly behaviours.</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patient brains with Parkinson's disease or Dementia with Lewy bodies show aggregation of alpha-synuclein in pre-cerebellar brainstem structures. Furthermore, patients exhibit resting tremor, unstable gait and impaired balance which may be associated with cerebellar dysfunction. Therefore, we screened the cerebella of 12 patients with alpha-synucleinopathies for neuropathological changes. Cerebellar nuclei and neighboring white matter displayed numerous aggregates, while lobules were mildly affected. Cerebellar aggregation pathology may suggest a prion-like spread originating from affected precerebellar structures and the high homogeneity between patients with Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease shows that both diseases likely belong to the same neuropathological spectrum.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To assess prognostic factors for a second clinical attack and a first disability worsening event in pediatric clinically isolated syndrome (pCIS) suggestive of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: A cohort of 770 pCIS patients was followed-up for at least 10 years. Cox proportional hazard models and RECursive Partitioning and AMalgamation (RECPAM) tree-regression were used to analyze data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: In pCIS, female sex and a multifocal onset were risk factors for a second clinical attack (HR, 95% CI: 1.28, 1.06-1.55; 1.42, 1.10-1.84, respectively), whereas disease modifying drugs (DMDs) exposure reduced this risk (HR, 95% CI: 0.75, 0.60-0.95). After pediatric onset MS (POMS) diagnosis, age at onset younger than 15 years and DMDs exposure decreased the risk of a first EDSS worsening event (HR, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.42-0.83; 0.75, 0.71-0.80, respectively), whereas the occurrence of relapse/s increased this risk (HR, 95% CI: 5.08, 3.46-7.46).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;An exploratory RECPAM analysis highlighted a significant higher incidence of a first EDSS worsening event in patients with multifocal or isolated spinal-cord or optic neuritis involvement at onset in comparison to those with an isolated supratentorial or brainstem syndrome. A Cox regression model including RECPAM classes confirmed DMDs exposure as the most protective factor against EDSS worsening events and relapses as the most important risk factor for attaining EDSS worsening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: This work represents an important step forward in identifying predictors of unfavorable course in pCIS and POMS and supports a protective effect of early DMDs treatment in preventing MS development and disability accumulation in this population.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Efficient Probabilistic Inference in Generic Neural Networks Trained with Non-Probabilistic Feedback. (arXiv:1601.03060v4 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03060</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03060</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Animals perform near-optimal probabilistic inference in a wide range of
psychophysical tasks. Probabilistic inference requires trial-to-trial
representation of the uncertainties associated with task variables and
subsequent use of this representation. Previous work has implemented such
computations using neural networks with hand-crafted and task-dependent
operations. We show that generic neural networks trained with a simple
error-based learning rule perform near-optimal probabilistic inference in nine
common psychophysical tasks. In a probabilistic categorization task,
error-based learning in a generic network simultaneously explains a monkey's
learning curve and the evolution of qualitative aspects of its choice behavior.
In all tasks, the number of neurons required for a given level of performance
grows sub-linearly with the input population size, a substantial improvement on
previous implementations of probabilistic inference. The trained networks
develop a novel sparsity-based probabilistic population code. Our results
suggest that probabilistic inference emerges naturally in generic neural
networks trained with error-based learning rules.

&lt;p&gt;α-Synuclein is present at high levels in all neurons and their synapses. We now learn that this protein helps dilate the fusion pore, which forms transiently during vesicle exocytosis, promoting release of certain neurotransmitters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capillary endothelial cells sense neuronal activity-evoked increases in extracellular K+ via KIR2.1 inwardly rectifying K+ channels. The ensuing hyperpolarization travels upstream along the vascular network, reaching arterioles and evoking vasodilation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;SUMMARY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We report 5 cases of acute heart failure (AHF) related to multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses. AHF was inaugural in 3 patients, always preceded or accompanied by signs of brainstem dysfunction; it was severe, requiring intensive care management. Echocardiography showed left ventricular hypokinesis. No other cause of AHF has been found. All patients showed a new medullary lesion on brain MRI. All had rapid and complete recovery of ventricular function after intravenous corticosteroids. We concluded to a takotsubo phenomenon. Physicians should be aware of rare cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in MS relapses. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt; To assess the associations of blood biomarkers of carbohydrate, lipid and apolipoprotein metabolisms with the future risk of ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt; In the Apolipoprotein-related MOrtality RISk (AMORIS) study, we enrolled 636,132 men and women during 1985-1996 in Stockholm, Sweden with measurements of serum glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B (apoB), and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). Serum LDL-C and HDL-C were either directly measured or calculated from total cholesterol, triglycerides and apoA-I. The cohort was followed until end of 2011. We used Cox models and mixed-effects models to first estimate the associations between these biomarkers and ALS incidence, and secondly to assess the changes of these biomarkers during the 20 years before ALS diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt; One-unit increase of LDL-C (HR=1.14, 95%CI=1.02-1.27), apoB (HR=1.68, 95%CI=1.17-2.42) and apoB/apoA-I ratio (HR=1.90, 95%CI=1.29-2.78) was associated with a higher incidence of ALS. High glucose level (≥6.11 mmol/L) was associated with a lower incidence (HR=0.62, 95%CI=0.42-0.93), whereas high LDL-C/HDL-C (≥3.50; HR=1.50, 95%CI 1.15-1.96) and high apoB/apoA-I (≥0.90 for men, ≥0.8 for women; HR=1.41, 95%CI 1.04-1.90) ratios were associated with a higher incidence. During the 10 years before diagnosis, ALS patients had increasing levels of LDL-C, HDL-C, apoB and apoA-I, whereas gradually decreasing levels of LDL-C/HDL-C and apoB/apoA-I ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt; Alterations in the carbohydrate, lipid and apolipoprotein metabolisms are associated with ALS risk and may serve as prodromal symptoms decades before ALS diagnosis. The imbalance between apoB and apoA-I as well as between LDL-C and HDL-C may be an etiologic mechanism for ALS and needs to be further studied. This article is protected by copyright.

The rapid development of sequencing technology has led to an explosive accumulation of genomic sequence data. Clustering is often the first step to perform in sequence analy- sis, and hierarchical clustering is one of the most commonly used approaches for this purpose. However, it is currently computationally expensive to perform hierarchical clustering of extremely large sequence datasets due to its quadratic time and space complexities. In this paper we developed a new algorithm called ESPRIT-Forest for parallel hierarchical clustering of sequences. The algorithm achieves subquadratic time and space complexity and maintains a high clustering accuracy comparable to the standard method. The basic idea is to organize sequences into a pseudo-metric based partitioning tree for sub-linear time searching of nearest neighbors, and then use a new multiple-pair merging criterion to construct clusters in parallel using multiple threads. The new algorithm was tested on the human microbiome project (HMP) dataset, currently one of the largest published microbial 16S rRNA sequence dataset. Our experiment demonstrated that with the power of parallel computing it is now compu- tationally feasible to perform hierarchical clustering analysis of tens of millions of sequences.

The formation and stability of synapses are key questions in neuroscience. Post-synaptic domains have been classically conceived as resulting from local insertion and turnover of proteins at the synapse. However, insertion is likely to occur outside the post-synaptic domains and advances in single-molecule imaging have shown that proteins diffuse in the plane of the membrane prior to their accumulation at synapses. We quantitatively investigated this scenario using computer simulations and mathematical analysis, taking for definiteness the specific case of inhibitory synapse components, i.e., the glycine receptors (GlyR) and the associated gephyrin scaffolding protein. The observed domain sizes of scaffold clusters can be explained by a dynamic balance between the aggregation of gephyrin proteins diffusing while bound to GlyR and their turnover at the neuron membrane. We also predict the existence of extrasynaptic clusters with a characteristic size distribution that significantly contribute to the size fluctuations of synaptic domains. New super-resolution data for gephyrin proteins established the existence of extrasynaptic clusters the sizes of which are consistent with the model predictions in a range of model parameters. At a general level, our results highlight aggregation with removal as a non-equilibrium phase separation which produces structures of tunable size.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-0Vh2Pl2bgo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Representational models: A common framework for understanding encoding, pattern-component, and representational-similarity analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005508</guid>

Representational models specify how activity patterns in populations of neurons (or, more generally, in multivariate brain-activity measurements) relate to sensory stimuli, motor responses, or cognitive processes. In an experimental context, representational models can be defined as hypotheses about the distribution of activity profiles across experimental conditions. Currently, three different methods are being used to test such hypotheses: encoding analysis, pattern component modeling (PCM), and representational similarity analysis (RSA). Here we develop a common mathematical framework for understanding the relationship of these three methods, which share one core commonality: all three evaluate the second moment of the distribution of activity profiles, which determines the representational geometry, and thus how well any feature can be decoded from population activity. Using simulated data for three different experimental designs, we compare the power of the methods to adjudicate between competing representational models. PCM implements a likelihood-ratio test and therefore provides the most powerful test if its assumptions hold. However, the other two approaches—when conducted appropriately—can perform similarly. In encoding analysis, the linear model needs to be appropriately regularized, which effectively imposes a prior on the activity profiles. With such a prior, an encoding model specifies a well-defined distribution of activity profiles. In RSA, the unequal variances and statistical dependencies of the dissimilarity estimates need to be taken into account to reach near-optimal power in inference. The three methods render different aspects of the information explicit (e.g. single-response tuning in encoding analysis and population-response representational dissimilarity in RSA) and have specific advantages in terms of computational demands, ease of use, and extensibility. The three methods are properly construed as complementary components of a single data-analytical toolkit for understanding neural representations on the basis of multivariate brain-activity data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/D1EUTvjXL8w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Predicting explorative motor learning using decision-making and motor noise</title>

A fundamental problem faced by humans is learning to select motor actions based on noisy sensory information and incomplete knowledge of the world. Recently, a number of authors have asked whether this type of motor learning problem might be very similar to a range of higher-level decision-making problems. If so, participant behaviour on a high-level decision-making task could be predictive of their performance during a motor learning task. To investigate this question, we studied performance during an explorative motor learning task and a decision-making task which had a similar underlying structure with the exception that it was not subject to motor (execution) noise. We also collected an independent measurement of each participant’s level of motor noise. Our analysis showed that explorative motor learning and decision-making could be modelled as the (approximately) optimal solution to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process bounded by noisy neural information processing. The model was able to predict participant performance in motor learning by using parameters estimated from the decision-making task and the separate motor noise measurement. This suggests that explorative motor learning can be formalised as a sequential decision-making process that is adjusted for motor noise, and raises interesting questions regarding the neural origin of explorative motor learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pwLVQOklUD0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Intrinsically-generated fluctuating activity in excitatory-inhibitory networks</title>

Recurrent networks of non-linear units display a variety of dynamical regimes depending on the structure of their synaptic connectivity. A particularly remarkable phenomenon is the appearance of strongly fluctuating, chaotic activity in networks of deterministic, but randomly connected rate units. How this type of intrinsically generated fluctuations appears in more realistic networks of spiking neurons has been a long standing question. To ease the comparison between rate and spiking networks, recent works investigated the dynamical regimes of randomly-connected rate networks with segregated excitatory and inhibitory populations, and firing rates constrained to be positive. These works derived general dynamical mean field (DMF) equations describing the fluctuating dynamics, but solved these equations only in the case of purely inhibitory networks. Using a simplified excitatory-inhibitory architecture in which DMF equations are more easily tractable, here we show that the presence of excitation qualitatively modifies the fluctuating activity compared to purely inhibitory networks. In presence of excitation, intrinsically generated fluctuations induce a strong increase in mean firing rates, a phenomenon that is much weaker in purely inhibitory networks. Excitation moreover induces two different fluctuating regimes: for moderate overall coupling, recurrent inhibition is sufficient to stabilize fluctuations; for strong coupling, firing rates are stabilized solely by the upper bound imposed on activity, even if inhibition is stronger than excitation. These results extend to more general network architectures, and to rate networks receiving noisy inputs mimicking spiking activity. Finally, we show that signatures of the second dynamical regime appear in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DbZz07hx9B4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recurrent neural network architectures can have useful computational
properties, with complex temporal dynamics. However, evaluation of recurrent
dynamic architectures requires solution of systems of differential equations,
and the number of evaluations required to determine their response to a given
input can vary with the input, or can be indeterminate altogether in the case
of oscillations or instability. In feed-forward networks, by contrast, only a
single pass through the network is needed to determine the response to a given
input. Modern machine-learning systems are designed to operate efficiently on
feed-forward architectures. We hypothesised that two-layer feedforward
architectures with simple, deterministic dynamics could approximate the
responses of single-layer recurrent network architectures. By identifying the
fixed-point responses of a given recurrent network, we trained two-layer
networks to directly approximate the fixed-point response to a given input.
These feed-forward networks then embodied useful computations, including
competitive interactions, information transformations and noise rejection. Our
approach was able to find useful approximations to recurrent networks, which
can then be evaluated in linear and deterministic time complexity.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Firing Cell: An Artificial Neuron with a Simulation of Long-Term-Potentiation-Related Memory. (arXiv:1704.06593v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a computational model of neuron, called firing cell (FC),
properties of which cover such phenomena as attenuation of receptors for
external stimuli, delay and decay of postsynaptic potentials, modification of
internal weights due to propagation of postsynaptic potentials through the
dendrite, modification of properties of the analog memory for each input due to
a pattern of short-time synaptic potentiation or long-time synaptic
potentiation (LTP), output-spike generation when the sum of all inputs exceeds
a threshold, and refraction. The cell may take one of the three forms:
excitatory, inhibitory, and receptory. The computer simulations showed that,
depending on the phase of input signals, the artificial neuron's output
frequency may demonstrate various chaotic behaviors.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Towards a theory of cortical columns: From spiking neurons to interacting neural populations of finite size. (arXiv:1611.00294v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural population equations such as neural mass or field models are widely
used to study brain activity on a large scale. However, the relation of these
models to the properties of single neurons is unclear. Here we derive an
equation for several interacting populations at the mesoscopic scale starting
from a microscopic model of randomly connected generalized integrate-and-fire
neuron models. Each population consists of 50 -- 2000 neurons of the same type
but different populations account for different neuron types. The stochastic
population equations that we find reveal how spike-history effects in
single-neuron dynamics such as refractoriness and adaptation interact with
finite-size fluctuations on the population level. Efficient integration of the
stochastic mesoscopic equations reproduces the statistical behavior of the
population activities obtained from microscopic simulations of a full spiking
neural network model. The theory describes nonlinear emergent dynamics like
finite-size-induced stochastic transitions in multistable networks and
synchronization in balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The
mesoscopic equations are employed to rapidly simulate a model of a local
cortical microcircuit consisting of eight neuron types. Our theory establishes
a general framework for modeling finite-size neural population dynamics based
on single cell and synapse parameters and offers an efficient approach to
analyzing cortical circuits and computations.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Invariant recognition drives neural representations of action sequences. (arXiv:1606.04698v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04698</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04698</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the actions of others from visual stimuli is a crucial aspect of
human visual perception that allows individuals to respond to social cues.
Humans are able to identify similar behaviors and discriminate between distinct
actions despite transformations, like changes in viewpoint or actor, that
substantially alter the visual appearance of a scene. This ability to
generalize across complex transformations is a hallmark of human visual
intelligence. Advances in understanding motion perception at the neural level
have not always translated in precise accounts of the computational principles
underlying what representation our visual cortex evolved or learned to compute.
Here we test the hypothesis that invariant action discrimination might fill
this gap. Recently, the study of artificial systems for static object
perception has produced models, CNNs, that achieve human level performance in
complex discriminative tasks. Within this class of models, architectures that
better support invariant object recognition also produce image representations
that match those implied by human and primate neural data. However, whether
these models produce representations of action sequences that support
recognition across complex transformations and closely follow neural
representations remains unknown. Here we show that spatiotemporal CNNs
appropriately categorize video stimuli into actions, and that deliberate model
modifications that improve performance on an invariant action recognition task
lead to data representations that better match human neural recordings. Our
results support our hypothesis that performance on invariant discrimination
dictates the neural representations of actions computed by human visual cortex.

We investigated whether anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR Abs could be involved in muscle damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24902-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle biopsies of patients were analyzed for atrophy and regeneration by measuring fiber size and by performing immunostaining of neonatal myosin heavy chain. To further understand the role of the Abs in the pathology, we performed muscle cell coculture with the Abs. Atrophy and regeneration were evaluated based on the myotube surface area as well as gene and cytokine profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24902-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In muscle biopsies of patients with anti-SRP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and anti-HMGCR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Abs, a large number of small fibers corresponding to both atrophic and regenerating fibers were observed. In vitro, anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR Abs induced muscle fiber atrophy and increased the transcription of &lt;em&gt;MAFbx&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;TRIM63&lt;/em&gt;. In addition, the muscle fiber atrophy was associated with high levels of inflammatory cytokines: tumor necrosis factor, interleukin (IL)-6, and reactive oxygen species. In the presence of anti-SRP or anti-HMGCR Abs, mechanisms involved in muscle regeneration were also impaired due to a defect of myoblast fusion. This defect was associated with a decreased production of IL-4 and IL-13. The addition of IL-4 and/or IL-13 totally rescued fusion capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24902-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data show that molecular mechanisms of atrophy and regeneration are affected and contribute to loss of muscle function occurring in IMNM. This emphasizes the potential interest of targeted therapies addressing these mechanisms. Ann Neurol 2017;81:538–548&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The neurology of acutely failing respiratory mechanics</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forces involved in breathing—which effectively pull in air—are the diaphragmatic, intercostal, spine, and neck muscles. Equally important is the bulbar musculature maintaining the architecture of a patent airway conduit and abdominal wall and internal intercostal muscles providing cough. Acute injury along a neural trajectory from brainstem to muscle will impair the coordinated interaction between these muscle groups. Acutely failing respiratory mechanics can be caused by central and peripheral lesions. In central lesions, the key lesion is in the nucleus ambiguus innervating the dilator muscles of the soft palate, pharynx, and larynx, but abnormal respiratory mechanics rarely coincide with abnormalities of the respiratory pattern generator. In peripheral lesions, diaphragmatic weakness is a main element, but in many neuromuscular disorders mechanical upper airway obstruction from oropharyngeal weakness contributes equally to an increased respiratory load. The neurology of breathing involves changes in respiratory drive, rhythm, mechanics, and dynamics. This review focuses on the fundamentals of abnormal respiratory mechanics in acute neurologic conditions, bedside judgment, interpretation of additional laboratory tests, and initial stabilization, with practical solutions provided. Many of these respiratory signs are relevant to neurologists, who in acute situations may see these patients first. Ann Neurol 2017;81:485–494&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Olig1 is required for noggin-induced neonatal myelin repair</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24907-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neonatal white matter injury (NWMI) is a lesion found in preterm infants that can lead to cerebral palsy. Although antagonists of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, such as Noggin, promote oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) production after hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury, the downstream functional targets are poorly understood. The basic helix-loop-helix protein, oligodendrocyte transcription factor 1 (Olig1), promotes oligodendrocyte (OL) development and is essential during remyelination in adult mice. Here, we investigated whether &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt; function is required downstream of BMP antagonism for response to injury in the neonatal brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24907-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used wild-type and &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt;-null mice subjected to neonatal stroke and postnatal neural progenitor cultures, and we analyzed Olig1 expression in human postmortem samples from neonates that suffered HI encephalopathy (HIE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24907-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt;-null neonatal mice showed significant hypomyelination after moderate neonatal stroke. Surprisingly, damaged white matter tracts in &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt;-null mice lacked Olig2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; OPCs, and instead proliferating neuronal precursors and GABAergic interneurons were present. We demonstrate that Noggin-induced OPC production requires &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt; function. In postnatal neural progenitors, Noggin governs production of OLs versus interneurons through &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt;-mediated repression of &lt;em&gt;Dlx1/2&lt;/em&gt; transcription factors. Additionally, we observed that Olig1 and the BMP signaling effector, phosphorylated SMADs (Sma- and Mad-related proteins) 1, 5, and 8, were elevated in the subventricular zone of human infants with HIE compared to controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24907-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt; has a critical function in regulation of postnatal neural progenitor cell production in response to Noggin.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Exhaustive search of linear information encoding protein-peptide recognition</title>

High-throughput &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; methods have been extensively applied to identify linear information that encodes peptide recognition. However, these methods are limited in number of peptides, sequence variation, and length of peptides that can be explored, and often produce solutions that are not found in the cell. Despite the large number of methods developed to attempt addressing these issues, the exhaustive search of linear information encoding protein-peptide recognition has been so far physically unfeasible. Here, we describe a strategy, called DALEL, for the exhaustive search of linear sequence information encoded in proteins that bind to a common partner. We applied DALEL to explore binding specificity of SH3 domains in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;. Using only the polypeptide sequences of SH3 domain binding proteins, we succeeded in identifying the majority of known SH3 binding sites previously discovered either &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, we discovered a number of sites with both non-canonical sequences and distinct properties that may serve ancillary roles in peptide recognition. We compared DALEL to a variety of state-of-the-art algorithms in the blind identification of known binding sites of the human Grb2 SH3 domain. We also benchmarked DALEL on curated biological motifs derived from the ELM database to evaluate the effect of increasing/decreasing the enrichment of the motifs. Our strategy can be applied in conjunction with experimental data of proteins interacting with a common partner to identify binding sites among them. Yet, our strategy can also be applied to any group of proteins of interest to identify enriched linear motifs or to exhaustively explore the space of linear information. Finally, we have developed a webserver located at http://michnick.bcm.umontreal.ca/dalel, offering user-friendly interface and providing different scenarios utilizing DALEL.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dW2RiuWYhoY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A dynamic genetic-hormonal regulatory network model explains multiple cellular behaviors of the root apical meristem of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thalian&lt;/i&gt;</title>

The study of the concerted action of hormones and transcription factors is fundamental to understand cell differentiation and pattern formation during organ development. The root apical meristem of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; is a useful model to address this. It has a stem cell niche near its tip conformed of a quiescent organizer and stem or initial cells around it, then a proliferation domain followed by a transition domain, where cells diminish division rate before transiting to the elongation zone; here, cells grow anisotropically prior to their final differentiation towards the plant base. A minimal model of the gene regulatory network that underlies cell-fate specification and patterning at the root stem cell niche was proposed before. In this study, we update and couple such network with both the auxin and cytokinin hormone signaling pathways to address how they collectively give rise to attractors that correspond to the genetic and hormonal activity profiles that are characteristic of different cell types along &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thaliana&lt;/i&gt; root apical meristem. We used a Boolean model of the genetic-hormonal regulatory network to integrate known and predicted regulatory interactions into alternative models. Our analyses show that, after adding some putative missing interactions, the model includes the necessary and sufficient components and regulatory interactions to recover attractors characteristic of the root cell types, including the auxin and cytokinin activity profiles that correlate with different cellular behaviors along the root apical meristem. Furthermore, the model predicts the existence of activity configurations that could correspond to the transition domain. The model also provides a possible explanation for apparently paradoxical cellular behaviors in the root meristem. For example, how auxin may induce and at the same time inhibit WOX5 expression. According to the model proposed here the hormonal regulation of WOX5 might depend on the cell type. Our results illustrate how non-linear multi-stable qualitative network models can aid at understanding how transcriptional regulators and hormonal signaling pathways are dynamically coupled and may underlie both the acquisition of cell fate and the emergence of hormonal activity profiles that arise during complex organ development.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8EgFpp_IOhQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The fight against cancer is hindered by its highly heterogeneous nature. Genome-wide sequencing studies have shown that individual malignancies contain many mutations that range from those commonly found in tumor genomes to rare somatic variants present only in a small fraction of lesions. Such rare somatic variants dominate the landscape of genomic mutations in cancer, yet efforts to correlate somatic mutations found in one or few individuals with functional roles have been largely unsuccessful. Traditional methods for identifying somatic variants that drive cancer are ‘gene-centric’ in that they consider only somatic variants within a particular gene and make no comparison to other similar genes in the same family that may play a similar role in cancer. In this work, we present oncodomain hotspots, a new ‘domain-centric’ method for identifying clusters of somatic mutations across entire gene families using protein domain models. Our analysis confirms that our approach creates a framework for leveraging structural and functional information encapsulated by protein domains into the analysis of somatic variants in cancer, enabling the assessment of even rare somatic variants by comparison to similar genes. Our results reveal a vast landscape of somatic variants that act at the level of domain families altering pathways known to be involved with cancer such as protein phosphorylation, signaling, gene regulation, and cell metabolism. Due to oncodomain hotspots’ unique ability to assess rare variants, we expect our method to become an important tool for the analysis of sequenced tumor genomes, complementing existing methods.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3F8cY6IbcVU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Cheminformatics-aided discovery of small-molecule Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) dual inhibitors of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and Receptor Activator of NF-κB Ligand (RANKL)</title>

We present an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; drug discovery pipeline developed and applied for the identification and virtual screening of small-molecule Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) compounds that act as dual inhibitors of TNF and RANKL through the trimerization interface. The cheminformatics part of the pipeline was developed by combining structure–based with ligand–based modeling using the largest available set of known TNF inhibitors in the literature (2481 small molecules). To facilitate virtual screening, the consensus predictive model was made freely available at: http://enalos.insilicotox.com/TNFPubChem/. We thus generated a priority list of nine small molecules as candidates for direct TNF function inhibition. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; evaluation of these compounds led to the selection of two small molecules that act as potent direct inhibitors of TNF function, with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values comparable to those of a previously-described direct inhibitor (SPD304), but with significantly reduced toxicity. These molecules were also identified as RANKL inhibitors and validated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; with respect to this second functionality. Direct binding of the two compounds was confirmed both for TNF and RANKL, as well as their ability to inhibit the biologically-active trimer forms. Molecular dynamics calculations were also carried out for the two small molecules in each protein to offer additional insight into the interactions that govern TNF and RANKL complex formation. To our knowledge, these compounds, namely T8 and T23, constitute the second and third published examples of dual small-molecule direct function inhibitors of TNF and RANKL, and could serve as lead compounds for the development of novel treatments for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rEIehantWPU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Neuron: Netrin1 Produced by Neural Progenitors, Not Floor Plate Cells, Is Required for Axon Guidance in the Spinal Cord</title>

	<description>Varadarajan et al. show that netrin1 supplied by neural progenitors, not floor plate (FP) cells, guides commissural axons in the developing spinal cord. These findings contrast with the long-held model that the FP supplies a long-range axonal chemoattractant. Rather, netrin1 is produced by neural progenitors and deposited on the pial surface, providing a growth substrate that directs ventrally directed axonal growth.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Tilo Schwalger, Moritz Deger, Wulfram Gerstner&lt;/p&gt;

Neural population equations such as neural mass or field models are widely used to study brain activity on a large scale. However, the relation of these models to the properties of single neurons is unclear. Here we derive an equation for several interacting populations at the mesoscopic scale starting from a microscopic model of randomly connected generalized integrate-and-fire neuron models. Each population consists of 50–2000 neurons of the same type but different populations account for different neuron types. The stochastic population equations that we find reveal how spike-history effects in single-neuron dynamics such as refractoriness and adaptation interact with finite-size fluctuations on the population level. Efficient integration of the stochastic mesoscopic equations reproduces the statistical behavior of the population activities obtained from microscopic simulations of a full spiking neural network model. The theory describes nonlinear emergent dynamics such as finite-size-induced stochastic transitions in multistable networks and synchronization in balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The mesoscopic equations are employed to rapidly integrate a model of a cortical microcircuit consisting of eight neuron types, which allows us to predict spontaneous population activities as well as evoked responses to thalamic input. Our theory establishes a general framework for modeling finite-size neural population dynamics based on single cell and synapse parameters and offers an efficient approach to analyzing cortical circuits and computations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qqiGo_2jYDE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Do-Monte et al. demonstrate that aPVT neurons fire differently when cued reward is available versus omitted. Distinct aPVT efferents bidirectionally regulate sucrose seeking only during reward omission. Whereas aPVT-NAc projections decrease reward seeking, aPVT-amygdala projections increase reward seeking. Photoactivating aPVT neurons abolishes reward seeking.</description>

	<description>Amine neurotransmitters, such as noradrenaline, mediate arousal, attention, and reward in the CNS. New data suggest that, from flies to mammals, a major mechanism for amine transmitter action is to raise astrocyte [Ca2+]i and release gliotransmitters that modulate neuronal activity and behavior.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Robust information propagation through noisy neural circuits</title>

Sensory neurons give highly variable responses to stimulation, which can limit the amount of stimulus information available to downstream circuits. Much work has investigated the factors that affect the amount of information encoded in these population responses, leading to insights about the role of covariability among neurons, tuning curve shape, etc. However, the informativeness of neural responses is not the only relevant feature of population codes; of potentially equal importance is how robustly that information propagates to downstream structures. For instance, to quantify the retina’s performance, one must consider not only the informativeness of the optic nerve responses, but also the amount of information that survives the spike-generating nonlinearity and noise corruption in the next stage of processing, the lateral geniculate nucleus. Our study identifies the set of covariance structures for the upstream cells that optimize the ability of information to propagate through noisy, nonlinear circuits. Within this optimal family are covariances with “differential correlations”, which are known to reduce the information encoded in neural population activities. Thus, covariance structures that maximize information in neural population codes, and those that maximize the ability of this information to propagate, can be very different. Moreover, redundancy is neither necessary nor sufficient to make population codes robust against corruption by noise: redundant codes can be very fragile, and synergistic codes can—in some cases—optimize robustness against noise.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-OtN3PGmSPM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Erroneous energy-generating cycles in published genome scale metabolic networks: Identification and removal</title>

Energy metabolism is central to cellular biology. Thus, genome-scale models of heterotrophic unicellular species must account appropriately for the utilization of external nutrients to synthesize energy metabolites such as ATP. However, metabolic models designed for flux-balance analysis (FBA) may contain thermodynamically impossible energy-generating cycles: without nutrient consumption, these models are still capable of charging energy metabolites (such as ADP→ATP or NADP+→NADPH). Here, we show that energy-generating cycles occur in over 85% of metabolic models without extensive manual curation, such as those contained in the ModelSEED and MetaNetX databases; in contrast, such cycles are rare in the manually curated models of the BiGG database. Energy generating cycles may represent model errors, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;., erroneous assumptions on reaction reversibilities. Alternatively, part of the cycle may be thermodynamically feasible in one environment, while the remainder is thermodynamically feasible in another environment; as standard FBA does not account for thermodynamics, combining these into an FBA model allows erroneous energy generation. The presence of energy-generating cycles typically inflates maximal biomass production rates by 25%, and may lead to biases in evolutionary simulations. We present efficient computational methods (i) to identify energy generating cycles, using FBA, and (ii) to identify minimal sets of model changes that eliminate them, using a variant of the GlobalFit algorithm.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SEq20qtdmn4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Two new studies provide new tools for examining mechanisms of plasticity in dendrites. Tang and Yasuda developed new fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensors for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase A (PKA), which are implicated in synaptic plasticity, primarily by replacing the fluorophore &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans exhibit socially contagious behaviours, including contagious itching, but studying the underlying mechanisms has been difficult. Yu et al. found that they could socially transmit scratching to mice by allowing them to watch mice with chronic itch. The observer mice showed upregulated neuronal activity &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Pharmacoresistant seizures and cytotoxic cerebral edema are serious complications of ischemic and traumatic brain injury. Intraneuronal Cl− concentration ([Cl−]i) regulation impacts on both cell volume homeostasis and Cl−-permeable GABAA receptor-dependent membrane excitability. Understanding the pleiotropic molecular determinants of neuronal [Cl−]i − cytoplasmic impermeant anions, polyanionic extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins, and plasmalemmal Cl− transporters − could help the identification of novel anticonvulsive and neuroprotective targets.</description>

	<description>We sleep almost one-third of our lives and sleep plays an important role in critical brain functions like memory formation and consolidation. The role of sleep in cerebellar processing, however, constitutes an enigma in the field of neuroscience; we know little about cerebellar sleep-physiology, cerebro–cerebellar interactions during sleep, or the contributions of sleep to cerebellum-dependent memory consolidation. Likewise, we do not understand why cerebellar malfunction can lead to changes in the sleep–wake cycle and sleep disorders.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Global Exosome Transcriptome Profiling Reveals Biomarkers for Multiple Sclerosis</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Accumulating evidence supports a role for exosomes in immune regulation. In this study, we investigated the total circulating exosome transcriptome in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients (RRMS) and healthy controls (HC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to define the global RNA profile of serum exosomes in 19 RRMS patients (9 in relapse, 10 in remission) and 10 HC. We analyzed 5 million reads and over 50,000 transcripts per sample, including a detailed analysis of microRNA (miRNA) differentially expressed in RRMS. The discovery set data were validated by quantification using digital quantitative PCR with an independent cohort of 63 RRMS patients (33 in relapse, 30 in remission) and 32 HC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Exosomal RNA NGS revealed that of 15 different classes of transcripts detected 4 circulating exosomal sequences within the miRNA category were differentially expressed in RRMS patients vs HC: hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-196b-5p, hsa-miR-301a-3p and hsa-miR-532-5p. Serum exosomal expression of these miRNA was significantly decreased during relapse in RRMS. These miRNA were also decreased in patients with a gadolinium enhancement on brain magnetic resonance imaging. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; secretion of these miRNA by peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also significantly impaired in RRMS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: These data show that circulating exosomes have a distinct RNA profile in RRMS. Since putative targets for these miRNA include the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and the cell cycle regulator aryl hydrocarbon receptor the data suggest a disturbed cell-to-cell communication in this disease. Thus exosomal miRNA might represent a useful biomarker to distinguish MS relapse. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The immune response of the human brain to abdominal surgery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24909</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24909</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24909-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgery launches a systemic inflammatory reaction that reaches the brain and associates with immune activation and cognitive decline. Although preclinical studies have in part described this systemic-to-brain signaling pathway, we lack information on how these changes appear in humans. This study examines the short- and long-term impact of abdominal surgery on the human brain immune system by positron emission tomography (PET) in relation to blood immune reactivity, plasma inflammatory biomarkers, and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24909-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight males undergoing prostatectomy under general anesthesia were included. Prior to surgery (baseline), at postoperative days 3 to 4, and after 3 months, patients were examined using [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 brain PET imaging to assess brain immune cell activation. Concurrently, systemic inflammatory biomarkers, ex vivo blood tests on immunoreactivity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and cognitive function were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

LPS-induced release of the proinflammatory marker tumor necrosis factor-α in blood displayed a reduction (41 ± 39%) on the 3rd to 4th postoperative day, corresponding to changes in [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 distribution volume. Change in Stroop Color-Word Test performance between postoperative days 3 to 4 and 3 months correlated to change in [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 binding (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.027).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Focused ultrasound as a novel strategy for Alzheimer's disease therapeutics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24933</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of advances in the pathology, genetics and imaging of Alzheimer's disease (AD), there remain no effective treatments that significantly alter its natural history. Several late phase clinical trials, focused largely on amyloid beta metabolism and clearance, have unfortunately demonstrated no significant benefit in early AD patients. Recent work investigating blood-brain barrier opening using focused ultrasound in transgenic animal models has shown that repeated ultrasound administration coupled with microbubble-containing contrast can reduce plaque burden and reverse memory deficits. While the mechanisms underlying plaque clearance are under investigation, this image-guided, noninvasive technique appears promising. This article describes the rationale and underlying principles of focused ultrasound as applied to Alzheimer's disease and suggests that based on promising pre-clinical results, this technology, whether alone or in conjunction with targeted therapies, can be of potential benefit.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Are midsagittal tissue bridges predictive of outcome after cervical spinal cord injury?</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;T2-weighted scans provided data on the extent and dynamics of neuronal tissue damage and midsagittal tissue bridges at the epicenter of traumatic cervical spinal cord lesions in 24 subacute tetraplegic patients. At one month post-injury, smaller lesion area and midsagittal tissue bridges identified those patients with lower extremity evoked potentials and better clinical recovery. Wider midsagittal tissue bridges and smaller lesions at one month post-injury were associated with neurological and functional recovery at 1 year follow-up. Neuroimaging biomarkers of lesion area and midsagittal tissue bridges are potential outcome predictors and patient stratifiers in both subacute and chronic clinical trials.

&lt;p&gt;People have been told that 'brain training' will make them not only better at playing certain games but smarter in general. However, evidence indicates that brain plasticity is specific to the acquired skill. The search for neural mechanisms of transfer of training-induced benefits needs to build on this evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proper construction of neural circuits requires the generation of diverse cell types, their distribution to defined regions, and their specific and appropriate wiring. A major objective in neurobiology has been to understand the molecular determinants that link neural birth to terminal specification and functional &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Deciphering Neural Codes of Memory during Sleep</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30045-0?rss=yes</guid>

	<description>Memories of experiences are stored in the cerebral cortex. Sleep is critical for the consolidation of hippocampal memory of wake experiences into the neocortex. Understanding representations of neural codes of hippocampal–neocortical networks during sleep would reveal important circuit mechanisms in memory consolidation and provide novel insights into memory and dreams. Although sleep-associated ensemble spike activity has been investigated, identifying the content of memory in sleep remains challenging.</description>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors: Dominik R. Bach &amp;amp; Peter Dayan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature and neural implementation of emotions is the subject of vigorous debate. Here, we use Bayesian decision theory to address key complexities in this field and conceptualize emotions in terms of their relationship to survival-relevant behavioural choices. Decision theory indicates which behaviours are optimal &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authors: Ulrike C. Müller, Thomas Deller &amp;amp; Martin Korte&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amyloid precursor protein (APP) gives rise to the amyloid-β peptide and thus has a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. By contrast, the physiological functions of APP and the closely related APP-like proteins (APLPs) remain less well understood. Studying these physiological functions has &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>A growing body of work is investigating the use of mental maps during decision-making. Here we discuss how decision-making organizes experiences according to an internal model of the current task, thereby structuring memory. Likewise, we consider how the structure of mental maps contributes to decision-making.</description>

	<description>Early sensory cortex is typically investigated in response to sensory stimulation, masking the contribution of internal signals. Recently, van Kerkoerle and colleagues reported that attention and memory signals segregate from sensory signals within specific layers of primary visual cortex, providing insight into the role of internal signals in sensory processing.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules of the Immunoglobulin Superfamily Regulate Synapse Formation, Maintenance, and Function</title>

	<description>Immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecules are among the most abundant proteins in vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems. Prominent family members are the neural cell adhesion molecules NCAM and L1, which were the first to be shown to be essential not only in development but also in synaptic function and as key regulators of synapse formation, synaptic activity, plasticity, and synaptic vesicle recycling at distinct developmental and activity stages. In addition to interacting with each other, adhesion molecules interact with ion channels and cytokine and neurotransmitter receptors.</description>
