	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Pitch and timbre discrimination at wave-to-spike transition in the cochlea. (arXiv:1711.05596v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05596</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05596</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A new definition of musical pitch is proposed. A Finite-Difference Time
Domain (FDTM) model of the cochlea is used to calculate spike trains caused by
tone complexes and by a recorded classical guitar tone. All harmonic tone
complexes, musical notes, show a narrow-band Interspike Interval (ISI) pattern
at the respective fundamental frequency of the tone complex. Still this
fundamental frequency is not only present at the bark band holding the
respective best frequency of this fundamental frequency, but rather at all bark
bands driven by the tone complex partials. This is caused by drop-outs in the
basically regular, periodic spike train in the respective bands. These
drop-outs are caused by the energy distribution in the wave form, where time
spans of low energy are not able to drive spikes. The presence of the
fundamental periodicity in all bark bands can be interpreted as pitch. Contrary
to pitch, timbre is represented as a wide distribution of different ISIs over
bark bands. The definition of pitch is shown to also works with residue
pitches. The spike drop-outs in times of low energy of the wave form also cause
undertones, integer multiple subdivisions in periodicity, but in no case
overtones can appear. This might explain the musical minor scale, which was
proposed to be caused by undertones already in 1880 by Hugo Riemann, still
until now without knowledge about any physical realization of such undertones.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Altered structural connectivity of the left visual thalamus in developmental dyslexia. (arXiv:1711.05517v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05517</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05517</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Developmental dyslexia is characterized by persistent reading and spelling
deficits [1]. Partly due to technical challenges with investigating subcortical
sensory structures, current research on dyslexia in humans by-and-large focuses
on the cerebral cortex [2, 3]. These studies found that dyslexia is typically
associated with functional and structural alterations of a distributed
left-hemispheric cerebral cortex network [e.g., 4, 5]. However, findings from
animal models and post-mortem studies in humans suggest that developmental
dyslexia might also be associated with structural alterations in subcortical
sensory pathways [6-12, reviewed in ref. 13]. Whether these alterations also
exist in developmental dyslexia in-vivo and how they relate to dyslexia
symptoms is currently unknown. Here we used ultra-high resolution structural
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI and probabilistic tractography
to investigate the structural connections of the visual sensory pathway in
dyslexia in-vivo. We discovered that individuals with developmental dyslexia
have reduced structural connections in the direct pathway between the left
visual thalamus (LGN) and left middle temporal area V5/MT, but not between the
left LGN and left primary visual cortex (V1). In addition, left V5/MT-LGN
connectivity strength correlated with rapid naming abilities - a key deficit in
dyslexia [14]. These findings provide the first evidence of specific structural
alterations in the connections between the sensory thalamus and cortex in
developmental dyslexia. The results challenge current standard models and
provide novel evidence for the importance of cortico-thalamic interactions in
explaining dyslexia.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Statistical crossover and nonextensive behavior of the neuronal short-term depression. (arXiv:1701.03164v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03164</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The theoretical basis of neuronal coding, associated with short term
degradation in synaptic transmission, is a matter of debate in the literature.
In fact, electrophysiological signals are commonly characterized as inversely
proportional to stimulus intensity. Among theoretical descriptions of this
phenomenon, models based on $1/f$-dependency are employed to investigate the
biophysical properties of the short term synaptic depression. In this work we
formulated a model based on a paradigmatic \textit{q}-differential equation to
obtain a generalized formalism useful for investigation of nonextensivity in
this specific type of synaptic plasticity. Our analysis reveals nonextensivity
in data from electrophysiological recordings and also a statistical crossover
in neurotransmission. In particular, statistical transitions providesadditional
support to the hypothesis of heterogeneous release probability of
neurotransmitters. On the other hand, the simple vesicle model agrees with data
only at low frequency stimulations. Thus, the present work presents a method to
demonstrate that short-term depression is not only governed by random
mechanisms but also by a nonextensive behavior. Our findings also conciliate
morphological and electrophysiological investigations into a coherent
biophysical scenario.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A Bayesian method for detecting pairwise associations in compositional data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005852</guid>

Compositional data consist of vectors of proportions normalized to a constant sum from a basis of unobserved counts. The sum constraint makes inference on correlations between unconstrained features challenging due to the information loss from normalization. However, such correlations are of long-standing interest in fields including ecology. We propose a novel Bayesian framework (BAnOCC: Bayesian Analysis of Compositional Covariance) to estimate a sparse precision matrix through a LASSO prior. The resulting posterior, generated by MCMC sampling, allows uncertainty quantification of any function of the precision matrix, including the correlation matrix. We also use a first-order Taylor expansion to approximate the transformation from the unobserved counts to the composition in order to investigate what characteristics of the unobserved counts can make the correlations more or less difficult to infer. On simulated datasets, we show that BAnOCC infers the true network as well as previous methods while offering the advantage of posterior inference. Larger and more realistic simulated datasets further showed that BAnOCC performs well as measured by type I and type II error rates. Finally, we apply BAnOCC to a microbial ecology dataset from the Human Microbiome Project, which in addition to reproducing established ecological results revealed unique, competition-based roles for Proteobacteria in multiple distinct habitats.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3ybTOXu3yrQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A coupled-oscillator model of olfactory bulb gamma oscillations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005760</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/AGOv1I-gt9I/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Guoshi Li, Thomas A. Cleland&lt;/p&gt;

The olfactory bulb transforms not only the information content of the primary sensory representation, but also its underlying coding metric. High-variance, slow-timescale primary odor representations are transformed by bulbar circuitry into secondary representations based on principal neuron spike patterns that are tightly regulated in time. This emergent fast timescale for signaling is reflected in gamma-band local field potentials, presumably serving to efficiently integrate olfactory sensory information into the temporally regulated information networks of the central nervous system. To understand this transformation and its integration with interareal coordination mechanisms requires that we understand its fundamental dynamical principles. Using a biophysically explicit, multiscale model of olfactory bulb circuitry, we here demonstrate that an inhibition-coupled intrinsic oscillator framework, pyramidal resonance interneuron network gamma (PRING), best captures the diversity of physiological properties exhibited by the olfactory bulb. Most importantly, these properties include global zero-phase synchronization in the gamma band, the phase-restriction of informative spikes in principal neurons with respect to this common clock, and the robustness of this synchronous oscillatory regime to multiple challenging conditions observed in the biological system. These conditions include substantial heterogeneities in afferent activation levels and excitatory synaptic weights, high levels of uncorrelated background activity among principal neurons, and spike frequencies in both principal neurons and interneurons that are irregular in time and much lower than the gamma frequency. This coupled cellular oscillator architecture permits stable and replicable ensemble responses to diverse sensory stimuli under various external conditions as well as to changes in network parameters arising from learning-dependent synaptic plasticity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AGOv1I-gt9I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Common Synaptic Input to Motor Neurons and Neural Drive to Targeted Reinnervated Muscles</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11285?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We compared the behavior of motor neurons innervating their physiological muscle targets with motor neurons from the same spinal segment whose axons were surgically redirected to remnant muscles (targeted muscle reinnervation). The objective was to assess whether motor neurons with nonphysiological innervation receive similar synaptic input and could be voluntary controlled as motor neurons with natural innervation. For this purpose, we acquired high-density EMG signals from the biceps brachii in 5 male transhumeral amputees who underwent targeted reinnervation of this muscle by the ulnar nerve and from the first dorsal interosseous muscle of 5 healthy individuals to investigate the natural innervation of the ulnar nerve. The same recordings were also performed from the biceps brachii muscle of additional 5 able-bodied individuals. The EMG signals were decomposed into discharges of motor unit action potentials. Motor neurons were progressively recruited for the full range of submaximal muscle activation in all conditions. Moreover, their discharge rate significantly increased from recruitment to target activation level in a similar way across the subject groups. Motor neurons across all subject groups received common synaptic input as identified by coherence analysis of their spike trains. However, the relative strength of common input in both the delta (0.5–5 Hz) and alpha (5–13 Hz) bands was significantly smaller for the surgically reinnervated motor neuron pool with respect to the corresponding physiologically innervated one. The results support the novel approach of motor neuron interfacing for prosthesis control and provide new insights into the role of afferent input on motor neuron activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Targeted muscle reinnervation surgically redirects nerves that lost their target in the amputation into redundant muscles in the region of the stump. The study of the behavior of motor neurons following this surgery is needed for designing biologically inspired prosthetic control strategies. Moreover, targeted muscle reinnervation offers a human experimental framework for studying the control and behavior of motor neurons when changing their target innervated muscle fibers and sensory feedback. Here, we show that the control of motor neurons and their synaptic input, following reinnervation, was remarkably similar to that of the physiological innervation, although with reduced common drive at some frequencies. The results advance our knowledge on the role of sensory input in the generation of the neural drive to muscles and provide the basis for designing physiologically inspired methods for prosthesis control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Gain-of-Function Integrin {beta}3 Pro33 Variant Alters the Serotonin System in the Mouse Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11271?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Engagement of integrins by the extracellular matrix initiates signaling cascades that drive a variety of cellular functions, including neuronal migration and axonal pathfinding in the brain. Multiple lines of evidence link the &lt;i&gt;ITGB3&lt;/i&gt; gene encoding the integrin β3 subunit with the serotonin (5-HT) system, likely via its modulation of the 5-HT transporter (SERT). The &lt;i&gt;ITGB3&lt;/i&gt; coding polymorphism Leu33Pro (rs5918, Pl&lt;sup&gt;A2&lt;/sup&gt;) produces hyperactive αvβ3 receptors that influence whole-blood 5-HT levels and may influence the risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using a phenome-wide scan of psychiatric diagnoses, we found significant, male-specific associations between the Pro33 allele and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and ASDs. Here, we used knock-in (KI) mice expressing an &lt;i&gt;Itgb3&lt;/i&gt; variant that phenocopies the human Pro33 variant to elucidate the consequences of constitutively enhanced αvβ3 signaling to the 5-HT system in the brain. KI mice displayed deficits in multiple behaviors, including anxiety, repetitive, and social behaviors. Anatomical studies revealed a significant decrease in 5-HT synapses in the midbrain, accompanied by decreases in SERT activity and reduced localization of SERTs to integrin adhesion complexes in synapses of KI mice. Inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) rescued SERT function in synapses of KI mice, demonstrating that constitutive active FAK signaling downstream of the Pro32Pro33 integrin αvβ3 suppresses SERT activity. Our studies identify a complex regulation of 5-HT homeostasis and behaviors by integrin αvβ3, revealing an important role for integrins in modulating risk for neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The integrin β3 Leu33Pro coding polymorphism has been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) within a subgroup of patients with elevated blood 5-HT levels, linking integrin β3, 5-HT, and ASD risk. We capitalized on these interactions to demonstrate that the Pro33 coding variation in the murine integrin β3 recapitulates the sex-dependent neurochemical and behavioral attributes of ASD. Using state-of-the-art techniques, we show that presynaptic 5-HT function is altered in these mice, and that the localization of 5-HT transporters to specific compartments within the synapse, disrupted by the integrin β3 Pro33 mutation, is critical for appropriate reuptake of 5-HT. Our studies provide fundamental insight into the genetic network regulating 5-HT neurotransmission in the CNS that is also associated with ASD risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Activity-Dependent Facilitation of CaV1.3 Calcium Channels Promotes KCa3.1 Activation in Hippocampal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11255?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1 L-type calcium channels are key to regulating neuronal excitability, with the range of functional roles enhanced by interactions with calmodulin, accessory proteins, or CaMKII that modulate channel activity. In hippocampal pyramidal cells, a prominent elevation of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1 activity is apparent in late channel openings that can last for seconds following a depolarizing stimulus train. The current study tested the hypothesis that a reported interaction among Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 channels, the scaffolding protein densin, and CaMKII could generate a facilitation of channel activity that outlasts a depolarizing stimulus. We found that Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 but not Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 channels exhibit a long-duration calcium-dependent facilitation (L-CDF) that lasts up to 8 s following a brief 50 Hz stimulus train, but only when coexpressed with densin and CaMKII. To test the physiological role for Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 L-CDF, we coexpressed the intermediate-conductance KCa3.1 potassium channel, revealing a strong functional coupling to Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 channel activity that was accentuated by densin and CaMKII. Moreover, the Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3–densin–CaMKII interaction gave rise to an outward tail current of up to 8 s duration following a depolarizing stimulus in both tsA-201 cells and male rat CA1 pyramidal cells. A slow afterhyperpolarization in pyramidal cells was reduced by a selective block of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1 channels by isradipine, a CaMKII blocker, and siRNA knockdown of densin, and spike frequency increased upon selective block of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1 channel conductance. The results are important in revealing a Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3–densin–CaMKII interaction that extends the contribution of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 calcium influx to a time frame well beyond a brief input train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1 L-type calcium channels play a key role in regulating the output of central neurons by providing calcium influx during repetitive inputs. This study identifies a long-duration calcium-dependent facilitation (L-CDF) of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 channels that depends on the scaffolding protein densin and CaMKII and that outlasts a depolarizing stimulus by seconds. We further show a tight functional coupling between Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 calcium influx and the intermediate-conductance KCa3.1 potassium channel that promotes an outward tail current of up to 8 s following a depolarizing stimulus. Tests in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells reveal that a slow AHP is reduced by blocking different components of the Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3-densin-CaMKII interaction, identifying an important role for Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 L-CDF in regulating neuronal excitability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dmrt5, a Novel Neurogenic Factor, Reciprocally Regulates Lhx2 to Control the Neuron-Glia Cell-Fate Switch in the Developing Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11245?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11245?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Regulation of the neuron–glia cell-fate switch is a critical step in the development of the CNS. Previously, we demonstrated that Lhx2 is a necessary and sufficient regulator of this process in the mouse hippocampal primordium, such that Lhx2 overexpression promotes neurogenesis and suppresses gliogenesis, whereas loss of Lhx2 has the opposite effect. We tested a series of transcription factors for their ability to mimic Lhx2 overexpression and suppress baseline gliogenesis, and also to compensate for loss of Lhx2 and suppress the resulting enhanced level of gliogenesis in the hippocampus. Here, we demonstrate a novel function of Dmrt5/Dmrta2 as a neurogenic factor in the developing hippocampus. We show that Dmrt5, as well as known neurogenic factors Neurog2 and Pax6, can each not only mimic &lt;i&gt;Lhx2&lt;/i&gt; overexpression, but also can compensate for loss of Lhx2 to different extents. We further uncover a reciprocal regulatory relationship between Dmrt5 and Lhx2, such that each can compensate for loss of the other. Dmrt5 and Lhx2 also have opposing regulatory control on &lt;i&gt;Pax6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neurog2&lt;/i&gt;, indicating a complex bidirectionally regulated network that controls the neuron–glia cell-fate switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We identify Dmrt5 as a novel regulator of the neuron–glia cell-fate switch in the developing hippocampus. We demonstrate Dmrt5 to be neurogenic, and reciprocally regulated by Lhx2: loss of either factor promotes gliogenesis; overexpression of either factor suppresses gliogenesis and promotes neurogenesis; each can substitute for loss of the other. Furthermore, each factor has opposing effects on established neurogenic genes &lt;i&gt;Neurog2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pax6&lt;/i&gt;. Dmrt5 is known to suppress their expression, and we show that Lhx2 is required to maintain it. Our study reveals a complex regulatory network with bidirectional control of a fundamental feature of CNS development, the control of the production of neurons versus astroglia in the developing hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we confirm that Lhx2 binds a highly conserved putative enhancer of &lt;i&gt;Dmrt5&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved regulatory relationship between these factors. Our findings uncover a complex network that involves Lhx2, Dmrt5, Neurog2, and Pax6, and that ensures the appropriate amount and timing of neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the developing hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Baseline Levels of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep May Protect Against Excessive Activity in Fear-Related Neural Circuitry</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11233?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sleep, and particularly rapid eye movement sleep (REM), has been implicated in the modulation of neural activity following fear conditioning and extinction in both human and animal studies. It has long been presumed that such effects play a role in the formation and persistence of posttraumatic stress disorder, of which sleep impairments are a core feature. However, to date, few studies have thoroughly examined the potential effects of sleep prior to conditioning on subsequent acquisition of fear learning in humans. Furthermore, these studies have been restricted to analyzing the effects of a single night of sleep—thus assuming a state-like relationship between the two. In the current study, we used long-term mobile sleep monitoring and functional neuroimaging (fMRI) to explore whether trait-like variations in sleep patterns, measured in advance in both male and female participants, predict subsequent patterns of neural activity during fear learning. Our results indicate that higher baseline levels of REM sleep predict reduced fear-related activity in, and connectivity between, the hippocampus, amygdala and ventromedial PFC during conditioning. Additionally, skin conductance responses (SCRs) were weakly correlated to the activity in the amygdala. Conversely, there was no direct correlation between REM sleep and SCRs, indicating that REM may only modulate fear acquisition indirectly. In a follow-up experiment, we show that these results are replicable, though to a lesser extent, when measuring sleep over a single night just before conditioning. As such, baseline sleep parameters may be able to serve as biomarkers for resilience, or lack thereof, to trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Numerous studies over the past two decades have established a clear role of sleep in fear-learning processes. However, previous work has focused on the effects of sleep following fear acquisition, thus neglecting the potential effects of baseline sleep levels on the acquisition itself. The current study provides the first evidence in humans of such an effect. Specifically, the results of this study suggest that baseline rapid eye movement (REM) sleep may serve a protective function against enhanced fear encoding through the modulation of connectivity between the hippocampus, amygdala, and the ventromedial PFC. Building on this finding, baseline REM measurements may serve as a noninvasive biomarker for resilience to trauma or, conversely, to the potential development of posttraumatic stress disorder following trauma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sensorimotor Processing in the Basal Ganglia Leads to Transient Beta Oscillations during Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11220?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11220?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brief epochs of beta oscillations have been implicated in sensorimotor control in the basal ganglia of task-performing healthy animals. However, which neural processes underlie their generation and how they are affected by sensorimotor processing remains unclear. To determine the mechanisms underlying transient beta oscillations in the LFP, we combined computational modeling of the subthalamo-pallidal network for the generation of beta oscillations with realistic stimulation patterns derived from single-unit data recorded from different basal ganglia subregions in rats performing a cued choice task. In the recordings, we found distinct firing patterns in the striatum, globus pallidus, and subthalamic nucleus related to sensory and motor events during the behavioral task. Using these firing patterns to generate realistic inputs to our network model led to transient beta oscillations with the same time course as the rat LFP data. In addition, our model can account for further nonintuitive aspects of beta modulation, including beta phase resets after sensory cues and correlations with reaction time. Overall, our model can explain how the combination of temporally regulated sensory responses of the subthalamic nucleus, ramping activity of the subthalamic nucleus, and movement-related activity of the globus pallidus leads to transient beta oscillations during behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Transient beta oscillations emerge in the normal functioning cortico-basal ganglia loop during behavior. Here, we used a unique approach connecting a computational model closely with experimental data. In this way, we achieved a simulation environment for our model that mimics natural input patterns in awake, behaving animals. We demonstrate that a computational model for beta oscillations in Parkinson's disease (PD) can also account for complex patterns of transient beta oscillations in healthy animals. Therefore, we propose that transient beta oscillations in healthy animals share the same mechanism with pathological beta oscillations in PD. This important result connects functional and pathological roles of beta oscillations in the basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dissociation of Self-Motion and Object Motion by Linear Population Decoding That Approximates Marginalization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11204?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11204?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We use visual image motion to judge the movement of objects, as well as our own movements through the environment. Generally, image motion components caused by object motion and self-motion are confounded in the retinal image. Thus, to estimate heading, the brain would ideally marginalize out the effects of object motion (or vice versa), but little is known about how this is accomplished neurally. Behavioral studies suggest that vestibular signals play a role in dissociating object motion and self-motion, and recent computational work suggests that a linear decoder can approximate marginalization by taking advantage of diverse multisensory representations. By measuring responses of MSTd neurons in two male rhesus monkeys and by applying a recently-developed method to approximate marginalization by linear population decoding, we tested the hypothesis that vestibular signals help to dissociate self-motion and object motion. We show that vestibular signals stabilize tuning for heading in neurons with congruent visual and vestibular heading preferences, whereas they stabilize tuning for object motion in neurons with discrepant preferences. Thus, vestibular signals enhance the separability of joint tuning for object motion and self-motion. We further show that a linear decoder, designed to approximate marginalization, allows the population to represent either self-motion or object motion with good accuracy. Decoder weights are broadly consistent with a readout strategy, suggested by recent computational work, in which responses are decoded according to the vestibular preferences of multisensory neurons. These results demonstrate, at both single neuron and population levels, that vestibular signals help to dissociate self-motion and object motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The brain often needs to estimate one property of a changing environment while ignoring others. This can be difficult because multiple properties of the environment may be confounded in sensory signals. The brain can solve this problem by marginalizing over irrelevant properties to estimate the property-of-interest. We explore this problem in the context of self-motion and object motion, which are inherently confounded in the retinal image. We examine how diversity in a population of multisensory neurons may be exploited to decode self-motion and object motion from the population activity of neurons in macaque area MSTd.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Correlated Disruption of Resting-State fMRI, LFP, and Spike Connectivity between Area 3b and S2 following Spinal Cord Injury in Monkeys</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11192?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11192?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study aims to understand how functional connectivity (FC) between areas 3b and S2 alters following input deprivation and the neuronal basis of disrupted FC of resting-state fMRI signals. We combined submillimeter fMRI with microelectrode recordings to localize the deafferented digit regions in areas 3b and S2 by mapping tactile stimulus-evoked fMRI activations before and after cervical dorsal column lesion in each male monkey. An average afferent disruption of 97% significantly reduced fMRI, local field potential (LFP), and spike responses to stimuli in both areas. Analysis of resting-state fMRI signal correlation, LFP coherence, and spike cross-correlation revealed significantly reduced functional connectivity between deafferented areas 3b and S2. The degrees of reductions in stimulus responsiveness and FC after deafferentation differed across fMRI, LFP, and spiking signals. The reduction of FC was much weaker than that of stimulus-evoked responses. Whereas the largest stimulus-evoked signal drop (~80%) was observed in LFP signals, the greatest FC reduction was detected in the spiking activity (~30%). fMRI signals showed mild reductions in stimulus responsiveness (~25%) and FC (~20%). The overall deafferentation-induced changes were quite similar in areas 3b and S2 across signals. Here we demonstrated that FC strength between areas 3b and S2 was much weakened by dorsal column lesion, and stimulus response reduction and FC disruption in fMRI covary with those of LFP and spiking signals in deafferented areas 3b and S2. These findings have important implications for fMRI studies aiming to probe FC alterations in pathological conditions involving deafferentation in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; By directly comparing fMRI, local field potential, and spike signals in both tactile stimulation and resting states before and after severe disruption of dorsal column afferent, we demonstrated that reduction in fMRI responses to stimuli is accompanied by weakened resting-state fMRI functional connectivity (FC) in input-deprived and reorganized digit regions in area 3b of the S1 and S2. Concurrent reductions in local field potential and spike FC validated the use of resting-state fMRI signals for probing neural intrinsic FC alterations in pathological deafferented cortex, and indicated that disrupted FC between mesoscale functionally highly related regions may contribute to the behavioral impairments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Plasticity of Signaling by Spinal Estrogen Receptor {alpha}, {kappa}-Opioid Receptor, and Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors over the Rat Reproductive Cycle Regulates Spinal Endomorphin 2 Antinociception: Relevance of Endogenous-Biased Agonism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11181?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11181?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We previously showed that intrathecal application of endomorphin 2 [EM2; the highly specific endogenous μ-opioid receptor (MOR) ligand] induces antinociception that varies with stage of the rat estrous cycle: minimal during diestrus and prominent during proestrus. Earlier studies, however, did not identify proestrus-activated signaling strategies that enable spinal EM2 antinociception. We now report that in female rats, increased spinal dynorphin release and -opioid receptor (KOR) signaling, as well as the emergence of glutamate-activated metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) signaling, are critical to the transition from an EM2 nonresponsive state (during diestrus) to an analgesically responsive state (during proestrus). Differential signaling by mGluR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, depending on its activation by membrane estrogen receptor α (mERα; during diestrus) versus glutamate (during proestrus), concomitant with the ebb and flow of spinal dynorphin/KOR signaling, functions as a switch, preventing or promoting, respectively, spinal EM2 antinociception. Importantly, EM2 and glutamate-containing varicosities appose spinal neurons that express MOR along with mGluRs and mERα, suggesting that signaling mechanisms regulating analgesic effectiveness of intrathecally applied EM2 also pertain to endogenous EM2. Regulation of spinal EM2 antinociception by both the nature of the endogenous mGluR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; activator (i.e., endogenous biased agonism at mGluR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and changes in spinal dynorphin/KOR signaling represent a novel mechanism for modulating analgesic responsiveness to endogenous EM2 (and perhaps other opioids). This points the way for developing noncanonical pharmacological approaches to pain management by harnessing endogenous opioids for pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The current prescription opioid abuse epidemic underscores the urgency to develop alternative pharmacotherapies for managing pain. We find that the magnitude of spinal endomorphin 2 (EM2) antinociception not only varies with stage of reproductive cycle, but is also differentially regulated during diestrus and proestrus. This finding highlights the need for sex-specific and cycle-specific approaches to pain management. Additionally, our finding that spinal EM2 antinociception in female rats is regulated by both the ebb and flow of spinal dynorphin/-opioid receptor signaling over the estrous cycle, as well as the nature of the endogenous mGluR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; activator, could encourage noncanonical pharmacological approaches to pain management, such as harnessing endogenous opioids for pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distinctive Modulation of Dopamine Release in the Nucleus Accumbens Shell Mediated by Dopamine and Acetylcholine Receptors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11166?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11166?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell shows unique dopamine (DA) signals &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and plays a unique role in DA-dependent behaviors such as reward-motivated learning and the response to drugs of abuse. A disynaptic mechanism for DA release was reported and shown to require synchronized firing of cholinergic interneurons (CINs) and activation of nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (nAChRs) in DA neuron (DAN) axons. The properties of this disynaptic mechanism of DA transmission are not well understood in the NAc shell. In this study, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; fast-scan cyclic voltammetry was used to examine the modulation of DA transmission evoked by CINs firing in the shell of mice and compared with other striatal regions. We found that DA signals in the shell displayed significant degree of summation in response to train stimulation of CINs, contrary to core and dorsal striatum. The summation was amplified by a D2-like receptor antagonist and experiments with mice with targeted deletion of D2 receptors to DANs or CINs revealed that D2 receptors in CINs mediate a fast inhibition observed within 100 ms of the first pulse, whereas D2 autoreceptors in DAN terminals are engaged in a slower inhibition that peaks at ~500 ms. ACh also contributes to the use-dependent inhibition of DA release through muscarinic receptors only in the shell, where higher activity of acetylcholinesterase minimizes nAChR desensitization and promotes summation. These findings show that DA signals are modulated differentially by endogenous DA and ACh in the shell, which may underlie the unique features of shell DA signals &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The present study reports that dopamine (DA) release evoked by activation of cholinergic interneurons displays a high degree of summation in the shell and shows unique modulation by endogenous DA and acetylcholine. Desensitization of nicotinic receptors, which is a prevailing mechanism for use-dependent inhibition in the nucleus accumbens core and dorsal striatum, is also minimal in the shell in part due to elevated acetylcholinesterase activity. This distinctive modulation of DA transmission in the shell may have functional implications in the acquisition of reward-motivated behaviors and reward seeking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mitochondrial Calcium Dysregulation Contributes to Dendrite Degeneration Mediated by PD/LBD-Associated LRRK2 Mutants</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11151?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11151?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) contribute to development of late-onset familial Parkinson's disease (PD), with clinical features of motor and cognitive dysfunction indistinguishable from sporadic PD. Calcium dysregulation plays an important role in PD pathogenesis, but the mechanisms of neurodegeneration remain unclear. Recent reports indicate enhanced excitatory neurotransmission in cortical neurons expressing mutant LRRK2, which occurs before the well-characterized phenotype of dendritic shortening. As mitochondria play a major role in the rapid buffering of cytosolic calcium, we hypothesized that altered mitochondrial calcium handling contributes to dendritic retraction elicited by the LRRK2-G2019S and -R1441C mutations. In primary mouse cortical neurons, we observed increased depolarization-induced mitochondrial calcium uptake. We found that expression of mutant LRRK2 elicited transcriptional upregulation of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and the mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 protein (MICU1) with no change in levels of the mitochondrial calcium antiporter NCLX. Elevated MCU and MICU1 were also observed in LRRK2-mutated patient fibroblasts, along with increased mitochondrial calcium uptake, and in postmortem brains of sporadic PD/PDD patients of both sexes. Transcriptional upregulation of MCU and MICU1 was caused by activation of the ERK1/2 (MAPK3/1) pathway. Inhibiting ERK1/2 conferred protection against mutant LRRK2-induced neurite shortening. Pharmacological inhibitors or RNAi knockdown of MCU attenuated mitochondrial calcium uptake and dendritic/neuritic shortening elicited by mutant LRRK2, whereas expression of a constitutively active mutant of NCLX that enhances calcium export from mitochondria was neuroprotective. These data suggest that an increased susceptibility to mitochondrial calcium dysregulation contributes to dendritic injury in mutant LRRK2 pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cognitive dysfunction and dementia are common features of Parkinson's disease (PD), causing significant disability. Mutations in LRRK2 represent the most common known genetic cause of PD. We found that PD-linked LRRK2 mutations increased dendritic and mitochondrial calcium uptake in cortical neurons and familial PD patient fibroblasts, accompanied by increased expression of the mitochondrial calcium transporter MCU. Blocking the ERK1/2-dependent upregulation of MCU conferred protection against mutant LRRK2-elicited dendrite shortening, as did inhibiting MCU-mediated calcium import. Conversely, stimulating the export of calcium from mitochondria was also neuroprotective. These results implicate increased susceptibility to mitochondrial calcium overload in LRRK2-driven neurodegeneration, and suggest possible interventions that may slow the progression of cognitive dysfunction in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Overactivity of Liver-Related Neurons in the Paraventricular Nucleus of the Hypothalamus: Electrophysiological Findings in db/db Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11140?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11140?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Preautonomic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus play a large role in the regulation of hepatic functions via the autonomic nervous system. Activation of hepatic sympathetic nerves increases glucose and lipid metabolism and contributes to the elevated hepatic glucose production observed in the type 2 diabetic condition. This augmented sympathetic output could originate from altered activity of liver-related PVN neurons. Remarkably, despite the importance of the brain-liver pathway, the cellular properties of liver-related neurons are not known. In this study, we provide the first evidence of overall activity of liver-related PVN neurons. Liver-related PVN neurons were identified with a retrograde, trans-synaptic, viral tracer in male lean and &lt;i&gt;db/db&lt;/i&gt; mice and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were conducted. In &lt;i&gt;db/db&lt;/i&gt; mice, the majority of liver-related PVN neurons fired spontaneously; whereas, in lean mice the majority of liver-related PVN neurons were silent, indicating that liver-related PVN neurons are more active in &lt;i&gt;db/db&lt;/i&gt; mice. Persistent, tonic inhibition was identified in liver-related PVN neurons; although, the magnitude of tonic inhibitory control was not different between lean and &lt;i&gt;db/db&lt;/i&gt; mice. In addition, our study revealed that the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1-dependent increase of excitatory neurotransmission was reduced in liver-related PVN neurons of &lt;i&gt;db/db&lt;/i&gt; mice. These findings demonstrate plasticity of liver-related PVN neurons and a shift toward excitation in a diabetic mouse model. Our study suggests altered autonomic circuits at the level of the PVN, which can contribute to autonomic dysfunction and dysregulation of neural control of hepatic functions including glucose metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A growing body of evidence suggests the importance of the autonomic control in the regulation of hepatic metabolism, which plays a major role in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Despite the importance of the brain-liver pathway, the overall activity of liver-related neurons in control and diabetic conditions is not known. This is a significant gap in knowledge, which prevents developing strategies to improve glucose homeostasis via altering the brain-liver pathway. One of the key findings of our study is the overall shift toward excitation in liver-related hypothalamic neurons in the diabetic condition. This overactivity may be one of the underlying mechanisms of elevated sympathetic activity known in metabolically compromised patients and animal models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cadherin-10 Maintains Excitatory/Inhibitory Ratio through Interactions with Synaptic Proteins</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11127?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Appropriate excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance is essential for normal cortical function and is altered in some psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Cell-autonomous molecular mechanisms that control the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synapse function remain poorly understood; no proteins that regulate excitatory and inhibitory synapse strength in a coordinated reciprocal manner have been identified. Using super-resolution imaging, electrophysiology, and molecular manipulations, we show that cadherin-10, encoded by &lt;i&gt;CDH10&lt;/i&gt; within the ASD risk locus 5p14.1, maintains both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic scaffold structure in cultured cortical neurons from rats of both sexes. Cadherin-10 localizes to both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in neocortex, where it is organized into nanoscale puncta that influence the size of their associated PSDs. Knockdown of cadherin-10 reduces excitatory but increases inhibitory synapse size and strength, altering the E/I ratio in cortical neurons. Furthermore, cadherin-10 exhibits differential participation in complexes with PSD-95 and gephyrin, which may underlie its role in maintaining the E/I ratio. Our data provide a new mechanism whereby a protein encoded by a common ASD risk factor controls E/I ratios by regulating excitatory and inhibitory synapses in opposing directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The correct balance between excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) is crucial for normal brain function and is altered in psychiatric disorders such as autism. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie this balance remain elusive. To address this, we studied cadherin-10, an adhesion protein that is genetically linked to autism and understudied at the cellular level. Using a combination of advanced microscopy techniques and electrophysiology, we show that cadherin-10 forms nanoscale puncta at excitatory and inhibitory synapses, maintains excitatory and inhibitory synaptic structure, and is essential for maintaining the correct balance between excitation and inhibition in neuronal dendrites. These findings reveal a new mechanism by which E/I balance is controlled in neurons and may bear relevance to synaptic dysfunction in autism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Classical and systems genetics have identified wide networks of genes associated with cognitive and neurodevelopmental diseases. In parallel to deciphering the role of each of these genes in neuronal or synaptic function, evaluating the response of neuronal and molecular networks to gene loss of function could reveal some pathophysiological mechanisms potentially accessible to nongenetic therapies. Loss of function of the Rho-GAP oligophrenin-1 is associated with cognitive impairments in both human and mouse. Upregulation of both PKA and ROCK has been reported in &lt;i&gt;Ophn1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice, but it remains unclear whether kinase hyperactivity contributes to the behavioral phenotypes. In this study, we thoroughly characterized a prominent perseveration phenotype displayed by &lt;i&gt;Ophn1&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice using a Y-maze spatial working memory (SWM) test. We report that &lt;i&gt;Ophn1&lt;/i&gt; deficiency in the mouse generated severe cognitive impairments, characterized by both a high occurrence of perseverative behaviors and a lack of deliberation during the SWM test. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; pharmacological experiments suggest that PKA dysregulation in the mPFC underlies cognitive dysfunction in &lt;i&gt;Ophn1&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice, as assessed using a delayed spatial alternation task results. Functionally, mPFC neuronal networks appeared to be affected in a PKA-dependent manner, whereas hippocampal-PFC projections involved in SWM were not affected in &lt;i&gt;Ophn1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/y&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Thus, we propose that discrete gene mutations in intellectual disability might generate &quot;secondary&quot; pathophysiological mechanisms, which are prone to become pharmacological targets for curative strategies in adult patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we report that &lt;i&gt;Ophn1&lt;/i&gt; deficiency generates severe impairments in performance at spatial working memory tests, characterized by a high occurrence of perseverative behaviors and a lack of decision making. This cognitive deficit is consecutive to PKA deregulation in the mPFC that prevents &lt;i&gt;Ophn1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice to exploit a correctly acquired rule. Functionally, mPFC neuronal networks appear to be affected in a PKA-dependent manner, whereas behaviorally important hippocampal projections were preserved by the mutation. Thus, we propose that discrete gene mutations in intellectual disability can generate &quot;secondary&quot; pathophysiological mechanisms prone to become pharmacological targets for curative strategies in adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Strength of Temporal White Matter Pathways Predicts Semantic Learning</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning the associations between words and meanings is a fundamental human ability. Although the language network is cortically well defined, the role of the white matter pathways supporting novel word-to-meaning mappings remains unclear. Here, by using contextual and cross-situational word learning, we tested whether learning the meaning of a new word is related to the integrity of the language-related white matter pathways in 40 adults (18 women). The arcuate, uncinate, inferior-fronto-occipital and inferior-longitudinal fasciculi were virtually dissected using manual and automatic deterministic fiber tracking. Critically, the automatic method allowed assessing the white matter microstructure along the tract. Results demonstrate that the microstructural properties of the left inferior-longitudinal fasciculus predict contextual learning, whereas the left uncinate was associated with cross-situational learning. In addition, we identified regions of special importance within these pathways: the posterior middle temporal gyrus, thought to serve as a lexical interface and specifically related to contextual learning; the anterior temporal lobe, known to be an amodal hub for semantic processing and related to cross-situational learning; and the white matter near the hippocampus, a structure fundamental for the initial stages of new-word learning and, remarkably, related to both types of word learning. No significant associations were found for the inferior-fronto-occipital fasciculus or the arcuate. While previous results suggest that learning new phonological word forms is mediated by the arcuate fasciculus, these findings show that the temporal pathways are the crucial neural substrate supporting one of the most striking human abilities: our capacity to identify correct associations between words and meanings under referential indeterminacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The language-processing network is cortically (i.e., gray matter) well defined. However, the role of the white matter pathways that support novel word learning within this network remains unclear. In this work, we dissected language-related (arcuate, uncinate, inferior-fronto-occipital, and inferior-longitudinal) fasciculi using manual and automatic tracking. We found the left inferior-longitudinal fasciculus to be predictive of word-learning success in two word-to-meaning tasks: contextual and cross-situational learning paradigms. The left uncinate was predictive of cross-situational word learning. No significant correlations were found for the arcuate or the inferior-fronto-occipital fasciculus. While previous results showed that learning new phonological word forms is supported by the arcuate fasciculus, these findings demonstrate that learning new word-to-meaning associations is mainly dependent on temporal white matter pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dysregulation of the Mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response Induces Non-Apoptotic Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration in C. elegans Models of Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11085?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Due to environmental insult or innate genetic deficiency, protein folding environments of the mitochondrial matrix are prone to dysregulation, prompting the activation of a specific organellar stress-response mechanism, the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt;). In &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, mitochondrial damage leads to nuclear translocation of the ATFS-1 transcription factor to activate the UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt;. After short-term acute stress has been mitigated, the UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt; is eventually suppressed to restore homeostasis to &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; hermaphrodites. In contrast, and reflective of the more chronic nature of progressive neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), here, we report the consequences of prolonged, cell-autonomous activation of the UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt; in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; dopaminergic neurons. We reveal that neuronal function and integrity decline rapidly with age, culminating in activity-dependent, non-apoptotic cell death. In a PD-like context wherein transgenic nematodes express the Lewy body constituent protein α-synuclein (αS), we not only find that this protein and its PD-associated disease variants have the capacity to induce the UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt;, but also that coexpression of αS and ATFS-1-associated dysregulation of the UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt; synergistically potentiate dopaminergic neurotoxicity. This genetic interaction is in parallel to mitophagic pathways dependent on the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans PINK1&lt;/i&gt; homolog, which is necessary for cellular resistance to chronic malfunction of the UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt;. Given the increasingly recognized role of mitochondrial quality control in neurodegenerative diseases, these studies illustrate, for the first time, an insidious aspect of mitochondrial signaling in which the UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt; pathway, under disease-associated, context-specific dysregulation, exacerbates disruption of dopaminergic neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, resulting in the neurodegeneration characteristic of PD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Disruptions or alterations in the activation of pathways that regulate mitochondrial quality control have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases due in part to the central role of mitochondria in metabolism, ROS regulation, and proteostasis. The extent to which these pathways, including the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt;) and mitophagy, are active may predict severity and progression of these disorders, as well as sensitivity to compounding stressors. Furthermore, therapeutic strategies that aim to induce these pathways may benefit from increased study into cellular responses that arise from long-term or ectopic stimulation, especially in neuronal compartments. By demonstrating the detrimental consequences of prolonged cellular activation of the UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt;, we provide evidence that this pathway is not a universally beneficial mechanism because dysregulation has neurotoxic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Ste20 Family Kinases MAP4K4, MINK1, and TNIK Converge to Regulate Stress-Induced JNK Signaling in Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/46/11074?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The c-Jun-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway regulates nervous system development, axon regeneration, and neuronal degeneration after acute injury or in chronic neurodegenerative disease. Dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) is required for stress-induced JNK signaling in neurons, yet the factors that initiate DLK/JNK pathway activity remain poorly defined. In the present study, we identify the Ste20 kinases MAP4K4, misshapen-like kinase 1 (MINK1 or MAP4K6) and TNIK Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK or MAP4K7), as upstream regulators of DLK/JNK signaling in neurons. Using a trophic factor withdrawal-based model of neurodegeneration in both male and female embryonic mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons, we show that MAP4K4, MINK1, and TNIK act redundantly to regulate DLK activation and downstream JNK-dependent phosphorylation of c-Jun in response to stress. Targeting MAP4K4, MINK1, and TNIK, but not any of these kinases individually, is sufficient to protect neurons potently from degeneration. Pharmacological inhibition of MAP4Ks blocks stabilization and phosphorylation of DLK within axons and subsequent retrograde translocation of the JNK signaling complex to the nucleus. These results position MAP4Ks as important regulators of the DLK/JNK signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuronal degeneration occurs in disparate circumstances: during development to refine neuronal connections, after injury to clear damaged neurons, or pathologically during disease. The dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK)/c-Jun-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway represents a conserved regulator of neuronal injury signaling that drives both neurodegeneration and axon regeneration, yet little is known about the factors that initiate DLK activity. Here, we uncover a novel role for a subfamily of MAP4 kinases consisting of MAP4K4, Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK or MAP4K7), and misshapen-like kinase 1 (MINK1 or MAP4K6) in regulating DLK/JNK signaling in neurons. Inhibition of these MAP4Ks blocks stress-induced retrograde JNK signaling and protects from neurodegeneration, suggesting that these kinases may represent attractive therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: February 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Zilong   Qiu&lt;br /&gt;  MECP2 is a critical gene for neural development, mutations or duplication of which led to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: October 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 46&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Scott W   Linderman, Samuel J   Gershman&lt;br /&gt; Computational neuroscience is, to first order, dominated by two approaches: the ‘bottom-up’ approach, which searches for statistical patterns in large-scale neural recordings, and the ‘top-down’ approach, which begins with a theory of computation and considers plausible neural implementations. While this division is not clear-cut, we argue that these approaches should be much more intimately linked. From a Bayesian perspective, computational theories provide constrained prior distributions on neural data—albeit highly sophisticated ones. By connecting theory to observation via a probabilistic model, we provide the link necessary to test, evaluate, and revise our theories in a data-driven and statistically rigorous fashion. This review highlights examples of this theory-driven pipeline for neural data analysis in recent literature and illustrates it with a worked example based on the temporal difference learning model of dopamine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

During development, glia keep neuronal cell numbers in check and ensure that mature neural circuits are appropriately sculpted by engulfing superfluous cells and projections. In the adult brain, glial cells offer metabolic sustenance and provide critical immune support in the face of acute and chronic challenges. Dysfunctional glial immune activity is believed to contribute to age-related cognitive decline, as well as neurodegenerative disease risk, but we still know surprisingly little about the specific molecular pathways that govern glia-neuron communication in the healthy or diseased brain. Drosophila offers a versatile in vivo model to explore the conserved molecular underpinnings of glial cell biology and glial cell contributions to brain function, health, and disease susceptibility. This review addresses recent findings describing how Drosophila glial cells influence neuronal activity in the adult fly brain to support optimal brain function and, importantly, highlights new insights into specific glial defects that may contribute to neuronal demise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Understanding this limited response could enable the enhancement of it. In Drosophila, the glial progenitor state is maintained by Notch, an activator of cell division and Prospero (Pros), a repressor. Injury provokes the activation of NFκB and up-regulation of Kon-tiki (Kon), driving cell proliferation. Homeostatic switch-off comes about as two negative feedback loops involving Pros terminate the response. Importantly, the functions of the kon and pros homologues NG2 and prox1, respectively, are conserved in mammalian NG2 glia. Controlling these genes is key for therapeutic manipulation of progenitors and stem cells to promote regeneration of the damaged CNS. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Critical to progressing the field is the identification of molecular underpinnings necessary for microglia to carry out these important functions within neural circuits. Here, we focus a review specifically on roles for microglial cytokine signaling within developing and mature neural circuits. We review exciting new studies demonstrating essential roles for microglial cytokine signaling in axon outgrowth, synaptogenesis and synapse maturation during development, as well as synaptic transmission and plasticity in adulthood. Together, these studies identify microglia and cytokines as critical modulators of neural circuits within the healthy brain, with implications for a broad range of neurological disorders with disruptions in synaptic structure and function. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;178&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095943881730137X-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

The morphological and molecular heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes and their progenitors point to functions beyond establishing saltatory nerve conduction. Here, we review the diversity in the oligodendroglial lineage as well as the classical and new functions identified for oligodendrocytes and their progenitors. Because oligodendroglia remain highly responsive to environmental changes, they likely contribute to various neurological and psychiatric diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: April 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Christian R   Burgess, Yoav   Livneh, Rohan N   Ramesh, Mark L   Andermann&lt;br /&gt; Physiological need states and associated motivational drives can bias visual processing of cues that help meet these needs. Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Recent work suggests that they play a key role in regulating brain energy supply by increasing blood flow to regions where neurons are active, and setting the baseline level of blood flow. Controversy persists over whether lactate derived from astrocyte glycolysis is used to power oxidative phosphorylation in neurons, but astrocytes sustain neuronal ATP production by recycling neurotransmitter glutamate that would otherwise need to be resynthesised from glucose, and by providing a short-term energy store in the form of glycogen that can be mobilised when neurons are active. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

To achieve these precise shapes, glia and neurons exhibit coordinated morphological changes on the time scale of minutes and on size scales ranging from nanometers to hundreds of microns. Here, we review recent studies that reveal the highly dynamic, localized morphological changes of mammalian neuron–glia contacts. We then explore the power of Drosophila and C. elegans models to study coordinated changes at defined neuron–glia contacts, highlighting the use of innovative genetic and imaging tools to uncover the molecular mechanisms responsible for coordinated morphogenesis of neurons and glia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Derived from the yolk sac during development, microglia self-renew, self-regulate their numbers during homeostatic conditions, and show a robust proliferative capacity even in adulthood. Together with monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), microglia coordinate the regeneration of CNS myelin around axons, termed remyelination. Gene expression analyses and experimental modelling have identified pro-remyelination roles for microglia/MDM in clearance of myelin debris, secretion of growth factors, and remodelling of the extracellular matrix. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms controlling these regenerative functions will reveal novel therapeutic strategies to enhance remyelination, by harnessing the beneficial effects of the innate immune response to injury. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

However, microglia enter the brain during embryogenesis and recent studies have revealed additional early functions of these immune cells in prenatal and perinatal cerebral development. Such findings are of importance since prenatal inflammation and microglia dysfunction have been associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. This review provides a selective overview of the early roles of microglia, their link with a specific spatiotemporal distribution and how they can be modulated by intrinsic factors or environmental signals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: December 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 47&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Matthew J   Carr, Adam PW   Johnston&lt;br /&gt; Current evidence suggests that peripheral nerve-associated Schwann cells possess the capacity to promote the repair and regeneration of multiple tissue types, in addition to peripheral nervous system axons. These findings shed light on the nerve-dependent nature of regeneration that has been well documented in various organs. This review outlines recent advances in knowledge surrounding endogenous regenerative functions of Schwann cells across species and tissue types, with a specific focus on the role of Sox2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dedifferentiated Schwann cells in regulating the proliferation of surrounding tissue-resident mesenchymal precursors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

The development of sophisticated genetic tools to manipulate its genome accelerates the discovery of the genetic basis of undiagnosed human diseases and the elucidation of molecular pathogenic events of known and novel diseases. Here, we discuss various approaches used in flies to assess the function of the fly homologues of disease-associated genes. We highlight how systematic and combinatorial approaches based on recently established methods provide us with integrated tool sets that can be applied to the study of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A memory mechanism based on two dimensional code of neurosome pattern. (arXiv:1711.05042v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05042</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05042</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We have recognized that 2D codes, i.e., a group of strongly connected
neurosomes that can be simultaneously excited, are the basic data carriers for
memory in a brain. An echoing mechanism between two neighboring layers of
neurosomes is assumed to establish temporary memory, and repeating processes
enhance the formation of long-term memory. Creation and degradation of memory
information are statistically. The maximum capacity of memory storage in a
human brain is estimated to be one billion of 2D codes. By triggering one or
more neurosomes in a neurosome-based 2D code, the whole strongly connected
neurosome network is capable of exciting simultaneously and projecting its
excitation onto an analysis layer of neurons in cortex, thus retrieving the
stored memory data. The capability of comparing two 2D codes in the analysis
layer is one of the major brain functions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Modelling stochastic resonance in humans: the influence of lapse rate. (arXiv:1711.04950v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04950</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04950</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adding noise to a sensory signal generally decreases human performance.
However noise can improve performance too, due to a process called stochastic
resonance (SR). This paradoxical effect may be exploited in psychophysical
experiments, to provide additional insights into how the sensory system deals
with noise. Here, I develop a model for stochastic resonance to study the
influence of noise on human perception, in which the biological parameter of
`lapse rate' was included. I show that the inclusion of lapse rate allows for
the occurrence of stochastic resonance in terms of the performance metric d'.
At the same time, I show that high levels of lapse rate cause stochastic
resonance to disappear. It is also shown that noise generated in the brain
(i.e., internal noise) may obscure any effect of stochastic resonance in
experimental settings. I further relate the model to a standard equivalent
noise model, the linear amplifier model, and show that the lapse rate can
function to scale the threshold versus noise (TvN) curve, similar to the
efficiency parameter in equivalent noise (EN) models. Therefore, lapse rate
provides a psychophysical explanation for reduced efficiency in EN paradigms.
Furthermore, I note that ignoring lapse rate may lead to an overestimation of
internal noise in equivalent noise paradigms. Overall, describing stochastic
resonance in terms of signal detection theory, with the inclusion of lapse
rate, may provide valuable new insights into how human performance depends on
internal and external noise.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A model of electrical impedance tomography on peripheral nerves for a neural-prosthetic control interface. (arXiv:1711.04377v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04377</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04377</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: A model is presented to evaluate the viability of using electrical
impedance tomography (EIT) with a nerve cuff to record neural activity in
peripheral nerves. Approach: Established modelling approaches in neural-EIT are
expanded on to be used, for the first time, on myelinated fibres which are
abundant in mammalian peripheral nerves and transmit motor commands. Main
results: Fibre impedance models indicate activity in unmyelinated fibres can be
screened out using operating frequencies above 100 Hz. At 1 kHz and 10 mm
electrode spacing, impedance magnitude of inactive intra-fascicle tissue and
the fraction changes during neural activity are estimated to be 1,142
{\Omega}.cm and -8.8x10-4, respectively, with a transverse current, and 328
{\Omega}.cm &amp;amp; -0.30, respectively with a longitudinal current. We show that a
novel EIT drive and measurement electrode pattern which utilises longitudinal
current and longitudinal differential boundary voltage measurements could
distinguish activity in different fascicles of a three-fascicle mammalian nerve
using pseudo-experimental data synthesised to replicate real operating
conditions. Significance: The results of this study provide an estimate of the
transient change in impedance of intra-fascicle tissue during neural activity
in mammalian nerve, and present a viable EIT electrode pattern, both of which
are critical steps towards implementing EIT in a nerve cuff for neural
prosthetics interfaces.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Convolutional neural network (CNN) driven by image recognition has been shown
to be able to explain cortical responses to static pictures at ventral-stream
areas. Here, we further showed that such CNN could reliably predict and decode
functional magnetic resonance imaging data from humans watching natural movies,
despite its lack of any mechanism to account for temporal dynamics or feedback
processing. Using separate data, encoding and decoding models were developed
and evaluated for describing the bi-directional relationships be-tween the CNN
and the brain. Through the encoding models, the CNN-predicted areas covered not
only the ventral stream, but also the dorsal stream, albe-it to a lesser
degree; single-voxel response was visualized as the specific pixel pattern that
drove the response, revealing the distinct representation of individual
cortical location; cortical activation was synthesized from natural images with
high-throughput to map category representation, con-trast, and selectivity.
Through the decoding models, fMRI signals were directly decoded to estimate the
feature representations in both visual and semantic spaces, for direct visual
reconstruction and seman-tic categorization, respectively. These results
cor-roborate, generalize, and extend previous findings, and highlight the value
of using deep learning, as an all-in-one model of the visual cortex, to
understand and decode natural vision.

	<description>Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a psychedelic drug with predominantly agonist activity at various serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine receptors. Despite the therapeutic and scientific interest in LSD, the specific receptor contributions to its neurobiological effects remain largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over study during which 24 healthy participants received either i) placebo+placebo, ii) placebo+LSD (100 microgram po), or iii) ketanserin, a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist. Here we focus on resting-state fMRI, a measure of spontaneous neural fluctuations that can map functional brain connectivity. We collected resting-state data 75 and 300 minutes after LSD/placebo administration. We quantified resting-state functional connectivity via a fully data-driven global brain connectivity (GBC) method to comprehensively map LSD neuropharmacological effects. LSD administration caused widespread GBC alterations that followed a specific topography: LSD reduced connectivity in associative areas, but concurrently increased connectivity across sensory and somatomotor areas. The 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, ketanserin, fully blocked the subjective and neural LSD effects. We show that whole-brain data-driven spatial patterns of LSD effects matched 5-HT2A receptor cortical gene expression in humans, which along with ketanserin effects, strongly implicates the 5-HT2A receptor in LSD's neuropharmacology. Critically, the LSD-induced subjective effects were associated with somatomotor networks GBC changes. These data-driven neuropharmacological results pinpoint the critical role of 5-HT2A in LSD's mechanism, which informs its neurobiology and guides rational development of psychedelic-based therapeutics</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Widespread shorter cortical adaptation in dyslexia</title>

	<description>Studies of dyslexics' performance on perceptual tasks suggest that their implicit inference of sound statistics is impaired. In a previous paper (Jaffe-Dax, Frenkel, &amp;amp; Ahissar, 2017), using 2-tone frequency discrimination, we found that the effect of previous trial frequencies on dyslexics' judgments decayed faster than the effect on controls' judgments, and that the adaptation of their ERP responses to tones recovered faster. Here, we show the cortical distribution of this abnormal dynamics of adaptation using fast acquisition fMRI. We find that dyslexics' faster decay of adaptation is widespread, though the most significant effects are found in the left superior temporal lobe, including the auditory cortex. This broad distribution suggests that dyslexics' faster decay of implicit memory is a general characteristic of their cortical dynamics, which also encompasses the sensory cortices.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: No changes in parieto-occipital alpha during neural phase locking to visual quasi-periodic theta-, alpha-, and beta-band stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/219766v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Many recent studies have probed the role of the parieto-occipital alpha rhythm (8 - 12 Hz) in human visual perception through attempts to drive its neural generators. To that end, paradigms have used high-intensity strictly-periodic visual stimulation that created strong predictions about future stimulus occurrences and repeatedly demonstrated perceptual consequences in line with an entrainment of parieto-occipital alpha. Our study, in turn, examined the case of alpha entrainment by non-predictive low-intensity quasi-periodic visual stimulation within theta- (4 - 7 Hz), alpha- (8 - 13 Hz) and beta (14 - 20 Hz) frequency bands, i.e. a class of stimuli that resemble the temporal characteristics of naturally occurring visual input more closely. We have previously reported substantial neural phase-locking in EEG recording during all three stimulation conditions. Here, we focussed on whether this phase-locking signified an entrainment of intrinsic alpha rhythms. Specifically, we tested whether quasi-periodic visual stimulation affected several properties of parieto-occipital alpha generators: 1) retinotopic power lateralisation during selective spatial attention, 2) individual alpha power and 3) alpha peak frequency. Speaking against an entrainment of intrinsic alpha rhythms, we found none of these properties to show differences between stimulation frequency bands. In particular, alpha band generators did not show increased sensitivity to alpha band stimulation and Bayesian inference provided evidence against an influence of stimulation frequency. Our results set boundary conditions for when and how to expect effects of entrainment of alpha generators and suggest that the parieto-occipital alpha rhythm may be more inert to external influences than previously thought.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: EEG Decoding Reveals the Temporal Dynamics and Functional Relevance of Goal-Relevant Representations in Humans [Revised]</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/219741v3?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/219741v3?rss=1</link>
	<description>Theoretical models of action control assume that abstract task-set settings regulate lower-level stimulus/response representations. However, we know little about the degree to which task-set representations can actually explain variability in performance, or about the dynamic interplay between task-set and lower-level representations. Addressing such questions requires time-resolved information about the strength of the different representations on a trial-by-trial basis. Using a cued task-switching paradigm, we show that information about both task sets and lower-level stimulus/response features can be extracted through decoding analyses from the scalp electrophysiological signal (EEG) with high temporal resolution. The representational strength of the different goal-relevant aspects--indexed through decoding accuracy--proceeds from superficial task cues, to stimulus locations, to features/responses. Importantly, these lower-level representations are accompanied by task-set representations that are prominent throughout almost the entire processing cascade. Moreover, trial-by-trial information about representational strength allows a detailed analysis of when and to what degree (a) different representations predict performance and (b) are related to each other. Indeed, the strength of abstract task sets emerges as a remarkably strong and consistent predictor of both within-individual and across-individual variability in performance. Also, task-set strength is related to target representation strength at an early period and to the strength of feature/response representations at a later period, consistent with the notion that task-sets coordinate successive, lower-level representations in a concurrent manner. These results demonstrate a powerful approach towards uncovering the different stages of information processing and their relative importance for performance.</description>

	<description>The visual brain is tasked with segmenting visual input into a structured scene of coherent objects. Figures that produce the perception of illusory contours reveal minimal conditions necessary for the visual system to perform figure-ground segmentation, but it is unclear what role visual attention plays in such perceptual organisation. Here we tested whether illusory contours are formed under the guidance of voluntary attention by exploiting a novel variant of the classical Kanizsa figure. We used a psychophysical response classification technique to quantify spatial structures guiding perceptual decisions, and found that illusory contour formation was contingent on attended elements of the figure. However, the strength of these illusory contours was constrained by form implied by unattended figural elements. Our data thus reveal an interplay of top-down and bottom-up processes in figure-ground segmentation: while attention is not necessary for illusory contour formation, under some conditions it is sufficient.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Masoud Nickaeen, Igor L. Novak, Stephanie Pulford, Aaron Rumack, Jamie Brandon, Boris M. Slepchenko, Alex Mogilner&lt;/p&gt;

To understand shapes and movements of cells undergoing lamellipodial motility, we systematically explore minimal free-boundary models of actin-myosin contractility consisting of the force-balance and myosin transport equations. The models account for isotropic contraction proportional to myosin density, viscous stresses in the actin network, and constant-strength viscous-like adhesion. The contraction generates a spatially graded centripetal actin flow, which in turn reinforces the contraction via myosin redistribution and causes retraction of the lamellipodial boundary. Actin protrusion at the boundary counters the retraction, and the balance of the protrusion and retraction shapes the lamellipodium. The model analysis shows that initiation of motility critically depends on three dimensionless parameter combinations, which represent myosin-dependent contractility, a characteristic viscosity-adhesion length, and a rate of actin protrusion. When the contractility is sufficiently strong, cells break symmetry and move steadily along either straight or circular trajectories, and the motile behavior is sensitive to conditions at the cell boundary. Scanning of a model parameter space shows that the contractile mechanism of motility supports robust cell turning in conditions where short viscosity-adhesion lengths and fast protrusion cause an accumulation of myosin in a small region at the cell rear, destabilizing the axial symmetry of a moving cell.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/F3soywyLL-A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Mitochondria constantly divide and fuse. Homotypic fusion of the outer mitochondrial membranes requires the mitofusin (MFN) proteins, a family of dynamin-like GTPases. MFNs are anchored in the membrane by transmembrane (TM) segments, exposing both the N-terminal GTPase domain and the C-terminal tail (CT) to the cytosol. This arrangement is very...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/zlGYYJocMA0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Proteoglycans (PGs) in the extracellular matrix (ECM) play vital roles in axon growth and navigation, plasticity, and regeneration of injured neurons. Different classes of PGs may support or inhibit cell growth, and their functions are determined in part by highly specific structural features. Among these, the pattern of sulfation on the PG sugar chains is a paramount determinant of a diverse and flexible set of outcomes. Recent studies of PG sulfation illustrate the challenges of attributing biological actions to specific sulfation patterns, and suggest ways in which highly similar molecules may exert opposing effects on neurons.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Tracking wakefulness as it fades: micro-measures of Alertness</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/219527v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/219527v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>A major problem in psychology and physiology experiments is drowsiness, around a third of participants show decreased wakefulness despite being instructed to stay alert. In non-visual experiments participants keep their eyes closed throughout the task, thus promoting the occurrence of such periods of varying alertness. These wakefulness changes contribute to systematic noise in data and measures of interest. To account for this omnipresent problem in data acquisition we defined criteria and code to allow researchers to detect and control for varying alertness in electroencephalography (EEG) experiments. We first revise a visual-scoring method developed for detection and characterization of the sleep-onset process, and adapt the same for detection of alertness levels. Further, we show the major issues preventing the practical use of this method, and overcome these issues by developing an automated method based on frequency and sleep graphoelements, which is capable of detecting micro variations in alertness. The validity of the automated method was verified by training and testing the algorithm using a dataset where participants are known to fall asleep. Further, we tested generalizability with independent validation on another dataset. The methods developed constitute a unique tool to assess micro variations in levels of alertness and control trial-by-trial retrospectively or prospectively in every experiment performed with EEG in cognitive neuroscience.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Genetic Single Neuron Anatomy reveals fine granularity of cortical interneuron subtypes</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/219485v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Parsing diverse nerve cells into biological types is necessary for understanding neural circuit organization. Morphology is an intuitive criterion for neuronal classification and a proxy of connectivity, but morphological diversity and variability often preclude resolving the granularity of discrete cell groups from population continuum. Combining genetic labeling with high-resolution, large volume light microscopy, we established a platform of genetic single neuron anatomy that resolves, registers and quantifies complete neuron morphologies in the mouse brain. We discovered that cortical axo-axonic cells (AACs), a cardinal GABAergic interneuron type that controls pyramidal neuron (PyN) spiking at axon initial segment, consist of multiple subtypes distinguished by laminar position, dendritic and axonal arborization patterns. Whereas the laminar arrangements of AAC dendrites reflect differential recruitment by input streams, the laminar distribution and local geometry of AAC axons enable differential innervation of PyN ensembles. Therefore, interneuron types likely consist of fine-grained subtypes with distinct input-output connectivity patterns.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A proof-of-principle study of the effect of combined haloperidol and levodopa administration on working memory-related brain activation in humans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/219436v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/219436v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background and Purpose: Cognitive deficits including impaired working memory are a hallmark feature of schizophrenia. Changes in prefrontal cortex function modulated by dopamine D1 receptors, play a potentially important role in the pathology underlying such deficits. However, pharmacological interventions that selectively engage the D1 receptor are severely restricted for research in humans. The present study is a proof-of-principle for enhancing cognitive performance and associated brain activation via indirect D1 stimulation. Here, we combine the non-selective dopamine agonist L-dopa with the D2-antagonist haloperidol, theoretically producing increased stimulation at the D1 receptor. Experimental Approach: Fourteen healthy volunteers received placebo or combined carbidopa (125 mg, 100mg L-dopa) plus haloperidol (2 mg) orally on two separate occasions according to a within-subjects cross-over design. Drug-induced differences in brain activity were assessed during an N-back working memory task in a 3T magnetic resonance imaging environment. Key Results: Drug treatment was associated with a reduction in activity in a large number of brain areas, most prominently occipital/temporal brain areas during 2-back performance, which may be due to the effects of haloperidol specifically. Drug treatment was also associated with greater functional connectivity within parts of the salience network during all N-back trials. Conclusion and Implications: This preliminary study provides initial evidence for combined L-dopa/haloperidol modulation in cognition-related brain areas and networks, which is relevant for the treatment of cognitive impairments in mental illness.</description>

	<description>The Brain Dynamics Toolbox provides a graphical tool for simulating user-defined dynamical systems in matlab. It supports three classes of differential equations commonly used in computational neuroscience: Ordinary Differential Equations, Delay Differential Equations and Stochastic Differential Equations. The design of the graphical interface fosters intuitive exploration of the dynamics, yet there is no barrier to scripting large-scale simulations and parameter explorations. System variables and parameters may range in size from simple scalars to large vectors or matrices. The toolbox is intended for dynamical models in computational neuroscience but it can be applied to continuous dynamical systems from any domain.</description>

	<description>Inter-areal functional connectivity (FC), neuronal synchronization in particular, is thought to constitute a key systems-level mechanism for coordination of neuronal processing and communication between brain regions. Evidence to support this hypothesis has been gained largely using invasive electrophysiological approaches. In humans, neuronal activity can be non-invasively recorded only with magneto- and electroencephalography (MEG/EEG), which have been used to assess FC networks with high temporal resolution and whole-scalp coverage. However, even in source-reconstructed MEG/EEG data, signal mixing, or &quot;source leakage&quot;, is a significant confounder for FC analyses and network localization. Signal mixing leads to two distinct kinds of false-positive observations: artificial interactions (AI) caused directly by mixing and spurious interactions (SI) arising indirectly from the spread of signals from true interacting sources to nearby false loci. To date, several interaction metrics have been developed to solve the AI problem, but the SI problem has remained largely intractable in MEG/EEG all-to-all source connectivity studies. Here, we advance a novel approach for correcting SIs in FC analyses using source-reconstructed MEG/EEG data. Our approach is to bundle observed FC connections into hyperedges by their adjacency in signal mixing. Using realistic simulations, we show here that bundling yields hyperedges with good separability of true positives and little loss in the true positive rate. Hyperedge bundling thus significantly decreases graph noise by minimizing the false-positive to true-positive ratio. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of edge bundling in the visualization of large-scale cortical networks with real MEG data. We propose that hypergraphs yielded by bundling represent well the set of true cortical interactions that are detectable and dissociable in MEG/EEG connectivity analysis.</description>

	<description>Fluctuations in gonadal hormones over the course of the menstrual cycle are known to cause functional brain changes and are thought to modulate changes in the balance of cortical excitation and inhibition. Animal research has shown this occurs primarily via the major metabolite of progesterone, allopregnanolone, and its action as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor. Our study used EEG to record gamma oscillations induced in the visual cortex using stationary and moving gratings. Recordings took place during twenty females' mid-luteal phase when progesterone and oestradiol are highest, and early follicular phase when progesterone and oestradiol are lowest. Significantly higher (~5 Hz) gamma frequency was recorded during the luteal compared to the follicular phase for both stimuli types. Using dynamic causal modelling these changes were linked to stronger self-inhibition of superficial pyramidal cells in the luteal compared to the follicular phase. In addition the connection from inhibitory interneurons to deep pyramidal cells was found to be stronger in the follicular compared to the luteal phase. These findings show that complex functional changes in synaptic microcircuitry occur across the menstrual cycle and that menstrual cycle phase should be taken into consideration when including female participants in research into gamma-band oscillations.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A model-based clustering method to detect infectious disease transmission outbreaks from sequence variation</title>

Clustering infections by genetic similarity is a popular technique for identifying potential outbreaks of infectious disease, in part because sequences are now routinely collected for clinical management of many infections. A diverse number of nonparametric clustering methods have been developed for this purpose. These methods are generally intuitive, rapid to compute, and readily scale with large data sets. However, we have found that nonparametric clustering methods can be biased towards identifying clusters of diagnosis—where individuals are sampled sooner post-infection—rather than the clusters of rapid transmission that are meant to be potential foci for public health efforts. We develop a fundamentally new approach to genetic clustering based on fitting a Markov-modulated Poisson process (MMPP), which represents the evolution of transmission rates along the tree relating different infections. We evaluated this model-based method alongside five nonparametric clustering methods using both simulated and actual HIV sequence data sets. For simulated clusters of rapid transmission, the MMPP clustering method obtained higher mean sensitivity (85%) and specificity (91%) than the nonparametric methods. When we applied these clustering methods to published sequences from a study of HIV-1 genetic clusters in Seattle, USA, we found that the MMPP method categorized about half (46%) as many individuals to clusters compared to the other methods. Furthermore, the mean internal branch lengths that approximate transmission rates were significantly shorter in clusters extracted using MMPP, but not by other methods. We determined that the computing time for the MMPP method scaled linearly with the size of trees, requiring about 30 seconds for a tree of 1,000 tips and about 20 minutes for 50,000 tips on a single computer. This new approach to genetic clustering has significant implications for the application of pathogen sequence analysis to public health, where it is critical to robustly and accurately identify clusters for the most cost-effective deployment of outbreak management and prevention resources.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DCiNkk7egBE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Frameworks such as BioNetGen, Kappa and Simmune use “reaction rules” to specify biochemical interactions compactly, where each rule specifies a mechanism such as binding or phosphorylation and its structural requirements. Current rule-based models of signaling pathways have tens to hundreds of rules, and these numbers are expected to increase as more molecule types and pathways are added. Visual representations are critical for conveying rule-based models, but current approaches to show rules and interactions between rules scale poorly with model size. Also, inferring design motifs that emerge from biochemical interactions is an open problem, so current approaches to visualize model architecture rely on manual interpretation of the model. Here, we present three new visualization tools that constitute an automated visualization framework for rule-based models: (i) a &lt;i&gt;compact rule visualization&lt;/i&gt; that efficiently displays each rule, (ii) the &lt;i&gt;atom-rule graph&lt;/i&gt; that conveys regulatory interactions in the model as a bipartite network, and (iii) a tunable &lt;i&gt;compression pipeline&lt;/i&gt; that incorporates expert knowledge and produces compact diagrams of model architecture when applied to the atom-rule graph. The compressed graphs convey network motifs and architectural features useful for understanding both small and large rule-based models, as we show by application to specific examples. Our tools also produce more readable diagrams than current approaches, as we show by comparing visualizations of 27 published models using standard graph metrics. We provide an implementation in the open source and freely available BioNetGen framework, but the underlying methods are general and can be applied to rule-based models from the Kappa and Simmune frameworks also. We expect that these tools will promote communication and analysis of rule-based models and their eventual integration into comprehensive whole-cell models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WVjQXIOWt00&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Mechanical strain is a potent stimulus for growth and remodeling in cells. Although many pathways have been implicated in stretch-induced remodeling, the control structures by which signals from distinct mechano-sensors are integrated to modulate hypertrophy and gene expression in cardiomyocytes remain unclear. Here, we constructed and validated a predictive computational model of the cardiac mechano-signaling network in order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying signal integration. The model identifies calcium, actin, Ras, Raf1, PI3K, and JAK as key regulators of cardiac mechano-signaling and characterizes crosstalk logic imparting differential control of transcription by AT1R, integrins, and calcium channels. We find that while these regulators maintain mostly independent control over distinct groups of transcription factors, synergy between multiple pathways is necessary to activate all the transcription factors necessary for gene transcription and hypertrophy. We also identify a PKG-dependent mechanism by which valsartan/sacubitril, a combination drug recently approved for treating heart failure, inhibits stretch-induced hypertrophy, and predict further efficacious pairs of drug targets in the network through a network-wide combinatorial search.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EWjJVc3m438&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Simultaneous electrical stimulation and recording using multi-electrode arrays can provide a valuable technique for studying circuit connectivity and engineering neural interfaces. However, interpreting these measurements is challenging because the spike sorting process (identifying and segregating action potentials arising from different neurons) is greatly complicated by electrical stimulation artifacts across the array, which can exhibit complex and nonlinear waveforms, and overlap temporarily with evoked spikes. Here we develop a scalable algorithm based on a structured Gaussian Process model to estimate the artifact and identify evoked spikes. The effectiveness of our methods is demonstrated in both real and simulated 512-electrode recordings in the peripheral primate retina with single-electrode and several types of multi-electrode stimulation. We establish small error rates in the identification of evoked spikes, with a computational complexity that is compatible with real-time data analysis. This technology may be helpful in the design of future high-resolution sensory prostheses based on tailored stimulation (e.g., retinal prostheses), and for closed-loop neural stimulation at a much larger scale than currently possible.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/umiUooXyYhQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In the continuous mode of cell culture, a constant flow carrying fresh media replaces culture fluid, cells, nutrients and secreted metabolites. Here we present a model for continuous cell culture coupling intra-cellular metabolism to extracellular variables describing the state of the bioreactor, taking into account the growth capacity of the cell and the impact of toxic byproduct accumulation. We provide a method to determine the steady states of this system that is tractable for metabolic networks of arbitrary complexity. We demonstrate our approach in a toy model first, and then in a genome-scale metabolic network of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, obtaining results that are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. We derive a number of consequences from the model that are independent of parameter values. The ratio between cell density and dilution rate is an ideal control parameter to fix a steady state with desired metabolic properties. This conclusion is robust even in the presence of multi-stability, which is explained in our model by a negative feedback loop due to toxic byproduct accumulation. A complex landscape of steady states emerges from our simulations, including multiple metabolic switches, which also explain why cell-line and media benchmarks carried out in batch culture cannot be extrapolated to perfusion. On the other hand, we predict invariance laws between continuous cell cultures with different parameters. A practical consequence is that the chemostat is an ideal experimental model for large-scale high-density perfusion cultures, where the complex landscape of metabolic transitions is faithfully reproduced.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JAaq3NMYju8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Improving virtual screening of G protein-coupled receptors via ligand-directed modeling</title>

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play crucial roles in cell physiology and pathophysiology. There is increasing interest in using structural information for virtual screening (VS) of libraries and for structure-based drug design to identify novel agonist or antagonist leads. However, the sparse availability of experimentally determined GPCR/ligand complex structures with diverse ligands impedes the application of structure-based drug design (SBDD) programs directed to identifying new molecules with a select pharmacology. In this study, we apply ligand-directed modeling (LDM) to available GPCR X-ray structures to improve VS performance and selectivity towards molecules of specific pharmacological profile. The described method refines a GPCR binding pocket conformation using a single known ligand for that GPCR. The LDM method is a computationally efficient, iterative workflow consisting of protein sampling and ligand docking. We developed an extensive benchmark comparing LDM-refined binding pockets to GPCR X-ray crystal structures across seven different GPCRs bound to a range of ligands of different chemotypes and pharmacological profiles. LDM-refined models showed improvement in VS performance over origin X-ray crystal structures in 21 out of 24 cases. In all cases, the LDM-refined models had superior performance in enriching for the chemotype of the refinement ligand. This likely contributes to the LDM success in all cases of inhibitor-bound to agonist-bound binding pocket refinement, a key task for GPCR SBDD programs. Indeed, agonist ligands are required for a plethora of GPCRs for therapeutic intervention, however GPCR X-ray structures are mostly restricted to their inactive inhibitor-bound state.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_oVl-6F8HtM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We employ an optimization procedure to estimate parameters of a small model
biological neuronal network. The input to the network and resulting network
output are: time series of stimulating electrical current delivered to each
constituent neuron, and time series of membrane voltage of each neuron,
respectively. We write a cost function as a measurement error and a model error
term. An iterative reweighting of these terms permits a systematic method to
identify the lowest-minimum, within a specific region of state-and-parameter
space, on the surface of a non-convex cost function. We use the estimates
corresponding to the lowest minimum of the cost function to predict the
particular mode of activity that the network is expressing, where each mode is
known to be associated with a particular set of parameter values. Finally, we
show how this method can prune a model of unnecessarily high complexity down to
a representation that contains the maximum dimensionality required to explain
the available experimental measurements. The design for simulated experiments
presented in this paper might apply in an experimental laboratory, to estimate
properties of extremely small biological circuits.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain areas' functional repertoires are shaped by their incoming and outgoing
structural connections. In empirically measured networks, most connections are
short, reflecting spatial and energetic constraints. Nonetheless, a small
number of connections span long distances, consistent with the notion that the
functionality of these connections must outweigh their cost. While the precise
function of these long-distance connections is not known, the leading
hypothesis is that they act to reduce the topological distance between brain
areas and facilitate efficient interareal communication. However, this
hypothesis implies a non-specificity of long-distance connections that we
contend is unlikely. Instead, we propose that long-distance connections serve
to diversify brain areas' inputs and outputs, thereby promoting complex
dynamics. Through analysis of five interareal network datasets, we show that
long-distance connections play only minor roles in reducing average interareal
topological distance. In contrast, areas' long-distance and short-range
neighbors exhibit marked differences in their connectivity profiles, suggesting
that long-distance connections enhance dissimilarity between regional inputs
and outputs. Next, we show that -- in isolation -- areas' long-distance
connectivity profiles exhibit non-random levels of similarity, suggesting that
the communication pathways formed by long connections exhibit redundancies that
may serve to promote robustness. Finally, we use a linearization of
Wilson-Cowan dynamics to simulate the covariance structure of neural activity
and show that in the absence of long-distance connections, a common measure of
functional diversity decreases. Collectively, our findings suggest that
long-distance connections are necessary for supporting diverse and complex
brain dynamics.

	<description>Auditory attention detection (AAD) is promising for use in auditory-assistive devices to detect to which sound the user is attending. Being able to train subjects in achieving high AAD performance would greatly increase its application potential. In order to do so an acceptable temporal resolution and online implementation are essential prerequisites. Consequently, users of an online AAD can be presented with feedback about their performance. Here we describe two studies that investigate the effects of online AAD with feedback. In the first study, we implemented a fully automated closed-loop system that allows for user-friendly recording environments. Subjects were presented online with visual feedback on their ongoing AAD performance. Following these results we implemented a longitudinal case study in which two subjects were presented with AAD sessions during four weeks. The results prove the feasibility of a fully working online (neuro)feedback system for AAD decoding. The detected changes in AAD for the feedback subject during and after training suggest that changes in AAD may be achieved via training. This is early evidence of such training effects and needs to be confirmed in future studies to evaluate training of AAD in more detail. Finally, the large number of sessions allowed to examine the correlation between the stimuli (i.e. acoustic stories) and AAD performance which was found to be significant. Future studies are suggested to evaluate their acoustic stimuli with care to prevent spurious associations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Age-dependent neurodegeneration and organelle transport deficiencies in mutant TDP43 patient-derived neurons are independent of TDP43 aggregation</title>

	<description>TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) is a cause of familiar and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The diverse postulated mechanisms by which TDP43 mutations cause the disease are not fully understood. Human wildtype and TDP43 S393L and G294V mutant spinal motor neuron cultures were differentiated from patient-derived iPSCs. Mutant hTDP43 and wildtype motor neuron cultures did not differ in neuron differentiation capacity during early maturation stage. During aging we detected a dramatic neurodegeneration including neuron loss and pathological neurofilament abnormalities in TDP43 mutant cultures only. Additionally mitochondria and lysosomes of aging spinal motor neurons revealed robust TDP43 mutation dependent abnormal phenotypes in size, shape, speed and motility which all appeared without TDP43 mislocalization or aggregation formation. Furthermore, D-sorbitol - known to induce stress granules and cytoplasmic mislocalization of TDP43 - rescued axonal trafficking phenotypes without any signs of TDP43 mislocalization or aggregation formation. Our data indicate TDP43 mutation-dependent but cytosolic aggregation-independent mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration in TDP43 ALS.</description>

	<description>Recent theories of norepinephrine (NE) function suggest that NE modulates the transition between stereotyped, goal-directed behavior and more variable exploratory behaviors that facilitate learning and adaptation. We provide evidence for context dependent switching by NE that is analogous to this explore/exploit strategy in the vocal system of the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). Stimulation of the locus coeruleus, the major source of norepinephrine in the brain, decreases song trial-to-trial variability transforming the variable, exploratory &quot;undirected&quot; song into song that resembles the more stereotyped, exploitative &quot;directed&quot; song males sing to females. This behavioral switch is mediated by NE acting directly on a cortical motor nucleus that integrates inputs from a premotor cortical nucleus and a basal ganglia circuit necessary for vocal motor learning. These findings suggest that norepinephrine can act directly on the motor system to influence the transition between exploratory and exploitative behavioral strategies.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Is dopamine D1 receptor availability related to social behavior? A positron emission tomography replication study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/218420v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/218420v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Associations between dopamine receptor levels and pro- and antisocial behavior have previously been demonstrated in human subjects using positron emission tomography (PET) and self-rated measures of personality traits. So far, only one study has focused on the D1-dopamine receptor (D1-R), finding a positive correlation with the trait social desirability, which is characterized by low dominant and high affiliative behavior, while physical aggression showed a negative correlation. The aim of the present study was to replicate these previous findings using a new independent sample of subjects. Methods: Twenty-six healthy males were examined with the radioligand [11]SCH-23390, and completed the Swedish universities Scales of Personality (SSP) which includes measures of social desirability and physical trait aggression. The simplified reference tissue model with cerebellum as reference region was used to calculate BPND values in the whole striatum and limbic striatum. The two regions were selected since they showed strong association between D1-R availability and personality scores in the previous study. Pearson's correlation coefficients and replication Bayes factors were then employed to assess the replicability and robustness of previous results. Results: There were no significant correlations (all p values &amp;gt; 0.3) between regional BPND values and personality scale scores. Replication Bayes factors showed strong to moderate evidence in favor no relationship between D1-receptor availability and social desirability (striatum BF01 = 12.4; limbic striatum BF01 = 7.2) or physical aggression scale scores (limbic striatum BF01 = 3.3), compared to the original correlations. Discussion: We could not replicate the previous findings of associations between D1-R availability and either pro- or antisocial behavior as measured using the SSP. Rather, there was evidence in favor of failed replications of associations between BPND and scale scores. Potential reasons for these results are restrictive variance in both PET and personality outcomes due to high sample homogeneity, or that the previous findings were false positives.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Limitations of proposed signatures of Bayesian confidence</title>

	<description>The Bayesian model of confidence posits that human confidence reports are a function of the posterior probability of being correct. We examine two proposed qualitative signatures of Bayesian confidence. We show that the proofs of these statements contain hidden assumptions that limit their applicability, and that they are neither necessary nor sufficient conditions for Bayesian confidence. One signature is an average confidence of 0.75 for trials with neutral evidence. This signature only holds when class-conditioned stimulus distributions do not overlap and internal noise is very low. Another signature is that, as stimulus magnitude increases, confidence increases on correct trials but decreases on incorrect trials. This signature is also dependent on stimulus distribution type. There is an alternative form of this signature that has been applied in the literature; we find no indication that this is expected under Bayesian confidence, which resolves an ostensible discrepancy. We conclude that, to determine the nature of the computations underlying confidence reports, there may be no shortcut to quantitative model comparison.</description>

	<description>Zebrafish has been introduced as a model organism in behavioral neuroscience and biological psychiatry, increasing the breadth of findings using fish to study the neurobiology of aggression. Phenotypic differences between leopard and longfin zebrafish were exploited in order to elucidate the role of phasic serotonin in aggressive displays on this species. The present study revealed differences in aggressive display between leopard and longfin zebrafish, and a discrepant effect of acute fluoxetine in both populations. In mirror-induced aggression, leopard animals showed higher display latencies than longfin, as well as lower display duration and frequency (Experiment 1). Moreover, 2.5 mg/kg fluoxetine decreased the duration and frequency of display in longfin, but not leopard; and 5 mg/kg fluoxetine increased display frequency in leopard, but not longfin (Experiment 2). It is suggested that zebrafish from the longfin phenotype show more aggressive motivation and readiness in the mirror-induced aggression test that leopard, and that acute fluoxetine increases aggression in leopard and decreased it in longfin zebrafish.</description>

	<description>Atypical sensory processing is a core characteristic in autism spectrum disorders that negatively impacts virtually all activities of daily living. Sensory symptoms are predictive of the subsequent appearance of impaired social behavior and other autistic traits. Thus, a better understanding of the changes in neural circuitry that disrupt perceptual learning in autism could shed light into the mechanistic basis and potential therapeutic avenues for a range of autistic symptoms. Likewise, the lack of directly comparable behavioral paradigms in both humans and animal models currently limits the translational potential of discoveries in the latter. We adopted a symptom-to-circuit approach to uncover the circuit-level alterations in the Fmr1-/- mouse model of Fragile X syndrome (FXS) that underlie atypical visual discrimination in this disorder. Using a go/no-go task and in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging in primary visual cortex (V1), we find that impaired discrimination in Fmr1-/- mice correlates with marked deficits in orientation tuning of principal neurons, and a decrease in the activity of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in V1. Restoring visually evoked activity in PV cells in Fmr1-/- mice with a chemogenetic (DREADD) strategy was sufficient to rescue their behavioral performance. Finally, we found that human subjects with FXS exhibit strikingly similar impairments in visual discrimination as Fmr1-/- mice. We conclude that manipulating orientation tuning in autism could improve visually guided behaviors that are critical for playing sports, driving or judging emotions.</description>

	<description>Microglia, the resident myeloid cells of the central nervous system parenchyma, are critical for brain functioning in health and disease. Here, using tissue-specific conditional gene targeting in mice, we show an essential role for the small GTPase RhoA in regulating microglia homeostasis and brain pathology. We reveal that in the absence of brain disease or any insult, the microglia-specific ablation of RhoA disrupted the quiescence of adult microglia leading to their activation, which culminated in astrogliosis, inflammation, synapse and neuronal loss, impairment of long-term potentiation and memory deficts. RhoA exerted its microglial homeostatic functions by sustaining C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) negative regulation of Src tyrosine kinase activity. Accordingly, inhibition of Src with a clinically-relevant inhibior prevented microglia deregulation and synapse loss restoring the memory performance of mice with microglia-specific ablation of RhoA. Overall, loss of RhoA in adult brain microglia leads to a neurodegenerative-like pathology mediated by deregulated microglial activation.</description>

	<description>Environmental boundaries play a crucial role in spatial navigation and memory across a wide range of distantly-related species. In rodents, boundary representations have been identified at the single-cell level in the subiculum and entorhinal cortex of the hippocampal formation. While studies of hippocampal function and spatial behavior suggest that similar representations might exist in humans, boundary-related neural activity has not been identified electrophysiologically in humans until now. Here we present direct intracranial recordings from the hippocampal formation of surgical epilepsy patients while they performed a virtual spatial navigation task. Our results suggest that encoding target locations near boundaries elicited stronger theta oscillations than for target locations near the center of the environment and that this difference cannot be explained by variables such as trial length, speed, or movement. These findings provide the first direct evidence of boundary-dependent neural activity localized in humans to the subiculum, the homologue of the hippocampal subregion in in which most boundary cells are found.</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objectives&lt;/b&gt;: A reduction in glucose metabolism in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) predicts conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and tracks disease progression, signifying its importance in AD. We aimed to use decline in PCC glucose metabolism as a proxy for the development and progression of AD to discover common genetic variants associated with disease vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of decline in PCC [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F] FDG PET measured in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;=606). We then performed follow-up analyses to assess the impact of significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on disease risk and longitudinal cognitive performance in a large independent dataset (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;=870). Lastly, we assessed whether significant SNPs influence gene expression using two RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) datasets (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;=210 &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;=159).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We demonstrate a novel genome-wide significant association between rs2273647-T in the gene &lt;em&gt;PPP4R3A&lt;/em&gt; and reduced [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F] FDG decline (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;= 4.44 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;). In a follow-up analysis using an independent dataset, we demonstrate a protective effect of this variant against risk of conversion to MCI or AD (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.038) and against cognitive decline in individuals who develop dementia (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 3.41 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, this variant is associated with altered gene expression in peripheral blood and altered &lt;em&gt;PPPP4R3A&lt;/em&gt; transcript expression in temporal cortex, suggesting a role at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretations&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;em&gt;PPP4R3A&lt;/em&gt; is a gene involved in AD risk and progression. Given the protective effect of this variant &lt;em&gt;PPP4R3A&lt;/em&gt; should be further investigated as a gene of interest in neurodegenerative diseases and as a potential target for AD therapies.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Heterogenous migraine aura symptoms correlate with visual cortex fMRI responses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25096</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Migraine aura is sparsely studied due to the highly challenging task of capturing patients during aura. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is likely the underlying phenomenon of aura. The possible correlation between the multifaceted phenomenology of aura symptoms and the effects of CSD on the brain has not been ascertained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Five migraine patients were studied during various forms of aura symptoms induced by hypoxia, sham or physical exercise and photostimulation. The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) signal response to visual stimulation was measured in retinotopic mapping defined visual cortex area V1 - V4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We found reduced BOLD response in patients reporting scotoma and increased response in patients who only experienced positive symptoms. Furthermore, patients with bilateral visual symptoms had corresponding bi-hemispherical changes in BOLD response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: These findings suggest that different aura symptoms reflect different types of cerebral dysfunction, which correspond to specific changes in BOLD signal reactivity. Furthermore, we provide evidence of bilateral CSD recorded by fMRI during bilateral aura symptoms. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A localized pallidal physiomarker in cervical dystonia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25095</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25095</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) allows for direct recordings of neuronal activity from the human basal ganglia. In Parkinson's disease, a disease-specific physiomarker was identified that is now used to investigate adaptive closed-loop stimulation in first studies. In dystonia such a physiomarker is missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Pallidal oscillations were recorded from 153 contact pairs in 27 patients. We investigated whether power amplitudes in theta and beta bands correlate with dystonic symptom severity across patients. We then projected theta power from each contact pair onto standard subcortical anatomy. This way, we defined a theta hot spot on a group level and investigated whether proximity of the active DBS contacts to it correlates with clinical improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Dystonic symptom severity significantly correlated with theta, but not beta oscillatory amplitudes (ρ=0.4; P=0.009) and interhemispheric coherence (ρ=0.5; P=0.002). The sweet spot of theta activity localized to the posterior third of the internal pallidum and theta power correlated with proximity to this location (ρ=0.23; P=0.002), which coincided with three previously published coordinates describing optimal stimulation targets. Finally, motor improvement through pallidal long term DBS correlated with theta peak amplitude (ρ=0.38; P=0.018).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Our findings suggest that theta oscillations in the internal pallidum are robustly associated with dystonic symptoms in cervical dystonia and may be a useful biomarker for adaptive closed-loop stimulation. Furthermore, theta oscillatory activity may have a predictive value for the clinical benefit after chronic DBS that could be used to improve intraoperative neurophysiological target mapping during electrode implantation.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25085-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutations in ABCD1 cause the neurodegenerative disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, which manifests as the spinal cord axonopathy adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) in nearly all males surviving into adulthood. Microglial dysfunction has long been implicated in pathogenesis of brain disease, but its role in the spinal cord is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25085-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assessed spinal cord microglia in humans and mice with AMN and investigated the role of ABCD1 in microglial activity toward neuronal phagocytosis in cell culture. Because mutations in ABCD1 lead to incorporation of very-long-chain fatty acids into phospholipids, we separately examined the effects of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) upon microglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25085-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the spinal cord of humans and mice with AMN, upregulation of several phagocytosis-related markers, such as MFGE8 and TREM2, precedes complement activation and synapse loss. Unexpectedly, this occurs in the absence of overt inflammation. LPC C26:0 added to ABCD1-deficient microglia in culture further enhances MFGE8 expression, aggravates phagocytosis, and leads to neuronal injury. Furthermore, exposure to a MFGE8-blocking antibody reduces phagocytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25085-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord microglia lacking ABCD1 are primed for phagocytosis, affecting neurons within an altered metabolic milieu. Blocking phagocytosis or specific phagocytic receptors may alleviate synapse loss and axonal degeneration. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region for gait recovery after stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25086</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25086-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One-third of all stroke survivors are unable to walk, even after intensive physiotherapy. Thus, other concepts to restore walking are needed. Because electrical stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) is known to elicit gait movements, this area might be a promising target for restorative neurostimulation in stroke patients with gait disability. The present study aims to delineate the effect of high-frequency stimulation of the MLR (MLR-HFS) on gait impairment in a rodent stroke model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25086-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male Wistar rats underwent photothrombotic stroke of the right sensorimotor cortex and chronic implantation of a stimulating electrode into the right MLR. Gait was assessed using clinical scoring of the beam-walking test and video-kinematic analysis (CatWalk) at baseline and on days 3 and 4 after experimental stroke with and without MLR-HFS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25086-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kinematic analysis revealed significant changes in several dynamic and static gait parameters resulting in overall reduced gait velocity. All rats exhibited major coordination deficits during the beam-walking challenge and were unable to cross the beam. Simultaneous to the onset of MLR-HFS, a significantly higher walking speed and improvements in several dynamic gait parameters were detected by the CatWalk system. Rats regained the ability to cross the beam unassisted, showing a reduced number of paw slips and misses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25086-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLR-HFS can improve disordered locomotor function in a rodent stroke model. It may act by shielding brainstem and spinal locomotor centers from abnormal cortical input after stroke, thus allowing for compensatory and independent action of these circuits.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Stereoelectroencephalography and surgical outcome in polymicrogyria-related epilepsy: A multicentric study</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25081-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We retrospectively analyzed 58 cases: 49 had SEEG and 39 corticectomy or hemispherotomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25081-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mean age at SEEG or surgery was 28.3 years (range, 2–50). PMG was bilateral in 9 (16%) patients and unilateral in 49, including 17 (29%) unilobar, 12 (21%) multilobar, 15 (26%) perisylvian, and only 5 (9%) hemispheric. Twenty-eight (48%) patients additionally had schizencephaly, heterotopia, or focal cortical dysplasia. The SEEG-determined EZ was fully concordant with the PMG in only 8 (16%) cases, partially concordant in 74%, and discordant in 10%. The EZ included remote cortical areas in 21 (43%) cases and was primarily localized in those in 5 (10%), all related to the mesial temporal structures. All but 1 PMG patient with corticectomy or hemispherotomy had a unilateral PMG. At last follow-up (mean, 4.6 years; range, 1–16), 28 (72%) patients remained seizure free. Shorter epilepsy duration to surgery was an independent predictor of seizure freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25081-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;PMG-related drug-resistant epilepsy warrants a comprehensive presurgical evaluation, including SEEG investigations in most cases, given that the EZ may only partially overlap with the PMG or include solely remote cortical areas. Seizure freedom is feasible in a large proportion of patients. PMG extent should not deter from exploring the possibility of epilepsy surgery. Our data support the early consideration of epilepsy surgery in this patient group. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Significant associations between driver gene mutations and DNA methylation alterations across many cancer types</title>

Recent evidence shows that mutations in several driver genes can cause aberrant methylation patterns, a hallmark of cancer. In light of these findings, we hypothesized that the landscapes of tumor genomes and epigenomes are tightly interconnected. We measured this relationship using principal component analyses and methylation-mutation associations applied at the nucleotide level and with respect to genome-wide trends. We found that a few mutated driver genes were associated with genome-wide patterns of aberrant hypomethylation or CpG island hypermethylation in specific cancer types. In addition, we identified associations between 737 mutated driver genes and site-specific methylation changes. Moreover, using these mutation-methylation associations, we were able to distinguish between two uterine and two thyroid cancer subtypes. The driver gene mutation–associated methylation differences between the thyroid cancer subtypes were linked to differential gene expression in JAK-STAT signaling, NADPH oxidation, and other cancer-related pathways. These results establish that driver gene mutations are associated with methylation alterations capable of shaping regulatory network functions. In addition, the methodology presented here can be used to subdivide tumors into more homogeneous subsets corresponding to underlying molecular characteristics, which could improve treatment efficacy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Lpa6elrCmFE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Are there physicochemical differences between allosteric and competitive ligands?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005813</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/hJZ5tkpR4r8/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Richard D. Smith, Jing Lu, Heather A. Carlson&lt;/p&gt;

Previous studies have compared the physicochemical properties of allosteric compounds to non-allosteric compounds. Those studies have found that allosteric compounds tend to be smaller, more rigid, more hydrophobic, and more drug-like than non-allosteric compounds. However, previous studies have not properly corrected for the fact that some protein targets have much more data than other systems. This generates concern regarding the possible skew that can be introduced by the inherent bias in the available data. Hence, this study aims to determine how robust the previous findings are to the addition of newer data. This study utilizes the Allosteric Database (ASD v3.0) and ChEMBL v20 to systematically obtain large datasets of both allosteric and competitive ligands. This dataset contains 70,219 and 9,511 unique ligands for the allosteric and competitive sets, respectively. Physically relevant compound descriptors were computed to examine the differences in their chemical properties. Particular attention was given to removing redundancy in the data and normalizing across ligand diversity and varied protein targets. The resulting distributions only show that allosteric ligands tend to be more aromatic and rigid and do not confirm the increase in hydrophobicity or difference in drug-likeness. These results are robust across different normalization schemes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hJZ5tkpR4r8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25087-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease mostly caused by autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptor associated with thymus abnormalities. Thymectomy has been proven to be an efficacious treatment for patients with MG, but postoperative myasthenic crisis often occurs and is a major complication. We aimed to develop and validate a simple scoring system based on clinical characteristics in the preoperative status to predict the risk of postoperative myasthenic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25087-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We studied 393 patients with MG who underwent thymectomy at 6 tertiary centers in Japan (275 patients for derivation and 118 for validation). Clinical characteristics, such as gender, age at onset and operation, body mass index, disease duration, MG subtype, severity, symptoms, preoperative therapy, operative data, and laboratory data, were reviewed retrospectively. A multivariate logistic regression with LASSO penalties was used to determine the factors associated with postoperative myasthenic crisis, and a score was assigned. Finally, the predictive score was evaluated using bootstrapping technique in the derivation and validation groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25087-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multivariate logistic regression identified 3 clinical factors for predicting postoperative myasthenic crisis risk: (1) vital capacity &amp;lt; 80%, (2) disease duration &amp;lt; 3 months, and (3) bulbar symptoms immediately before thymectomy. The postoperative myasthenic crisis predictive score, ranging from 0 to 6 points, had areas under the curve of 0.84 (0.66–0.96) in the derivation group and 0.80 (0.62–0.95) in the validation group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Axonal spike initiation can be maintained with low axonal Na channel density, but temporal precision of spiking is lost. (arXiv:1711.03383v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03383</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03383</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In central neurons, action potentials (APs) originate in the axon initial
segment (AIS) presumably due to its high concentration of voltage-dependent
sodium (NaV) channels. In the AIS, NaV and their cytoskeletal anchoring
proteins display a highly periodical nanoscale arrangement with unknown
functional relevance. In mouse hippocampal neurons, we examined a mutation of
the AIS-specific protein $\beta$IV-spectrin and assessed AP initiation locus,
AIS molecular organization, and the precision of in vivo-like AP encoding. In
mutants, NaV concentration was strongly reduced in AIS but not soma, while AIS
nanoscale organization was preserved. Surprisingly, APs still originated in the
axon, even if the axonal channel density was as low as in the somatic membrane.
However, the timing of those APs was less precise, therefore the neuron's
encoding bandwidth was substantially decreased. Therefore, the high NaV density
in the AIS is not required for axonal AP initiation, it is crucial for AP
timing precision.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A comparative study of the robustness of frequency--domain connectivity measures to finite data length. (arXiv:1711.03332v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03332</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03332</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this work we use numerical simulation to investigate how the temporal
length of the data affects the reliability of the estimates of brain
connectivity from EEG time--series. We assume that the neural sources follow a
stable MultiVariate AutoRegressive model, and consider three connectivity
metrics: Imaginary part of Coherency (IC), generalized Partial Directed
Coherence (gPDC) and frequency--domain Granger Causality (fGC). In order to
assess the statistical significance of the estimated values, we use the
surrogate data test by generating phase--randomized and autoregressive
surrogate data. We first consider the ideal case where we know the source time
courses exactly. Here we show how, expectedly, even exact knowledge of the
source time courses is not sufficient to provide reliable estimates of the
connectivity when the number of samples gets small; however, while gPDC and fGC
tend to provide a larger number of false positives, the IC becomes less
sensitive to the presence of connectivity. Then we proceed with more realistic
simulations, where the source time courses are estimated using eLORETA, and the
EEG signal is affected by biological noise of increasing intensity. Using the
ideal case as a reference, we show that the impact of biological noise on IC
estimates is qualitatively different from the impact on gPDC and fGC.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Estimation of neural connections from partially observed neural spikes. (arXiv:1711.03303v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03303</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Plasticity is one of the most important features of the nervous systems that
enable animals to adjust their behavior to an ever-changing external world. A
major mechanism of plasticity is the changes in synaptic efficacy between
neurons, and therefore estimation of neural connections is crucial for
investigating information processing in the brain. Although many analysis
methods have been proposed to this end, most of them suffer from a mathematical
difficulty that stems from the fact that activity of only a limited number of
neurons are available. That is, many existing methods ignore effects from
unobserved neurons. To overcome this difficulty, a novel probabilistic
framework is proposed for estimating neural connections from partially observed
spikes. In this study, we estimate influence on observed neurons from
unobserved neurons based on probabilistic firing model and abstract the
connections among observed neurons. Our numerical experiment supports
usefulness of our proposed method.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A modeling study of budding yeast colony formation and its relationship to budding pattern and aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005843</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yanli Wang, Wing-Cheong Lo, Ching-Shan Chou&lt;/p&gt;

Budding yeast, which undergoes polarized growth during budding and mating, has been a useful model system to study cell polarization. Bud sites are selected differently in haploid and diploid yeast cells: haploid cells bud in an axial manner, while diploid cells bud in a bipolar manner. While previous studies have been focused on the molecular details of the bud site selection and polarity establishment, not much is known about how different budding patterns give rise to different functions at the population level. In this paper, we develop a two-dimensional agent-based model to study budding yeast colonies with cell-type specific biological processes, such as budding, mating, mating type switch, consumption of nutrients, and cell death. The model demonstrates that the axial budding pattern enhances mating probability at an early stage and the bipolar budding pattern improves colony development under nutrient limitation. Our results suggest that the frequency of mating type switch might control the trade-off between diploidization and inbreeding. The effect of cellular aging is also studied through our model. Based on the simulations, colonies initiated by an aged haploid cell show declined mating probability at an early stage and recover as the rejuvenated offsprings become the majority. Colonies initiated with aged diploid cells do not show disadvantage in colony expansion possibly due to the fact that young cells contribute the most to colony expansion.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PXks6MGAEWo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Matrix-normal models for fMRI analysis. (arXiv:1711.03058v2 [stat.ML] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03058</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03058</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multivariate analysis of fMRI data has benefited substantially from advances
in machine learning. Most recently, a range of probabilistic latent variable
models applied to fMRI data have been successful in a variety of tasks,
including identifying similarity patterns in neural data (Representational
Similarity Analysis and its empirical Bayes variant, RSA and BRSA; Intersubject
Functional Connectivity, ISFC), combining multi-subject datasets (Shared
Response Mapping; SRM), and mapping between brain and behavior (Joint
Modeling). Although these methods share some underpinnings, they have been
developed as distinct methods, with distinct algorithms and software tools. We
show how the matrix-variate normal (MN) formalism can unify some of these
methods into a single framework. In doing so, we gain the ability to reuse
noise modeling assumptions, algorithms, and code across models. Our primary
theoretical contribution shows how some of these methods can be written as
instantiations of the same model, allowing us to generalize them to flexibly
modeling structured noise covariances. Our formalism permits novel model
variants and improved estimation strategies: in contrast to SRM, the number of
parameters for MN-SRM does not scale with the number of voxels or subjects; in
contrast to BRSA, the number of parameters for MN-RSA scales additively rather
than multiplicatively in the number of voxels. We empirically demonstrate
advantages of two new methods derived in the formalism: for MN-RSA, we show up
to 10x improvement in runtime, up to 6x improvement in RMSE, and more
conservative behavior under the null. For MN-SRM, our method grants a modest
improvement to out-of-sample reconstruction while relaxing an orthonormality
constraint of SRM. We also provide a software prototyping tool for MN models
that can flexibly reuse noise covariance assumptions and algorithms across
models.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Measuring functional connectivity from fMRI is important in understanding
processing in cortical networks. However, because brain's connection pattern is
complex, currently used methods are prone to produce false connections. We
introduce here a new method that uses derivative for estimating functional
connectivity. Using simulations, we benchmarked our method with other commonly
used methods. Our method achieves better results in complex network
simulations. This new method provides an alternative way to estimate functional
connectivity.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated impressive
performance on visual object classification tasks. In addition, it is a useful
model for predication of neuronal responses recorded in visual system. However,
there is still no clear understanding of what CNNs learn in terms of visual
neuronal circuits. Visualizing CNN's features to obtain possible connections to
neuronscience underpinnings is not easy due to highly complex circuits from the
retina to higher visual cortex. Here we address this issue by focusing on
single retinal ganglion cells with a simple model and electrophysiological
recordings from salamanders. By training CNNs with white noise images to
predicate neural responses, we found that convolutional filters learned in the
end are resembling to biological components of the retinal circuit. Features
represented by these filters tile the space of conventional receptive field of
retinal ganglion cells. These results suggest that CNN could be used to reveal
structure components of neuronal circuits.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Training coupled spin-torque nano-oscillators to classify patterns in real-time. (arXiv:1711.02704v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Substantial evidence indicates that the brain uses principles of non-linear
dynamics in neural processes, providing inspiration for computing with
nanoelectronic devices. However, training neural networks composed of dynamical
nanodevices requires finely controlling and tuning their coupled oscillations.
In this work, we show that the outstanding tunability of spintronic
nano-oscillators can solve this challenge. We successfully train a hardware
network of four spin-torque nano-oscillators to recognize spoken vowels by
tuning their frequencies according to an automatic real-time learning rule. We
show that the high experimental recognition rates stem from the high frequency
tunability of the oscillators and their mutual coupling. Our results
demonstrate that non-trivial pattern classification tasks can be achieved with
small hardware neural networks by endowing them with non-linear dynamical
features: here, oscillations and synchronization. This demonstration is a
milestone for spintronics-based neuromorphic computing.

Quantitative measurements of spinal cord atrophy are important in fully characterizing these and other spinal cord diseases. We aimed to investigate patterns of spinal cord atrophy and correlations with clinical markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Clinical disability scores, viral markers, and immunological parameters were obtained for patients and correlated with representative spinal cord cross-sectional area regions at the C2 to C3, C4 to C5, and T4 to T9 levels. In 2 HAM/TSP patients, spinal cord cross-sectional area was measured over 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

SPMS (62 [9], 66 [9], 32 [6]) and PPMS (65 [11], 68 [10], 35 [7]) have thinner cervical cords than HC and RRMS (73 [9], 77 [10], 37 [6]). Clinical disability scores (Expanded Disability Status Scale [&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.009] and Instituto de Pesquisas de Cananeia [&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03]) and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell frequency (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04) correlate with T4 to T9 spinal cord cross-sectional area in HAM/TSP. Higher cerebrospinal fluid HTLV-1 proviral load (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01) was associated with thinner spinal cord cross-sectional area.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Neural system identification for large populations separating &quot;what&quot; and &quot;where&quot;. (arXiv:1711.02653v1 [stat.ML])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists classify neurons into different types that perform similar
computations at different locations in the visual field. Traditional methods
for neural system identification do not capitalize on this separation of 'what'
and 'where'. Learning deep convolutional feature spaces that are shared among
many neurons provides an exciting path forward, but the architectural design
needs to account for data limitations: While new experimental techniques enable
recordings from thousands of neurons, experimental time is limited so that one
can sample only a small fraction of each neuron's response space. Here, we show
that a major bottleneck for fitting convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
neural data is the estimation of the individual receptive field locations, a
problem that has been scratched only at the surface thus far. We propose a CNN
architecture with a sparse readout layer factorizing the spatial (where) and
feature (what) dimensions. Our network scales well to thousands of neurons and
short recordings and can be trained end-to-end. We evaluate this architecture
on ground-truth data to explore the challenges and limitations of CNN-based
system identification. Moreover, we show that our network model outperforms
current state-of-the art system identification models of mouse primary visual
cortex.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Cortical microcircuits as gated-recurrent neural networks. (arXiv:1711.02448v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02448</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical circuits exhibit intricate recurrent architectures that are
remarkably similar across different brain areas. Such stereotyped structure
suggests the existence of common computational principles. However, such
principles have remained largely elusive. Inspired by gated-memory networks,
namely long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), we introduce a recurrent neural
network in which information is gated through inhibitory cells that are
subtractive (subLSTM). We propose a natural mapping of subLSTMs onto known
canonical excitatory-inhibitory cortical microcircuits. Our empirical
evaluation across sequential image classification and language modelling tasks
shows that subLSTM units can achieve similar performance to LSTM units. These
results suggest that cortical circuits can be optimised to solve complex
contextual problems and proposes a novel view on their computational function.
Overall our work provides a step towards unifying recurrent networks as used in
machine learning with their biological counterparts.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02177</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics has emerged as an exciting tool for manipulating neural
activity, which in turn, can modulate behavior in live organisms. However,
detecting the response to the optical stimulation requires electrophysiology
with physical contact or fluorescent imaging at target locations, which is
often limited by photobleaching and phototoxicity. In this paper, we show that
phase imaging can report the intracellular transport induced by optogenetic
stimulation. We developed a multimodal instrument that can both stimulate cells
with high spatial resolution and detect optical pathlength changes with
nanometer scale sensitivity. We found that optical pathlength fluctuations
following stimulation are consistent with active organelle transport.
Furthermore, the results indicate a broadening in the transport velocity
distribution, which is significantly higher in stimulated cells compared to
optogenetically inactive cells. It is likely that this label-free, contactless
measurement of optogenetic response will provide an enabling approach to
neuroscience.

	<description>Several experimental procedures are currently used to investigate the impact of the environment on brain plasticity under physiological and pathological conditions. The available methodologies are aimed at obtaining global or specific reductions or intensifications of the stimuli, with initial standardization in animal models being paralleled by translational applications to humans. More procedures can be combined together or applied in series to obtain powerful experimental paradigms, and the choice of a given setting should take into account the specific genetic background, age, and phenotypic vulnerabilities of the target subjects.</description>

	<description>Drugs that act on the brain oxytocin (OXT) system may provide a much-needed treatment breakthrough for substance-use disorders. Targeting the brain OXT system has the potential to treat addiction to all major classes of addictive substance and to intervene across all stages of the addiction cycle. Emerging evidence suggests that OXT is able to interfere with such a wide range of addictive behaviours for such a wide range of addictive substances by rebalancing core neural systems that become dysregulated over the course of addiction.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Metabolic dynamics restricted by conserved carriers: Jamming and feedback</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005847</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/LDEILmhSyzM/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Tetsuhiro S. Hatakeyama, Chikara Furusawa&lt;/p&gt;

To uncover the processes and mechanisms of cellular physiology, it first necessary to gain an understanding of the underlying metabolic dynamics. Recent studies using a constraint-based approach succeeded in predicting the steady states of cellular metabolic systems by utilizing conserved quantities in the metabolic networks such as carriers such as ATP/ADP as an energy carrier or NADH/NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as a hydrogen carrier. Although such conservation quantities restrict not only the steady state but also the dynamics themselves, the latter aspect has not yet been completely understood. Here, to study the dynamics of metabolic systems, we propose adopting a carrier cycling cascade (CCC), which includes the dynamics of both substrates and carriers, a commonly observed motif in metabolic systems such as the glycolytic and fermentation pathways. We demonstrate that the conservation laws lead to the jamming of the flux and feedback. The CCC can show slow relaxation, with a longer timescale than that of elementary reactions, and is accompanied by both robustness against small environmental fluctuations and responsiveness against large environmental changes. Moreover, the CCC demonstrates robustness against internal fluctuations due to the feedback based on the moiety conservation. We identified the key parameters underlying the robustness of this model against external and internal fluctuations and estimated it in several metabolic systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LDEILmhSyzM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Reading wild minds: A computational assay of Theory of Mind sophistication across seven primate species</title>

Theory of Mind (ToM), i.e. the ability to understand others' mental states, endows humans with highly adaptive social skills such as teaching or deceiving. Candidate evolutionary explanations have been proposed for the unique sophistication of human ToM among primates. For example, the &lt;i&gt;Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis&lt;/i&gt; states that the increasing complexity of social networks may have induced a demand for sophisticated ToM. This type of scenario ignores neurocognitive constraints that may eventually be crucial limiting factors for ToM evolution. In contradistinction, the &lt;i&gt;cognitive scaffolding hypothesis&lt;/i&gt; asserts that a species' opportunity to develop sophisticated ToM is mostly determined by its general cognitive capacity (on which ToM is scaffolded). However, the actual relationships between ToM sophistication and either brain volume (a proxy for general cognitive capacity) or social group size (a proxy for social network complexity) are unclear. Here, we let 39 individuals sampled from seven non-human primate species (lemurs, macaques, mangabeys, orangutans, gorillas and chimpanzees) engage in simple dyadic games against artificial ToM players (&lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a familiar human caregiver). Using computational analyses of primates' choice sequences, we found that the probability of exhibiting a ToM-compatible learning style is mainly driven by species' brain volume (rather than by social group size). Moreover, primates' social cognitive sophistication culminates in a precursor form of ToM, which still falls short of human fully-developed ToM abilities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OruXehLZRCo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fast amortized inference of neural activity from calcium imaging data with variational autoencoders. (arXiv:1711.01846v1 [stat.ML])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01846</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Calcium imaging permits optical measurement of neural activity. Since
intracellular calcium concentration is an indirect measurement of neural
activity, computational tools are necessary to infer the true underlying
spiking activity from fluorescence measurements. Bayesian model inversion can
be used to solve this problem, but typically requires either computationally
expensive MCMC sampling, or faster but approximate maximum-a-posteriori
optimization. Here, we introduce a flexible algorithmic framework for fast,
efficient and accurate extraction of neural spikes from imaging data. Using the
framework of variational autoencoders, we propose to amortize inference by
training a deep neural network to perform model inversion efficiently. The
recognition network is trained to produce samples from the posterior
distribution over spike trains. Once trained, performing inference amounts to a
fast single forward pass through the network, without the need for iterative
optimization or sampling. We show that amortization can be applied flexibly to
a wide range of nonlinear generative models and significantly improves upon the
state of the art in computation time, while achieving competitive accuracy. Our
framework is also able to represent posterior distributions over spike-trains.
We demonstrate the generality of our method by proposing the first
probabilistic approach for separating backpropagating action potentials from
putative synaptic inputs in calcium imaging of dendritic spines.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Base pair probability estimates improve the prediction accuracy of RNA non-canonical base pairs</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Michael F. Sloma, David H. Mathews&lt;/p&gt;

Prediction of RNA tertiary structure from sequence is an important problem, but generating accurate structure models for even short sequences remains difficult. Predictions of RNA tertiary structure tend to be least accurate in loop regions, where non-canonical pairs are important for determining the details of structure. Non-canonical pairs can be predicted using a knowledge-based model of structure that scores nucleotide cyclic motifs, or NCMs. In this work, a partition function algorithm is introduced that allows the estimation of base pairing probabilities for both canonical and non-canonical interactions. Pairs that are predicted to be probable are more likely to be found in the true structure than pairs of lower probability. Pair probability estimates can be further improved by predicting the structure conserved across multiple homologous sequences using the TurboFold algorithm. These pairing probabilities, used in concert with prior knowledge of the canonical secondary structure, allow accurate inference of non-canonical pairs, an important step towards accurate prediction of the full tertiary structure. Software to predict non-canonical base pairs and pairing probabilities is now provided as part of the RNAstructure software package.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/J5YsnnWYYZg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Allosteric modulation of cardiac myosin dynamics by omecamtiv mecarbil</title>

New promising avenues for the pharmacological treatment of skeletal and heart muscle diseases rely on direct sarcomeric modulators, which are molecules that can directly bind to sarcomeric proteins and either inhibit or enhance their activity. A recent breakthrough has been the discovery of the myosin activator omecamtiv mecarbil (OM), which has been shown to increase the power output of the cardiac muscle and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of heart failure. While the overall effect of OM on the mechano-chemical cycle of myosin is to increase the fraction of myosin molecules in the sarcomere that are strongly bound to actin, the molecular basis of its action is still not completely clear. We present here a Molecular Dynamics study of the motor domain of human cardiac myosin bound to OM, where the effects of the drug on the dynamical properties of the protein are investigated for the first time with atomistic resolution. We found that OM has a double effect on myosin dynamics, inducing a) an increased coupling of the motions of the converter and lever arm subdomains to the rest of the protein and b) a rewiring of the network of dynamic correlations, which produces preferential communication pathways between the OM binding site and distant functional regions. The location of the residues responsible for these effects suggests possible strategies for the future development of improved drugs and the targeting of specific cardiomyopathy-related mutations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9Z_oilE7eOc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Insight into glucocorticoid receptor signalling through interactome model analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005825</guid>

Glucocorticoid hormones (GCs) are used to treat a variety of diseases because of their potent anti-inflammatory effect and their ability to induce apoptosis in lymphoid malignancies through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Despite ongoing research, high glucocorticoid efficacy and widespread usage in medicine, resistance, disease relapse and toxicity remain factors that need addressing. Understanding the mechanisms of glucocorticoid signalling and how resistance may arise is highly important towards improving therapy. To gain insight into this we undertook a systems biology approach, aiming to generate a Boolean model of the glucocorticoid receptor protein interaction network that encapsulates functional relationships between the GR, its target genes or genes that target GR, and the interactions between the genes that interact with the GR. This model named GEB052 consists of 52 nodes representing genes or proteins, the model input (GC) and model outputs (cell death and inflammation), connected by 241 logical interactions of activation or inhibition. 323 changes in the relationships between model constituents following &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; knockouts were uncovered, and steady-state analysis followed by cell-based microarray genome-wide model validation led to an average of 57% correct predictions, which was taken further by assessment of model predictions against patient microarray data. Lastly, semi-quantitative model analysis via microarray data superimposed onto the model with a score flow algorithm has also been performed, which demonstrated significantly higher correct prediction ratios (average of 80%), and the model has been assessed as a predictive clinical tool using published patient microarray data. In summary we present an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; simulation of the glucocorticoid receptor interaction network, linked to downstream biological processes that can be analysed to uncover relationships between GR and its interactants. Ultimately the model provides a platform for future development both by directing laboratory research and allowing for incorporation of further components, encapsulating more interactions/genes involved in glucocorticoid receptor signalling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OQTHoGXLIUY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Conversely, there is increasing evidence that brain ischemia can cause cardiac dysfunction. The mechanisms underlying this neurogenic heart disease are incompletely understood. Although it is established that ischemic stroke is associated with cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial damage, elevated cardiac enzymes, and plasma catecholamines in the acute phase, nothing is known about the delayed consequences of ischemic stroke on cardiovascular function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25073-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine the long-term cardiac consequences of a focal cerebral ischemia, we subjected young and aged mice to a 30-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and analyzed cardiac function by serial transthoracic echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements up to week 8 after surgery. Finally, animals were treated with metoprolol to evaluate a pharmacologic treatment option to prevent the development of heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25073-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focal cerebral ischemia induced a long-term cardiac dysfunction with a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction and an increase in left ventricular volumes; this development was associated with higher peripheral sympathetic activity. Metoprolol treatment prevented the development of chronic cardiac dysfunction by decelerating extracellular cardiac remodeling and inhibiting sympathetic signaling relevant to chronic autonomic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25073-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focal cerebral ischemia in mice leads to the development of chronic systolic dysfunction driven by increased sympathetic activity. If these results can be confirmed in a clinical setting, treating physicians should be attentive to clinical signs of heart failure in every patient after ischemic stroke. Therapeutically, the successful β-blockade with metoprolol in mice could also have future clinical implications. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                     Arid1b haploinsufficiency causes autism and intellectual disability, yet the neurobiological basis of this is unknown. The authors demonstrate that Arid1b-heterozygous mice have impaired cortical interneuron development and epigenetic signatures. These mice also have cognitive and social deficits, which are reversed by treatment with a GABA&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;-receptor-positive allosteric modulator.&lt;/p&gt;, isJats=true)&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/aXWe6_DqvAE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Serum tau and neurological outcome in cardiac arrest</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25067-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test serum tau as a predictor of neurological outcome after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25067-sec-0102&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We measured the neuronal protein tau in serum at 24, 48, and 72 hours after cardiac arrest in 689 patients in the prospective international Target Temperature Management trial. The main outcome was poor neurological outcome, defined as Cerebral Performance Categories 3–5 at 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25067-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased tau was associated with poor outcome at 6 months after cardiac arrest (median = 38.5, interquartile range [IQR] = 5.7–245ng/l in poor vs median = 1.5, IQR = 0.7–2.4ng/l in good outcome, for tau at 72 hours, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Tau improved prediction of poor outcome compared to using clinical information (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Tau cutoffs had low false-positive rates (FPRs) for good outcome while retaining high sensitivity for poor outcome. For example, tau at 72 hours had FPR = 2% (95% CI = 1–4%) with sensitivity = 66% (95% CI = 61–70%). Tau had higher accuracy than serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.91 for tau vs 0.86 for NSE at 72 hours, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.00024). During follow-up (up to 956 days), tau was significantly associated with overall survival. The accuracy in predicting outcome by serum tau was equally high for patients randomized to 33 °C and 36 °C targeted temperature after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25067-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serum tau is a promising novel biomarker for prediction of neurological outcome in patients with cardiac arrest. It may be significantly better than serum NSE, which is recommended in guidelines and currently used in clinical practice in several countries to predict outcome after cardiac arrest.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Reforming the Taxonomy in Disorders of Consciousness</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper examines the serious shortcomings that characterize the current taxonomy of post-comatose disorders of consciousness (DoC), and it provides guidelines for how an improved DoC taxonomy might be developed. In particular, it is argued that behavioural criteria for the application of DoC categories should be supplemented with brain-based criteria (e.g., information derived from EEG and fMRI), and that the categorical framework that currently characterizes DoC should be replaced by a more complex framework that better captures the performance of patients across a range of cognitive and behavioural tasks.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Effect of sensory and motor connectivity on hand function in pediatric hemiplegia</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25080-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested the hypothesis that somatosensory system injury would more strongly affect movement than motor system injury in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (USCP). This hypothesis was based on how somatosensory and corticospinal circuits adapt to injury during development; whereas the motor system can maintain connections to the impaired hand from the uninjured hemisphere, this does not occur in the somatosensory system. As a corollary, cortical injury strongly impairs sensory function, so we hypothesized that cortical lesions would impair hand function more than subcortical lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25080-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four children with unilateral cerebral palsy had physiological and anatomical measures of the motor and somatosensory systems and lesion classification. Motor physiology was performed with transcranial magnetic stimulation and somatosensory physiology with vibration-evoked electroencephalographic potentials. Tractography of the corticospinal tract and the medial lemniscus was performed with diffusion tensor imaging, and lesions were classified by magnetic resonance imaging. Anatomical and physiological results were correlated with measures of hand function using 2 independent statistical methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25080-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with disruptions in the somatosensory connectivity and cortical lesions had the most severe upper extremity impairments, particularly somatosensory function. Motor system connectivity was significantly correlated with bimanual function, but not unimanual function or somatosensory function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25080-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sensory and motor connectivity impact hand function in children with USCP. Somatosensory connectivity could be an important target for recovery of hand function in children with USCP. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>The striking diversity of cells in the nervous system has long inspired scientists to ask how the various cell types of the nervous system are generated, wired, and respond to each other to allow for the diverse and dynamic behaviors generated by the brain. Neuronal cell biology has been a cornerstone of Neuron since its inception in 1988 and was the focus of a previous special issue in 2003. Just as systems and cognitive neuroscience is flourishing with new technologies to manipulate and visualize neural circuits, molecular and cellular neuroscience is in a time of growth and rapid discovery.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Does smoking impact dopamine neuronal loss in de novo Parkinson disease?</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study analyzed data from dopamine transporter (DAT) positron emission tomographic scans of 282 male patients with de novo Parkinson disease to investigate whether smoking impacts striatal dopamine neuronal degeneration. Mean DAT activity in the posterior (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.016) and ventral putamen (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.028) was higher in 44 current smokers in comparison to 105 ex-smokers and 133 never-smokers. The severity of baseline motor deficits and the longitudinal increases in levodopa-equivalent doses during follow-up were similar among the 3 groups. These results suggest that current smoking, but not past smoking, protects dopamine neuronal degeneration in the sensorimotor striatum with no additional clinical benefits.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25079-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oral anticoagulation treatment (OAT) resumption is a therapeutic dilemma in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) care, particularly for lobar hemorrhages related to amyloid angiopathy. We sought to determine whether OAT resumption after ICH is associated with long-term outcome, accounting for ICH location (ie, lobar vs nonlobar).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25079-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We meta-analyzed individual patient data from: (1) the multicenter RETRACE study (n = 542), (2) a U.S.-based single-center ICH study (n = 261), and (3) the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage study (n = 209). We determined whether, within 1 year from ICH, OAT resumption was associated with: (1) mortality, (2) favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale = 0–3), and (3) stroke incidence. We separately analyzed nonlobar and lobar ICH cases using propensity score matching and Cox regression models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25079-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We included 1,012 OAT-related ICH survivors (633 nonlobar and 379 lobar). Among nonlobar ICH survivors, 178/633 (28%) resumed OAT, whereas 86/379 (23%) lobar ICH survivors did. In multivariate analyses, OAT resumption after nonlobar ICH was associated with decreased mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.14–0.44, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and improved functional outcome (HR = 4.22, 95% CI = 2.57–6.94, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). OAT resumption after lobar ICH was also associated with decreased mortality (HR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.17–0.45, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and favorable functional outcome (HR = 4.08, 95% CI = 2.48–6.72, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, OAT resumption was associated with decreased all-cause stroke incidence in both lobar and nonlobar ICH (both &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25079-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest novel evidence of an association between OAT resumption and outcome following ICH, regardless of hematoma location. These findings support conducting randomized trials to explore risks and benefits of OAT resumption after ICH. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Traumatic brain injury in the prodromal period of Parkinson's disease: A large epidemiological study using medicare data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25074</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25074-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies suggest a greater risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) after traumatic brain injury (TBI), but it is possible that the risk of TBI is greater in the prodromal period of PD. We aimed to examine the time-to-TBI in PD patients in their prodromal period compared to population-based controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25074-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified 89,790 incident PD cases and 118,095 comparable controls aged &amp;gt; 65 years in 2009 using Medicare claims data. Using data from the preceding 5 years, we compared time-to-TBI in PD patients in their prodromal period to controls. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for TBI in a Cox regression, while adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, modified Charlson comorbidity index, smoking, and alcohol use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25074-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk of TBI was greater in PD patients in their prodromal period across all age and sex groups, with HRs consistently increasing with proximity to PD diagnosis. HRs ranged from 1.64 (95% CI, 1.52, 1.77) 5 years preceding diagnosis to 3.93 (95% CI, 3.74, 4.13) in the year before. The interaction between PD, TBI, and time was primarily observed for TBI attributed to falls. Motor dysfunction and cognitive impairment, suggested by corresponding International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes, partially mediated the PD-TBI association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25074-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a strong association between PD and a recent TBI in the prodromal period of PD. This association strengthens as PD diagnosis approaches and may be a result of undetected nonmotor and motor symptoms, but confirmation will be required.

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25070-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical and radiological data of 42 Italian patients with PML were analyzed. Patient's data are available until 12 months after PML diagnosis. PLEX and steroids treatment as time-dependent covariates were entered in: (1) a Cox model to investigate their impact on full-blown PML-IRIS latency; (2) an analysis of variance ANOVA to investigate their impact on IRIS duration; and (3) a linear mixed model to assess their impact on the longitudinal clinical course (measured by means of Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25070-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment with PLEX was not associated to PML-IRIS latency (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.05; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.92), but once IRIS emerged, its duration was significantly longer in patients who underwent PLEX (101 vs 54 days in PLEX&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and PLEX&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; patients; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.028). Receiving proST versus therST was not associated to IRIS latency (HR = 0.67; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.39) or duration (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.95). Patients who underwent proST had a significantly higher EDSS increase during PML (0.09 EDSS points per month; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04) as compared to those who had therST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25070-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study highlights that: (1) caution on the use of PLEX should be considered as the current data do not support a beneficial effect of PLEX and (2) caution on the early use of steroids is suggested because their prophylactic use to prevent full-blown PML-IRIS seems to negatively impact on the longitudinal disability course.

	<description>The brain has the ability to sense, coordinate, and respond to environmental changes through biological processes involving activity-dependent gene expression. cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription coactivators (CRTCs) have recently emerged as novel transcriptional regulators of essential biological functions, while their deregulation is linked to age-related human diseases. In the brain, CRTCs are unique signaling factors that act as sensors and integrators of hormonal, metabolic, and neural signals contributing to brain plasticity and brain–body communication.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Prediction of phenotypic severity in mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25069</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25069-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA or Sanfilippo disease type A is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder presenting in early childhood, caused by an inherited deficiency of the lysosomal hydrolase sulfamidase. New missense mutations, for which genotype–phenotype correlations are currently unknown, are frequently reported, hampering early prediction of phenotypic severity and efficacy assessment of new disease-modifying treatments. We aimed to design a method to determine phenotypic severity early in the disease course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25069-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-three patients were included for whom skin fibroblasts and data on disease course and mutation analysis were available. Patients were phenotypically characterized on clinical data as rapidly progressing or slowly progressing. Sulfamidase activity was measured in fibroblasts cultured at 37 °C and at 30 °C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25069-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts from patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for a combination of known severe mutations remained below the limit of quantification under both culture conditions. In contrast, sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts from patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for a known mild mutation increased above the limit of quantification when cultured at 30 °C. With division on the basis of the patients' phenotype, fibroblasts from slowly progressing patients could be separated from rapidly progressing patients by increase in sulfamidase activity when cultured at 30 °C (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001, sensitivity = 96%, specificity = 93%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25069-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phenotypic severity strongly correlates with the potential to increase sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts cultured at 30 °C, allowing reliable distinction between patients with rapidly progressing or slowly progressing phenotypes. This method may provide an essential tool for assessment of treatment effects and for health care and life planning decisions. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elucidating the underlying components of food valuation in the human orbitofrontal cortex&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 23 October 2017; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-017-0008-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-017-0008-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suzuki et al. found that food valuation is related to beliefs about nutritive attributes.

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Predicting Age Using Neuroimaging: Innovative Brain Ageing Biomarkers</title>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30187-X?rss=yes</link>
	<description>The brain changes as we age and these changes are associated with functional deterioration and neurodegenerative disease. It is vital that we better understand individual differences in the brain ageing process; hence, techniques for making individualised predictions of brain ageing have been developed. We present evidence supporting the use of neuroimaging-based ‘brain age’ as a biomarker of an individual’s brain health. Increasingly, research is showing how brain disease or poor physical health negatively impacts brain age.</description>
