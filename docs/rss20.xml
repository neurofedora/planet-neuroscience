	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Multi-scale detection of hierarchical community architecture in structural and functional brain networks. (arXiv:1704.05826v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05826</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05826</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Community detection algorithms have been widely used to study the
organization of complex systems like the brain. A principal appeal of these
techniques is their ability to identify a partition of brain regions (or nodes)
into communities, where nodes within a community are densely interconnected. In
their simplest application, community detection algorithms are agnostic to the
presence of community hierarchies, but a common characteristic of many neural
systems is a nested hierarchy. To address this limitation, we exercise a
multi-scale extension of a community detection technique known as modularity
maximization, and we apply the tool to both synthetic graphs and graphs derived
from human structural and functional imaging data. Our multi-scale community
detection algorithm links a graph to copies of itself across neighboring
topological scales, thereby becoming sensitive to conserved community
organization across neighboring levels of the hierarchy. We demonstrate that
this method allows for a better characterization of topological inhomogeneities
of the graph's hierarchy by providing a local (node) measure of community
stability and inter-scale reliability across topological scales. We compare the
brain's structural and functional network architectures and demonstrate that
structural graphs display a wider range of topological scales than functional
graphs. Finally, we build a multimodal multiplex graph that combines structural
and functional connectivity in a single model, and we identify the topological
scales where resting state functional connectivity and underlying structural
connectivity show similar versus unique hierarchical community architecture.
Together, our results showcase the advantages of the multi-scale community
detection algorithm in studying hierarchical community structure in brain
graphs, and they illustrate its utility in modeling multimodal neuroimaging
data.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: EEG source imaging assists decoding in a face recognition task. (arXiv:1704.05748v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05748</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05748</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;EEG based brain state decoding has numerous applications. State of the art
decoding is based on processing of the multivariate sensor space signal,
however evidence is mounting that EEG source reconstruction can assist
decoding. EEG source imaging leads to high-dimensional representations and
rather strong a priori information must be invoked. Recent work by Edelman et
al. (2016) has demonstrated that introduction of a spatially focal source space
representation can improve decoding of motor imagery. In this work we explore
the generality of Edelman et al. hypothesis by considering decoding of face
recognition. This task concerns the differentiation of brain responses to
images of faces and scrambled faces and poses a rather difficult decoding
problem at the single trial level. We implement the pipeline using spatially
focused features and show that this approach is challenged and source imaging
does not lead to an improved decoding. We design a distributed pipeline in
which the classifier has access to brain wide features which in turn does lead
to a 15% reduction in the error rate using source space features. Hence, our
work presents supporting evidence for the hypothesis that source imaging
improves decoding.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: NEURAL: quantitative features for newborn EEG using Matlab. (arXiv:1704.05694v1 [physics.med-ph])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05694</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05694</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: For newborn infants in critical care, continuous monitoring of
brain function can help identify infants at-risk of brain injury. Quantitative
features allow a consistent and reproducible approach to EEG analysis, but only
when all implementation aspects are clearly defined.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods: We detail quantitative features frequently used in neonatal EEG
analysis and present a Matlab software package together with exact
implementation details for all features. The feature set includes stationary
features that capture amplitude and frequency characteristics and features of
inter-hemispheric connectivity. The software, a Neonatal Eeg featURe set in
mAtLab (NEURAL), is open source and freely available. The software also
includes a pre-processing stage with a basic artefact removal procedure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: NEURAL provides a common platform for quantitative analysis of
neonatal EEG. This will support reproducible research and enable comparisons
across independent studies. These features present summary measures of the EEG
that can also be used in automated methods to determine brain development and
health of the newborn in critical care.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Neural (EEG) Response during Creation and Appreciation: A Novel Study with Hindustani Raga Music. (arXiv:1704.05687v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05687</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;What happens inside the performers brain when he is performing and composing
a particular raga. Are there some specific regions in brain which are activated
when an artist is creating or imaging a raga in his brain. Do the regions
remain the same when the artist is listening to the same raga sung by him.
These are the questions that perplexed neuroscientists for a long time. In this
study we strive to answer these questions by using latest state of the art
techniques to assess brain response. An EEG experiment was conducted for two
eminent performers of Indian classical music, when they mentally created the
imagery of a raga Jay Jayanti in their mind, as well as when they listened to
the same raga. The beauty of Hindustani music lies in the fact that the
musician is himself the composer and recreates the imagery of the raga in his
mind while performing, hence the scope of creative improvisations are immense.
The alpha and theta frequency rhythms were segregated from each of the time
series data and analyzed using robust non MFDXA technique to quantitatively
assess the degree of cross-correlation of each EEG frequency rhythm in
different combination of electrodes from frontal, occipital and temporal lobes.
A strong response was found in the occipital and fronto occipital region during
mental improvisation of the raga, which is an interesting revelation of this
study. Strong retentive features were obtained in regard to both alpha and
theta rhythms in musical listening in the fronto temporal and occipital
temporal region while the features were almost absent in the thinking part.
Further, other specific regions have been identified separately for the two
separate conditions in which the correlations among the different lobes were
the strongest.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Towards a theory of cortical columns: From spiking neurons to interacting neural populations of finite size</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Tilo Schwalger, Moritz Deger, Wulfram Gerstner&lt;/p&gt;

Neural population equations such as neural mass or field models are widely used to study brain activity on a large scale. However, the relation of these models to the properties of single neurons is unclear. Here we derive an equation for several interacting populations at the mesoscopic scale starting from a microscopic model of randomly connected generalized integrate-and-fire neuron models. Each population consists of 50–2000 neurons of the same type but different populations account for different neuron types. The stochastic population equations that we find reveal how spike-history effects in single-neuron dynamics such as refractoriness and adaptation interact with finite-size fluctuations on the population level. Efficient integration of the stochastic mesoscopic equations reproduces the statistical behavior of the population activities obtained from microscopic simulations of a full spiking neural network model. The theory describes nonlinear emergent dynamics such as finite-size-induced stochastic transitions in multistable networks and synchronization in balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The mesoscopic equations are employed to rapidly integrate a model of a cortical microcircuit consisting of eight neuron types, which allows us to predict spontaneous population activities as well as evoked responses to thalamic input. Our theory establishes a general framework for modeling finite-size neural population dynamics based on single cell and synapse parameters and offers an efficient approach to analyzing cortical circuits and computations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qqiGo_2jYDE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Task-Dependent Behavioral Dynamics Make the Case for Temporal Integration in Multiple Strategies during Odor Processing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4416?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Differing results in olfactory-based decision-making research regarding the amount of time that rats and mice use to identify odors have led to some disagreements about odor-processing mechanics, including whether or not rodents use temporal integration (i.e., sniffing longer to identify odors better). Reported differences in behavioral strategies may be due to the different types of tasks used in different laboratories. Some researchers have reported that animals performing two-alternative choice (TAC) tasks need only 1–2 sniffs and do not increase performance with longer sampling. Others have reported that animals performing go/no-go (GNG) tasks increase sampling times and performance for difficult discriminations, arguing for temporal integration. We present results from four experiments comparing GNG and TAC tasks over several behavioral variables (e.g., performance, sampling duration). When rats know only one task, they perform better in GNG than in TAC. However, performance was not statistically different when rats learned and were tested in both tasks. Rats sample odors longer in GNG than in TAC, even when they know both tasks and perform them in the same or different sessions. Longer sampling is associated with better performance for both tasks in difficult discriminations, which supports the case for temporal integration over ≥2–6 sniffs in both tasks. These results illustrate that generalizations from a single task about behavioral or cognitive abilities (e.g., processing, perception) do not capture the full range of complexity and can significantly impact inferences about general abilities in sensory perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Behavioral tasks and training and testing history affect measured outcomes in cognitive tests. Rats sample odors longer in a go/no-go (GNG) than in a two-alternative choice (TAC) task, performing better in GNG unless they know both tasks. Odor-sampling time is extended in both tasks when the odors to be discriminated are very similar. Rats may extend sampling time to integrate odor information up to ~0.5 s (2–6 sniffs). Such factors as task, task parameters, and training history affect decision times and performance, making it important to use multiple tasks when making inferences about sensory or cognitive processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cholinergic, But Not Dopaminergic or Noradrenergic, Enhancement Sharpens Visual Spatial Perception in Humans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4405?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neuromodulator acetylcholine modulates spatial integration in visual cortex by altering the balance of inputs that generate neuronal receptive fields. These cholinergic effects may provide a neurobiological mechanism underlying the modulation of visual representations by visual spatial attention. However, the consequences of cholinergic enhancement on visuospatial perception in humans are unknown. We conducted two experiments to test whether enhancing cholinergic signaling selectively alters perceptual measures of visuospatial interactions in human subjects. In Experiment 1, a double-blind placebo-controlled pharmacology study, we measured how flanking distractors influenced detection of a small contrast decrement of a peripheral target, as a function of target-flanker distance. We found that cholinergic enhancement with the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil improved target detection, and modeling suggested that this was mainly due to a narrowing of the extent of facilitatory perceptual spatial interactions. In Experiment 2, we tested whether these effects were selective to the cholinergic system or would also be observed following enhancements of related neuromodulators dopamine or norepinephrine. Unlike cholinergic enhancement, dopamine (bromocriptine) and norepinephrine (guanfacine) manipulations did not improve performance or systematically alter the spatial profile of perceptual interactions between targets and distractors. These findings reveal mechanisms by which cholinergic signaling influences visual spatial interactions in perception and improves processing of a visual target among distractors, effects that are notably similar to those of spatial selective attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Acetylcholine influences how visual cortical neurons integrate signals across space, perhaps providing a neurobiological mechanism for the effects of visual selective attention. However, the influence of cholinergic enhancement on visuospatial perception remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that cholinergic enhancement improves detection of a target flanked by distractors, consistent with sharpened visuospatial perceptual representations. Furthermore, whereas most pharmacological studies focus on a single neurotransmitter, many neuromodulators can have related effects on cognition and perception. Thus, we also demonstrate that enhancing noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems does not systematically improve visuospatial perception or alter its tuning. Our results link visuospatial tuning effects of acetylcholine at the neuronal and perceptual levels and provide insights into the connection between cholinergic signaling and visual attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: K+ Channel Modulatory Subunits KChIP and DPP Participate in Kv4-Mediated Mechanical Pain Control</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4391?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4391?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel pore-forming subunit Kv4.3 is expressed in a subset of nonpeptidergic nociceptors within the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), and knockdown of Kv4.3 selectively induces mechanical hypersensitivity, a major symptom of neuropathic pain. K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel modulatory subunits KChIP1, KChIP2, and DPP10 are coexpressed in Kv4.3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; DRG neurons, but whether they participate in Kv4.3-mediated pain control is unknown. Here, we show the existence of a Kv4.3/KChIP1/KChIP2/DPP10 complex (abbreviated as the Kv4 complex) in the endoplasmic reticulum and cell surface of DRG neurons. After intrathecal injection of a gene-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to knock down the expression of each component in the Kv4 complex, mechanical hypersensitivity develops in the hindlimbs of rats in parallel with a reduction in all components in the lumbar DRGs. Electrophysiological data further indicate that the excitability of nonpeptidergic nociceptors is enhanced. The expression of all Kv4 complex components in DRG neurons is downregulated following spinal nerve ligation (SNL). To rescue Kv4 complex downregulation, cDNA constructs encoding Kv4.3, KChIP1, and DPP10 were transfected into the injured DRGs (defined as DRGs with injured spinal nerves) of living SNL rats. SNL-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity was attenuated, accompanied by a partial recovery of Kv4.3, KChIP1, and DPP10 surface levels in the injured DRGs. By showing an interdependent regulation among components in the Kv4 complex, this study demonstrates that K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel modulatory subunits KChIP1, KChIP2, and DPP10 participate in Kv4.3-mediated mechanical pain control. Thus, these modulatory subunits could be potential drug targets for neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuropathic pain, a type of moderate to severe chronic pain resulting from nerve injury or disorder, affects 6.9%–10% of the global population. However, less than half of patients report satisfactory pain relief from current treatments. K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, which act to reduce nociceptor activity, have been suggested to be novel drug targets for neuropathic pain. This study is the first to show that K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel modulatory subunits KChIP1, KChIP2, and DPP10 are potential drug targets for neuropathic pain because they form a channel complex with the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel pore-forming subunit Kv4.3 in a subset of nociceptors to selectively inhibit mechanical hypersensitivity, a major symptom of neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Linear Summation of Repulsive and Attractive Serial Dependencies: Orientation and Motion Dependencies Sum in Motion Perception</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4381?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4381?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent work from several groups has shown that perception of various visual attributes in human observers at a given moment is biased toward what was recently seen. This positive serial dependency is a kind of temporal averaging that exploits short-term correlations in visual scenes to reduce noise and stabilize perception. To date, this stabilizing &quot;continuity field&quot; has been demonstrated on stable visual attributes such as orientation and face identity, yet it would be counterproductive to apply it to dynamic attributes in which change sensitivity is needed. Here, we tested this using motion direction discrimination and predict a negative perceptual dependency: a contrastive relationship that enhances sensitivity to change. Surprisingly, our data showed a cubic-like pattern of dependencies with positive and negative components. By interleaving various stimulus combinations, we separated the components and isolated a positive perceptual dependency for motion and a negative dependency for orientation. A weighted linear sum of the separate dependencies described the original cubic pattern well. The positive dependency for motion shows an integrative perceptual effect and was unexpected, although it is consistent with work on motion priming. These findings suggest that a perception-stabilizing continuity field occurs pervasively, occurring even when it obscures sensitivity to dynamic stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent studies show that visual perception at a given moment is not entirely veridical, but rather biased toward recently seen stimuli: a positive serial dependency. This temporal smoothing process helps perceptual continuity by preserving stable aspects of the visual scene over time, yet, for dynamic stimuli, temporal smoothing would blur dynamics and reduce sensitivity to change. We tested whether this process is selective for stable attributes by examining dependencies in motion perception. We found a clear positive dependency for motion, suggesting that positive perceptual dependencies are pervasive. We also found a concurrent negative (contrastive) dependency for orientation. Both dependencies combined linearly to determine perception, showing that the brain can calculate contrastive and integrative dependencies simultaneously from recent stimulus history when making perceptual decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Effort-Based Reinforcement Processing and Functional Connectivity Underlying Amotivation in Medicated Patients with Depression and Schizophrenia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4370?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4370?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amotivation is a common phenotype of major depressive disorder and schizophrenia, which are clinically distinct disorders. Effective treatment targets and strategies can be discovered by examining the dopaminergic reward network function underlying amotivation between these disorders. We conducted an fMRI study in healthy human participants and medicated patients with depression and schizophrenia using an effort-based reinforcement task. We examined regional activations related to reward type (positive and negative reinforcement), effort level, and their composite value, as well as resting-state functional connectivities within the meso–striatal–prefrontal pathway. We found that integrated reward and effort values of low effort-positive reinforcement and high effort-negative reinforcement were behaviorally anticipated and represented in the putamen and medial orbitofrontal cortex activities. Patients with schizophrenia and depression did not show anticipation-related and work-related reaction time reductions, respectively. Greater amotivation severity correlated with smaller work-related putamen activity changes according to reward type in schizophrenia and effort level in depression. Patients with schizophrenia showed feedback-related putamen hyperactivity of low effort compared with healthy controls and depressed patients. The strength of medial orbitofrontal-striatal functional connectivity predicted work-related reaction time reduction of high effort negative reinforcement in healthy controls and amotivation severity in both patients with schizophrenia and those with depression. Patients with depression showed deficient medial orbitofrontal-striatal functional connectivity compared with healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia. These results indicate that amotivation in depression and schizophrenia involves different pathophysiology in the prefrontal-striatal circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Amotivation is present in both depression and schizophrenia. However, treatment involves the use of drugs that enhance serotonin activity in depression and inhibit serotonin and dopamine activity in schizophrenia. Understanding how motivation processed in the mesocorticolimbic and nigostriatal pathways is affected in depression and schizophrenia is important in discovering treatment targets and strategies for amotivation. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare patients with depression and schizophrenia in a common functional construct. By using an effort-based reinforcement task and examining resting-state functional connectivity in the dopaminergic network, we propose that difference in striato–orbitofrontal dysfunction in effort-based reinforcement between depression and schizophrenia may be related to differences in the extent of functional dysconnectivity in the dopaminergic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Prefrontal Cortex KCa2 Channels Regulate mGlu5-Dependent Plasticity and Extinction of Alcohol-Seeking Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4359?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Identifying novel treatments that facilitate extinction learning could enhance cue-exposure therapy and reduce high relapse rates in alcoholics. Activation of mGlu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex (IL-PFC) facilitates learning during extinction of cue-conditioned alcohol-seeking behavior. Small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2) channels have also been implicated in extinction learning of fear memories, and mGlu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation can reduce K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 channel function. Using a combination of electrophysiological, pharmacological, and behavioral approaches, this study examined K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 channels as a novel target to facilitate extinction of alcohol-seeking behavior in rats. This study also explored related neuronal and synaptic mechanisms within the IL-PFC that underlie mGlu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent enhancement of extinction learning. Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, activation of mGlu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; in &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; slices significantly reduced K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 channel currents in layer V IL-PFC pyramidal neurons, confirming functional downregulation of K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 channel activity by mGlu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. Additionally, positive modulation of K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 channels prevented mGlu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-dependent facilitation of long-term potentiation in the IL-PFC. Systemic and intra-IL-PFC treatment with apamin (K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 channel allosteric inhibitor) significantly enhanced extinction of alcohol-seeking behavior across multiple extinction sessions, an effect that persisted for 3 weeks, but was not observed after apamin microinfusions into the prelimbic PFC. Positive modulation of IL-PFC K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 channels significantly attenuated mGlu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent facilitation of alcohol cue-conditioned extinction learning. These data suggest that mGlu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent facilitation of extinction learning and synaptic plasticity in the IL-PFC involves functional inhibition of K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 channels. Moreover, these findings demonstrate that K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 channels are a novel target to facilitate long-lasting extinction of alcohol-seeking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Alcohol use disorder is a chronic relapsing disorder that is associated with compulsive alcohol-seeking behavior. One of the main causes of alcohol relapse is the craving caused by environmental cues that are associated with alcohol. These cues are formed by normal learning and memory principles, and the understanding of the brain mechanisms that help form these associations can lead to the development of drugs and/or behavior therapies that reduce the impact that these cues have on relapse in alcoholics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sleep Deprivation and Caffeine Treatment Potentiate Photic Resetting of the Master Circadian Clock in a Diurnal Rodent</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4343?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4343?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Circadian rhythms in nocturnal and diurnal mammals are primarily synchronized to local time by the light/dark cycle. However, nonphotic factors, such as behavioral arousal and metabolic cues, can also phase shift the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCNs) and/or reduce the synchronizing effects of light in nocturnal rodents. In diurnal rodents, the role of arousal or insufficient sleep in these functions is still poorly understood. In the present study, diurnal Sudanian grass rats, &lt;i&gt;Arvicanthis ansorgei&lt;/i&gt;, were aroused at night by sleep deprivation (gentle handling) or caffeine treatment that both prevented sleep. Phase shifts of locomotor activity were analyzed in grass rats transferred from a light/dark cycle to constant darkness and aroused in early night or late night. Early night, but not late night, sleep deprivation induced a significant phase shift. Caffeine on its own induced no phase shifts. Both sleep deprivation and caffeine treatment potentiated light-induced phase delays and phase advances in response to a 30 min light pulse, respectively. Sleep deprivation in early night, but not late night, potentiated light-induced c-Fos expression in the ventral SCN. Caffeine treatment in midnight triggered c-Fos expression in dorsal SCN. Both sleep deprivation and caffeine treatment potentiated light-induced c-Fos expression in calbindin-containing cells of the ventral SCN in early and late night. These findings indicate that, in contrast to nocturnal rodents, behavioral arousal induced either by sleep deprivation or caffeine during the sleeping period potentiates light resetting of the master circadian clock in diurnal rodents, and activation of calbindin-containing suprachiasmatic cells may be involved in this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Arousing stimuli have the ability to regulate circadian rhythms in mammals. Behavioral arousal in the sleeping period phase shifts the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei and/or slows down the photic entrainment in nocturnal animals. How these stimuli act in diurnal species remains to be established. Our study in a diurnal rodent, the Grass rat, indicates that sleep deprivation in the early rest period induces phase delays of circadian locomotor activity rhythm. Contrary to nocturnal rodents, both sleep deprivation and caffeine-induced arousal potentiate the photic entrainment in a diurnal rodent. Such enhanced light-induced circadian responses could be relevant for developing chronotherapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Working Memory Load Strengthens Reward Prediction Errors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4332?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4332?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning (RL) in simple instrumental tasks is usually modeled as a monolithic process in which reward prediction errors (RPEs) are used to update expected values of choice options. This modeling ignores the different contributions of different memory and decision-making systems thought to contribute even to simple learning. In an fMRI experiment, we investigated how working memory (WM) and incremental RL processes interact to guide human learning. WM load was manipulated by varying the number of stimuli to be learned across blocks. Behavioral results and computational modeling confirmed that learning was best explained as a mixture of two mechanisms: a fast, capacity-limited, and delay-sensitive WM process together with slower RL. Model-based analysis of fMRI data showed that striatum and lateral prefrontal cortex were sensitive to RPE, as shown previously, but, critically, these signals were reduced when the learning problem was within capacity of WM. The degree of this neural interaction related to individual differences in the use of WM to guide behavioral learning. These results indicate that the two systems do not process information independently, but rather interact during learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Reinforcement learning (RL) theory has been remarkably productive at improving our understanding of instrumental learning as well as dopaminergic and striatal network function across many mammalian species. However, this neural network is only one contributor to human learning and other mechanisms such as prefrontal cortex working memory also play a key role. Our results also show that these other players interact with the dopaminergic RL system, interfering with its key computation of reward prediction errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Phases of Hyperconnectivity and Hypoconnectivity in the Default Mode and Salience Networks Track with Amyloid and Tau in Clinically Normal Individuals</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by two hallmark molecular pathologies: amyloid aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; and Tau neurofibrillary tangles. To date, studies of functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) in individuals with preclinical AD have relied on associations with &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; measures of amyloid pathology. With the recent advent of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; Tau-PET tracers it is now possible to extend investigations on fcMRI in a sample of cognitively normal elderly humans to regional measures of Tau. We modeled fcMRI measures across four major cortical association networks [default-mode network (DMN), salience network (SAL), dorsal attention network, and frontoparietal control network] as a function of global cortical amyloid [Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET] and regional Tau (AV1451-PET) in entorhinal, inferior temporal (IT), and inferior parietal cortex. Results showed that the interaction term between PiB and IT AV1451 was significantly associated with connectivity in the DMN and salience. The interaction revealed that amyloid-positive (aβ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) individuals show increased connectivity in the DMN and salience when neocortical Tau levels are low, whereas aβ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; individuals demonstrate decreased connectivity in these networks as a function of elevated Tau-PET signal. This pattern suggests a hyperconnectivity phase followed by a hypoconnectivity phase in the course of preclinical AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This article offers a first look at the relationship between Tau-PET imaging with F&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;-AV1451 and functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) in the context of amyloid-PET imaging. The results suggest a nonlinear relationship between fcMRI and both Tau-PET and amyloid-PET imaging. The pattern supports recent conjecture that the AD fcMRI trajectory is characterized by periods of both hyperconnectivity and hypoconnectivity. Furthermore, this nonlinear pattern can account for the sometimes conflicting reports of associations between amyloid and fcMRI in individuals with preclinical Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Decoding Information for Grasping from the Macaque Dorsomedial Visual Stream</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4311?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodecoders have been developed by researchers mostly to control neuroprosthetic devices, but also to shed new light on neural functions. In this study, we show that signals representing grip configurations can be reliably decoded from neural data acquired from area V6A of the monkey medial posterior parietal cortex. Two &lt;i&gt;Macaca fascicularis&lt;/i&gt; monkeys were trained to perform an instructed-delay reach-to-grasp task in the dark and in the light toward objects of different shapes. Population neural activity was extracted at various time intervals on vision of the objects, the delay before movement, and grasp execution. This activity was used to train and validate a Bayes classifier used for decoding objects and grip types. Recognition rates were well over chance level for all the epochs analyzed in this study. Furthermore, we detected slightly different decoding accuracies, depending on the task's visual condition. Generalization analysis was performed by training and testing the system during different time intervals. This analysis demonstrated that a change of code occurred during the course of the task. Our classifier was able to discriminate grasp types fairly well in advance with respect to grasping onset. This feature might be important when the timing is critical to send signals to external devices before the movement start. Our results suggest that the neural signals from the dorsomedial visual pathway can be a good substrate to feed neural prostheses for prehensile actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recordings of neural activity from nonhuman primate frontal and parietal cortex have led to the development of methods of decoding movement information to restore coordinated arm actions in paralyzed human beings. Our results show that the signals measured from the monkey medial posterior parietal cortex are valid for correctly decoding information relevant for grasping. Together with previous studies on decoding reach trajectories from the medial posterior parietal cortex, this highlights the medial parietal cortex as a target site for transforming neural activity into control signals to command prostheses to allow human patients to dexterously perform grasping actions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distinct Actions of Voltage-Activated Ca2+ Channel Block on Spontaneous Release at Excitatory and Inhibitory Central Synapses</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;At chemical synapses, voltage-activated calcium channels (VACCs) mediate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx to trigger action potential-evoked neurotransmitter release. However, the mechanisms by which Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; regulates spontaneous transmission have not been fully determined. We have shown that VACCs are a major trigger of spontaneous release at neocortical inhibitory synapses but not at excitatory synapses, suggesting fundamental differences in spontaneous neurotransmission at GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses. Recently, VACC blockers were reported to reduce spontaneous release of glutamate and it was proposed that there was conservation of underlying mechanisms of neurotransmission at excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that the different effects on excitatory and inhibitory synapses may have resulted from off-target actions of Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, a nonselective VACC blocker, or other variations in experimental conditions. Here we report that in mouse neocortical neurons, selective and nonselective VACC blockers inhibit spontaneous release at inhibitory but not at excitatory terminals, and that this pattern is observed in culture and slice preparations as well as in synapses from acute slices of the auditory brainstem. The voltage dependence of Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; block of VACCs accounts for the apparent lower potency of Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; on spontaneous release of GABA than on VACC current amplitudes. Our findings indicate fundamental differences in the regulation of spontaneous release at inhibitory and excitatory synapses by stochastic VACC activity that extend beyond the cortex to the brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry via voltage-activated calcium channels (VACCs) is the major trigger of action potential-evoked synaptic release. However, the role of VACCs in the regulation of spontaneous neurotransmitter release (in the absence of a synchronizing action potential) remains controversial. We show that spontaneous release is affected differently by VACCs at excitatory and inhibitory synapses. At inhibitory synapses, stochastic openings of VACCs trigger the majority of spontaneous release, whereas they do not affect spontaneous release at excitatory synapses. We find this pattern to be wide ranging, holding for large and small synapses in the neocortex and brainstem. These findings indicate fundamental differences of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dependence of spontaneous release at excitatory and inhibitory synapses and heterogeneity of the mechanisms of release across the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Amyloid Precursor Protein in Drosophila Glia Regulates Sleep and Genes Involved in Glutamate Recycling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4289?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyloid precursor protein (App) plays a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease via the production and deposition of toxic β-amyloid peptides. App is heavily expressed in neurons, the focus of the vast majority of studies investigating its function. Meanwhile, almost nothing is known about App's function in glia, where it is also expressed, and can potentially participate in the regulation of neuronal physiology. In this report, we investigated whether &lt;i&gt;Appl&lt;/i&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; homolog of &lt;i&gt;App&lt;/i&gt;, could influence sleep–wake regulation when its function is manipulated in glial cells. &lt;i&gt;Appl&lt;/i&gt; inhibition in astrocyte-like and cortex glia resulted in higher sleep amounts and longer sleep bout duration during the night, while overexpression had the opposite effect. These sleep phenotypes were not the result of developmental defects, and were correlated with changes in expression in glutamine synthetase (GS) in astrocyte-like glia and in changes in the gap-junction component innexin2 in cortex glia. Downregulating both GS and innexin2, but not either one individually, resulted in higher sleep amounts, similarly to &lt;i&gt;Appl&lt;/i&gt; inhibition. Consistent with these results, the expression of GS and innexin2 are increased following sleep deprivation, indicating that GS and innexin2 genes are dynamically linked to vigilance states. Interestingly, the reduction of GS expression and the sleep phenotype observed upon &lt;i&gt;Appl&lt;/i&gt; inhibition could be rescued by increasing the expression of the glutamate transporter dEaat1. In contrast, reducing dEaat1 expression severely disrupted sleep. These results associate glutamate recycling, sleep, and a glial function for the App family proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The amyloid precursor protein (App) has been intensively studied for its implication in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The attributed functions of App are linked to the physiology and cellular biology of neurons where the protein is predominantly expressed. Consequences on glia in AD are generally thought to be secondary effects of the pathology in neurons. Researchers still do not know whether App plays a role in glia in nonpathological conditions. We report here that glial App plays a role in physiology and in the regulation of sleep/wake, which has been shown recently to be involved in AD pathology. These results also associate glutamate recycling and sleep regulation, adding further complexity to the physiological role of App and to its implication in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Effects of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome on the Dentate Gyrus and Learning and Memory in Children</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4280?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4280?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is associated with intermittent hypoxia and sleep loss. In children, impairments of cognitive function are important manifestations, but the underlying pathology is unknown. We hypothesized that OSAS would affect the dentate gyrus, a hippocampal subdivision essential to neurogenesis and cognition, and that this impact would further affect cognitive function in children. In children with OSAS (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 11) and control subjects (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 12; age and sex matched), we performed diffusion tensor imaging and structural MRI, polysomnography, and neuropsychological assessments. We found that OSAS was associated with decreased mean diffusivity of the left dentate gyrus (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002; false discovery rate corrected; adjusting for sex, age, and body mass index), showing a large effect size (partial &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.491), but not with any other structural measures across the brain. Decreased dentate gyrus mean diffusivity correlated with a higher apnea hypopnea index (Spearman's &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = –0.50, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008) and a greater arousal index (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = –0.44, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.017). OSAS did not significantly affect neuropsychological measures (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; values &amp;gt;0.5); however, a lower verbal learning score correlated with lower dentate gyrus mean diffusivity (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.54, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004). Path analysis demonstrated that dentate gyrus mean diffusivity mediates the impact of OSAS on verbal learning capacity. Finally, the diagnostic accuracy of a regression model based on dentate gyrus mean diffusivity reached 85.8% (cross validated). This study demonstrates a likely pathway of effects of OSAS on neurocognitive function in children, as well as potential utility of the dentate gyrus mean diffusivity as an early marker of brain pathology in children with OSAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In this study we investigate the relationships between dentate gyrus structure, hippocampus-dependent cognition, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). We demonstrate lower mean diffusivity of the dentate gyrus in children with OSAS, which correlates with a lower verbal learning and memory score. This study provides new evidence of disrupted microstructure of the dentate gyrus in children with OSAS that may help explain some of the neurocognitive deficits described in these children.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Multivoxel Pattern Analysis Reveals 3D Place Information in the Human Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4270?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The spatial world is three dimensional (3D) and humans and other animals move both horizontally and vertically within it. Extant neuroscientific studies have typically investigated spatial navigation on a horizontal 2D plane, leaving much unknown about how 3D spatial information is represented in the brain. Specifically, horizontal and vertical information may be encoded in the same or different neural structures with equal or unequal sensitivity. Here, we investigated these possibilities using fMRI while participants were passively moved within a 3D lattice structure as if riding a rollercoaster. Multivoxel pattern analysis was used to test for the existence of information relating to where and in which direction participants were heading in this virtual environment. Behaviorally, participants had similarly accurate memory for vertical and horizontal locations and the right anterior hippocampus (HC) expressed place information that was sensitive to changes along both horizontal and vertical axes. This is suggestive of isotropic 3D place encoding. In contrast, participants indicated their heading direction faster and more accurately when they were heading in a tilted-up or tilted-down direction. This direction information was expressed in the right retrosplenial cortex and posterior HC and was only sensitive to vertical pitch, which could reflect the importance of the vertical (gravity) axis as a reference frame. Overall, our findings extend previous knowledge of how we represent the spatial world and navigate within it by taking into account the important third dimension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The spatial world is 3D. We can move horizontally across surfaces, but also vertically, going up slopes or stairs. Little is known about how the brain supports representations of 3D space. A key question is whether horizontal and vertical information is equally well represented. Here, we measured fMRI response patterns while participants moved within a virtual 3D environment and found that the anterior hippocampus (HC) expressed location information that was sensitive to the vertical and horizontal axes. In contrast, information about heading direction, found in retrosplenial cortex and posterior HC, favored the vertical axis, perhaps due to gravity effects. These findings provide new insights into how we represent our spatial 3D world and navigate within it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: STAT3 Controls the Long-Term Survival and Phenotype of Repair Schwann Cells during Nerve Regeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4255?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4255?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After nerve injury, Schwann cells convert to a phenotype specialized to promote repair. But during the slow process of axonal regrowth, these repair Schwann cells gradually lose their regeneration-supportive features and eventually die. Although this is a key reason for the frequent regeneration failures in humans, the transcriptional mechanisms that control long-term survival and phenotype of repair cells have not been studied, and the molecular signaling underlying their decline is obscure. We show, in mice, that Schwann cell STAT3 has a dual role. It supports the long-term survival of repair Schwann cells and is required for the maintenance of repair Schwann cell properties. In contrast, STAT3 is less important for the initial generation of repair Schwann cells after injury. In repair Schwann cells, we find that Schwann cell STAT3 activation by Tyr705 phosphorylation is sustained during long-term denervation. STAT3 is required for maintaining autocrine Schwann cell survival signaling, and inactivation of Schwann cell STAT3 results in a striking loss of repair cells from chronically denervated distal stumps. STAT3 inactivation also results in abnormal morphology of repair cells and regeneration tracks, and failure to sustain expression of repair cell markers, including Shh, GDNF, and BDNF. Because Schwann cell development proceeds normally without STAT3, the function of this factor appears restricted to Schwann cells after injury. This identification of transcriptional mechanisms that support long-term survival and differentiation of repair cells will help identify, and eventually correct, the failures that lead to the deterioration of this important cell population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although injured peripheral nerves contain repair Schwann cells that provide signals and spatial clues for promoting regeneration, the clinical outcome after nerve damage is frequently poor. A key reason for this is that, during the slow growth of axons through the proximal parts of injured nerves repair, Schwann cells gradually lose regeneration-supporting features and eventually die. Identification of signals that sustain repair cells is therefore an important goal. We have found that in mice the transcription factor STAT3 protects these cells from death and contributes to maintaining the molecular and morphological repair phenotype that promotes axonal regeneration. Defining the molecular mechanisms that maintain repair Schwann cells is an essential step toward developing therapeutic strategies that improve nerve regeneration and functional recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Topography and Lateralized Effect of Acute Aromatase Inhibition on Auditory Processing in a Seasonal Songbird</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4243?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is increasingly recognized that brain-derived estrogens (neuroestrogens) can regulate brain physiology and behavior much faster than what was previously known from the transcriptional action of estrogens on nuclear receptors. One of the best examples of such neuromodulation by neuroestrogens concerns the acute regulation of sensory coding by the auditory cortex as demonstrated by electrophysiological studies of selected neurons in zebra finches. Yet, the spatial extent of such modulation by neuroestrogens is not known. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate here that acute estrogen depletion alters within minutes auditory processing in male European starlings. These effects are confined to very specific but large areas of the auditory cortex. They are also specifically lateralized to the left hemisphere. Interestingly, the modulation of auditory responses by estrogens was much larger (both in amplitude and in topography) in March than in December or May/June. This effect was presumably independent from changes in circulating testosterone concentrations since levels of the steroid were controlled by subcutaneous implants, thus suggesting actions related to other aspects of the seasonal cycle or photoperiodic manipulations. Finally, we also show that estrogen production specifically modulates selectivity for behaviorally relevant vocalizations in a specific part of the caudomedial nidopallium. These findings confirm and extend previous conclusions that had been obtained by electrophysiological techniques. This approach provides a new very powerful tool to investigate auditory responsiveness in songbirds and its fast modulation by sex steroids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuroestrogens can acutely modulate sensory processing in a manner similar to neuromodulators. We report that acute estrogen depletion rapidly disrupts auditory processing in large areas of the male starling brain. Effects were larger in March than in December or May/June, lateralized to the left hemisphere and specific to behaviorally relevant stimuli. These findings confirm and extend previous data that identified an acute regulation of auditory neurons in zebra finches by (1) delineating the extent of the brain region affected, (2) confirming its lateralization, and (3) demonstrating that a large part of the auditory brain regions are acutely affected by estrogens. These findings provide a very powerful tool to investigate auditory responsiveness in songbirds and its fast modulation by sex steroids.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Respiration-Deficient Astrocytes Survive As Glycolytic Cells In Vivo</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/16/4231?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons and glial cells exchange energy-rich metabolites and it has been suggested, originally based on &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; data, that astrocytes provide lactate to glutamatergic synapses (&quot;lactate shuttle&quot;). Here, we have studied astrocytes that lack mitochondrial respiration &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. A novel mouse mutant (&lt;i&gt;GLAST&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;CreERT2&lt;/sup&gt;::&lt;i&gt;Cox10&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox&lt;/sup&gt;) was generated, in which the administration of tamoxifen causes mutant astrocytes to fail in the assembly of mitochondrial cytochrome &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; oxidase (COX). Focusing on cerebellar Bergmann glia (BG) cells, which exhibit the highest rate of Cre-mediated recombination, we found a normal density of viable astrocytes even 1 year after tamoxifen-induced &lt;i&gt;Cox10&lt;/i&gt; gene targeting. Our data show that BG cells, and presumably all astrocytes, can survive by aerobic glycolysis for an extended period of time in the absence of glial pathology or unspecific signs of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When astrocytes are placed into culture, they import glucose and release lactate, an energy-rich metabolite readily metabolized by neurons. This observation led to the &quot;glia-to-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis,&quot; but &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; evidence for this hypothesis is weak. To study astroglial energy metabolism and the directionality of lactate flux, we generated conditional &lt;i&gt;Cox10&lt;/i&gt; mouse mutants lacking mitochondrial respiration in astrocytes, which forces these cells to survive by aerobic glycolysis. Here, we report that these mice are fully viable in the absence of any signs of glial or neuronal loss, suggesting that astrocytes are naturally glycolytic cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Linear Response of General Observables in Spiking Neuronal Network Models. (arXiv:1704.05344v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05344</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05344</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The activity of a neuronal network, characterized by action potentials
(spikes) is constrained by the intrinsic properties of neurons and their
interactions. When a neuronal network is submitted to external stimuli, the
statistics of spikes changes, and becomes difficult to disentangle the
influence of the stimuli from the intrinsic dynamics. Using the formalism of
Gibbs distributions we analyze this problem in a specific model
(Conductance-based Integrate-and-Fire), where the neuronal dynamics depends on
the history of spikes of the network. We derive a linear response formula
allowing to quantify the influence of a weak amplitude external stimuli on the
average value of arbitrary observables. This formula clearly disentangles the
effect of the stimuli, intrinsic neuronal dynamics, and network connectivity.
Upon some approximations, it reduces to a convolution, allowing to recover a
standard computation in computational neuroscience.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Criticality as It Could Be: organizational invariance as self-organized criticality in embodied agents. (arXiv:1704.05255v1 [nlin.AO])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05255</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05255</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper outlines a methodological approach to generate adaptive agents
driving themselves near points of criticality. Using a synthetic approach we
construct a conceptual model that, instead of specifying mechanistic
requirements to generate criticality, exploits the maintenance of an
organizational structure capable of reproducing critical behavior. Our approach
captures the well-known principle of universality that classifies critical
phenomena inside a few universality classes of systems without relying on
specific mechanisms or topologies. In particular, we implement an artificial
embodied agent controlled by a neural network maintaining a correlation
structure randomly sampled form a lattice Ising model at a critical point. We
evaluate the agent in two classical reinforcement learning scenarios: the
Mountain Car benchmark and the Acrobot double pendulum, finding that in both
cases the neural controller reaches a point of criticality, which coincides
with a transition point between two regimes of the agent's behaviour,
maximizing the synergistic information between hidden neurons and sensorimotor
patterns. Finally, we discuss the possible applications of this synthetic
approach to the comprehension of deeper principles connected to the pervasive
presence of criticality in biological and cognitive systems.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Creative Process of Cultural Evolution. (arXiv:1704.05056v1 [q-bio.PE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05056</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05056</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Even this saying itself is a variant of a similar statement attributed to
Bernard of Chartres in the 12th Century, and inspired the title for a book by
Steven Hawking and an album by Oasis. Creative ideas beget other creative ideas
and, as a result, modifications accumulate, and we see an overall increase in
the complexity of cultural novelty over time, a phenomenon sometimes referred
to as the ratchet effect (Tomasello, Kruger, &amp;amp; Ratner, 1993). Although we may
never meet the people or objects that creatively influence us, by assimilating
what we encounter around us and bringing to bear our own insights and
perspectives, we all contribute in our own way, however small, to a second
evolutionary process -- the evolution of culture. This chapter explores how we
can better understand culture by understanding the creative processes that fuel
it, and better understand creativity by examining it from its cultural context.
First, we look at some theoretical frameworks for how culture evolves and what
these frameworks imply for the role of creativity. Then we will see how
questions about the relationship between creativity and cultural evolution have
been addressed using an agent-based model. We will also discuss studies of how
creative outputs are influenced, in perhaps unexpected ways, by other ideas and
individuals, and how individual creative styles &quot;peek through&quot; cultural outputs
in different domains.

	<description>How are fear memories organized? In this issue of Neuron, Vetere et al. take a network-based approach to demonstrate the importance of highly interconnected hub regions in the consolidation of a fear memory. By doing so, they provide an elegant framework for predicting behavior from functional network properties.</description>

	<description>Introduction: Animal studies report abstinence from nicotine makes rewards less rewarding; however, the results of human tests of the effects of cessation on reward sensitivity are mixed. The current study tested reward sensitivity in abstinent smokers using more rigorous methods than most prior studies. Methods: A human laboratory study compared outcomes for 1 week prior to quitting to those during 4 weeks post-quit. The study used smokers trying to quit, objective and subjective measures, multiple measures during smoking and abstinence, and monetary rewards to increase the prevalence of abstinence. Current daily smokers (n = 211) who were trying to quit completed an operant measure of reward sensitivity and a survey of pleasure from various rewards as well as self-reports of anhedonia, delay discounting, positive affect and tobacco withdrawal twice each week. A comparison group of long-term former smokers (n = 67) also completed the tasks weekly for 4 weeks. Primary analyses were based on the 61 current smokers who abstained for all 4 weeks. Results: Stopping smoking decreased self-reported pleasure from rewards but did not decrease reward sensitivity on the operant task. Abstinence also decreased self-reported reward frequency and increased the two anhedonia measures. However, the changes with abstinence were small for all outcomes (6-14%) and most lasted less than a week. Conclusion: Abstinence from tobacco decreased most self-report measures of reward sensitivity; however, it did not change the objective measure. The self-report effects were small. Implications: Animal research suggests that nicotine withdrawal decreases reward sensitivity. Replication tests of this in humans have produced inconsistent results. We report what we believe is a more rigorous test We found smoking abstinence slightly decreases self-reports of reward sensitivity but does not do so for behavioral measures of reward sensitivity</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Effect Of Perinatal Brain Injury On Dopaminergic Function And Hippocampal Volume In Adult Life</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/128710v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Background: Very preterm birth (&amp;lt;32 weeks of gestation) is associated with long-lasting brain alterations and an increased risk of psychiatric disorders associated with dopaminergic abnormalities. Preclinical studies have shown perinatal brain injuries, including hippocampal lesions, cause lasting changes in dopamine function, but it is not known if this occurs in humans. The purpose of this study was to determine whether very preterm birth and perinatal brain injury were associated with altered dopamine synthesis and reduced hippocampal volume in humans in adulthood. Methods: We compared adults who were born very preterm with associated perinatal brain injury to adults born very preterm without perinatal brain injury, and age-matched controls born at full term using [18F]-DOPA PET and structural MRI imaging. Results: Dopamine synthesis capacity was significantly reduced in the perinatal brain injury group relative to both the group born very preterm without brain injury (Cohen's d=1.36, p=0.02) and the control group (Cohen's d=1.07, p=0.01). Hippocampal volume was reduced in the perinatal brain injury group relative to controls (Cohen's d = 1.17, p = 0.01). There was a significant correlation between hippocampal volume and striatal dopamine synthesis capacity (r = 0.344, p= 0.03). Conclusions: Perinatal brain injury, but not very preterm birth without macroscopic brain injury, is associated with persistent alterations in dopaminergic function and reductions in hippocampal volume. This is the first evidence in humans linking neonatal hippocampal injury to adult dopamine dysfunction, and has implications for understanding the mechanism underlying cognitive impairments and neuropsychiatric disorders following very preterm birth.</description>

	<description>Understanding the unique contributions of frontoparietal networks (FPN) in cognition is challenging because different FPNs spatially overlap and are co-activated for diverse tasks. In order to characterize these networks involves studying how they activate across many different cognitive tasks, which has only previously been possible with meta-analyses. Here, building upon meta-analyses as a starting point, we use neuroadaptive Bayesian optimization, an approach combining real-time analysis of functional neuroimaging data with machine-learning, to discover cognitive tasks that dissociate ventral and dorsal FPN activity from a large pool of tasks. We identify and subsequently refine two cognitive tasks (Deductive Reasoning and Tower of London) that are optimal for dissociating the FPNs. The identified cognitive tasks are not those predicted by meta-analysis, highlighting a different mapping between cognitive tasks and frontoparietal networks than expected. The optimization approach converged on a similar neural dissociation independently for the two different tasks, suggesting a possible common underlying functional mechanism and the need for neurally-derived cognitive taxonomies.</description>

	<description>Reproducibility is one of the key defining features of science and plays a central role in knowledge accumulation. In the field of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI), concerns regarding the reproducibility of findings have been raised. In response, we comprehensively assessed the reproducibility of widely used R-fMRI metrics and systematically investigated the impact of different strategies correcting for multiple comparisons and for small sample sizes. We found that multiple comparison correction strategies with liberal thresholds yield higher reproducibility but can dramatically increase the family wise error rate (FWER) to unacceptable levels. We noted permutation test with Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE), a strict multiple comparison correction strategy, reached the best balance between FWER (under 5%) and reproducibility (e.g., 0.68 for within-subject reproducibility of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations). Although the sex differences in R-fMRI metrics can be moderately reproduced from a scan to another scan within subjects, they are poorly reproduced in another different dataset (between-subject reproducibility &amp;lt; 0.3). Among the brain regions showing the most reproducible sex differences, posterior cingulate cortex demonstrated consistent lower spontaneous activity in males than in females. Defining the most reproducible brain regions in two large sample datasets as &quot;gold standard&quot;, we found that small sample size not only minimized power (sensitivity &amp;lt; 5%), but also decreased the likelihood that significant results reflect true effects. For the liberal multiple comparison correction, results were unlikely to reflect true effects (positive predictive value = 10%). Fortunately, voxels determined to be significant using permutation test with TFCE have a 71% probability of reflecting true effects. Our findings have implications for how to select multiple comparison correction strategies and highlight the need for sufficiently large sample sizes in future R-fMRI studies.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Spiking Resonances In Models With The Same Slow Resonant And Fast Amplifying Currents But Different Subthreshold Dynamic Properties</title>

	<description>The generation of spiking resonances in neurons (preferred spiking responses to oscillatory inputs) requires the interplay of the intrinsic ionic currents that operate at the subthreshold voltage regime and the spiking mechanism. Combinations of the same types of ionic currents in different parameter regimes may give rise to different types of nonlinearities in the voltage equation (e.g., parabolic- and cubic-like), generating subthreshold oscillations patterns with different properties. We investigate the spiking resonant properties of conductance-based models that are biophysically equivalent at the subthreshold level (same ionic currents), but functionally different (parabolic- and cubic-like). As a case study we consider a model having a persistent sodium current and a hyperpolarization-activated (h-) current. We unfold the concept of spiking resonance into evoked and output spiking resonance. The former focuses on the input frequencies that are able to generate spikes, while the latter focuses on the output spiking frequencies regardless of the input frequency that generated these spikes. A cell can exhibit one or both types of resonance. We also measure spiking phasonance, which is an extension of subthreshold phasonance to the spiking regime. The subthreshold resonant properties of both types of models are communicated to the spiking regime for low enough input amplitudes as the voltage response for the subthreshold resonant frequency band raises above threshold. For higher input amplitudes evoked spiking resonance is no longer present, but output spiking resonance is present primarily in the parabolic-like model, while the cubic-like model shows a better 1:1 entrainment. We use dynamical systems tools to explain the underlying mechanisms and the mechanistic differences between the resonance types. Our results show that the effective time scales that operate at the subthreshold regime to generate intrinsic subthreshold oscillations, mixed-mode oscillations and subthreshold resonance do not necessarily determine the existence of a preferred spiking response to oscillatory inputs in the same frequency band. The results discussed in this paper highlight both the complexity of the suprathreshold responses to oscillatory inputs in neurons having resonant and amplifying currents with different time scales and the fact that the identity of the participating ionic currents is not enough to predict the resulting patterns, but additional dynamic information, captured by the geometric properties of the phase-space diagram, is needed.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Non-monotonic spatial structure of interneuronal correlations in prefrontal microcircuits</title>

	<description>Correlated fluctuations of single neuron discharges, on a mesoscopic scale, decrease as a function of lateral distance in early sensory cortices, reflecting a rapid spatial decay of lateral connection probability and excitation. However, spatial periodicities in horizontal connectivity and associational input as well as an enhanced probability of lateral excitatory connections in the association cortex could theoretically result in nonmonotonic correlation structures. Here we show such a spatially non-monotonic correlation structure, characterized by significantly positive long-range correlations, in the inferior convexity of the macaque prefrontal cortex. This functional connectivity kernel was more pronounced during wakefulness than anesthesia and could be largely attributed to the spatial pattern of correlated variability between functionally similar neurons during structured visual stimulation. These results suggest that the spatial decay of lateral functional connectivity is not a common organizational principle of neocortical microcircuits. A non-monotonic correlation structure could reflect a critical topological feature of prefrontal microcircuits, facilitating their role in integrative processes.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: White matter alterations at pubertal onset</title>

	<description>Recent neurodevelopmental research supports the contribution of pubertal stage to local and global grey and white matter remodelling. Little is known, however, about white matter microstructural alterations at pubertal onset. This study investigated differences in white matter properties between pre-pubertal and pubertal children using whole brain fixel-based analysis (FBA) of the microscopic density and macroscopic cross-section of fibre bundles. Diffusion-weighted imaging data were acquired for 74 typically developing children (M=10.4, SD=0.43 years, 31 female) at 3.0T (60 diffusion gradient directions, b-value=2800 s/mm2). Group comparisons of fibre density (FD) and fibre cross-section (FC) were made between age-matched pre-pubertal and pubertal groups, and post-hoc analyses were performed on regions of interest (ROIs) defined in the splenium, body and genu of the corpus callosum. Significant fixel-wise differences in FD were observed between the pubertal groups, where the pubertal group had significantly higher FD compared with age-matched pre-pubertal children, localised to the posterior corpus callosum. Post-hoc analyses on mean FD in the corpus callosum ROIs revealed group differences between the pubertal groups in the splenium, but not body or genu. The observed higher apparent fibre density in the splenium suggests that pubertal onset coincides with white matter differences explained by increasing axon diameter. This may be an important effect to account for over pubertal development, particularly for group studies where age-matched clinical and typical populations may be at various stages of puberty.</description>

Sensory neurons give highly variable responses to stimulation, which can limit the amount of stimulus information available to downstream circuits. Much work has investigated the factors that affect the amount of information encoded in these population responses, leading to insights about the role of covariability among neurons, tuning curve shape, etc. However, the informativeness of neural responses is not the only relevant feature of population codes; of potentially equal importance is how robustly that information propagates to downstream structures. For instance, to quantify the retina’s performance, one must consider not only the informativeness of the optic nerve responses, but also the amount of information that survives the spike-generating nonlinearity and noise corruption in the next stage of processing, the lateral geniculate nucleus. Our study identifies the set of covariance structures for the upstream cells that optimize the ability of information to propagate through noisy, nonlinear circuits. Within this optimal family are covariances with “differential correlations”, which are known to reduce the information encoded in neural population activities. Thus, covariance structures that maximize information in neural population codes, and those that maximize the ability of this information to propagate, can be very different. Moreover, redundancy is neither necessary nor sufficient to make population codes robust against corruption by noise: redundant codes can be very fragile, and synergistic codes can—in some cases—optimize robustness against noise.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-OtN3PGmSPM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Energy metabolism is central to cellular biology. Thus, genome-scale models of heterotrophic unicellular species must account appropriately for the utilization of external nutrients to synthesize energy metabolites such as ATP. However, metabolic models designed for flux-balance analysis (FBA) may contain thermodynamically impossible energy-generating cycles: without nutrient consumption, these models are still capable of charging energy metabolites (such as ADP→ATP or NADP+→NADPH). Here, we show that energy-generating cycles occur in over 85% of metabolic models without extensive manual curation, such as those contained in the ModelSEED and MetaNetX databases; in contrast, such cycles are rare in the manually curated models of the BiGG database. Energy generating cycles may represent model errors, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;., erroneous assumptions on reaction reversibilities. Alternatively, part of the cycle may be thermodynamically feasible in one environment, while the remainder is thermodynamically feasible in another environment; as standard FBA does not account for thermodynamics, combining these into an FBA model allows erroneous energy generation. The presence of energy-generating cycles typically inflates maximal biomass production rates by 25%, and may lead to biases in evolutionary simulations. We present efficient computational methods (i) to identify energy generating cycles, using FBA, and (ii) to identify minimal sets of model changes that eliminate them, using a variant of the GlobalFit algorithm.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SEq20qtdmn4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This chapter revisits the concept of excitability, a basic system property of
neurons. The focus is on excitable systems regarded as behaviors rather than
dynamical systems. By this we mean open systems modulated by specific
interconnection properties rather than closed systems classified by their
parameter ranges. Modeling, analysis, and synthesis questions can be formulated
in the classical language of circuit theory. The input-output characterization
of excitability is in terms of the local sensitivity of the current-voltage
relationship. It suggests the formulation of novel questions for non-linear
system theory, inspired by questions from experimental neurophysiology.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Layperson Introduction to the Quantum Approach to Humor. (arXiv:1704.04818v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04818</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04818</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite our familiarity with and fondness of humor, until relatively recently
very little was known about the underlying psychology of this complex and
nuanced phenomenon. Recently, however, cognitive psychologists have begun
investigating how people understand humor and why we find certain things funny.
This chapter introduces a new cognitive approach to modeling humor that we
refer to as the 'quantum approach', which will be explained here in intuitive,
non-mathematical terms later (a formal treatment can be found in Gabora &amp;amp;
Kitto, 2017). What makes the quantum approach a promising candidate for a
theory of humor is that it can be useful for representing states of ambiguity,
and it defines states and variables with reference to a context. Contextuality
and ambiguity both play a key role in humor, which often hangs on an ambiguous
word, phrase, or situation that might not make sense, or even be socially
acceptable outside the specific context of the joke. The quantum approach does
not attempt to explain all aspects of humor, such as the contagious quality of
laughter, or why children tease each other, or why people might find it funny
when someone is hit in the face with a pie (and laugh even if they know it will
happen in advance); what it aims to do is to mathematically represent the
underlying cognitive process of &quot;getting&quot; a joke. After briefly overviewing the
relevant historical antecedents of the quantum approach and other related

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics is an emerging field of neuroscience where neurons are
genetically modified to express light-sensitive receptors that enable external
control over when the neurons fire. Given the prominence of neuronal signaling
within the brain and throughout the body, optogenetics has significant
potential to improve the understanding of the nervous system and to develop
treatments for neurological diseases. This paper uses a simple optogenetic
model to compare the timing distortion between a randomly-generated target
spike sequence and an externally-stimulated neuron spike sequence. The
distortion is measured by filtering each sequence and finding the mean square
error between the two filter outputs. The expected distortion is derived in
closed form when the target sequence generation rate is sufficiently low.
Derivations are verified via simulations.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Efficient complex systems have a modular structure, but modularity does not
guarantee robustness, because efficiency also requires an ingenious interplay
of the interacting modular components. The human brain is the elemental
paradigm of an efficient robust modular system interconnected as a network of
networks (NoN). Understanding the emergence of robustness in such modular
architectures from the interconnections of its parts is a long-standing
challenge that has concerned many scientists. Current models of dependencies in
NoN inspired by the power grid express interactions among modules with fragile
couplings that amplify even small shocks, thus preventing functionality.
Therefore, we introduce a model of NoN to shape the pattern of brain
activations to form a modular environment that is robust. The model predicts
the map of neural collective influencers (NCIs) in the brain, through the
optimization of the influence of the minimal set of essential nodes responsible
for broadcasting information to the whole-brain NoN. Our results suggest new
intervention protocols to control brain activity by targeting influential
neural nodes predicted by network theory.

	<description>Pharmacoresistant seizures and cytotoxic cerebral edema are serious complications of ischemic and traumatic brain injury. Intraneuronal Cl− concentration ([Cl−]i) regulation impacts on both cell volume homeostasis and Cl−-permeable GABAA receptor-dependent membrane excitability. Understanding the pleiotropic molecular determinants of neuronal [Cl−]i − cytoplasmic impermeant anions, polyanionic extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins, and plasmalemmal Cl− transporters − could help the identification of novel anticonvulsive and neuroprotective targets.</description>

The role of sleep in cerebellar processing, however, constitutes an enigma in the field of neuroscience; we know little about cerebellar sleep-physiology, cerebro–cerebellar interactions during sleep, or the contributions of sleep to cerebellum-dependent memory consolidation. Likewise, we do not understand why cerebellar malfunction can lead to changes in the sleep–wake cycle and sleep disorders.</description>

	<description>The relative electrical conductivity gradient with depth was estimated in the frontal cortex of anaesthetized rats. Current source density (CSD) approximations of field potentials evoked by ventromedial thalamic stimulations with an assumed homogeneous electrical conductivity of the neocortical tissue were compared to those with correction for the estimated conductivity gradient. In spite of the cellular heterogeneity the electrical conductivity of the frontal cortical tissue was found to be fairly homogeneous inside the superficial (layers I through IV) or deep layers (V-VI). The relative conductivity increased twofold at the transition between superficial and deep layers. Regardless of this changes CSD analysis of the field potentials evoked by ventromedial thalamic stimulation revealed negligible differences between estimations ignoring the conductivity and those taking the conductivity into account. No sinks or sources appeared or disappeared. Both CSD approximations revealed: 1) a strong sink in layer I representing most likely summed monosynaptic EPSPs of the ventromedial thalamic afferents; 2) a strong sink in layer VI, probably representing summed disynaptic EPSPs on dendrites of layer VI pyramidal cells, generated by axons of upper layer pyramidal cells; and 3) a sink in lower layer V representing probably threesynaptic summed EPSPs on dendrites of layer V pyramidal cells.</description>

	<description>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects approximately 1:68 individuals and has incalculable burdens on affected individuals, their families, and health care systems. While the genetic contributions to idiopathic ASD are heterogeneous and largely unknown, the causal mutations for syndromic forms of ASD - including truncations and copy number variants - provide a genetic toehold with which to gain mechanistic insights1-3. Models of these syndromic disorders have been used to better characterize the molecular and physiological processes disrupted by these mutations4. Two fundamental questions remain - how biologically similar are the mouse models of syndromic forms of ASD, and how relevant are these mouse models to their human analogs? To address these questions, we performed integrative transcriptomic analyses of seven independent mouse models of three syndromic forms of ASD generated across five laboratories, and assessed dysregulated genes and their pathways in human postmortem brain from patients with ASD and unaffected controls. These cross-species analyses converged on shared disruptions in myelination and axon development across both syndromic and idiopathic ASD, highlighting both the face validity of mouse models for these disorders and identifying novel convergent molecular phenotypes amendable to rescue with therapeutics.</description>

	<description>Using gene chip methodology, we identified candidate genes differentially expressed by vasomotor and non-vasomotor sympathetic neurons in the superior cervical ganglion. Groups of 10 neurons were manually sorted after isolation from a transgenic neuropeptide Y (NPY) reporter mouse that expresses the humanized Renilla green fluorescent protein (GFP) under control of Npy promoter sequences. Anatomical analysis of GFP and NPY co-expression showed that 98% of GFP-positive neurons and 16% of GFP-negative neurons express NPY. The probability of contamination in sorted cell samples was therefore high. To minimize this problem, we screened amplified cDNA samples by the quantitative polymerase chain reaction. This approach identified 101 candidate genes preferentially expressed by GFP-positive neurons and 74 candidate genes preferentially expressed by GFP-negative neurons.</description>

Discriminating the causative disease variant(s) for individuals with inherited or &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; mutations presents one of the main challenges faced by the clinical genetics community today. Computational approaches for variant prioritization include machine learning methods utilizing a large number of features, including molecular information, interaction networks, or phenotypes. Here, we demonstrate the PhenomeNET Variant Predictor (PVP) system that exploits semantic technologies and automated reasoning over genotype-phenotype relations to filter and prioritize variants in whole exome and whole genome sequencing datasets. We demonstrate the performance of PVP in identifying causative variants on a large number of synthetic whole exome and whole genome sequences, covering a wide range of diseases and syndromes. In a retrospective study, we further illustrate the application of PVP for the interpretation of whole exome sequencing data in patients suffering from congenital hypothyroidism. We find that PVP accurately identifies causative variants in whole exome and whole genome sequencing datasets and provides a powerful resource for the discovery of causal variants.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tDgNhG1ME4I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Deeper exploration of the brain’s vast synaptic networks will require new tools for high-throughput structural and molecular profiling of the diverse populations of synapses that compose those networks. Fluorescence microscopy (FM) and electron microscopy (EM) offer complementary advantages and disadvantages for single-synapse analysis. FM combines exquisite molecular discrimination capacities with high speed and low cost, but rigorous discrimination between synaptic and non-synaptic fluorescence signals is challenging. In contrast, EM remains the gold standard for reliable identification of a synapse, but offers only limited molecular discrimination and is slow and costly. To develop and test single-synapse image analysis methods, we have used datasets from conjugate array tomography (cAT), which provides voxel-conjugate FM and EM (annotated) images of the same individual synapses. We report a novel unsupervised probabilistic method for detection of synapses from multiplex FM (muxFM) image data, and evaluate this method both by comparison to EM gold standard annotated data and by examining its capacity to reproduce known important features of cortical synapse distributions. The proposed probabilistic model-based synapse detector accepts molecular-morphological synapse models as user queries, and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel represents part of a synapse. Taking human annotation of cAT EM data as ground truth, we show that our algorithm detects synapses from muxFM data alone as successfully as human annotators seeing only the muxFM data, and accurately reproduces known architectural features of cortical synapse distributions. This approach opens the door to data-driven discovery of new synapse types and their density. We suggest that our probabilistic synapse detector will also be useful for analysis of standard confocal and super-resolution FM images, where EM cross-validation is not practical.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aRCvW-nYvK8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Dipjyoti Das, Supravat Dey, Robert C. Brewster, Sandeep Choubey&lt;/p&gt;

Gene expression is intrinsically a stochastic (noisy) process with important implications for cellular functions. Deciphering the underlying mechanisms of gene expression noise remains one of the key challenges of regulatory biology. Theoretical models of transcription often incorporate the kinetics of how transcription factors (TFs) interact with a single promoter to impact gene expression noise. However, inside single cells multiple identical gene copies as well as additional binding sites can compete for a limiting pool of TFs. Here we develop a simple kinetic model of transcription, which explicitly incorporates this interplay between TF copy number and its binding sites. We show that TF sharing enhances noise in mRNA distribution across an isogenic population of cells. Moreover, when a single gene copy shares it’s TFs with multiple competitor sites, the mRNA variance as a function of the mean remains unaltered by their presence. Hence, all the data for variance as a function of mean expression collapse onto a single master curve independent of the strength and number of competitor sites. However, this result does not hold true when the competition stems from multiple copies of the same gene. Therefore, although previous studies showed that the mean expression follows a universal master curve, our findings suggest that different scenarios of competition bear distinct signatures at the level of variance. Intriguingly, the introduction of competitor sites can transform a unimodal mRNA distribution into a multimodal distribution. These results demonstrate the impact of limited availability of TF resource on the regulation of noise in gene expression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TIEMlk0J4j0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Serena Bradde, Marija Vucelja, Tiberiu Teşileanu, Vijay Balasubramanian&lt;/p&gt;

The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) mechanism allows bacteria to adaptively defend against phages by acquiring short genomic sequences (spacers) that target specific sequences in the viral genome. We propose a population dynamical model where immunity can be both acquired and lost. The model predicts regimes where bacterial and phage populations can co-exist, others where the populations exhibit damped oscillations, and still others where one population is driven to extinction. Our model considers two key parameters: (1) ease of acquisition and (2) spacer effectiveness in conferring immunity. Analytical calculations and numerical simulations show that if spacers differ mainly in ease of acquisition, or if the probability of acquiring them is sufficiently high, bacteria develop a diverse population of spacers. On the other hand, if spacers differ mainly in their effectiveness, their final distribution will be highly peaked, akin to a “winner-take-all” scenario, leading to a specialized spacer distribution. Bacteria can interpolate between these limiting behaviors by actively tuning their overall acquisition probability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Rk5kitjCtOo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yonatan Savir, Alexander Martynov, Michael Springer&lt;/p&gt;

Nutrient homeostasis—the maintenance of relatively constant internal nutrient concentrations in fluctuating external environments—is essential to the survival of most organisms. Transcriptional regulation of plasma membrane transporters by internal nutrient concentrations is typically assumed to be the main mechanism by which homeostasis is achieved. While this mechanism is homeostatic we show that it does not achieve global perfect homeostasis—a condition where internal nutrient concentrations are completely independent of external nutrient concentrations for all external nutrient concentrations. We show that the criterion for global perfect homeostasis is that transporter levels must be inversely proportional to net nutrient flux into the cell and that downregulation of active transporters (activity-dependent regulation) is a simple and biologically plausible mechanism that meets this criterion. Activity-dependent transporter regulation creates a trade-off between robustness and efficiency, i.e., the system's ability to withstand perturbation in external nutrients and the transporter production rate needed to maintain homeostasis. Additionally, we show that a system that utilizes both activity-dependent transporter downregulation and regulation of transporter synthesis by internal nutrient levels can create a system that mitigates the shortcomings of each of the individual mechanisms. This analysis highlights the utility of activity-dependent regulation in achieving homeostasis and calls for a re-examination of the mechanisms of regulation of other homeostatic systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-bFXMDNyVUw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Experimental data suggest that neural circuits configure their synaptic
connectivity for a given computational task. They also point to dopamine-gated
stochastic spine dynamics as an important underlying mechanism, and they show
that the stochastic component of synaptic plasticity is surprisingly strong. We
propose a model that elucidates how task-dependent self-configuration of neural
circuits can emerge through these mechanisms. The Fokker-Planck equation allows
us to relate local stochastic processes at synapses to the stationary
distribution of network configurations, and thereby to computational properties
of the network. This framework suggests a new model for reward-gated network
plasticity, where one replaces the common policy gradient paradigm by
continuously ongoing stochastic policy search (sampling) from a posterior
distribution of network configurations. This posterior integrates priors that
encode for example previously attained knowledge and structural constraints.
This model can explain the experimentally found capability of neural circuits
to configure themselves for a given task, and to compensate automatically for
changes in the network or task. We also show that experimental data on
dopamine-modulated spine dynamics can be modeled within this theoretical
framework, and that a strong stochastic component of synaptic plasticity is
essential for its performance.

	<description>Bulimia nervosa (BN) is a serious psychiatric illness defined by preoccupation with weight and shape, episodic binge-eating and compensatory behaviors. Although diagnosed BN has been associated with diffuse grey matter volume reductions, characterization of brain structure alterations in women with a range of BN symptoms has yet to be made. This study examined whether changes in cortical thickness (CT) scaled with BN symptom severity in a sample of 33 adult women (n = 10 BN; n = 5 EDNOS-BN). Our second objective was to assess global structural connectivity (SC) of CT and to determine if individual differences in global SC relate to BN symptom severity. We used the validated Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q; Fairburn &amp;amp; Beglin, 1994) as a continuous measure of BN symptom severity. Increased EDE-Q score was negatively related to global CT and local CT in the left middle frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus and bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and temporoparietal regions. Moreover, analysis of global SC indicated that BN-related cortical thinning preferentially occurred in regions with high global connectivity. Finally, we showed that individuals' contribution to global SC at the group level were significantly related to EDE-Q score, where increased EDE-Q score correlated with reduced connectivity of the left OFC and middle temporal cortex and increased connectivity of the right superior parietal lobule. Our findings offer novel insight into CT alterations in BN and further suggest that the combination of CT and structural connectivity measures may be sensitive to individual differences in BN symptom severity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Experience-dependent plasticity in accessory olfactory bulb interneurons following male-male social interaction</title>

	<description>Chemosensory information processing in the mouse accessory olfactory system (AOS) guides the expression of social behavior. After salient chemosensory encounters, the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) experiences changes in the balance of excitation and inhibition at reciprocal synapses between mitral cells (MCs) and local interneurons. The mechanisms underlying these changes remain controversial. Moreover, it remains unclear whether MC-interneuron plasticity is unique to specific behaviors, such as mating, or whether it is a more general feature of the AOB circuit. Here, we describe targeted electrophysiological studies of AOB inhibitory internal granule cells (IGCs), many of which upregulate the immediate-early gene Arc after male-male social experience. Following the resident-intruder paradigm, Arc-expressing IGCs in acute AOB slices from resident males displayed stronger excitation than non-expressing neighbors when sensory inputs are stimulated. The increased excitability of Arc-expressing IGCs was not correlated with changes in the strength or number of excitatory synapses with MCs, but is instead associated with increased intrinsic excitability and decreased HCN channel-mediated IH currents. Consistent with increased inhibition by IGCs, MCs responded to sensory input stimulation with decreased depolarization and spiking following resident-intruder encounters. These results reveal that non-mating behaviors drive AOB inhibitory plasticity, and indicate that increased MC inhibition involves intrinsic excitability changes in Arc-expressing interneurons.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Cell-Type Specific Burst Firing Interacts With Theta And Beta Activity In Prefrontal Cortex During Attention States</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/127811v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/127811v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Population-level theta and beta band activity in anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex (ACC/PFC) are prominent signatures of endogenously controlled, adaptive behaviors. But how these rhythmic activities are linked to cell-type specific activity has remained unclear. Here, we suggest such a cell-to-systems level linkage. We found that the rate of burst spiking events is enhanced particularly during attention states and that attention-specific burst spikes have a unique temporal relationship to local theta and beta band population level activities. For the 5-10Hz theta frequency range, bursts coincided with transient increases of local theta power relative to non-bursts, particularly for bursts of putative interneurons. For the 16-30Hz beta frequency, bursts of putative interneurons phase synchronized stronger than nonbursts, and were associated with larger beta power modulation. In contrast, burst of putative pyramidal cells were overall similarly beta-synchronized than nonbursts, but were linked with stronger beta power only when they occurred early in the beta cycle. These findings suggests that in the ACC/PFC during attention states, mechanisms underlying burst firing are intimately linked to narrow band population level activities, providing a cell-type specific window into the emergence, resetting, or termination of oscillatory activities.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Global Exosome Transcriptome Profiling Reveals Biomarkers for Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24931</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24931</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Accumulating evidence supports a role for exosomes in immune regulation. In this study, we investigated the total circulating exosome transcriptome in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients (RRMS) and healthy controls (HC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to define the global RNA profile of serum exosomes in 19 RRMS patients (9 in relapse, 10 in remission) and 10 HC. We analyzed 5 million reads and over 50,000 transcripts per sample, including a detailed analysis of microRNA (miRNA) differentially expressed in RRMS. The discovery set data were validated by quantification using digital quantitative PCR with an independent cohort of 63 RRMS patients (33 in relapse, 30 in remission) and 32 HC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Exosomal RNA NGS revealed that of 15 different classes of transcripts detected 4 circulating exosomal sequences within the miRNA category were differentially expressed in RRMS patients vs HC: hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-196b-5p, hsa-miR-301a-3p and hsa-miR-532-5p. Serum exosomal expression of these miRNA was significantly decreased during relapse in RRMS. These miRNA were also decreased in patients with a gadolinium enhancement on brain magnetic resonance imaging. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; secretion of these miRNA by peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also significantly impaired in RRMS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: These data show that circulating exosomes have a distinct RNA profile in RRMS. Since putative targets for these miRNA include the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and the cell cycle regulator aryl hydrocarbon receptor the data suggest a disturbed cell-to-cell communication in this disease. Thus exosomal miRNA might represent a useful biomarker to distinguish MS relapse. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Surgically disconnected temporal pole exhibits resting functional connectivity with remote brain regions</title>

	<description>Functional connectivity, as measured by resting-state fMRI, has proven a powerful method for studying brain systems in the context of behavior, development, and disease states. However, the relationship of functional connectivity to structural connectivity remains unclear. If functional connectivity relies on structural connectivity, then anatomical isolation of a brain region should eliminate functional connectivity with other brain regions. We tested this by measuring functional connectivity of the surgically disconnected temporal pole in resection patients (N=5; mean age 37; 2F, 3M). Functional connectivity was evaluated based on coactivation of whole-brain fMRI data with the average low-frequency BOLD signal from disconnected tissue in each patient. In sharp contrast to our prediction, we observed significant functional connectivity between the disconnected temporal pole and remote brain regions in each disconnection case. These findings raise important questions about the neural bases of functional connectivity measures derived from the fMRI BOLD signal.</description>

	<description>Since its introduction, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), or neural decoding, has transformed the field of cognitive neuroscience. Underlying its influence is a crucial inference, which we call the Decoder's Dictum: if information can be decoded from patterns of neural activity, then this provides strong evidence about what information those patterns represent. Although the Dictum is a widely held and well-motivated principle in decoding research, it has received scant philosophical attention. We critically evaluate the Dictum, arguing that it is false: decodability is a poor guide for revealing the content of neural representations. However, we also suggest how the Dictum can be improved on, in order to better justify inferences about neural representation using MVPA.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Aversive Learning Changes Face-Viewing Strategies, as Revealed by Model-Based Fixation-Pattern Similarity Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/125682v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>To avoid costly situations animals must be able to rapidly predict imminent threat based on past experience and present noisy sensory evidence. We aimed to characterize to what extent active exploration strategies, can be adaptively tuned to achieve this goal. We measured how eye-movement patterns on 8 faces, organized along a circular similarity continuum, were modified after aversive learning and generalization. Using model-based Fixation Similarity Analysis, we characterized how similarity relationships between exploration strategies were modified after volunteers learnt to pair one face (CS+) with a mild electric shock. Initially, viewing patterns reflected the circular physical similarity structure of different faces, indicating that eye-movements were guided by subtle differences between faces. Following aversive learning, the similarity structure of exploration patterns became elliptical and stretched along the adversity gradient defined by the CS+ and the most dissimilar neutral face (CS-), indicating that exploration patterns on these faces were most dissimilar. These findings suggest that the need to predict adversity introduces substantial remodelling of exploration patterns and influences entire sensorimotor loops by selecting fixation locations that can help in categorizing stimuli as aversive or safe.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Simple biochemical networks allow accurate sensing of multiple ligands with a single receptor</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Vijay Singh, Ilya Nemenman&lt;/p&gt;

Cells use surface receptors to estimate concentrations of external ligands. Limits on the accuracy of such estimations have been well studied for pairs of ligand and receptor species. However, the environment typically contains many ligands, which can bind to the same receptors with different affinities, resulting in cross-talk. In traditional rate models, such cross-talk prevents accurate inference of concentrations of individual ligands. In contrast, here we show that knowing the precise timing sequence of stochastic binding and unbinding events allows one receptor to provide information about multiple ligands simultaneously and with a high accuracy. We show that such high-accuracy estimation of multiple concentrations can be realized with simple structural modifications of the familiar kinetic proofreading biochemical network diagram. We give two specific examples of such modifications. We argue that structural and functional features of real cellular biochemical sensory networks in immune cells, such as feedforward and feedback loops or ligand antagonism, sometimes can be understood as solutions to the accurate multi-ligand estimation problem.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ubt69dgmPdA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Highly accessible AU-rich regions in 3’ untranslated regions are hotspots for binding of regulatory factors</title>

Post-transcriptional regulation is regarded as one of the major processes involved in the regulation of gene expression. It is mainly performed by RNA binding proteins and microRNAs, which target RNAs and typically affect their stability. Recent efforts from the scientific community have aimed at understanding post-transcriptional regulation at a global scale by using high-throughput sequencing techniques such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP), which facilitates identification of binding sites of these regulatory factors. However, the diversity in the experimental procedures and bioinformatics analyses has hindered the integration of multiple datasets and thus limited the development of an integrated view of post-transcriptional regulation. In this work, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of 107 CLIP datasets from 49 different RBPs in HEK293 cells to shed light on the complex interactions that govern post-transcriptional regulation. By developing a more stringent CLIP analysis pipeline we have discovered the existence of conserved regulatory AU-rich regions in the 3’UTRs where miRNAs and RBPs that regulate several processes such as polyadenylation or mRNA stability bind. Analogous to promoters, many factors have binding sites overlapping or in close proximity in these hotspots and hence the regulation of the mRNA may depend on their relative concentrations. This hypothesis is supported by RBP knockdown experiments that alter the relative concentration of RBPs in the cell. Upon AGO2 knockdown (KD), transcripts containing “free” target sites show increased expression levels compared to those containing target sites in hotspots, which suggests that target sites within hotspots are less available for miRNAs to bind. Interestingly, these hotspots appear enriched in genes with regulatory functions such as DNA binding and RNA binding. Taken together, our results suggest that hotspots are functional regulatory elements that define an extra layer of regulation of post-transcriptional regulatory networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Eu7ni9y2PKY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Heterogeneous firing responses predict diverse couplings to presynaptic activity in mice layer V pyramidal neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yann Zerlaut, Alain Destexhe&lt;/p&gt;

In this study, we present a theoretical framework combining experimental characterizations and analytical calculus to capture the firing rate input-output properties of single neurons in the fluctuation-driven regime. Our framework consists of a two-step procedure to treat independently how the dendritic input translates into somatic fluctuation variables, and how the latter determine action potential firing. We use this framework to investigate the functional impact of the heterogeneity in firing responses found experimentally in young mice layer V pyramidal cells. We first design and calibrate &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; a simplified morphological model of layer V pyramidal neurons with a dendritic tree following Rall's branching rule. Then, we propose an analytical derivation for the membrane potential fluctuations at the soma as a function of the properties of the synaptic input in dendrites. This mathematical description allows us to easily emulate various forms of synaptic input: either balanced, unbalanced, synchronized, purely proximal or purely distal synaptic activity. We find that those different forms of input activity lead to various impact on the membrane potential fluctuations properties, thus raising the possibility that individual neurons will differentially couple to specific forms of activity as a result of their different firing response. We indeed found such a heterogeneous coupling between synaptic input and firing response for all types of presynaptic activity. This heterogeneity can be explained by different levels of cellular excitability in the case of the balanced, unbalanced, synchronized and purely distal activity. A notable exception appears for proximal dendritic inputs: increasing the input level can either promote firing response in some cells, or suppress it in some other cells whatever their individual excitability. This behavior can be explained by different sensitivities to the speed of the fluctuations, which was previously associated to different levels of sodium channel inactivation and density. Because local network connectivity rather targets proximal dendrites, our results suggest that this aspect of biophysical heterogeneity might be relevant to neocortical processing by controlling how individual neurons couple to local network activity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6jte2cL8TGI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Evolution and Analysis of Embodied Spiking Neural Networks Reveals Task-Specific Clusters of Effective Networks. (arXiv:1704.04199v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Elucidating principles that underlie computation in neural networks is
currently a major research topic of interest in neuroscience. Transfer Entropy
(TE) is increasingly used as a tool to bridge the gap between network
structure, function, and behavior in fMRI studies. Computational models allow
us to bridge the gap even further by directly associating individual neuron
activity with behavior. However, most computational models that have analyzed
embodied behaviors have employed non-spiking neurons. On the other hand,
computational models that employ spiking neural networks tend to be restricted
to disembodied tasks. We show for the first time the artificial evolution and
TE-analysis of embodied spiking neural networks to perform a
cognitively-interesting behavior. Specifically, we evolved an agent controlled
by an Izhikevich neural network to perform a visual categorization task. The
smallest networks capable of performing the task were found by repeating
evolutionary runs with different network sizes. Informational analysis of the
best solution revealed task-specific TE-network clusters, suggesting that
within-task homogeneity and across-task heterogeneity were key to behavioral
success. Moreover, analysis of the ensemble of solutions revealed that
task-specificity of TE-network clusters correlated with fitness. This provides
an empirically testable hypothesis that links network structure to behavior.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Analysis of pacemaker activity in a two-component model of some brainstem neurons. (arXiv:1704.03941v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03941</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Serotonergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic brainstem (including midbrain)
neurons, often exhibit spontaneous and fairly regular spiking with frequencies
of order a few Hz, though dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons only exhibit
such pacemaker-type activity in vitro or in vivo under special conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large number of ion channel types contribute to such spiking so that
detailed modeling of spike generation leads to the requirement of solving very
large systems of differential equations. It is useful to have simplified
mathematical models of spiking in such neurons so that, for example, features
of inputs and output spike trains can be incorporated including stochastic
effects for possible use in network models.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article we investigate a simple two-component conductance-based model
of the Hodgkin-Huxley type. Solutions are computed numerically and with
suitably chosen parameters mimic features of pacemaker-type spiking in the
above types of neurons. The effects of varying parameters is investigated in
detail, it being found that there is extreme sensitivity to eight of them.
Transitions from non-spiking to spiking are examined for two of these, the
half-activation potential for an activation variable and the added
(depolarizing) current and contrasted with the behavior of the classical
Hodgkin-Huxley system. The plateaux levels between spikes can be adjusted, by
changing a set of voltage parameters, to agree with experimental observations.
Experiment has shown that in, in vivo, dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons'
pacemaker activity can be induced by the removal of excitatory inputs or the
introduction of inhibitory ones. These properties are confirmed by mimicking
opposite such changes in the model, which resulted in a change from pacemaker
activity to bursting-type phenomena.

	<description>The explore-exploit dilemma occurs anytime we must choose between exploring unknown options for information and exploiting known resources for reward. Previous work suggests that people use two different strategies to solve the explore-exploit dilemma: directed exploration, driven by information seeking, and random exploration, driven by decision noise. Here, we show that these two strategies rely on different neural systems. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation to inhibit the right frontopolar cortex, we were able to selectively inhibit directed exploration while leaving random exploration intact. This suggests a causal role for right frontopolar cortex in directed, but not random, exploration and that directed and random exploration rely on (at least partially) dissociable neural systems.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Inferring modulators of genetic interactions with epistatic nested effects models</title>

Maps of genetic interactions can dissect functional redundancies in cellular networks. Gene expression profiles as high-dimensional molecular readouts of combinatorial perturbations provide a detailed view of genetic interactions, but can be hard to interpret if different gene sets respond in different ways (called &lt;i&gt;mixed epistasis&lt;/i&gt;). Here we test the hypothesis that mixed epistasis between a gene pair can be explained by the action of a third gene that modulates the interaction. We have extended the framework of Nested Effects Models (NEMs), a type of graphical model specifically tailored to analyze high-dimensional gene perturbation data, to incorporate logical functions that describe interactions between regulators on downstream genes and proteins. We benchmark our approach in the controlled setting of a simulation study and show high accuracy in inferring the correct model. In an application to data from deletion mutants of kinases and phosphatases in &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; we show that epistatic NEMs can point to modulators of genetic interactions. Our approach is implemented in the R-package ‘epiNEM’ available from https://github.com/cbg-ethz/epiNEM and https://bioconductor.org/packages/epiNEM/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dCx7jocTDw4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A high level of HER2 expression in breast cancer correlates with a higher tumor growth rate, high metastatic potential, and a poor long-term patient survival rate. Pertuzumab, a human monoclonal antibody, can reduce the effect of HER2 overexpression by preventing HER2 dimerization. In this study, a combination protocol of molecular dynamics modeling and MM/GBSA binding free energy calculations was applied to design peptides that interact with HER2 based on the HER2/pertuzumab crystal structure. Based on a β hairpin in pertuzumab from Glu46 to Lys65—which plays a key role in interacting with HER2—mutations were carried out &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; to improve the binding free energy of the hairpin that interacts with the Phe256-Lys314 of the HER2 protein. Combined the use of one-bead-one-compound library screening, among all the mutations, a peptide (58F63Y) with the lowest binding free energy was confirmed experimentally to have the highest affinity, and it may be used as a new probe in diagnosing and treating HER2-positive breast cancer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pRx0fy4iclw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Software produced for research, published and otherwise, suffers from a number of common problems that make it difficult or impossible to run outside the original institution or even off the primary developer’s computer. We present ten simple rules to make such software robust enough to be run by anyone, anywhere, and thereby delight your users and collaborators.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rwsQosb6YZY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: From elementary flux modes to elementary flux vectors: Metabolic pathway analysis with arbitrary linear flux constraints</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005409</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Steffen Klamt, Georg Regensburger, Matthias P. Gerstl, Christian Jungreuthmayer, Stefan Schuster, Radhakrishnan Mahadevan, Jürgen Zanghellini, Stefan Müller&lt;/p&gt;

Elementary flux modes (EFMs) emerged as a formal concept to describe metabolic pathways and have become an established tool for constraint-based modeling and metabolic network analysis. EFMs are characteristic (support-minimal) vectors of the flux cone that contains all feasible steady-state flux vectors of a given metabolic network. EFMs account for (homogeneous) linear constraints arising from reaction irreversibilities and the assumption of steady state; however, other (inhomogeneous) linear constraints, such as minimal and maximal reaction rates frequently used by other constraint-based techniques (such as flux balance analysis [FBA]), cannot be directly integrated. These additional constraints further restrict the space of feasible flux vectors and turn the flux cone into a general flux polyhedron in which the concept of EFMs is not directly applicable anymore. For this reason, there has been a conceptual gap between EFM-based (pathway) analysis methods and linear optimization (FBA) techniques, as they operate on different geometric objects. One approach to overcome these limitations was proposed ten years ago and is based on the concept of &lt;i&gt;elementary flux vectors&lt;/i&gt; (EFVs). Only recently has the community started to recognize the potential of EFVs for metabolic network analysis. In fact, EFVs exactly represent the conceptual development required to generalize the idea of EFMs from flux cones to flux polyhedra. This work aims to present a concise theoretical and practical introduction to EFVs that is accessible to a broad audience. We highlight the close relationship between EFMs and EFVs and demonstrate that almost all applications of EFMs (in flux cones) are possible for EFVs (in flux polyhedra) as well. In fact, certain properties can only be studied with EFVs. Thus, we conclude that EFVs provide a powerful and unifying framework for constraint-based modeling of metabolic networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gAQqy35d7wM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Random Item Generation tasks (RIG) are commonly used to assess high cognitive abilities such as inhibition or sustained attention. They also draw upon our approximate sense of complexity. A detrimental effect of aging on pseudo-random productions has been demonstrated for some tasks, but little is as yet known about the developmental curve of cognitive complexity over the lifespan. We investigate the complexity trajectory across the lifespan of human responses to five common RIG tasks, using a large sample (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3429). Our main finding is that the developmental curve of the estimated algorithmic complexity of responses is similar to what may be expected of a measure of higher cognitive abilities, with a performance peak around 25 and a decline starting around 60, suggesting that RIG tasks yield good estimates of such cognitive abilities. Our study illustrates that very short strings of, i.e., 10 items, are sufficient to have their complexity reliably estimated and to allow the documentation of an age-dependent decline in the approximate sense of complexity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jh8fhJNsGrM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: How brains are built: Principles of computational neuroscience. (arXiv:1704.03855v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03855</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03855</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;'If I cannot build it, I do not understand it.' So said Nobel laureate
Richard Feynman, and by his metric, we understand a bit about physics, less
about chemistry, and almost nothing about biology.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we fully understand a phenomenon, we can specify its entire sequence of
events, causes, and effects so completely that it is possible to fully simulate
it, with all its internal mechanisms intact. Achieving that level of
understanding is rare. It is commensurate with constructing a full design for a
machine that could serve as a stand-in for the thing being studied. To
understand a phenomenon sufficiently to fully simulate it is to understand it
computationally.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Computation' does not refer to computers per se. Rather, it refers to the
underlying principles and methods that make them work. As Turing Award
recipient Edsger Dijkstra said, computational science 'is no more about
computers than astronomy is about telescopes.' Computational science is the
study of the hidden rules underlying complex phenomena from physics to
psychology.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computational neuroscience, then, has the aim of understanding brains
sufficiently well to be able to simulate their functions, thereby subsuming the
twin goals of science and engineering: deeply understanding the inner workings
of our brains, and being able to construct simulacra of them. As simple robots
today substitute for human physical abilities, in settings from factories to
hospitals, so brain engineering will construct stand-ins for our mental
abilities, and possibly even enable us to fix our brains when they break.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans take advantage of real world symmetries for various tasks, yet
capturing their superb symmetry perception mechanism into a computational model
remains elusive. Encouraged by a new discovery (CVPR 2016) demonstrating
extremely high inter-person accuracy of human perceived symmetries in the wild,
we have created the first deep-learning neural network for reflection and
rotation symmetry detection (Sym-NET), trained on photos from MS-COCO (Common
Object in COntext) dataset with nearly 11K symmetry-labels from more than 400
human observers. We employ novel methods to convert discrete human labels into
symmetry heatmaps, capture symmetry densely in an image and quantitatively
evaluate Sym-NET against multiple existing computer vision algorithms. Using
the symmetry competition testsets from CVPR 2013 and unseen MS-COCO photos,
Sym-NET comes out as the winner with significantly superior performance over
all other competitors. Beyond mathematically well-defined symmetries on a
plane, Sym-NET demonstrates abilities to identify viewpoint-varied 3D
symmetries, partially occluded symmetrical objects and symmetries at a semantic
level.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cooperation and competition between human players in repeated microeconomic
games offer a powerful window onto social phenomena such as the establishment,
breakdown and repair of trust. This offers the prospect of particular insight
into populations of subjects suffering from socially-debilitating conditions
such as borderline personality disorder. However, although a suitable
foundation for the quantitative analysis of such games exists, namely the
Interactive Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (I-POMDP),
computational considerations have hitherto limited its application. Here, we
improve inference in I-POMDPs in a canonical trust game, and thereby highlight
and address two previously unmodelled phenomena: a form of social risk-aversion
exhibited by the player who is in control of the interaction in the game, and
irritation or anger exhibited by both players. Irritation arises when partners
apparently defect, and it causes a precipitate breakdown in cooperation.
Failing to model one's partner's propensity for it leads to substantial
economic inefficiency. We illustrate these behaviours using evidence drawn from
the play of large cohorts of healthy volunteers and patients.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Volumetric grey matter alterations in adolescents and adults born very preterm suggest accelerated brain maturation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/127365v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/127365v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Previous research investigating structural neurodevelopmental alterations in individuals who were born very preterm demonstrated a complex pattern of grey matter changes that defy straightforward summary. Here we addressed this problem by characterising volumetric brain alterations in individuals who were born very preterm from adolescence to adulthood at three hierarchically related levels - global, modular and regional. We demarcated structural components that were either particularly resilient or vulnerable to the impact of very preterm birth. We showed that individuals who were born very preterm had smaller global grey matter volume compared to controls, with subcortical and medial temporal regions being particularly affected. Conversely, frontal and lateral parieto-temporal cortices were relatively resilient to the effects of very preterm birth, possibly indicating compensatory mechanisms. Exploratory analyses supported this hypothesis by showing a stronger association of lateral parieto-temporal volume with IQ in the very preterm group compared to controls. We then related these alterations to brain maturation processes. Very preterm individuals exhibited a higher maturation index compared to controls, indicating accelerated brain ageing and this was specifically associated with younger gestational age. We discuss how the findings of accelerated maturation might be reconciled with evidence of delayed maturation at earlier stages of development.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Just above chance: is it harder to decode information from human prefrontal cortex BOLD signals?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/127324v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/127324v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Understanding the nature and form of prefrontal cortex representations that support flexible behavior is an important open problem in cognitive neuroscience. In humans, multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI BOLD measurements has emerged as an important approach for studying neural representations. An implicit, untested assumption underlying many MVPA studies is that the base rate of decoding information encoded in neuronal activity from BOLD activity patterns, is invariant across brain regions. Here we test this assumption by estimating these base rates from a meta-analysis of published MVPA studies. We show that this assumption is violated for the prefrontal cortex, which shows a significantly lower base rate for decoding than visual sensory cortex. Our results have implications for the design and interpretation of MVPA studies of prefrontal cortex, and raise important questions about its functional organization.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/127159v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Synaptic inputs to neurons are distributed across extensive neurite arborizations. To what extent arbors process inputs locally or integrate them globally is, for most neurons, unknown. This question is particularly relevant for amacrine cells, a diverse class of retinal interneurons, which receive input and provide output through the same neurites. Here, we used two-photon Ca2+ imaging to analyze visual processing in VGluT3-expressing amacrine cells (VG3-ACs), an important component of object motion sensitive circuits in the retina. VG3-AC neurites differed in their preferred stimulus contrast (ON vs. OFF); and ON and OFF responses varied in transience and preferred stimulus size. Contrast preference changed predictably with the laminar position of neurites in the inner plexiform layer. Yet, neurites at all depths were strongly activated by local but not by global image motion. Thus, VG3-AC neurites process visual information locally, exhibiting diverse responses to contrast steps, but uniform object motion selectivity.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Increased decision thresholds enhance information gathering performance in juvenile Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Tobias U. Hauser, Michael Moutoussis, Reto Iannaccone, Silvia Brem, Susanne Walitza, Renate Drechsler, Peter Dayan, Raymond J. Dolan&lt;/p&gt;

Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can be described as cautious and hesitant, manifesting an excessive indecisiveness that hinders efficient decision making. However, excess caution in decision making may also lead to better performance in specific situations where the cost of extended deliberation is small. We compared 16 juvenile OCD patients with 16 matched healthy controls whilst they performed a sequential information gathering task under different external cost conditions. We found that patients with OCD outperformed healthy controls, winning significantly more points. The groups also differed in the number of draws required prior to committing to a decision, but not in decision accuracy. A novel Bayesian computational model revealed that subjective sampling costs arose as a non-linear function of sampling, closely resembling an escalating urgency signal. Group difference in performance was best explained by a later emergence of these subjective costs in the OCD group, also evident in an increased decision threshold. Our findings present a novel computational model and suggest that enhanced information gathering in OCD can be accounted for by a higher decision threshold arising out of an altered perception of costs that, in some specific contexts, may be advantageous.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kYO-DetTaxM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Stochastic Spike Synchronization in A Small-World Neural Network with Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity. (arXiv:1704.03150v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03150</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03150</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider the Watts-Strogatz small-world network consisting of subthreshold
neurons which exhibit noise-induced spikings. This neuronal network has
adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths governed by the spike-timing-dependent
plasticity (STDP). In previous works without STDP, stochastic spike
synchronization (SSS) between noise-induced spikings of subthreshold neurons
was found to occur in a range of intermediate noise intensities through
competition between the constructive and the destructive roles of noise. Here,
we investigate the effect of additive STDP on the SSS by varying the noise
intensity. Occurrence of a &quot;Matthew&quot; effect in synaptic plasticity is found due
to a positive feedback process. As a result, good synchronization gets better
via long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strengths, while bad
synchronization gets worse via long-term depression (LTD). Emergence of LTP and
LTD of synaptic strengths are intensively investigated via microscopic studies
based on the pair-correlations between the pre- and the post-synaptic IISRs
(instantaneous individual spike rates) as well as the distributions of time
delays between the pre- and the post-synaptic spike times. Furthermore, the
effects of multiplicative STDP (which depends on the states) on the SSS are
also studied and discussed in comparison with the case of additive STDP.

fault-tolerant information processing can be achieved by neural assemblies.
Transposed to nanoelectronics, this strategy could allow computing reliably
with ultimately scaled-down, noisy, imperfect devices. This approach requires
that the response functions to inputs of the population components form a set
of basis functions, thus offering a physical substrate for calculating. For
this purpose, the nanodevice responses should be non-linear, and each tuned to
different values of the input. These strong requirements have until now
prevented a demonstration of population coding with nanodevices. Here we show
that nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions can be assembled to exhibit such
neural-like ensemble responses. We demonstrate experimentally that a population
of nine junctions can implement a basis set of functions, allowing, for
instance, the generation of cursive letters. Through simulations, we show that
systems based on interlinked populations of junctions can learn to realize low
power, variability-resilient non-linear transformations through population
coding.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The immune response of the human brain to abdominal surgery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24909</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24909</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24909-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgery launches a systemic inflammatory reaction that reaches the brain and associates with immune activation and cognitive decline. Although preclinical studies have in part described this systemic-to-brain signaling pathway, we lack information on how these changes appear in humans. This study examines the short- and long-term impact of abdominal surgery on the human brain immune system by positron emission tomography (PET) in relation to blood immune reactivity, plasma inflammatory biomarkers, and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24909-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight males undergoing prostatectomy under general anesthesia were included. Prior to surgery (baseline), at postoperative days 3 to 4, and after 3 months, patients were examined using [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 brain PET imaging to assess brain immune cell activation. Concurrently, systemic inflammatory biomarkers, ex vivo blood tests on immunoreactivity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and cognitive function were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24909-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients showed a global downregulation of gray matter [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 binding of 26 ± 26% (mean ± standard deviation) at 3 to 4 days postoperatively compared to baseline (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.023), recovering or even increasing after 3 months. LPS-induced release of the proinflammatory marker tumor necrosis factor-α in blood displayed a reduction (41 ± 39%) on the 3rd to 4th postoperative day, corresponding to changes in [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 distribution volume. Change in Stroop Color-Word Test performance between postoperative days 3 to 4 and 3 months correlated to change in [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 binding (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.027).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24909-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study translates preclinical data on changes in the brain immune system after surgery to humans, and suggests an interplay between the human brain and the inflammatory response of the peripheral innate immune system. These findings may be related to postsurgical impairments of cognitive function. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Equivalence between synaptic current dynamics and heterogeneous propagation delays in spiking neuron networks. (arXiv:1704.02780v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02780</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02780</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Message passing between components of a distributed physical system is
non-instantaneous and contributes to determine the time scales of the emerging
collective dynamics like an effective inertia. In biological neuron networks
this inertia is due in part to local synaptic filtering of exchanged spikes,
and in part to the distribution of the axonal transmission delays. How
differently these two kinds of inertia affect the network dynamics is an open
issue not yet addressed due to the difficulties in dealing with the
non-Markovian nature of synaptic transmission. Here, we develop a mean-field
dimensional reduction yielding to an effective Markovian dynamics of the
population density of the neuronal membrane potential, valid under the
hypothesis of small fluctuations of the synaptic current. The resulting theory
allows us to prove the formal equivalence between local and distributed
inertia, holding for any synaptic time scale, integrate-and-fire neuron model,
spike emission regimes and for different network states even when the neuron
number is finite.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Focused ultrasound as a novel strategy for Alzheimer's disease therapeutics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24933</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of advances in the pathology, genetics and imaging of Alzheimer's disease (AD), there remain no effective treatments that significantly alter its natural history. Several late phase clinical trials, focused largely on amyloid beta metabolism and clearance, have unfortunately demonstrated no significant benefit in early AD patients. Recent work investigating blood-brain barrier opening using focused ultrasound in transgenic animal models has shown that repeated ultrasound administration coupled with microbubble-containing contrast can reduce plaque burden and reverse memory deficits. While the mechanisms underlying plaque clearance are under investigation, this image-guided, noninvasive technique appears promising. This article describes the rationale and underlying principles of focused ultrasound as applied to Alzheimer's disease and suggests that based on promising pre-clinical results, this technology, whether alone or in conjunction with targeted therapies, can be of potential benefit.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Are midsagittal tissue bridges predictive of outcome after cervical spinal cord injury?</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;T2-weighted scans provided data on the extent and dynamics of neuronal tissue damage and midsagittal tissue bridges at the epicenter of traumatic cervical spinal cord lesions in 24 subacute tetraplegic patients. At one month post-injury, smaller lesion area and midsagittal tissue bridges identified those patients with lower extremity evoked potentials and better clinical recovery. Wider midsagittal tissue bridges and smaller lesions at one month post-injury were associated with neurological and functional recovery at 1 year follow-up. Neuroimaging biomarkers of lesion area and midsagittal tissue bridges are potential outcome predictors and patient stratifiers in both subacute and chronic clinical trials.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A mutation in the Tubb4a gene leads to microtubule accumulation with hypomyelination and demyelination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24930</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24930</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Our goal was to define the genetic cause of the profound hypomyelination in the &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; rat model and determine its relevance to human white matter disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Based on previous localization of the &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; mutation to rat chromosome 9, we tested if the mutation resided within the &lt;em&gt;Tubb4a&lt;/em&gt; (β-tubulin 4A) gene, since mutations in the &lt;em&gt;TUBB4A&lt;/em&gt; gene have been described in patients with CNS hypomyelination. To determine whether accumulation of microtubules led to progressive demyelination we analyzed the spinal cord and optic nerves of 2 year old rats by light and electron microscopy. Cerebral white matter from a patient with &lt;em&gt;TUBB4A&lt;/em&gt; Asn414Lys mutation and MRI evidence of severe hypomyelination was studied similarly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: As the &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; rat ages there is progressive loss of myelin in the brain and dorsal column of the spinal cord associated with increased oligodendrocyte numbers with accumulation of microtubules. This accumulation involved the entire cell body and distal processes of oligodendrocytes but there was no accumulation of microtubules in axons. A single point mutation in &lt;em&gt;Tubb4a&lt;/em&gt; (p.Ala302Thr) was found in homozygous &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; samples. A similar hypomyelination associated with increased oligodendrocyte numbers and arrays of microtubules in oligodendrocytes was demonstrated in the human patient sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: The &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; rat is the first animal model of &lt;em&gt;TUBB4&lt;/em&gt; mutations in humans and a novel system in which to test the mechanism of microtubule accumulation. The finding of microtubule accumulation in a patient with a &lt;em&gt;TUBB4A&lt;/em&gt; mutation and leukodystrophy confirms the usefulness of &lt;em&gt;taiep&lt;/em&gt; as a model of the human disease.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Fluorodeoxyglucose metabolism associated with tau-amyloid interaction predicts memory decline</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24910-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of this article was to evaluate in normal older adults and preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) the impact of amyloid and regional tauopathy on cerebral glucose metabolism and subsequent memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24910-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We acquired positron emission tomography using F18 flortaucipir (tau), C11 Pittsburgh compound B (amyloid), and F18 fluorodeoxyglucose in 90 clinically normal elderly of the Harvard Aging Brain Study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24910-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posterior cingulate metabolism decreased when both amyloid and neocortical tau were high and predicted subsequent memory decline in a larger sample of normal elderly. In contrast, frontal hypometabolism related to the common age-related entorhinal tauopathy, but this dysfunction was independent of amyloid, and did not predict significant memory decline. Neocortical tauopathy was positively associated with metabolism in individuals with subthreshold amyloid, suggesting that glucose metabolism increases before decreasing in the course of preclinical AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24910-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study identified a synergistic effect of amyloid and tau deposits and demonstrated, for the first time, in normal elderly its link to AD-like hypometabolism and to AD-like memory decline. The amyloid effect was observed with tau in neocortex, but not with tau in entorhinal cortex, which is the common site of age-related tauopathy. Entorhinal tau was associated with frontal hypometabolism, but this dysfunction was not associated with memory loss. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aimed to assess the possibility of using a noninvasive screening method for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis by means of abdominal fat ultrasonography. Quantitative analysis of ultrasound B-mode images demonstrated a significant increase in mean echogenicity and a loss of the normal structure of the layers of fat tissue in patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (n = 19). The ultrasound features of the fat tissue and the degree of amyloid deposition seen histopathologically showed a significant correlation. These results suggest that abdominal fat ultrasonography may be a valuable method for screening for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;People have been told that 'brain training' will make them not only better at playing certain games but smarter in general. However, evidence indicates that brain plasticity is specific to the acquired skill. The search for neural mechanisms of transfer of training-induced benefits needs to build on this evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Myoclonus epilepsy and ataxia due to KCNC1 mutation: Analysis of 20 cases and K+ channel properties</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24929</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24929</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To comprehensively describe the new syndrome of myoclonus epilepsy and ataxia due to potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) channel mutation (MEAK), including cellular electrophysiological characterization of observed clinical improvement with fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analysed clinical, electroclinical and neuroimaging data for twenty patients with MEAK due to recurrent KCNC1 p.R320H mutation. In vitro electrophysiological studies were conducted using whole cell patch clamp to explore biophysical properties of wild-type and mutant K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.1 channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms began between 3-15 years (median 9.5) with progressively severe myoclonus and rare tonic-clonic seizures. Ataxia was present early but quickly became overshadowed by myoclonus; ten patients were wheelchair-bound by late teenage. Mild cognitive decline occurred in half. Early death was not observed. EEG showed generalized spike and polyspike wave discharges with documented photosensitivity in most. Polygraphic EEG-EMG studies demonstrated a cortical origin for myoclonus and striking co-activation of agonist and antagonist muscles. MRI revealed symmetrical cerebellar atrophy, that appeared progressive, and a prominent corpus callosum. Unexpectedly, transient clinical improvement with fever was noted in six patients. To explore this, we performed high temperature in vitro recordings. At elevated temperatures there was a robust left-shift in activation of wild-type K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.1 increasing channel availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEAK has a relatively homogeneous presentation resembling Unverricht-Lundborg disease, despite the genetic and biological basis being quite different. A remarkable improvement with fever may be explained by the temperature-dependent left-shift in activation of wild-type K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.1 subunit containing channels that would counter the loss-of-function observed for mutant channels, highlighting KCNC1 as a potential target for precision therapeutics.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Randomized clinical trial of deep brain stimulation for post-stroke pain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24927</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24927</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: The experience with deep brain stimulation (DBS) for pain is largely based on uncontrolled studies targeting the somatosensory pathways, with mixed results. We hypothesized that targeting limbic neural pathways would modulate the affective sphere of pain and alleviate suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We conducted a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study of DBS targeting the ventral striatum/anterior limb of the internal capsule (VS/ALIC) in 10 patients with post-stroke pain syndrome. One month after bilateral DBS, patients were randomized to active DBS or sham for 3 months, followed by cross-over for another 3-month period. The primary endpoint was a ≥ 50% improvement in the Pain Disability Index in 50% of patients with active DBS compared to sham. This 6-month blinded phase was followed by an 18-month open-stimulation phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Nine participants completed randomization. Although this trial was negative for its primary and secondary endpoints, we did observe significant differences in multiple outcome measures related to the affective sphere of pain (e.g. Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Affective Pain Rating Index of the Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire). 14 serious adverse events were recorded and resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: VS/ALIC DBS to modulate the affective sphere of pain represents a paradigm shift in chronic pain management. While this exploratory study was negative for its primary endpoint, VS/ALIC DBS demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and statistically-significant improvements in multiple outcome measures related to the affective sphere of pain. Therefore, we believe these results justify further work in neuromodulation therapies targeting the affective sphere of pain. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Tailoring epilepsy surgery with fast ripples in the intra-operative electrocorticogram</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24928</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24928</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Intra-operative electrocorticography (ECoG) can be used to delineate the resection area in epilepsy surgery. High frequency oscillations (HFOs, 80-500Hz) seem better biomarkers for epileptogenic tissue than spikes. We studied how HFOs and spikes in combined pre- and post-resection ECoG predict surgical outcome in different tailoring approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We, retrospectively, marked HFOs, divided into fast ripples (FRs, 250-500Hz) and ripples (80-250Hz), and spikes in pre- and post-resection ECoG sampled at 2048 Hz in people with refractory focal epilepsy. We defined four groups of EEG-event occurrence: pre+post- (+/-), pre+post+ (+/+), pre-post+ (-/+) and pre-post- (-/-). We subcategorized three tailoring approaches: hippocampectomy with tailoring for neocortical involvement, lesionectomy of temporal lesions with tailoring for mesiotemporal involvement and lesionectomy with tailoring for surrounding neocortical involvement. We compared the percentage of resected pre-EEG-events, the time to recurrence and the different tailoring approaches to outcome (seizure-free versus recurrence).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We included 54 patients (median age 15.5y, 25 months follow-up, 30 seizure-free). The percentage of resected FRs, ripples or spikes in pre-ECoG did not predict outcome. The occurrence of FRs in post-ECoG, given FRs in pre-ECoG (+/-,+/+), predicted outcome (hazard ratio: 3.13 (CI=1.22-6.25); p=0.01). Seven out of eight patients without spikes in pre-ECoG were seizure-free. The highest predictive value for seizure recurrence was the presence of FRs in post-ECoG for all tailoring approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: FRs which persists before and after resection predict poor post-surgical outcome. These findings hold for different tailoring approaches. FRs can thus be used for tailoring epilepsy surgery with repeated intra-operative ECoG measurements. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Deciphering Neural Codes of Memory during Sleep</title>

	<description>Memories of experiences are stored in the cerebral cortex. Sleep is critical for the consolidation of hippocampal memory of wake experiences into the neocortex. Understanding representations of neural codes of hippocampal–neocortical networks during sleep would reveal important circuit mechanisms in memory consolidation and provide novel insights into memory and dreams. Although sleep-associated ensemble spike activity has been investigated, identifying the content of memory in sleep remains challenging.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Stroke in right dorsal anterior insular cortex Is related to myocardial injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24906</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24906</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24906-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated levels of cardiac troponin, and especially their relative changes over time, indicate acute myocardial injury. They are also frequently observed after acute ischemic stroke (AIS), indicating poor functional outcome and increased mortality. However, recent evidence showed that, in most AIS patients, myocardial injury is not caused by coronary ischemia. Instead, stroke lesion location has been suggested to precipitate myocardial injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24906-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) was used in 299 patients who had a magnetic resonance imaging–confirmed acute ischemic stroke within the anterior circulation and a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) acquired on the day of admission. Of these, 228 had a second troponin measurement during the acute phase. The absolute hs-cTnT levels above the 99th percentile of a healthy reference population (≥14ng/l) as well as their relative temporal changes were used as continuous variables of interest in the VLSM model, including a multiple regression analysis adjusted for confounding variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24906-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anterior insular cortex of the right hemisphere, in particular its dorsal subregion, was significantly associated with the relative temporal changes of hs-cTnT (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01, corrected for multiple comparisons). In contrast, the baseline hs-cTnT levels on admission were not related to lesion location anywhere within the anterior circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24906-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results amplify recent evidence from functional neuroimaging, which suggests a prominent role of dorsal anterior insular cortex in the parasympathetic control of cardiac and autonomic function. Acute vascular damage of this insular subregion might lead to autonomic dysbalance and an upregulation of sympathetic function, thereby resulting in myocardial injury.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24919-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM), an intractable progressive muscle disease, frequently occurs in older persons. sIBM pathogenesis may involve protein degradation dysfunction and immune abnormalities. Autoantibodies recognizing cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase 1A (cN1A) were found in plasma and serum from sIBM patients. However, whether anti-cN1A autoantibodies play a pathogenic role in sIBM is controversial. This study investigated the pathogenic properties of anti-cN1A autoantibodies in sIBM pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24919-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We developed a cell-based assay to detect anti-cN1A autoantibodies, which we found in serum from patients with neuromuscular diseases including sIBM. We also investigated the clinicopathological differences between sIBM patients with and without the autoantibodies. We used passive in vitro and in vivo immunization models to evaluate the pathogenic role of the autoantibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24919-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 67 patients with sIBM, 24 (35.8%) possessed anti-cN1A autoantibodies as determined via our cell-based assay. In the anti-cN1A–positive group, the percentage of patients with hepatitis C virus antibodies was significantly lower and the mean area of type 2 myofibers was significantly smaller compared with the autoantibody-negative group. In the in vitro passive immunization model, p62/SQSTM1 significantly increased in anti-cN1A–positive sIBM immunoglobulin G (IgG)-supplemented cells. In the in vivo passive immunization model, anti-cN1A–positive sIBM IgG-injected mice demonstrated p62/SQSTM1-positive sarcoplasmic aggregates in myofibers, associated with macrophage infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24919-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our cell-based assay is useful for anti-cN1A autoantibodies detection. Patients with anti-cN1A autoantibodies demonstrated unique clinicopathological features. In vitro and in vivo passive immunization model results suggest that anti-cN1A autoantibodies may affect protein degradation in myofibers.

&lt;p&gt;Authors: Dominik R. Bach &amp;amp; Peter Dayan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature and neural implementation of emotions is the subject of vigorous debate. Here, we use Bayesian decision theory to address key complexities in this field and conceptualize emotions in terms of their relationship to survival-relevant behavioural choices. Decision theory indicates which behaviours are optimal &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authors: Ulrike C. Müller, Thomas Deller &amp;amp; Martin Korte&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amyloid precursor protein (APP) gives rise to the amyloid-β peptide and thus has a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. By contrast, the physiological functions of APP and the closely related APP-like proteins (APLPs) remain less well understood. Studying these physiological functions has &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We report 2 families with undiagnosed recessive presynaptic congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). Whole exome or genome sequencing identified segregating homozygous variants in &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt;: c.51_64delAGGTGGGGGTCCCC in a Kuwaiti family and c.146G&amp;gt;C in an Israeli family. &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt; is crucial for vesicle fusion at presynaptic neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Electrodiagnostic examination showed severely low compound muscle action potentials and presynaptic impairment. We assessed the effect of the nonsense mutation on mRNA levels and evaluated the NMJ transmission in &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;lew/lew&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice, observing neurophysiological features of presynaptic impairment, similar to the patients. Taken together, our findings highlight &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt; homozygous mutations as a cause of presynaptic CMS. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Authors: Kristina Valentinova &amp;amp; Manuel Mameli&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addictive substances hijack the reward system partly via synaptic plasticity onto dopamine neurons. Cadherins may contribute to cocaine-evoked adaptations, supporting the notion that drug addiction is a synaptic disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal place cells are traditionally thought to represent locations where animals currently are or predict where they are headed. However, new results reveal that place cells also represent distant places that are actively avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: The Role of Mental Maps in Decision-Making</title>

	<description>A growing body of work is investigating the use of mental maps during decision-making. Here we discuss how decision-making organizes experiences according to an internal model of the current task, thereby structuring memory. Likewise, we consider how the structure of mental maps contributes to decision-making.</description>

	<description>Early sensory cortex is typically investigated in response to sensory stimulation, masking the contribution of internal signals. Recently, van Kerkoerle and colleagues reported that attention and memory signals segregate from sensory signals within specific layers of primary visual cortex, providing insight into the role of internal signals in sensory processing.</description>

	<description>Immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecules are among the most abundant proteins in vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems. Prominent family members are the neural cell adhesion molecules NCAM and L1, which were the first to be shown to be essential not only in development but also in synaptic function and as key regulators of synapse formation, synaptic activity, plasticity, and synaptic vesicle recycling at distinct developmental and activity stages. In addition to interacting with each other, adhesion molecules interact with ion channels and cytokine and neurotransmitter receptors.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Stroke instigates a dynamic process of repair and remodelling of remaining neural circuits, and this process is shaped by behavioural experiences. The onset of motor disability simultaneously creates a powerful incentive to develop new, compensatory ways of performing daily activities. Compensatory movement strategies that are &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies in humans have shown that many behaviors engage processes that suppress excitability within the corticospinal tract. Inhibition of the motor output pathway has been extensively studied in the context of action stopping, where a planned movement needs to be abruptly aborted. Recent TMS work has also revealed markers of motor inhibition during the preparation of movement. Here, we review the evidence for motor inhibition during action stopping and action preparation, focusing on studies that have used TMS to monitor changes in the excitability of the corticospinal pathway.</description>

	<description>Obesity is now a worldwide health issue. Far from being limited to weight gain, obesity is generally associated with low-grade inflammation and with a cluster of disorders collectively known as the ‘metabolic syndrome’. When considering obesity and the subsequent neuroinflammation, the focus was long set on the hypothalamus. More recently, obesity-derived neuroinflammation has been shown to affect other brain structures such as the hippocampus, cortex, brainstem, or amygdala. Furthermore, obesity has been associated with increased occurrence of central disorders such as depression and impaired cognitive function.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Monoamine Transporters as Ionotropic Receptors</title>

	<description>It is well established that glutamate and GABA signal through both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Conversely, it is thought that, with one exception, monoamines (dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine) signal via metabotropic receptors. Given their capacity to generate fast-acting currents, I suggest that the monoamine transporters should be considered as ionotropic receptors.</description>

&lt;p&gt;In a new, chimeric model of Alzheimer disease (AD), in which human neurons were transplanted into an AD mouse model, amyloid-β-related pathology was associated with robust degeneration of the human neurons but no neurofibrillary tangle formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the first formal description of Parkinson disease (PD) two centuries ago, our understanding of this common neurodegenerative disorder has expanded at all levels of description, from the delineation of its clinical phenotype to the identification of its neuropathological features, neurochemical processes and genetic factors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NMDA receptors are preeminent neurotransmitter-gated channels in the CNS, which respond to glutamate in a manner that integrates multiple external and internal cues. They belong to the ionotropic glutamate receptor family and fulfil unique and crucial roles in neuronal development and function. These roles depend &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern optogenetics can be tuned to evoke activity that corresponds to naturally occurring local or global activity in timing, magnitude or individual-cell patterning. This outcome has been facilitated not only by the development of core features of optogenetics over the past 10 years (microbial-opsin variants, &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Where Does EEG Come From and What Does It Mean?</title>

	<description>Electroencephalography (EEG) has been instrumental in making discoveries about cognition, brain function, and dysfunction. However, where do EEG signals come from and what do they mean? The purpose of this paper is to argue that we know shockingly little about the answer to this question, to highlight what we do know, how important the answers are, and how modern neuroscience technologies that allow us to measure and manipulate neural circuits with high spatiotemporal accuracy might finally bring us some answers.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: The Insula: An Underestimated Brain Area in Clinical Neuroscience, Psychiatry, and Neurology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30017-6?rss=yes</guid>

	<description>Supported by recent human neuroimaging studies, the insula is re-emerging as an important brain area not only in the physiological understanding of the brain, but also in pathological contexts in clinical research. In this opinion article, we briefly introduce the anatomical and histological features of the human insula. We then summarize the physiological functions of the insula and underscore its pathological roles in psychiatric and neurological disorders that have long been underestimated. We finally propose possible strategies through which the role of the insula may be further understood for both basic and clinical neuroscience.</description>
