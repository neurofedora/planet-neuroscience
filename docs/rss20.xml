	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A generative learning model for saccade adaptation</title>

Plasticity in the oculomotor system ensures that saccadic eye movements reliably meet their visual goals—to bring regions of interest into foveal, high-acuity vision. Here, we present a comprehensive description of sensorimotor learning in saccades. We induced continuous adaptation of saccade amplitudes using a double-step paradigm, in which participants saccade to a peripheral target stimulus, which then undergoes a surreptitious, intra-saccadic shift (ISS) as the eyes are in flight. In our experiments, the ISS followed a systematic variation, increasing or decreasing from one saccade to the next as a sinusoidal function of the trial number. Over a large range of frequencies, we confirm that adaptation gain shows (1) a periodic response, reflecting the frequency of the ISS with a delay of a number of trials, and (2) a simultaneous drift towards lower saccade gains. We then show that state-space-based linear time-invariant systems (LTIS) represent suitable generative models for this evolution of saccade gain over time. This &lt;i&gt;state-equation&lt;/i&gt; algorithm computes the prediction of an internal (or hidden state-) variable by learning from recent feedback errors, and it can be compared to experimentally observed adaptation gain. The algorithm also includes a forgetting rate that quantifies per-trial leaks in the adaptation gain, as well as a systematic, non-error-based bias. Finally, we study how the parameters of the generative models depend on features of the ISS. Driven by a sinusoidal disturbance, the state-equation admits an exact analytical solution that expresses the parameters of the phenomenological description as functions of those of the generative model. Together with statistical model selection criteria, we use these correspondences to characterize and refine the structure of compatible state-equation models. We discuss the relation of these findings to established results and suggest that they may guide further design of experimental research across domains of sensorimotor adaptation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fhHPZoP9o_4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: A computational model of oxytocin modulation of olfactory recognition memory</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Social recognition in mammals depends on complex interactions between sensory and other brain areas as well as modulatory inputs by specific neuropeptides such as oxytocin (OXT). Social recognition memory specifically has been shown to depend among others on olfactory processing, and can be probed using methods similar to those used when probing non-social odor memory. We here use a computational model of two interconnected olfactory networks in the mouse, the olfactory bulb and anterior olfactory nucleus, to propose a mechanism for olfactory short term recognition memory and its modulation in social situations. Based on previous experiments, we propose one early locus for memory to be the olfactory bulb. During social encounters in mice, pyramidal cells in the AON, themselves driven by olfactory input, are rendered more excitable by OXT release, resulting in stronger feedback to olfactory bulb local interneurons. This additional input to the OB creates stronger dynamics and improves signal to noise ratio of odor responses in the OB proper. As a consequence, mouse social olfactory memories are more strongly encoded and their duration is modulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Oxytocin has long been associated with modulating neural networks during social encounters. We here use a computational model to show how neural plasticity, modulation and memory for social odors interact when animals encounter conspecific odors. To date the exact neural processes of oxytocin modulation of social odor memory are not elucidated; our modeling approach allows us to draw from a number of experimental data from different levels of analyses to create a coherent framework for how oxytocin modulates odor processing to match behavioral demands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Blue Light Promotes Neurite Outgrowth of Retinal Explants in Postnatal ChR2 Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the adult mammalian CNS fails to regenerate after severe injury. However, it is known that an increase in neural activity occurs in mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) after extrinsic stimulation and this can induce axon growth. In the present study, we applied an optogenetic approach using a mouse model, specifically involving channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) expression in RGCs. We investigated whether modulation of RGC neural activity exclusively by blue light stimulation is able to promote neurite outgrowth of postnatal retinal explants. The results showed that activation of RGCs expressing ChR2 by 20 Hz blue light for 1 h is a most effective way of enhancing neurite outgrowth in postnatal retinas. This is achieved via gap junctions that spread neural activity across the whole retina. Moreover, we found that activation of intrinsic photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs) by blue light also contributes significantly to the promotion of neurite outgrowth in the same postnatal retinal explants. Our findings not only demonstrate that a short-term increase in RGC neural activity is sufficient to facilitate the neurite outgrowth of retinal explants, but also highlight the fact that the temporal pattern of neural activity in RGCs is a critical factor in regulating axon regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerstmann‐Sträussler‐Scheinker syndrome (GSS) with the P102L mutation is a rare genetic prion disease caused by a pathogenic mutation at codon 102 in the prion protein gene. Cluster analysis encompassing data from seven Czech patients and 87 published cases suggests the existence of four clinical phenotypes (“typical GSS,” “GSS with areflexia and paresthesia,” “pure dementia GSS,” and “Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease‐like GSS”); GSS may be more common than previously estimated. In making a clinical diagnosis or progression estimates of GSS, MRI, and RT‐QuIC may be helpful, but the results should be evaluated with respect to the overall clinical context.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Effects of Orthostatic Hypotension on Cognition in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25578?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the effect of a decrease in blood pressure (BP) fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for orthostatic hypotension (OH) on performance in each domain of cognitive function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using a cross‐sectional and within‐group design.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjects were individuals without dementia and with type 2 diabetes mellitus, including 107 individuals without OH and 94 with OH (DMOH); 95 control participants were also included. Blood pressure was assessed in both supine and standing positions. A detailed neuropsychological assessment was underwent in each posture for all subjects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were statistically significant between the DM and DMOH group with regards to some cognitive measure while supine. Standing posture exacerbated and broadened cognitive deficits in the DMOH group for all measures in different &lt;i&gt;domains&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;cognition&lt;/i&gt;, including executive functioning, memory, visuospatial skills, information processing speed, and attention. When group‐specific supine scores were used as baseline anchors, both DM groups showed cognitive changes when transitioning from a supine to a standing upright position, with the DMOH group exhibiting a wider range of neuropsychological deficits in memory, visuospatial skills, executive function, and sustained attention, as well as significant changes in information processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data demonstrate that Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with OH had transient, posture‐mediated cognitive deficits in excess of those found in diabetes without OH. Understanding the effects of OH on cognition due to autonomic failure is important, particularly as clinical assessments and neuroimaging collect data only in the seated or supine positions.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Robust motifs of threshold-linear networks. (arXiv:1902.10270v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To any inhibition-dominated threshold-linear network (TLN) we can associate a
directed graph that captures the pattern of strong and weak inhibition between
neurons. Robust motifs are graphs for which the structure of fixed points in
the network is independent of the choice of connectivity matrix $W$, and whose
dynamics are thus greatly constrained. This makes them ideal building blocks
for constructing larger networks whose behaviors are robust to changes in
connection strengths. In contrast, flexible motifs correspond to networks with
multiple dynamic regimes. In this work, we give a purely graphical
characterization of both flexible and robust motifs of any size. We find that
all but a few robust motifs fall into two infinite families of graphs with
simple feedforward architectures.

	<description>Background: Nrf2 (nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2) is believed to play a major role in neurodegenerative diseases. The present study attempted to investigate the hippocampal circRNA and lncRNA expression profiles associated with Nrf2-mediated neuroprotection.
Methods: The hippocampal mRNA, circRNA and lncRNA expression profiles of Nrf2 (-/-) mice were determined by microarray analysis. Bioinformatics analyses, including identification of differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs), circRNAs (DEcircRNAs) and lncRNAs (DElncRNAs), DEcircRNA-miRNA-DEmRNA interaction network construction, DElncRNA-DEmRNA co-expression network construction, and biological function annotation, were conducted. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to validate the dysregulated expression of circRNAs and lncRNAs derived from the microarray data of the hippocampus of Nrf2 (-/-) mice.
Results: Compared to wild-type Nrf2 (+/+) mice, 412 DEmRNAs (109 up- and 303 down-regulated mRNAs), 1279 DEcircRNAs (632 up- and 647 down-regulated circRNAs), and 303 DElncRNAs (50 up- and 253 down-regulated lncRNAs) were identified in the hippocampus of Nrf2 (-/-) mice. Additionally, in qRT-PCR validation results, the expression patterns of selected DEcircRNAs and DElncRNAs were generally consistent with results in the microarray data. The DEcircRNA-miRNA-DEmRNA interaction networks revealed that mmu_circRNA_44531, mmu_circRNA_34132, mmu_circRNA_000903, mmu_circRNA_018676, mmu_circRNA_45901, mmu_circRNA_33836, mmu_circRNA_34137, mmu_circRNA_34106, mmu_circRNA_008691, and mmu_circRNA_003237 were predicted to compete with 47, 54, 45, 57, 63, 81, 121, 85, 181, and 43 DEmRNAs, respectively. ENSMUST00000125413, NR_028123, uc008nfy.1, AK076764, AK142725, AK080547 and AK035903 were co-expressed with 178, 89, 149, 179, 142, 55 and 112 DEmRNAs in the Nrf2 (-/-) hippocampus, respectively.
Conclusions: In conclusion, our study might contribute to exploring the key circRNAs and lncRNAs associated with Nrf2-mediated neuroprotection.</description>

	<description>Neurological deficits and cognitive dysfunctions caused by acute ischemic stroke pose enormous burden to the stroke families and the communities. Restoration of the normal function of the neurovascular unit following ischemic stroke is critical for improving neurological recovery and cognitive functions after stroke. Recent evidences suggest that the myeloid cells including both the resident microglia and infiltrating monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils are highly plastic in response to the environmental cues. They intimately interact with multiple components of the neurovascular unit in response to the alarmins, danger associated pattern molecules (DAMPs) and other signals released from the ischemic brain. The aim of this review is to discuss the reciprocal interactions between the myeloid cells and the ischemic neurovascular unit during the late repair phase of cerebral ischemic stroke. We also summarize potential immunotherapeutic targets on myeloid cells and new therapeutic approaches targeting myeloid cells, such as cell transplantation, mitochondrial dynamic and extracellular vesicles-based therapy and et al to enhance neurovascular repair for better stroke recovery.</description>

	<description>Optical stimulation and imaging of neurons deep in the brain require implantable optical neural probes. External optical access to deeper regions of the brain is limited by scattering and absorption of light as it propagates through tissue. Implantable optoelectronic probes capable of high-resolution light delivery and high-density neural recording are needed for closed-loop manipulation of neural circuits. Micro-light-emitting diodes (µLEDs) have been used for optical stimulation, but predominantly on rigid silicon or sapphire substrates. Flexible polymer neural probes would be preferable for chronic applications since they cause less damage to brain tissue. Flexible LED neural probes have been recently implemented by flip-chip bonding of commercially available µLED chips onto flexible substrates. Here, we demonstrate a monolithic design for flexible optoelectronic neural interfaces with embedded gallium nitride µLEDs that can be microfabricated at wafer-scale. Parylene C is used as the substrate and insulator due to its biocompatibility, compliance, and optical transparency. We demonstrate one-dimensional and two-dimensional individually-addressable µLED arrays. Our µLEDs have sizes as small as 22 µm × 22 µm in arrays of up to 32 µLEDs per probe shank. These devices emit blue light at a wavelength of 445 nm, suitable for stimulation of channelrhodopsin-2, with output power greater than 200 µW at 2 mA. Our flexible optoelectronic probes are double-sided and can illuminate brain tissue from both sides of the flexible probe. Recording electrodes are co-fabricated with µLEDs on the front- and backside of the optoelectronic probes for electrophysiology recording of neuronal activity from the volumes of tissue on the front- and backside simultaneously with bi-directional optical stimulation.</description>

	<description>Minimally-invasive monitoring of electrophysiological neural activities in real-time—that enables quantification of neural functions without a need for invasive craniotomy and the longer time constants of fMRI and PET—presents a very challenging yet significant task for neuroimaging. In this paper, we present in vivo functional PA (fPA) imaging of chemoconvulsant rat seizure model with intact scalp using a fluorescence quenching-based cyanine voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) characterized by a lipid vesicle model mimicking different levels of membrane potential variation. The framework also involves use of a near-infrared VSD delivered through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), opened by pharmacological modulation of adenosine receptor signaling. Our normalized time-frequency analysis presented in vivo VSD response in the seizure group significantly distinguishable from those of the control groups at sub-mm spatial resolution. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recording confirmed the changes of severity and frequency of brain activities, induced by chemoconvulsant seizures of the rat brain. The findings demonstrate that the near-infrared fPA VSD imaging is a promising tool for in vivo recording of brain activities through intact scalp, which would pave a way to its future translation.</description>

	<description>In experimental psychology, subjects are confronted with computer-based
experimental paradigms. Creating such paradigms can require quite an effort.
PyParadigm is a newly developed Python library to ease the development of such
paradigms by employing a declarative approach to build user interfaces (UIs).
This approach is a highly code-efficient alternative to currently
available libraries. Although PyParadigm was initially developed for the
creation of experimental paradigms, it is generally suited to build UIs that
display or interact with 2D objects.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Differences in Brain Activity After Learning With the Use of a Digital Pen vs. an Ink Pen—An Electroencephalography Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00275</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00275</link>
	<description>The purpose of this study is to clarify whether there is a learning effect on brain activity after writing with an ink pen vs. a digital pen. Previous studies have reported the superiority of handwriting to typing in terms of learning performance, but differences between the use of an ink pen vs. a digital pen remain unclear. In the present study, the participants learned to read difficult words by writing with an ink pen vs. a digital pen. After the learning period, electroencephalography signals were measured, while the participants underwent a repetition priming paradigm with the use of the learned words. The repetition priming effect of the N400 event-related potential was quantified as an index of the learning effect and the effects between pen types were compared. The groups were also subdivided according to whether a digital pen is frequently used (familiar vs. unfamiliar group). The number of writing repetitions for each word within 10 min during the learning activity and the post-learning test scores were not affected by the pen type or familiarity with a digital pen. However, the repetition priming effect of the N400 was greater for words written with a digital pen in the learning session, as compared with an ink pen, in the familiar group, but not the unfamiliar group. These results suggest that for those familiar with its use, writing with a digital pen may improve learning relative to the use of an ink pen.</description>

	<description>Background: Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, has tremendous social and economic impact worldwide. This study aimed to analyze global trends in Alzheimer's disease research and to investigate China’s contribution to this research. 
Methods: The quantity and influence of publications related to Alzheimer's disease in China and elsewhere were compared. The Web of Science and PubMed databases were searched from 1988 to 2017 using the terms “Alzheimer's disease” or “Alzheimers disease.” Global Alzheimer's disease publications were classified and analyzed. Keywords, countries, and institutions publishing articles on Alzheimer’s disease were analyzed, and citations of these articles were examined.
Results: A total of 181,116 articles regarding Alzheimer's disease research were identified and analyzed. Neuroscience and neurology were the main research categories both globally and in China. Basic research dominated Alzheimer’s publications, accounting for 30.93% of global publications and 95.31% of publications in China. A total of 8,935 journals published articles related to Alzheimer’s disease. The journal Neurobiology of Aging published the most Alzheimer’s disease-related articles, numbering 5,206 over the time period examined. The National Institutes of Health, the National Institute on Aging, and the Department of Health and Human Services jointly sponsored 11,809 articles, ranking first in the world. The National Natural Science Foundation of China funded the largest number of studies on Alzheimer's disease in China and recognized the importance of traditional Chinese medicine in Alzheimer’s disease research. 
Conclusions: The present study provides data for global researchers to understand research perspectives and develop future research directions. In recent years, Chinese researchers have contributed significantly to global Alzheimer’s research. Still, strengthening international cooperation could improve the quality and number of publications regarding Alzheimer’s disease.</description>

	<description>The cerebellar involvement in cognitive functions such as attention, language, working memory, emotion, goal-directed behavior and spatial navigation is constantly growing. However, an exact connectivity map between the hippocampus and cerebellum in mice is still unknown. Here, we conducted a tracing study to identify the sequence of transsynaptic, cerebellar-hippocampal connections in the mouse brain using combinations of recombinant adeno-associated (rAAV) and pseudotyped deletion-mutant rabies (RABV) viruses. Stereotaxic injection of a primarily anterograde rAAV-WGA (wheat germ agglutinin)-Cre tracer virus in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) of a Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter mouse resulted in strong tdTomato labeling in hippocampal CA1 neurons, retrosplenial cortex (RSC), rhinal cortex (RC) as well as thalamic and cerebellar areas. Whereas hippocampal injections with the retrograde tracer virus rAAV-TTC (tetanus toxin C fragment)-eGFP, displayed eGFP positive cells in the rhinal cortex and subiculum. To determine the sequence of mono-transsynaptic connections between the cerebellum and hippocampus, we used the retrograde tracer RABVΔG-eGFP(EnvA). The tracing revealed a direct connection from the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), RC and subiculum (S), which are monosynaptically connected to thalamic laterodorsal and ventrolateral areas. These thalamic nuclei are directly connected to cerebellar fastigial (FN), interposed (IntP) and lateral (Lat) nuclei, discovering a new projection route from the fastigial to the laterodorsal thalamic nucleus in the mouse brain. Collectively, our findings suggest a new cerebellar-hippocampal connection via the laterodorsal and ventrolateral thalamus to RSC, RC and S. These results strengthen the notion of the cerebellum’s involvement in cognitive functions such as spatial navigation via a polysynaptic circuitry.</description>

	<description>The complex and elaborate architecture of a neuron poses a great challenge to the cellular machinery which localizes proteins and organelles, such as mitochondria, to necessary locations. Proper mitochondrial localization in neurons is particularly important as this organelle provides energy and metabolites essential to form and maintain functional neural connections. Consequently, maintenance of a healthy pool of mitochondria and removal of damaged organelles are essential for neuronal homeostasis. Long distance transport of the organelle itself as well as components necessary for maintaining mitochondria in distal compartments are important for a constant supply of healthy mitochondria at the right time and place. Accordingly, many neurodegenerative diseases have been associated with mitochondrial abnormalities. Here we review our current understanding on transport-dependent mechanisms that regulate mitochondrial replenishment. We focus on axonal transport and import of mRNAs and proteins destined for mitochondria as well as mitochondrial fusion and fission to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis in distal compartments of the neuron.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cannabidivarin Treatment Ameliorates Autism-Like Behaviors and Restores Hippocampal Endocannabinoid System and Glia Alterations Induced by Prenatal Valproic Acid Exposure in Rats</title>

	<description>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition whose primary features include social communication and interaction impairments with restricted or repetitive motor movements. No approved treatment for the core symptoms is available and considerable research efforts aim at identifying effective therapeutic strategies.
Emerging evidence suggests that altered endocannabinoid signaling and immune dysfunction might contribute to ASD pathogenesis. In this scenario, phytocannabinoids could hold great pharmacological potential due to their combined capacities to act either directly or indirectly on components of the endocannabinoid system and to modulate immune functions. Among all plant-cannabinoids, the phytocannabinoid cannabidivarin (CBDV) was recently shown to reduce motor impairments and cognitive deficits in animal models of Rett Syndrome, a condition showing some degree of overlap with autism, raising the possibility that CBDV might have therapeutic potential in ASD.
Here, we investigated the ability of CBDV treatment to reverse or prevent ASD-like behaviors in male rats prenatally exposed to VPA (500mg/kg i.p.; gestation day 12.5). The offspring received CBDV according to two different protocols: symptomatic (0.2/2/20/100mg/kg i.p.; postnatal days 34-58) and preventative (2/20mg/kg i.p.; postnatal days 19-29). The major efficacy of CBDV was observed at the dose of 20mg/kg for both treatment schedules. CBDV in symptomatic rats recovered social impairments, social novelty preference, short-term memory deficits, repetitive behaviors and hyperlocomotion whereas preventative treatment reduced sociability and social novelty deficits, short-term memory impairments and hyperlocomotion, without affecting stereotypies. As dysregulations in the endocannabinoid system and neuroinflammatory markers contribute to the development of some ASD phenotypes in the VPA model, neurochemical studies were performed after symptomatic treatment to investigate possible CBDV’s effects on the endocannabinoid system, inflammatory markers and microglia activation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Prenatal VPA exposure increased CB1 receptor, FAAH and MAGL levels, enhanced GFAP, CD11b and TNFα levels and triggered microglia activation restricted to the hippocampus. All these alterations were restored after CBDV treatment.
These data provide preclinical evidence in support of the ability of CBDV to ameliorate behavioral abnormalities resembling core and associated symptoms of ASD. At the neurochemical level, symptomatic CBDV restores hippocampal endocannabinoid signaling and neuroinflammation induced by prenatal VPA exposure.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Mechanistic Basis for Successful Spinal Cord Stimulation to Generate Steady Motor Outputs</title>

	<description>Electrical stimulation of the spinal cord is a promising rehabilitation intervention to restore/augment motor function after spinal cord injury. Combining sensory feedback with stimulation of remaining motor circuits has been shown to be a prerequisite for the functional improvement of spinal cord injury patients. However, little is known about the cellular mechanisms potentially underlying this functional benefit in the injured spinal cord.  Here, we combine computer simulations with an isolated whole-tissue adult mouse spinal cord preparation to examine synaptic, cellular, and system potentials measured from single motoneurons and ventral roots. The stimulation protocol included separate and combined activation of the sensory inputs (evoked by dorsal root stimulation) and motor inputs (evoked by stimulation of spinal cord tissue) at different frequencies, intensities, and neuromodulatory states. Our data show that, while sensory inputs exhibit short-term depression in response to a train of stimulation, motor inputs exhibit short-term facilitation. However, the concurrent activation of both inputs elicits a stronger and steadier motor output. This effect is enhanced by the application of pharmacological neuromodulators. Furthermore, sensorimotor excitatory postsynaptic potentials summate sublinearly (i.e., their combination produces an excitatory potential smaller than the sum of the excitatory potentials they would individually produce). However, ventral root compound action potentials summate supralinearly generating much higher outputs. Computer simulations revealed that the contrasting summation and disproportionality in plasticity between the excitatory postsynaptic potentials and compound action potentials result from the motoneuronal firing threshold acting as an amplitude-selective filter. Together, these results provide the mechanistic basis for the cellular processes contributing to the generation of steady motor outputs using spinal stimulation. This data has great potential to guide the design of more effective stimulation protocols in spinal cord injury patients.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cofilin 2 in Serum as a Novel Biomarker for Alzheimer’s Disease in Han Chinese</title>

	<description>The identification of biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important and urgent area of study, not only to aid in the early diagnosis of AD, but also to evaluate potentially new anti-AD drugs. The aim of this study was to explore cofilin 2 in serum as a novel biomarker for AD. The upregulation was observed in AD patients and different AD animal models compared to the controls, as well as in AD cell models. Memantine and donepezil can attenuate the upregulation of cofilin 2 expression in APP/PS1 mice. The serum levels of cofilin 2 in AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients were significantly higher compared to controls (AD: 167.9±35.3 pg/mL; MCI: 115.9±15.4 pg/mL; Control: 90.5±27.1 pg/mL; p&amp;lt;0.01). A significant correlation between cofilin 2 levels and cognitive decline was observed (r=–0.792; p&amp;lt;0.001). The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis showed the area under the curve (AUC) of cofilin 2 was 0.957, and the diagnostic accuracy was 80%, with 93% sensitivity and 87% specificity. The optimal cut-off value was 130.4 pg/ml. Our results indicate the possibility of serum cofilin 2 as a novel and non-invasive biomarker for AD. In addition, the expression of cofilin 2 was found to be significantly increased in AD compared to vascular dementia (VaD), and only an increased trend but not significant was detected in VaD compared to the controls. ROC analysis between AD and VaD showed that the AUC was 0.824, which could indicate a role of cofilin 2 as a biomarker in the differential diagnosis between AD and VaD.</description>

	<description>Humans employ different strategies when making decisions. Previous research has reported reduced reliance on model-based strategies with aging, but it remains unclear whether this is due to cognitive or motivational factors. Moreover, it is not clear how aging affects the metacontrol of decision making, i.e. the dynamic adaptation of decision-making strategies to varying situational demands. In this cross-sectional study, we tested younger and older adults in a sequential decision-making task that dissociates model-free and model-based strategies. In contrast to previous research, model-based strategies led to higher payoffs. Moreover, we manipulated the costs and benefits of model-based strategies by varying reward magnitude and the stability of the task structure. Compared to younger adults, older adults showed reduced model-based decision making and less adaptation of decision-making strategies. Our findings suggest that aging affects the metacontrol of decision-making strategies and that reduced model-based strategies in older adults are due to limited cognitive abilities.</description>

	<description>CRISPR-Cas systems provide bacteria and archaea with programmable immunity against mobile genetic elements. Evolutionary pressure by CRISPR-Cas has driven bacteriophage to evolve small protein inhibitors, anti-CRISPRs (Acrs), that block Cas enzyme function by wide-ranging mechanisms. We show here that the inhibitor AcrVA4 uses a previously undescribed strategy to recognize the &lt;i&gt;L. bacterium &lt;/i&gt;Cas12a (LbCas12a) pre-crRNA processing nuclease, forming a Cas12a dimer, and allosterically inhibiting DNA binding. The &lt;i&gt;A. species&lt;/i&gt; Cas12a (AsCas12a) enzyme, widely used for genome editing applications, contains an ancestral helical bundle that blocks AcrVA4 binding and allows it to escape anti-CRISPR recognition. Using biochemical, microbiological, and human cell editing experiments, we show that Cas12a orthologs can be rendered either sensitive or resistant to AcrVA4 through rational structural engineering informed by evolution. Together, these findings explain a new mode of CRISPR-Cas inhibition and illustrate how structural variability in Cas effectors can drive opportunistic co-evolution of inhibitors by bacteriophage.</description>

	<description>In the &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; germline, &lt;i&gt;fem-3&lt;/i&gt; Binding Factor (FBF) partners with LST-1 to maintain stem cells. A crystal structure of an FBF-2/LST-1/RNA complex revealed that FBF-2 recognizes a short RNA motif different from the characteristic 9-nt FBF binding element, and compact motif recognition coincided with curvature changes in the FBF-2 scaffold. Previously we engineered FBF-2 to favor recognition of shorter RNA motifs without curvature change (Bhat, Qiu, et al. 2019). &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; selection of RNAs bound by FBF-2 suggested sequence specificity in the central region of the compact element. This bias, reflected in the crystal structure, was validated in RNA-binding assays. FBF-2 has the intrinsic ability to bind to this shorter motif. LST-1 weakens FBF-2 binding affinity for short and long motifs, which may increase target selectivity. Our findings highlight the role of FBF scaffold flexibility in RNA recognition and suggest a new mechanism by which protein partners refine target site selection.</description>

	<description>The antiviral activity of host factor apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G, A3G) and its degradation mediated by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vif protein are important topics. Although accumulating evidence indicates the importance of deubiquitination enzymes (DUBs) in innate immunity, it is unknown if they participate in A3G stability. Here, we found that USP49 directly interacts with A3G and efficiently removes ubiquitin, consequently increasing A3G protein expression and significantly enhancing its anti-HIV-1 activity. Unexpectedly, A3G degradation was also mediated by a Vif- and cullin-ring-independent pathway, which was effectively counteracted by USP49. Furthermore, clinical data suggested that USP49 is correlated with A3G protein expression and hypermutations in Vif-positive proviruses, and inversely with the intact provirus ratio in the HIV-1 latent reservoir. Our studies demonstrated a mechanism to effectively stabilize A3G expression, which could comprise a target to control HIV-1 infection and eradicate the latent reservoir.</description>

	<description>Previously, we reported the first oxygen partial pressure (Po2) measurements in the brain of awake mice, by performing two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy at micrometer resolution (Lyons et al., 2016). However, this study disregarded that imaging through a cranial window lowers brain temperature, an effect capable of affecting cerebral blood flow, the properties of the oxygen sensors and thus Po2 measurements. Here, we show that in awake mice chronically implanted with a glass window over a craniotomy or a thinned-skull surface, the postsurgical decrease of brain temperature recovers within a few days. However, upon imaging with a water immersion objective at room temperature, brain temperature decreases by ~ 2-3{degree sign}C, causing drops in resting capillary blood flow, capillary Po2, hemoglobin saturation, and tissue Po2. These adverse effects are corrected by heating the immersion objective or avoided by imaging through a dry air objective, thereby revealing the physiological values of brain oxygenation.</description>

	<description>Production of healthy gametes in meiosis relies on the quality control and proper distribution of both nuclear and cytoplasmic contents. Meiotic differentiation naturally eliminates age-induced cellular damage by an unknown mechanism. Using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy in budding yeast, we found that nuclear senescence factors - including protein aggregates, extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA circles, and abnormal nucleolar material - are sequestered away from chromosomes during meiosis II and subsequently eliminated. A similar sequestration and elimination process occurs for the core subunits of the nuclear pore complex in both young and aged cells. Nuclear envelope remodeling drives the formation of a membranous compartment containing the sequestered material. Importantly, &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; generation of plasma membrane is required for the sequestration event, preventing the inheritance of long-lived nucleoporins and senescence factors into the newly formed gametes. Our study uncovers a new mechanism of nuclear quality control and provides insight into its function in meiotic cellular rejuvenation.</description>

	<description>The chromosomal replication origin region (&lt;i&gt;ori&lt;/i&gt;) of characterized bacteria is dynamically positioned throughout the cell cycle. In slowly growing &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ori&lt;/i&gt; is maintained at mid-cell from birth until its replication, after which newly replicated sister &lt;i&gt;ori&lt;/i&gt;s move to opposite quarter positions. Here, we provide an explanation for &lt;i&gt;ori &lt;/i&gt;positioning based on the self-organisation of the Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes complex, MukBEF, which forms dynamically positioned clusters on the chromosome. We propose that a non-trivial feedback between the self-organising gradient of MukBEF complexes and the &lt;i&gt;ori&lt;/i&gt;s leads to accurate &lt;i&gt;ori &lt;/i&gt;positioning. We find excellent agreement with quantitative experimental measurements and confirm key predictions. Specifically, we show that &lt;i&gt;ori&lt;/i&gt;s exhibit biased motion towards MukBEF clusters, rather than mid-cell. Our findings suggest that MukBEF and &lt;i&gt;ori&lt;/i&gt;s act together as a self-organising system in chromosome organisation-segregation and introduces protein self-organisation as an important consideration for future studies of chromosome dynamics.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Is Vergence an Absolute Distance Cue?</title>

	<description>Since Kepler (1604) and Descartes (1638), vergence (the angular rotation of the eyes) has been thought of as one of our most important absolute distance cues. But vergence has never been tested as an absolute distance cue divorced from obvious confounding cues such as binocular disparity. In this article we control for these confounding cues for the first time by gradually manipulating vergence, and find that observers fail to accurately judge distance from vergence. We consider a number of different interpretations of these results, and argue that rather than adopt an ad-hoc reinterpretation of vergence as blind to gradual changes, or ineffective when static, the most principled response to these results is to question the general effectiveness of vergence as an absolute distance cue. cue. Given other absolute distance cues (such as motion parallax and vertical disparities) are limited in application, this poses a real challenge to our contemporary understanding of visual scale.</description>

	<description>Broad brain transcriptome, connectome and proteome maps are being generated, but a comprehensive spatially and temporally resolved proteotype analysis of the dynamic surfaceome reorganization during synapse formation is currently lacking. We performed a surfaceome focused quantitative and spatiotemporal proteotype analysis using autoCSC in primary neuronal cultures to a depth of around 1000 surface proteins. Spatiotemporal surfaceome data analysis reveals that total protein abundance modulates the neuronal surfaceome on a broad scale over a long period of time, whereas changes in surface trafficking are more pronounced at smaller time scales during the developmental process of synapse formation. The uncoupling of surface and total abundance changes has direct functional implications as shown in the context of synaptic vesicle transport. To demonstrate the utility of our approach we analyzed the surfaceome modulation in response to homeostatic synaptic scaling and found dynamic remodelling of the neuronal surface, which was largely independent of global protein abundance. Finally, we present a quantitative analysis of the neuronal surface during early-phase chemical LTP and reveal fast externalization of diverse surface proteins, potentially mediating the dependency of LTP on exocytosis. Our resource and finding of organizational principles complement discovery-driven system-wide approaches used for modeling of developmental synaptic processes with spatiotemporal resolved data on the proteotype level.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The effect of overnight consolidation in the perceptual learning of non-native tonal contrasts</title>

	<description>Sleep-mediated overnight consolidation was found to facilitate perceptual learning by promoting learners' generalization across talkers in their perception of novel segmental categories. Lexical tone differs from most segmental contrasts in that it is highly variable across talkers, and displays dynamic change over time. It remains unclear whether a similar (or a larger) effect of overnight consolidation would be found for perceptual learning of novel tonal contrasts. Thus, this study aims to examine whether overnight consolidation facilitates generalization across talkers in the discrimination and identification of novel Cantonese level tones by Mandarin listeners. Two groups of Mandarin listeners were perceptually trained either in the morning or in the evening. Listeners were trained in a tone identification (ID) task using stimuli produced by a trained talker. Their development was then tested in the ID and AX discrimination tasks using stimuli produced by trained and untrained talkers in three posttests following training: immediately after training, 12-hour delay, and 24-hour delay. While the evening group slept between the first and second posttests, the morning group did not. The results of accuracy rates in the ID task showed that while Mandarin listeners trained in the evening showed an improved trend, predicted by their individual sleep time, in identifying the level tones produced by both the trained and untrained talkers, Mandarin listeners trained in the morning showed a declining trend. In contrast, the results of d-prime scores in the AX discrimination task did not show different developmental patterns between the two groups. Consistent with previous studies on segmental learning, the finding suggests that overnight consolidation might have assisted the evening trainees' formation of a more abstract (talker-independent) representation of novel tone categories in memory traces. The results are discussed regarding the features of lexical tones to shed light on the mechanism of phonetic learning.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Low rank mechanisms underlying flexible visual representations</title>

	<description>Neuronal population responses to sensory stimuli are remarkably flexible. The responses of neurons in visual cortex depend on stimulus properties (e.g. contrast), processes that affect all stages of visual processing (e.g. adaptation), and cognitive processes (e.g attention or task switching). The effects of all of these processes on trial-averaged responses of individual neurons are well-described by divisive normalization, in which responses are scaled by the total stimulus drive. Normalization describes how a staggering variety of sensory, cognitive, and motor processes affect individual neurons (Carandini and Heeger, 2012), but whether different normalization processes could be mediated by the same mechanism remains poorly understood. We and others recently showed that attention has low rank effects on the covariability of populations of neurons in visual area V4 (Rabinowitz et al., 2015; Ecker et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019), which strongly constrains mechanistic models mechanism (Huang et al., 2019). We hypothesized that measuring changes in population covariability associated with other normalization processes could clarify whether they might share a mechanism. Our experimental design included measurements in multiple visual areas using four normalization processes. We found that contrast, adaptation, attention, and task switching affect the responses of populations of neurons in primate visual cortex in a similarly low rank way. These results suggest that a given circuit uses a common mechanism to perform many forms of normalization and likely reflect a general principle that applies to a wide range of brain areas and sensory, cognitive, or motor processes.</description>

	<description>Neurogenesis is a multistep process by which progenitor cells become terminally differentiated neurons. Adult neurogenesis has gathered increasing interest with the aim of developing new cell-based treatments for neurodegenerative diseases in humans. Active sites of adult neurogenesis exist from fish to mammals, although in the adult mammalian brain the number and extension of neurogenic areas is considerably reduced in comparison to non-mammalian vertebrates, and they become mostly reduced to the telencephalon. Much of our understanding in this field is based in studies on mammals and zebrafish, a modern bony fish. The use of the cartilaginous fish Scyliorhinus canicula (representative of basal gnathostomes) as a model expands the comparative framework to a species that shows highly neurogenic activity in the adult brain. In this work, we studied the proliferation pattern in the telencephalon of juvenile and adult specimens of S. canicula by using antibodies against the proliferation marker PCNA. We have characterized proliferating niches by using stem cell markers (Sox2), glial markers (GFAP, BLBP and GS), intermediate progenitor cell markers (Dlx2 and Tbr2) and markers for migrating neuroblasts (DCX). Based in the expression pattern of these markers, we demonstrate the existence of different cell subtypes within the PCNA immunoreactive zones including non-glial stem cells, glial progenitors, intermediate progenitor-like cells and migratory neuroblasts, which were widely distributed in the ventricular zone of the pallium, suggesting that the main progenitor types that constitute the neurogenic niche in mammals are already present in cartilaginous fishes.</description>

	<description>Modern control theory highlights strategies that consider a range of factors, such as errors caused by environmental disturbances or inaccurate estimates of body or environmental dynamics. Here we reveal similar diversity in how humans naturally adapt and control their arm movements. We divided participants into groups based on how well they adapted to interaction loads during a single session of reaching movements. This classification revealed differences in how participants controlled their movements and responded to mechanical perturbations. Interestingly, variation in behaviour across good and partial adapters resembled simulations from stochastic and robust optimal feedback control, respectively, where the latter minimizes the effect of disturbances, including those introduced by inaccurate internal models of movement dynamics. In a second experiment, we varied the interaction loads over short time periods making it difficult to adapt. Under these conditions, participants who otherwise adapted well altered their behaviour and more closely resembled those using a robust control strategy. Taken together, the results suggest the diversity of how humans control and adapt their arm movements may reflect the accuracy of (or confidence in) their internal models. Our findings may open novel perspectives for interpreting motor behaviour in uncertain environments, or when neurologic dysfunction compromises motor adaptation.</description>

	<description>Rodents can successfully learn multiple, novel stimulus-response associations after only a few repetitions when the contingencies predict reward. The circuits modified during such reinforcement learning to support decision making are not known, but the olfactory tubercle (OT) and posterior piriform cortex (pPC) are candidates for decoding reward category from olfactory sensory input and relaying this information to cognitive and motor areas. Here, we show that an explicit representation for reward category emerges in the OT within minutes of learning a novel odor-reward association, whereas the pPC lacks an explicit representation even after weeks of overtraining. The explicit reward category representation in OT is visible in the first sniff (50-100ms) of an odor on each trial, and precedes the motor action. Together, these results suggest that coding of stimulus information required for reward prediction does not occur within olfactory cortex, but rather in circuits involving the olfactory striatum.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Exploration-related strategy mediates negative coupling between decision-making performance and psychiatric symptoms</title>

	<description>Various psychiatric symptoms are often accompanied by impairments in decision-making. Given the high comorbidity of psychiatric disorders, symptoms that specifically couple with the impairment remain unidentified. The computations involved in decision-making that mediate the coupling are also elusive. Here, we conducted an online experiment with healthy individuals (n=939), participating in a decision-making task and completing questionnaires about psychiatric symptoms. The questionnaire data identified two dimensions underlying various symptoms: the first is mainly associated with obsessive-compulsive traits whereas the second is associated with depression and anxiety. Furthermore, by model-based analysis, we found only the first dimension was negatively correlated with the overall performance of the decision-making task, and the negative correlation was mediated by choice stochasticity (random exploration) and propensity to choose options previously unchosen. Given that the preference for previously unchosen options can reflect uncertainty-driven exploration, our findings highlight a key role of exploration-related strategies in psychiatric deficits of decision-making.</description>

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/730234v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/730234v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Using fMRI and multivariate pattern analysis, we determined whether acoustic features are represented by independent or integrated neural codes in human cortex. Male and female listeners heard band-pass noise varying simultaneously in spectral (frequency) and temporal (amplitude-modulation [AM] rate) features. In the superior temporal plane, changes in multivoxel activity due to frequency were largely invariant with respect to AM rate (and vice versa), consistent with an independent representation. In contrast, in posterior parietal cortex, neural representation was exclusively integrated and tuned to specific conjunctions of frequency and AM features. Direct between-region comparisons show that whereas independent coding of frequency and AM weakened with increasing levels of the hierarchy, integrated coding strengthened at the transition between non-core and parietal cortex. Our findings support the notion that primary auditory cortex can represent component acoustic features in an independent fashion and suggest a role for parietal cortex in feature integration and the structuring of acoustic input.</description>

	<description>Water intake is regulated by neocortical top-down circuits, but their identity and the cellular mechanisms involved are scantly known. Here, we show that endogenous activation of type-1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1) promotes water intake and that endocannabinoid modulation of excitatory projections from the anterior cingulate cortex to the basolateral amygdala is sufficient to guarantee physiological drinking. These data reveal a new circuit involved in the homeostatic control of water intake.</description>

	<description>Schizophrenia is a highly heritable disorder with considerable phenotypic heterogeneity. Hallmark psychotic symptoms can be considered as existing on a continuum from non-clinical to clinical populations. Assessing genetic risk and psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) in non-clinical populations and their associated neurobiological underpinnings can offer valuable insights into symptom-associated brain mechanisms without the potential confounds of the effects of schizophrenia and its treatment. We leveraged a large population-based cohort (UKBiobank) including information on PLEs, polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia (szPGRS) and multi-modal brain imaging in combination with network neuroscience. Morphometric (cortical thickness, volume) and water diffusion (fractional anisotropy) properties of the regions and pathways belonging to the salience, default-mode and central-executive networks were computed. We hypothesized that these anatomical concomitants of functional dysconnectivity would be negatively associated with szPGRS and PLEs. SzPGRS was associated with a latent measure of cortical thickness across the salience network (r = -0.069, p = 0.010) and with the right insular cortex ({beta} = -0.046, pFDR = 0.050). Moreover, PLEs showed a number of significant positive and negative associations with morphometric properties of the salience and default mode networks (pFDR &amp;lt; 0.050); with the cortical thickness of the insula largely mediating the relationship between szPGRS and unusual voices. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that higher genetic liability for schizophrenia is related to subtle disruptions in brain structure and predisposes to PLEs even among healthy participants. In addition, our study suggests that networks engaged during auditory verbal hallucinations show structural associations with PLEs in the general population.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: MisMatch Negativity-study showing pre-lexical sensitivity to both primary Final Accent and secondary Initial Accent in French</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/727776v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/727776v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In French, accentuation is not lexically distinctive and tightly intertwined with intonation. This has led to the language being described of as 'a language without accent' and to French listeners being alleged 'deaf to stress'. However, if one considers Di Cristo's model in which the metrical structure of speech plays a central role, it becomes possible to envision stress templates underlying the cognitive representation of words. This event-related potential (ERP) study examined whether French listeners are sensitive to the French primary final accent (FA) and secondary initial accent (IA), and whether the accents are part of the French phonologically expected stress pattern. Two oddball studies were carried out. In the first study, in one condition, deviants were presented without (-FA) and standards with final accent (+FA), while in another condition, these positions were switched. We obtained asymmetric MMN waveforms, such that deviants -FA elicited a larger MMN than deviants +FA (which did not elicit an MMN), pointing toward a preference for stress patterns with FA. Additionally, the difference waveforms between identical stimuli in different positions within the oddball paradigms indicated -FA stimuli to be disfavored whether they were the deviants or the standards. In the second study, standards were always presented with both the initial and final accent, while deviants were presented either without final accent (-FA) or without initial accent (-IA). Here, we obtained MMNs both to deviants -FA and to deviants -IA, although -FA deviants elicited a more ample MMN. Nevertheless, the results show that French listeners are not deaf to the initial and final accents, pointing instead to an abstract phonological representation for both accents. In sum, the results argue against the notion of stress deafness for French and instead suggest accentuation to play a more important role in French speech comprehension than is currently acknowledged.</description>

	<description>The scientific basis of intracranial aneurysm (IA) formation, its rupture and further development of cerebral vasospasm remains incompletely understood. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying these events will lead to identification of early detection biomarkers and in turn, improved treatment outcomes. Aberrant protein expression may drive structural alterations of vasculature found in IA. To unravel these aberrations, we performed untargeted, global, quantitative proteomic analysis of aneurysm tissue and serum from patients with IA. Samples were derived from patients of three clinical sub groups- 1) unruptured aneurysm 2) ruptured aneurysm without vasospasm 3) ruptured aneurysm who developed vasospasm. A total of 937 and 294 proteins were identified in aneurysm tissue and serum samples respectively. Several proteins that are known to maintain the structural integrity of vasculature were found to be dysregulated. ORM1, a glycoprotein, was significantly upregulated in both the aneurysm tissue and serum samples of unruptured IA patients. We employed a larger cohort of patients and validated ORM1 as a potential biomarker for screening of unruptured aneurysm using ELISA. Samples from ruptured aneurysm with vasospasm showed significant upregulation of MMP9 as compared to ruptured aneurysm without vasospasm. Using a cohort of ruptured aneurysm patients with and without vasospasm, we validated MMP9 as a potential biomarker for vasospasm. This study reveals pathophysiology underlying different clinical sub groups of IA and also suggests potential biomarkers.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Arrhythmia mechanisms and spontaneous calcium release: Bi-directional coupling between re-entrant and focal excitation</title>

Spontaneous sub-cellular calcium release events (SCRE) are conjectured to promote rapid arrhythmias associated with conditions such as heart failure and atrial fibrillation: they can underlie the emergence of spontaneous action potentials in single cells which can lead to arrhythmogenic triggers in tissue. The multi-scale mechanisms of the development of SCRE into arrhythmia triggers, and their dynamic interaction with the tissue substrate, remain elusive; rigorous and simultaneous study of dynamics from the nanometre to the centimetre scale is a major challenge. The aim of this study was to develop a computational approach to overcome this challenge and study potential bi-directional coupling between sub-cellular and tissue-scale arrhythmia phenomena. A framework comprising a hierarchy of computational models was developed, which includes detailed single-cell models describing spatio-temporal calcium dynamics in 3D, efficient non-spatial cell models, and both idealised and realistic tissue models. A phenomenological approach was implemented to reproduce SCRE morphology and variability in the efficient cell models, comprising the definition of analytical Spontaneous Release Functions (SRF) whose parameters may be randomly sampled from appropriate distributions in order to match either the 3D cell models or experimental data. Pro-arrhythmogenic pacing protocols were applied to initiate re-entry and promote calcium overload, leading to the emergence of SCRE. The SRF accurately reproduced the dynamics of SCRE and its dependence on environment variables under multiple different conditions. Sustained re-entrant excitation promoted calcium overload, and led to the emergence of focal excitations after termination. A purely functional mechanism of re-entry and focal activity localisation was demonstrated, related to the unexcited spiral wave core. In conclusion, a novel approach has been developed to dynamically model SCRE at the tissue scale, which facilitates novel, detailed multi-scale mechanistic analysis. It was revealed that complex re-entrant excitation patterns and SCRE may be bi-directionally coupled, promoting novel mechanisms of arrhythmia perpetuation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3M0-4_0aT3Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Directed migration shapes cooperation in spatial ecological public goods games</title>

From the microscopic to the macroscopic level, biological life exhibits directed migration in response to environmental conditions. Chemotaxis enables microbes to sense and move towards nutrient-rich regions or to avoid toxic ones. Socio-economic factors drive human populations from rural to urban areas. The effect of collective movement is especially significant when triggered in response to the generation of public goods. Microbial communities can, for instance, alter their environment through the secretion of extracellular substances. Some substances provide antibiotic-resistance, others provide access to nutrients or promote motility. However, in all cases the maintenance of public goods requires costly cooperation and is consequently susceptible to exploitation. The threat of exploitation becomes even more acute with motile individuals because defectors can avoid the consequences of their cheating. Here, we propose a model to investigate the effects of targeted migration and analyze the interplay between social conflicts and migration in ecological public goods. In particular, individuals can locate attractive regions by moving towards higher cooperator densities or avoid unattractive regions by moving away from defectors. Both migration patterns not only shape an individual’s immediate environment but also affects the entire population. For example, defectors hunting cooperators have a homogenizing effect on population densities. This limits the production of the public good and hence inhibits the growth of the population. In contrast, aggregating cooperators promote the spontaneous formation of patterns through heterogeneous density distributions. The positive feedback between cooperator aggregation and public goods production, however, poses analytical and numerical challenges due to its tendency to develop discontinuous distributions. Thus, different modes of directed migration bear the potential to enhance or inhibit the emergence of complex and sometimes dynamic spatial arrangements. Interestingly, whenever patterns emerge, cooperation is promoted, on average, population densities rise, and the risk of extinction is reduced.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hiilMIqWD-c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is known to be an effective treatment for a variety of neurological disorders, including Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor (ET). At present, it involves administering a train of pulses with constant frequency via electrodes implanted into the brain. New ‘closed-loop’ approaches involve delivering stimulation according to the ongoing symptoms or brain activity and have the potential to provide improvements in terms of efficiency, efficacy and reduction of side effects. The success of closed-loop DBS depends on being able to devise a stimulation strategy that minimizes oscillations in neural activity associated with symptoms of motor disorders. A useful stepping stone towards this is to construct a mathematical model, which can describe how the brain oscillations should change when stimulation is applied at a particular state of the system. Our work focuses on the use of coupled oscillators to represent neurons in areas generating pathological oscillations. Using a reduced form of the Kuramoto model, we analyse how a patient should respond to stimulation when neural oscillations have a given phase and amplitude, provided a number of conditions are satisfied. For such patients, we predict that the best stimulation strategy should be phase specific but also that stimulation should have a greater effect if applied when the amplitude of brain oscillations is lower. We compare this surprising prediction with data obtained from ET patients. In light of our predictions, we also propose a new hybrid strategy which effectively combines two of the closed-loop strategies found in the literature, namely phase-locked and adaptive DBS.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Jm---ynrOEA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In the resting state, heartbeats evoke cortical responses called heartbeat-evoked responses (HERs), which reflect cortical cardiac interoceptive processing. While previous studies have reported that the heartbeat evokes cortical responses at a regional level, whether the heartbeat induces synchronization between regions to form a network structure remains unknown. Using resting-state MEG data from 85 human subjects of both genders, we first showed that heartbeat increases the phase synchronization between cortical regions in the theta frequency but not in other frequency bands. This increase in synchronization between cortical regions formed a network structure called the heartbeat-induced network (HIN), which did not reflect artificial phase synchronization. In the HIN, the left inferior temporal gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus played a central role as hubs. Furthermore, the HIN was modularized, containing five subnetworks called modules. In particular, module 1 played a central role in between-module interactions in the HIN. Furthermore, synchronization within module 1 had a positive association with the mood of an individual. In this study, we show the existence of the HIN and its network properties, advancing the current understanding of cortical heartbeat processing and its relationship with mood, which was previously confined to region level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Approach-avoidance conflict arises when the drives to pursue reward and avoid harm are incompatible. Previous neuroimaging studies of approach-avoidance conflict have shown large variability in reported neuroanatomical correlates. These prior studies have generally neglected to account for potential sources of variability, such as individual differences in choice preferences and modeling of hemodynamic response during conflict. In the present study, we controlled for these limitations using a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM). This enabled us to measure participant-specific per-trial estimates of conflict during an approach-avoidance task. We also employed a variable epoch method to identify brain structures specifically sensitive to conflict. In a sample of 28 human participants, we found that only a limited set of brain structures [inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and right pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA)] are specifically correlated with approach-avoidance conflict. These findings suggest that controlling for previous sources of variability increases the specificity of the neuroanatomical correlates of approach-avoidance conflict.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The ability to recognize and identify a smell is highly dependent on multisensory context and expectation, for example, hearing the name of the odor source. Here, we develop a novel auditory-odor association task in rats, wherein the animal learns that a specific auditory tone, when associated with a specific odor, predicts reward (Go signal), whereas the same tone associated with a different odor, or vice versa, is not (No-Go signal). The tone occurs prior to the onset of the odor, allowing physiological analyses of sensory-evoked local field potential (LFP) activity to each stimulus in primary auditory cortex and anterior piriform cortex (aPCX). In trained animals that have acquired the task, both auditory and subsequent olfactory cues activate β band oscillations in both the auditory cortex and PCX, suggesting multisensory integration. Naive animals show no such multisensory responses, suggesting the response is learned. In addition to the learned multisensory evoked responses, functional connectivity between auditory cortex and PCX, as assessed with spectral coherence and phase lag index (PLI), is enhanced. Importantly, both the multi-sensory evoked responses and the functional connectivity are context-dependent. In trained animals, the same auditory stimuli presented in the home cage evoke no responses in auditory cortex or PCX, and functional connectivity between the sensory cortices is reduced. Together, the results demonstrate how learning and context shape the expression of multisensory cortical processing. Given that odor identification impairment is associated with preclinical dementia in humans, the mechanisms suggested here may help develop experimental models to assess effects of neuropathology on behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: GPR88 in D1R-Type and D2R-Type Medium Spiny Neurons Differentially Regulates Affective and Motor Behavior</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The orphan receptor GPR88 is highly expressed in D1 receptor (D1R)- and D2R-medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and has been associated to striatum-dependent functions in rodents. The total deletion of &lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; in mice was shown to decrease anxiety-like behaviors, increase stereotypies and locomotion, and impair motor coordination and motor learning. Knowing the opposing role of D1R- and D2R-MSNs, we here investigated the respective roles of GPR88 in the two MSN subtypes for these behaviors. To do so, we compared effects of a conditional &lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; gene knock-out (KO) in D1R-MSNs (D1R-&lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; mice) or D2R-MSNs (A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R-&lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; mice) with effects of the total &lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; KO (CMV-&lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; mice). Overall, most phenotypes of CMV-&lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; mice were recapitulated in A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R-&lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; mice, including reduced marble burying, increased social interactions, increased locomotor activity and stereotypies in the open field, and reduced motor coordination in the rotarod. Exceptions were the reduced habituation to the open field and reduced motor skill learning, which were observed in CMV-&lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; and D1R-&lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; mice, but not in A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R-&lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; mice. D1R-&lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; mice otherwise showed no other phenotype in this study. Our data together show that GPR88 modulates the function of both D1R- and D2R-MSNs, and that GPR88 activity in these two neuron populations has very different and dissociable impacts on behavior. We suggest that GPR88 in D2R-MSNs shapes defensive and social behavior and contributes in maintaining the inhibition of basal ganglia outputs to control locomotion, stereotypies and motor coordination, while GPR88 in D1R-MSNs promotes novelty habituation and motor learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A critical aspect of behavior is that mobile organisms must be able to precisely determine where and when to move. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying precise movement timing and action planning is therefore crucial to understanding how we interact with the world around us. Recent evidence suggest that our experience of time is directly and intrinsically computed within the motor system, consistent with the theory of embodied cognition. In order to investigate the role of the motor system, we tested human subjects (n=40) on a novel task combining reaching and time estimation. In this task, subjects were required to move a robotic manipulandum to one of two physical locations to categorize a concurrently timed suprasecond. Critically, subjects were divided into two groups: one in which movement during the interval was unrestricted and one in which they were restricted from moving until the stimulus interval had elapsed. Our results revealed a higher degree of precision for subjects in the free-moving group. A further experiment (n=14) verified that these findings were not due to proximity to the target, counting strategies, bias, or movement length. A final experiment (n=10) replicated these findings using a within-subjects design, performing a time reproduction task, in which movement during encoding of the interval led to more precise performance. Our findings suggest that time estimation may be instantiated within the motor system as an ongoing readout of timing judgment and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Perception is inherently a noisy process, wherein the nervous system must find a tradeoff between measurement noise, bias, distractions, and expectations. Recent evidence has begun to demonstrate that our perceptions and sensations are influenced by motor movements and actions. One area where this is of particular importance is the perception of time. Recent work has shown that our temporal perception fluidly changes with the length of our movements. Further, there is also evidence suggesting that movement not only biases perceived time, but can enhance it, suggesting the motor system directly influences temporal perception. We here show that when subjects are free to move during the timing of an auditory interval, the representation of that interval is enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Connectomic Profiling Identifies Responders to Vagus Nerve Stimulation</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a common treatment for medically‐intractable epilepsy, but response rates are highly variable with no pre‐operative means of identifying good candidates. This study aimed to predict VNS response using structural and functional connectomic profiling.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty‐six children, comprising Discovery (N = 38) and Validation (N = 18) Cohorts, were recruited from three separate institutions. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to identify group differences in white‐matter microstructure, which in turn informed beamforming of resting‐state magnetoencephalography recordings. The results were used to generate a support vector machine learning classifier, which was independently validated. This algorithm was compared to a second classifier generated using 31 clinical covariates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment responders demonstrated greater fractional anisotropy in left thalamocortical, limbic, and association fibres, as well as greater connectivity in a functional network encompassing left thalamic, insular, and temporal nodes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). The resulting classifier demonstrated 89.5% accuracy and area under the ROC curve of 0.93 on 10‐fold cross‐validation. In the external Validation Cohort, this model demonstrated an accuracy of 83.3% with a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 75.0%. This was significantly superior to predictions using clinical covariates alone, which exhibited an area under the ROC curve of 0.57 (&lt;i&gt;p &amp;lt;&lt;/i&gt; 0.008).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides the first multi‐institutional, multi‐modal connectomic prediction algorithm for VNS, and provides new insights into its mechanism of action. Reliable identification of VNS responders is critical to mitigate surgical risks for children who may not benefit, and to ensure cost‐effective allocation of healthcare resources.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Exogenous Galactosylceramide as Potential Treatment for CLN3 Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25573?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLN3 disease is the commonest form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), a group of pediatric neurodegenerative disorders. Functions of the CLN3 protein (CLN3p) include anti‐apoptotic properties, and, facilitating anterograde transport of galactosylceramide from Golgi to lipids rafts. This study confirms the beneficial effects of long‐term exogenous galactosylceramide supplementation on longevity, neurobehavioral parameters, neuronal cell counts, astrogliosis, and diminution in brain and serum ceramide levels in &lt;i&gt;Cln3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Δex7/8&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; knock‐in mice. Additionally, the impact of galactosylceramide on ceramide synthesis enzymes is documented.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of 72 mice received galactosylceramide or vehicle for 40 weeks. The effect of galactosylceramide supplementation on &lt;i&gt;Cln3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Δex7/8&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mice was determined by performing behavioral tests, measuring ceramide in brains and serum, assessing impact on longevity, subunit C storage, astrogliosis and neuronal cell counts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galactosylceramide resulted in enhanced grip strength of forelimbs in male and female mice, better balance on the accelerating rotarod in females and improved motor coordination during pole climbing of male mice. Brain and serum ceramide levels, as well as apoptosis rates were lower in galactosylceramide‐treated &lt;i&gt;Cln3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Δex7/8&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Galatosylceramide also increased neuronal cell counts significantly in male and female mice and tended to decrease subunit C storage in specific brain regions. Astrogliosis dropped in females compared to a slight increase in males after galactosylceramide. and, galactosylceramide increased lifespan of affected mice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galactosylceramide improved behavioral, neuropathological and biochemical parameters in &lt;i&gt;Cln3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Δex7/8&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mice paving the way for effective therapy for CLN3 disease and use of serum ceramide as a potential biomarker to track impact of therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Paradoxical effects of optogenetic stimulation in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25572?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25572?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To establish the effects induced by long‐term, unilateral stimulation of parvalbumin‐positive (PV) interneurons on seizures, interictal spikes and high‐frequency oscillations (80‐500 Hz) occurring after pilocarpine‐induced &lt;i&gt;status epilepticus&lt;/i&gt; (SE) ‐ a proven model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) ‐ in transgenic mice expressing or not expressing ChR2.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PV‐ChR2 (n = 6) and PV‐Cre (n = 6) mice were treated with pilocarpine to induce SE. Three hours after SE onset, unilateral optogenetic stimulation (450 nm, 25 mW, 20 ms pulses delivered at 8 Hz for 30 s every 2 min) of CA3 PV‐positive interneurons was implemented for 14 continuous days in both groups.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rates of seizures (p &amp;lt; 0.01), interictal spikes (p &amp;lt; 0.001) and interictal spikes with fast ripples (250‐500 Hz) (p &amp;lt; 0.001) were lower in PV‐ChR2 than in PV‐Cre mice. Ripples (80‐200 Hz) occurring outside of interictal spikes had higher rates in the PV‐ChR2 group (p &amp;lt; 0.01) while isolated fast ripples had lower rates (p &amp;lt; 0.01). However, seizure probability was higher during optogenetic stimulation in PV‐ChR2 compared to PV‐Cre animals (p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings show that the unilateral activation of CA3 PV‐positive interneurons exerts anti‐ictogenic effects associated with decreased rates of interictal spikes and fast ripples in this MTLE model. However, PV‐positive interneuron stimulation can paradoxically trigger seizures in epileptic animals, supporting the notion that GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; signaling can also initiate ictogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers within the Human Brain Project and related projects have in the
last couple of years expanded their needs for high-performance computing
infrastructures. The needs arise from a diverse set of science challenges that
range from large-scale simulations of brain models to processing of
extreme-scale experimental data sets. The ICEI project, which is in the process
of creating a distributed infrastructure optimised for brain research, started
to build-up a set of benchmarks that reflect the diversity of applications in
this field. In this paper we analyse the performance of some selected
benchmarks on an IBM POWER8 and Intel Skylake based systems with and without
GPUs.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Sex differences in predicting fluid intelligence of adolescent brain from T1-weighted MRIs. (arXiv:1908.02333v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02333</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fluid intelligence (Gf) has been defined as the ability to reason and solve
previously unseen problems. Links to Gf have been found in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) sequences such as functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging. As
part of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Neurocognitive Prediction
Challenge 2019, we sought to predict Gf in children aged 9-10 from T1-weighted
(T1W) MRIs. The data included atlas-aligned volumetric T1W images,
atlas-defined segmented regions, age, and sex for 3739 subjects used for
training and internal validation and 415 subjects used for external validation.
We trained sex-specific convolutional neural net (CNN) and random forest models
to predict Gf. For the convolutional model, skull-stripped volumetric T1W
images aligned to the SRI24 brain atlas were used for training. Volumes of
segmented atlas regions along with each subject's age were used to train the
random forest regressor models. Performance was measured using the mean squared
error (MSE) of the predictions. Random forest models achieved lower MSEs than
CNNs. Further, the external validation data had a better MSE for females than
males (60.68 vs. 80.74), with a combined MSE of 70.83. Our results suggest that
predictive models of Gf from volumetric T1W MRI features alone may perform
better when trained separately on male and female data. However, the
performance of our models indicates that more information is necessary beyond
the available data to make accurate predictions of Gf.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce TempoCave, a novel visualization application for analyzing
dynamic brain networks, or connectomes. TempoCave provides a range of
functionality to explore metrics related to the activity patterns and modular
affiliations of different regions in the brain. These patterns are calculated
by processing raw data retrieved functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
scans, which creates a network of weighted edges between each brain region,
where the weight indicates how likely these regions are to activate
synchronously. In particular, we support the analysis needs of clinical
psychologists, who examine these modular affiliations and weighted edges and
their temporal dynamics, utilizing them to understand relationships between
neurological disorders and brain activity, which could have a significant
impact on the way in which patients are diagnosed and treated. We summarize the
core functionality of TempoCave, which supports a range of comparative tasks,
and runs both in a desktop mode and in an immersive mode. Furthermore, we
present a real-world use case that analyzes pre- and post-treatment connectome
datasets from 27 subjects in a clinical study investigating the use of
cognitive behavior therapy to treat major depression disorder, indicating that
TempoCave can provide new insight into the dynamic behavior of the human brain.

	<description>Depression is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with a high rate of relapse and low rate of response to antidepressant treatment. However, there is a dearth of new drugs, attributed to our incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in its etiopathology. Chronic stress appears to be one of the foremost underlying causes of depression. Using various animal models, efforts in the past decade has implicated epigenetic mechanisms in mediating the negative effects of chronic stressful events on the progression/manifestation of depression and other co-morbid neuropsychiatric disorders. However, non-coding RNAs, another layer of epigenetic regulation is relatively lesser studied in this context. Here, using the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)-induced depression model, we aimed to uncover dysregulation in miRNA-mRNA networks in the neurogenic dentate gyrus (DG) region of  male C57BL/6 mice. Among several dysregulated miRNAs, identified via miRNA arrays, the most striking finding was attenuated expression of miRNAs of the miR-30 family in stressed/defeated mice. To investigate miRNAs in the DG-resident neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs), we used the in vitro neurosphere culture, where proliferating NSCs/NPCs were subjected to differentiation. Among several differentially exprerssed miRNAs, we observed an upregulation of miR-30 miRNAs upon differentiation. To search for the gene targets of these miRNAs, we performed gene arrays followed by bioinformatics analysis, miRNA manipulations and luciferase assays. Our results suggest that miR-30 miRNAs mediate chronic stress-induced depression by altering hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroplasticity via controlling the epigenetic/transcription regulators such as Mll3 and Runx1 and cell signaling regulators like Socs3, Ppp3r1, Gpr125, and Nrp1.</description>

	<description>Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), also known as NG2 glia, arise from neural progenitor cells in the embryonic ganglionic eminences that also generate inhibitory neurons. They are ubiquitously distributed in the central nervous system, remain proliferative through life, and generate oligodendrocytes in both gray and white matter. OPCs exhibit some lineage plasticity, and attempts have been made to reprogram them into neurons, with varying degrees of success. However, little is known about how epigenetic mechanisms affect the ability of OPCs to undergo fate switch and whether OPCs have a unique chromatin environment around neuronal genes that might contribute to their lineage plasticity. Our bioinformatic analysis of histone posttranslational modifications at interneuron genes in OPCs revealed that OPCs had significantly fewer bivalent and repressive histone marks at interneuron genes compared to astrocytes or fibroblasts. Conversely, OPCs had a greater degree of deposition active histone modifications at bivalently marked interneuron genes than other cell types, and this was correlated with higher expression levels of these genes in OPCs. Furthermore, a significantly higher proportion of interneuron genes in OPCs than in other cell types lacked the histone posttranslational modifications examined. These genes had a moderately high level of expression, suggesting that the “no mark” interneuron genes could be in a transcriptionally “poised” or “transitional” state. Thus, our findings suggest that OPCs have a unique histone code at their interneuron genes that may obviate the need for erasure of repressive marks during their fate switch to inhibitory neurons.</description>

	<description>Progressive neurological deterioration poses enormous burden on the aging population with ischemic stroke and neurodegenerative disease patients, such as Alzheimers’ disease and Parkinson’s disease. The past two decades have witnessed remarkable advances in the research of neurovascular unit dysfunction, which is emerging as an important pathological feature that underlies these neurological disorders. Dysfunction of the unit allows penetration of blood-derived toxic proteins or leukocytes into the brain and contributes to white matter injury, disturbed neurovascular coupling and neuroinflammation, which all eventually lead to cognitive dysfunction. Recent evidences suggest that aging-related oxidative stress, accumulated DNA damage and impaired DNA repair capacities compromises the genome integrity not only in neurons, but also in other cell types of the neurovascular unit, such as endothelial cells, astrocytes and pericytes. Combating DNA damage or enhancing DNA repair capacities in the neurovascular unit represents a promising therapeutic strategy for vascular and neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we focus on aging related mechanisms that underlie DNA damage and repair in the neurovascular unit and introduce several novel strategies that target the genome integrity in the neurovascular unit to combat the vascular and neurodegenerative disorders in the aging brain.</description>

	<description>Background: Flow states are considered a positive, subjective experience during an optimal balance between skills and task demands. Previously, experimentally induced flow experiences have relied solely on adaptive tasks.
Objective: To investigate whether cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) area and anodal tDCS over the right parietal cortex area during video game play will promote an increased experience of flow states. 
Methods: Two studies had participants play Tetris or first-person shooter (FPS) video games while receiving either real tDCS or sham stimulation. Tetris recruited nineteen untrained players who infrequently played video games while the ten FPS participants played FPS frequently. Flow experience was assessed before and after stimulation.
Results: Compared to sham stimulation, real stimulation increased flow experience for both untrained Tetris and trained FPS players. No ceiling effects were noticed between trained and untrained groups.
Conclusion: Cathodal and anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC and right parietal areas respectively may encourage flow experiences in complex real-life motor tasks that occur during sports, games and everyday life.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Detrended Fluctuation, Coherence, and Spectral Power Analysis of Activation Rearrangement in EEG Dynamics During Cognitive Workload</title>

	<description>In the study of human cognitive activity using electroencephalogram (EEG), the brain dynamics parameters and characteristics play a crucial role. They allow to investigate the changes in functionality depending on the environment and task performance process, and also to access the intensity of the brain activity in various locations of the cortex and its dependencies. Usually, the dynamics of activation of different brain areas during the cognitive tasks are being studied by spectral analysis based on power spectral density (PSD) estimation, and coherence analysis, which are de facto standard tools in quantitative characterization of brain activity. PSD and coherence reflect the strength of oscillations and similarity of the emergence of these oscillations in the brain, respectively, while the concept of stability of brain activity over time is not well defined and less formalized.   
We propose to employ the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) as a measure of the EEG persistence over time, and use the DFA scaling exponent as its quantitative characteristics. We applied DFA to the study of the changes in activation in brain dynamics during mental calculations and united it with PSD and coherence estimation. In the experiment, EEGs during resting state and mental serial subtraction from 36 subjects were recorded and analyzed in four frequency ranges: θ1 (4.1 - 5.8 Hz), θ2 (5.9 - 7.4 Hz), β1 (13 - 19.9 Hz), and β2 (20 - 25 Hz). PSD maps to access the intensity of cortex activation and coherence to quantify the connections between different brain areas were calculated, the distribution of DFA scaling exponent over the head surface was exploited to measure the time characteristics of the dynamics of brain activity.   
Obtained arrangements of DFA scaling exponent suggest that normal functioning of the brain is characterized by long-term temporal correlations in the cortex. Topographical distribution of the DFA scaling exponent was comparable for θ and β frequency bands, demonstrating the largest values of DFA scaling exponent during cognitive activation. The study shows that the long-term temporal correlations evaluated by DFA can be of great interest for diagnosis of the variety of brain dysfunctions of different etiology in future.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Origins Matter: Culture Impacts Cognitive Testing in Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>Cognitive decline is common in Parkinson’s disease (PD), and precise cognitive assessment is important for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. To date, there are no studies in PD investigating cultural bias on neuropsychological tests. Clinical practice in multicultural societies such as Toronto Canada, where nearly half of the population is comprised of first generation immigrants, presents important challenges as most neuropsychological tools were developed in Anglosphere cultures (e.g., USA, UK) and normed in more homogeneous groups. We examine total scores and rates of deficits on tests of visuoperceptual/visuospatial, attention, memory, and executive functions in Canadians with PD born in Anglosphere countries (n = 248) versus in Canadians with PD born in other regions (International group; n = 167). The International group shows lower scores and greater rates of deficits on all visuoperceptual and some executive function tasks, but not on attention or memory measures. These biases are not explained by demographic and clinical variables as groups were comparable. Age at immigration, years in Canada, and English proficiency also do not account for the observed biases. In contrast, group differences are strongly mediated by the Historical Index of Human Development of the participants’ country of birth, which reflects economic, health, and educational potential of a country at the time of birth. In sum, our findings demonstrate lasting biases on neuropsychological tests despite significant exposure to, and participation in, Canadian culture. These biases are most striking on visuoperceptual measures and non-verbal executive tasks which many clinicians still considered to be “culture-fair” despite the growing evidence from the field of cross-cultural neuropsychology to the contrary. Our findings also illustrate that socio-development context captures important aspects of culture that relate to cognition, and have important implications for clinical practice.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Pre-stimulus Brain Activity Is Associated With State-Anxiety Changes During Single-Session Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00266</guid>

	<description>Transcranial direct current stimulation is a promising neuromodulation method for treating depression. However, compared with pharmacological treatment, previous studies have reported that a relatively limited proportion of patients respond to tDCS treatment. In addition, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying tDCS treatment remain unclear, making it difficult to identify response predictors for tDCS treatment based on neurophysiological function. Because treatment effects are achieved by repetitive application of tDCS, studying the immediate effects of tDCS in depressive patients could extend understanding of its treatment mechanisms. However, immediate changes in a single session of tDCS are not well documented. Thus, in the current study, we focused on the immediate impact of tDCS and its association with pre-stimulus brain activity. 
To address this question, we applied anodal tDCS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) in 14 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 20 healthy controls, at an intensity of 1.5 mA for 20 minutes in a single session. To evaluate anxiety, the state trait anxiety inventory was completed before and after tDCS. We recorded resting electroencephalography before tDCS, and calculated electrical neuronal activity in the theta and alpha frequency bands using standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography. 
We found that, during application of left DLPFC tDCS to patients with MDD, the anxiety reduction effect of tDCS was related to higher baseline theta-band activity in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex. For DMPFC stimulation in MDD, the anxiety reduction effect was associated with lower baseline alpha-band activity in the left inferior parietal lobule. In contrast, the anxiety reduction effect was associated with greater alpha activity in the left inferior parietal lobule during left DLPFC stimulation in healthy controls, whereas it was associated with lower baseline alpha activity in the precuneus during DMPFC stimulation.
The current results suggest that the association between pre-tDCS brain activity and the anxiety reduction effect of tDCS depends on psychopathology (depressed or non-depressed) as well as the site of stimulation (DMPFC or left DLPFC). Furthermore, the results suggest that tDCS response might be predicted by baseline resting state electrophysiological neural activity.</description>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00262</link>
	<description>Abstract
Background/Aim: 
Using a within-subjects, within-wound care design, this pilot study tested for the first time, the whether immersive virtual reality (VR) can serve as an adjunctive non-opioid analgesic for children with large severe burn wounds during burn wound cleaning in the ICU, in a regional burn center in the United States. 

Methods: Participants included 48 children from 6 years old to 17 years of age with &amp;gt; 10% TBSA burn injuries reporting moderate or higher worst pain during no VR on Day 1. Forty-four of the 48 children were from developing Latin American countries. Patients played adjunctive SnowWorld, an interactive 3D snowy canyon in virtual reality during some portions of wound care, vs. No VR during comparable portions of the same wound care session (initial treatment condition randomized). Using Graphic Rating scales, children's worst pain ratings during “No VR” (treatment as usual pain medications) vs. their worst pain during “Yes VR” was measured during at least one day of wound care, and was measured for up to ten study days the patient used VR.  

Results: VR significantly reduced children’s “worst pain” ratings during burn wound cleaning procedures in the ICU on Day 1. Worst pain during No VR = 8.52 (SD = 1.75) vs. during Yes VR = 5.10 (SD = 3.27), t(47) = 7.11, p &amp;lt; .001, SD = 3.33, CI = 2.45 to 4.38, Cohen’s d = 1.21 (indicating large effect size). Patients continued to report the predicted pattern of lower pain and more fun during VR, during multiple sessions.
 
Conclusion:Immersive virtual reality can help reduce the pain of children with large severe burn wounds during burn wound cleaning in the Intensive Care Unit. . Additional research and development is recommended.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Effects of Sindbis Viral Vectors on Neuronal Function</title>

	<description>Viral vectors are attractive tools to express genes in neurons. Transduction of neurons with a recombinant, replication-deficient Sindbis viral vector is a method of choice for studying the effects of short-term protein overexpression on neuronal function. However, to which extent Sindbis by itself may affect neurons is not fully understood. We assessed effects of neuronal transduction with a Sindbis viral vector on the transcriptome and proteome in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, and analyzed the electrophysiological properties of individual CA1 neurons, at 24h and 72h after viral vector injection. Whereas Sindbis caused substantial gene expression alterations, changes at the protein level were less pronounced. Alterations in transcriptome and proteome were predominantly limited to proteins involved in mediating anti-viral innate immune responses. Sindbis transduction did not affect the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of individual neurons: the membrane potential and neuronal excitability were similar between transduced and non-transduced CA1 neurons up to 72h after Sindbis injection. Synaptic currents also remained unchanged upon Sindbis transduction, unless slices were massively infected for 72h. We conclude that Sindbis viral vectors at low transduction rates are suitable for studying short-term effects of a protein of interest on electrophysiological properties of neurons, but not for studies on the regulation of gene expression.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Time-Dependent Changes in Microglia Transcriptional Networks Following Traumatic Brain Injury</title>

	<description>The neuroinflammatory response to Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is critical to both neurotoxicity and neuroprotection and has been proposed as a potentially modifiable driver of secondary injury in animal and human studies. Attempts to broadly target immune activation have been unsuccessful in improving outcomes, in part because the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms driving injury and outcome at acute, subacute and chronic time points after TBI remain poorly defined.  Microglia play a critical role in neuroinflammation and their persistent activation may contribute to long-term functional deficits. Activated microglia are characterized by morphological transformation and transcriptomic changes associated with specific inflammatory states. We analyzed the temporal course of changes in inflammatory genes of microglia isolated from injured brains at 2, 14 and 60 days after controlled cortical impact in mice, a well-established model of focal cerebral contusion. We identified a time dependent, injury-associated change in the microglial gene expression profile toward a reduced ability to sense tissue damage, perform housekeeping, and maintain homeostasis in the early stages following injury, with recovery and transition to a specialized inflammatory state over time. This later state starts at 14 days post injury and is characterized by a biphasic pattern of IFNγ, IL-4 and IL-10 gene expression changes, with concurrent proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory gene changes. Our transcriptomic data sets are an important step to understand microglial role in TBI pathogenesis at the molecular level and identify common pathways that affect outcome. More studies to evaluate gene expression at the single cell level and focusing on subacute and chronic timepoint are warranted.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Resting State Networks in the TgF344-AD Rat Model of Alzheimer’s Disease Are Altered From Early Stages</title>

	<description>A better and non-invasive characterization of the preclinical phases of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is important to advance its diagnosis and obtain more effective benefits from potential treatments. The TgF344-AD rat model has been well characterized and shows molecular, behavioral and brain connectivity alterations that resemble the silent period of the pathology. Our aim was to longitudinally investigate functional brain connectivity in established resting-state networks (RSNs) obtained by independent component analysis (ICA) in a cohort of TgF344-AD and control rats every 3 months, from 5 to 18 months of age, to cover different stages of the disease. Before each acquisition, working memory performance was evaluated by the delayed non match-to-sample (DNMS) task.

Differences in the temporal evolution were observed between groups in the amplitude and shape of the somatosensorial and sensorimotor networks but not in the whole default mode network (DMN). Subsequent high dimensional ICA analysis showed early alterations in the anterior DMN subnetwork activity of TgF344-AD rats compared to controls. Performance of DNMS task was positively correlated with somatosensorial network at 5 months of age in the wild-type animals but not in the Tg-F344 rats. At different time points, DMN showed negative correlation with cognitive performance in the control group while in the transgenic group the correlation was positive. In addition, behavioral differences observed at 5 months of age correlated with alterations in the posterior DMN subnetwork.

We have demonstrated that functional connectivity using ICA represents a useful biomarker also in animal models of AD such as the TgF344AD rats, as it allows the identification of alterations associated with the progression of the disease, detecting differences in specific networks even at very early stages.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Influence of Cerebrospinal Fluid Abnormalities and APOE 4 on PHF-Tau Protein: Evidence From Voxel Analysis and Graph Theory</title>

	<description>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional state between the cognitive changes in normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which induces abnormalities in specific brain regions. Previous studies showed that paired helical filaments Tau (PHF-Tau) protein is a potential pathogenic protein which may cause abnormal brain function and structure in MCI and AD patients. However, the understanding of the PHF-Tau protein network in MCI patients is limited. In this study, 225 subjects with PHF-Tau PET images were divided into four groups based on whether they carried Apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE 4) or abnormal cerebrospinal fluid Total-Tau (CSF T-Tau). They are two important pathogenic factors that might cause cognitive function impairment. The four groups were: individuals harboring CSF T-Tau pathology but no APOE 4 (APOE 4-T+); APOE 4 carriers with normal CSF T-Tau (APOE 4+T-); APOE 4 carriers with abnormal CSF T-Tau (APOE 4+T+); and APOE 4 noncarriers with abnormal CSF T-Tau (APOE 4-T-). We explored the topological organization of PHF-Tau networks in these four groups and calculated five kinds of network properties: clustering coefficient, shortest path length, Q value of modularity, nodal centrality and degree. Our findings showed that compared with APOE 4-T-group, the other three groups showed different alterations in the clustering coefficient, shortest path length, Q value of modularity, nodal centrality and degree. Simultaneously, voxel level analysis was conducted and the results showed that compared with APOE 4-T- group, the other three groups were found increased PHF-Tau distribution in some brain regions. For APOE 4+T+ group, positive correlation was found between the value of PHF-Tau distribution in altered regions and Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) score. Our results indicated that the effects of APOE 4 and abnormal CSF T-Tau may induce abnormalities of PHF-Tau protein and APOE 4 has a greater impact on PHF-Tau than abnormal CSF T-Tau. Our results may be particularly helpful in uncovering the pathophysiology underlying the cognitive dysfunction in MCI patients.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Insulin Resistance Predicts Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction in Elderly Gastrointestinal Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00197</guid>

	<description>BACKGROUND: Aging population undergoing surgery are at risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Exploring effective and reliable early predictor of POCD is essential to identify high-risk patients and make prospective decisions. The purpose of this study was to examine whether preoperative insulin resistance, is an independent predictor of POCD.
METHODS: A total of 124 aged 60 years older patients for gastrointestinal surgery were enrolled in a prospective observational clinical study. All participants completed a battery of neuropsychological tests before surgery and at 7 days afterwards. POCD was defined as a decline of at least 1.5 SD on two or more of neuropsychological tests. Plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP), and S-100β protein were measured. The status of insulin resistance was assessed by Homeostasis Model Assessment–Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). The relationship between HOMA-IR and POCD was assessed by Multivariable logistic regression models and the receiver operating characteristic curve.

RESULTS: 51 patients (41.1%) were diagnosed with POCD at 7 days after surgery. Preoperative HOMA-IR values of the POCD group were significantly higher than the non-POCD group, besides, CRP and TNF-α levels of the POCD group were significantly higher at each postoperative time point (P&amp;lt;0.05). Preoperative HOMA-IR value was an independent predictor of POCD (adjusted OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.18-2.99) even after adjust for confounding variables, and when dichotomized, individuals above the HOMA-IR threshold (HOMA-IR &amp;gt;2.6) had a three time’s higher risk of POCD (OR 3.26; 95% CI 1.07–9.91) compared individuals below the threshold. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of HOMA-IR was 0.804 (95% CI, 0.725–0.883; P &amp;lt;0 .001).The optimal cutoff value was found to be 0.583, with sensitivity of 84.3% and specificity of 74%. HOMA-IR value was positively associated with TNF-α concentration at baseline (R2= 0.43, P &amp;lt; 0.01) and 1 days after surgery (R2= 0.3861, P &amp;lt; 0.01). 
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative insulin resistance is an effective predictor for the occurrence of POCD. Targeted prevention and treatment strategies of insulin resistance may be effective interventions of patients at risk for POCD.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Precursor to Glutathione (GSH), γ-Glutamylcysteine (GGC), Can Ameliorate Oxidative Damage and Neuroinflammation Induced by Aβ40 Oligomers in Human Astrocytes</title>

	<description>Soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers have been shown to induce oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction and memory deficits which have been reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Administration of γ-glutamylcysteine (GGC), a precursor to glutathione (GSH) can replenish depleted GSH levels, by circumventing the regulation of GSH biosynthesis and providing the limiting substrate. In this study, we examined the effect of exogenous Aβ40 oligomers on biomarkers of apoptosis and cell death, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, in primary adult human astrocytes. Treatment with Aβ40 oligomers significantly reduced the cell viability and apoptosis of astrocyte brain cultures and decreased oxidative modifications of DNA, lipids, and protein after 24 hours. Co-treatment with GGC at 200µM also attenuated increased the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and led to significant increases in the levels of the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and GSH and reduced the GSSG/GSH ratio. GGC also upregulated the level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and reduced the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) in Oligomeric Aβ40-treated astrocytes. Our data provides renewed insight on the beneficial effects of increased GSH levels by GGC in human astrocytes, and identifies yet another potential therapeutic strategy to attenuate the cytotoxic effects of Aβ oligomers in AD.</description>

	<description>Visual information about speech content from the talker’s mouth is often available before auditory information from the talker's voice. Here we examined perceptual and neural responses to words with and without this visual head start. For both types of words, perception was enhanced by viewing the talker's face, but the enhancement was significantly greater for words with a head start. Neural responses were measured from electrodes implanted over auditory association cortex in the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) of epileptic patients. The presence of visual speech suppressed responses to auditory speech, more so for words with a visual head start. We suggest that the head start inhibits representations of incompatible auditory phonemes, increasing perceptual accuracy and decreasing total neural responses. Together with previous work showing visual cortex modulation (Ozker et al., 2018b) these results from pSTG demonstrate that multisensory interactions are a powerful modulator of activity throughout the speech perception network.</description>

	<description>Cardiac neural crest cells contribute to important portions of the cardiovascular system including the aorticopulmonary septum and cardiac ganglion. Using replication incompetent avian retroviruses for precise high-resolution lineage analysis, we uncover a previously undescribed neural crest contribution to cardiomyocytes of the ventricles in &lt;i&gt;Gallus gallus&lt;/i&gt;, supported by &lt;i&gt;Wnt1-Cre&lt;/i&gt; lineage analysis in &lt;i&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/i&gt;. To test the intriguing possibility that neural crest cells contribute to heart repair, we examined &lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt; adult heart regeneration in the neural crest transgenic line, &lt;i&gt;Tg(-4.9sox10:eGFP)&lt;/i&gt;. Whereas the adult heart has few &lt;i&gt;sox10+ &lt;/i&gt;cells in the apex, &lt;i&gt;sox10&lt;/i&gt; and other neural crest regulatory network genes are upregulated in the regenerating myocardium after resection. The results suggest that neural crest cells contribute to many cardiovascular structures including cardiomyocytes across vertebrates and to the regenerating heart of teleost fish. Thus, understanding molecular mechanisms that control the normal development of the neural crest into cardiomyocytes and reactivation of the neural crest program upon regeneration may open potential therapeutic approaches to repair heart damage in amniotes.</description>

	<description>Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) were originally classified based on their cytokine profiles, placing natural killer (NK) cells and ILC1s together, but recent studies support their separation into different lineages at steady-state. However, tumors may induce NK cell conversion into ILC1-like cells that are limited to the tumor microenvironment and whether this conversion occurs beyond this environment remains unknown. Here we describe &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii &lt;/i&gt;infection converts NK cells into ILC1-like cells that are distinct from both steady-state NK cells and ILC1s in uninfected mice. These cells were Eomes-dependent, indicating that NK cells can give rise to Eomes&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; Tbet-dependent ILC1-like cells that circulate widely and persist independent of ongoing infection. Moreover, these changes appear permanent, as supported by epigenetic analyses. Thus, these studies markedly expand current concepts of NK cells, ILCs, and their potential conversion.</description>

	<description>Hepatocytes are regarded as the only effective cell source for cell transplantation to treat liver diseases; however, their availability is limited due to a donor shortage. Thus, a novel cell source must be developed. We recently reported that mature rodent hepatocytes can be reprogrammed into progenitor-like cells with a repopulative capacity using small molecule inhibitors. Here, we demonstrate that hepatic progenitor cells can be obtained from human infant hepatocytes using the same strategy. These cells, named human chemically induced liver progenitors (hCLiPs), had a significant repopulative capacity in injured mouse livers following transplantation. hCLiPs redifferentiated into mature hepatocytes &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; upon treatment with hepatic maturation-inducing factors. These redifferentiated cells exhibited cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymatic activities in response to CYP-inducing molecules and these activities were comparable with those in primary human hepatocytes. These findings will facilitate liver cell transplantation therapy and drug discovery studies.</description>

	<description>Many viruses previously have been shown to have pressurized genomes inside their viral protein shell, termed the capsid. This pressure results from the tight confinement of negatively charged viral nucleic acids inside the capsid. However, the relevance of capsid pressure to viral infection has not been demonstrated. In this work, we show that the internal DNA pressure of tens of atmospheres inside a herpesvirus capsid powers ejection of the viral genome into a host cell nucleus. To our knowledge, this provides the first demonstration of a pressure-dependent mechanism of viral genome penetration into a host nucleus, leading to infection of eukaryotic cells.</description>

	<description>Muscle development and regeneration require delicate cell cycle regulation of embryonic myoblasts and adult muscle satellite cells (MuSCs). Through analysis of the Polo-like kinase (Plk) family cell-cycle regulators in mice, we show that Plk1’s expression closely mirrors myoblast dynamics during embryonic and postnatal myogenesis. Cell-specific deletion of &lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt; in embryonic myoblasts leads to depletion of myoblasts, developmental failure and prenatal lethality. Postnatal deletion of &lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt; in MuSCs does not perturb their quiescence but depletes activated MuSCs as they enter the cell cycle, leading to regenerative failure. The &lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt;-null MuSCs are arrested at the M-phase, accumulate DNA damage, and apoptose. Mechanistically, &lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt; deletion upregulates p53, and inhibition of p53 promotes survival of the &lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt;-null myoblasts. Pharmacological inhibition of Plk1 similarly inhibits proliferation but promotes differentiation of myoblasts in vitro, and blocks muscle regeneration in vivo. These results reveal for the first time an indispensable role of Plk1 in developmental and regenerative myogenesis.</description>

	<description>Proper connectivity of the nervous system requires temporal and spatial control of axon guidance signaling. As commissural axons navigate across the CNS midline, ROBO-mediated repulsion has traditionally been thought to be repressed before crossing, and then to become upregulated after crossing. The regulation of the ROBO receptors involves multiple mechanisms that control protein expression, trafficking, and activity. Here, we report that mammalian ROBO1 and ROBO2 are not uniformly inhibited precrossing and are instead subject to additional temporal control via alternative splicing at a conserved microexon. The NOVA splicing factors regulate the developmental expression of ROBO1 and ROBO2 variants with small sequence differences and distinct guidance activities. As a result, ROBO-mediated axonal repulsion is activated early in development to prevent premature crossing and becomes inhibited later to allow crossing. Postcrossing, the ROBO1 and ROBO2 isoforms are disinhibited to prevent midline reentry and to guide postcrossing commissural axons to distinct mediolateral positions.</description>

	<description>Experience-dependent modifications of synaptic connections are thought to change patterns of network activities and stimulus tuning with learning. However, only a few studies explored how synaptic plasticity shapes the response dynamics of cortical circuits. Here, we investigated the mechanism underlying sharpening of both stimulus selectivity and response dynamics with familiarity observed in monkey inferotemporal cortex. Broadening the distribution of activities and stronger oscillations in the response dynamics after learning provide evidence for synaptic plasticity in recurrent connections modifying the strength of positive feedback. Its interplay with slow negative feedback via firing rate adaptation is critical in sharpening response dynamics. Analysis of changes in temporal patterns also enables us to disentangle recurrent and feedforward synaptic plasticity and provides a measure for the strengths of recurrent synaptic plasticity. Overall, this work highlights the importance of analyzing changes in dynamics as well as network patterns to further reveal the mechanisms of visual learning.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: DNA methylation change in neurotrophic genes with aging and delirium evidenced from three independent cohorts</title>

	<description>INTRODUCTION: We previously reported the association between DNA methylation (DNAm) of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes and aging. Neurotrophic factors are also known to be associated with aging and neurocognitive disorders. Thus, we hypothesized that DNAm of neurotrophic genes change with aging, especially in delirium patients. METHODS: DNAm were analyzed using HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip Kit in 3 independent cohorts; blood from 383 Grady Trauma Project subjects, brain from 21 neurosurgery patients, and blood from 87 inpatients with and without delirium. RESULTS: Both blood and brain samples showed that most of the DNAm of neurotrophic genes were positively correlated with aging. Furthermore, DNAm of neurotrophic genes were positively correlated with aging in delirium cases than in non-delirium controls. DISCUSSION: These findings support our hypothesis that the neurotrophic genes may be epigenetically modulated with aging, and this process may be contributing to the pathophysiology of delirium.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dynamic control of cortical head-direction signal by angular velocity</title>

	<description>The sense of direction requires accurate tracking of head direction at different turning-velocities, yet it remains unclear how this is achieved in the mammalian brain. Here we recorded head-direction cells in bat dorsal presubiculum and found that, surprisingly, the head-direction signal in this cortical region was dynamically controlled by angular velocity. In most neurons, a sharp head-direction tuning emerged at some angular velocity, but was absent at other velocities - resulting in a 4-fold increase in head-direction cell abundance. The head-direction tuning changed as a function of angular velocity primarily via a redistribution of spikes between the neuron's preferred and null directions - while keeping the average firing-rate constant. These results could not be explained by existing 'ring-attractor' models of the head-direction system. We propose a novel recurrent network model that accounts for the observed dynamics of head-direction cells. This model predicts that the new classes of cells we found can improve the sensitivity of the head-direction system to directional sensory cues, and support angular-velocity integration.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Mapping the living mouse brain neural architecture: strain specific patterns of brain structural and functional connectivity</title>

	<description>Mapping the structural and functional brain connectivity fingerprints became an essential approach in neurology and experimental neuroscience because network properties can underlie behavioral phenotypes. In mouse models, revealing strain related patterns of brain wiring have a tremendous importance, since these animals are used to answer questions related to neurological or neuropsychiatric disorders. C57BL/6 and BALB/cJ inbred strains are primary genetic backgrounds for brain disease modelling and for testing therapeutic approaches. Nevertheless, extensive literature describes basal differences in the behavioral, neuroanatomical and neurochemical profiles of the two strains, which raises the question whether the observed effects are pathology specific or depend on the genetic background. Here we performed a systematic comparative exploration of brain structure and function of C57BL/6 and BALB/cJ mice via Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We combined voxel-based morphometry (VBM), diffusion MRI and high resolution fiber mapping (hrFM) and resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and depicted brain-wide dissimilarities in the morphology and connectome features in the two strains. Particularly C57BL/6 animals show bigger and denser frontal cortical areas, cortico-striatal tracts and thalamic and midbrain pathways, and higher density of fibers in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. These features are fairly reflected in the functional connectograms that emphasize differences in hubness, frontal cortical and basal forbrain connectivity. We demonstrate strongly divergent reward-aversion circuitry patterns and some variations of the default mode network features. Inter-hemispherical functional connectivity showed flexibility and adjustment regarding the structural patterns in a strain specific manner. We further provide high-resolution tractograms illustrating also inter-individual variability across inter-hemispherical callosal pathways in the BALB/cJ strain.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neuroimaging contrast across the cortical hierarchy is the feature maximally linked to behavior and demographics</title>

	<description>We employed a data-driven canonical correlation analysis to investigate the population covariance of whole-brain cortical thickness, resting-state functional connectivity, and hundreds of behavioral/demographic measures in a large cohort of individuals. We found that the maximal thickness-behavior correlation and the maximal connectivity-behavior correlation are largely converged along the same direction across subjects, which is characterized by very specific modulations of all three modalities. Along this direction, individuals tend to have more positive and less negative behavioral/demographic traits, and more importantly, their functional connectivity and cortical thickness show a similar divergent modulation across the cortical hierarchy: thinner cortex and stronger functional connectivity at the higher-order cognitive regions whereas thicker cortex and weaker connectivity at the lower-order sensory/motor areas. These findings provide a unique link between structural and functional brain organizations and human behavior. Specifically, they suggest that the cross-hierarchy contrast of structural and functional brain measures may be a specific feature linked to the overall goodness of behavior and demographics.</description>

	<description>To move the body, the brain must precisely coordinate patterns of activity among diverse populations of motor neurons. In many species, including vertebrates, the motor neurons innervating a given muscle fire in a specific order that is determined by a gradient of cellular size and electrical excitability. This hierarchy allows premotor circuits to recruit motor neurons of increasing force capacity in a task-dependent manner. However, it remains unclear whether such a size principle also applies to species with more compact motor systems, such as the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, which has just 52 motor neurons per leg. Using in vivo calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we found that genetically-identified motor neurons controlling flexion of the fly tibia exhibit a gradient of anatomical, physiological, and functional properties consistent with the size principle. Large, fast motor neurons control high force, ballistic movements while small, slow motor neurons control low force, postural movements. Intermediate neurons fall between these two extremes. In behaving flies, motor neurons are recruited in order from slow to fast. This hierarchical organization may simplify the task of premotor circuits that control adaptive behaviors such as walking.</description>

	<description>Human cerebrospinal fluid (hCSF) have proven advantageous over conventional medium when culturing both rodent and human brain tissue. Increased excitability and synchronicity, similar to the active state exclusively recorded in vivo, reported in rodent slice and cell-cultures with hCSF as recording medium, indicates properties of the hCSF not matched by the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) commonly used for electrophysiological recording. To evaluate the possible importance of using hCSF as electrophysiological recording medium of human brain tissue, we compared the general excitability in ex vivo human brain tissue slice cultures during perfusion with hCSF and aCSF. For measuring the general activity from a majority of neurons within neocortical and hippocampal human ex vivo slices we used a microelectrode array (MEA) recording technique with 252 electrodes covering an area of 3.2 x 3.2 mm2 and a second CMOS-based MEA with 4225 electrodes on a 2 x 2 mm2 area for detailed mapping of action potential waveforms. We found that hCSF increase the number of active neurons and the firing rate of the neurons in the slices as well as increasing the numbers of bursts while leaving the duration of the bursts unchanged. Interestingly, not only an increase in the overall activity in the slices was observed, but a reconfiguration of the network functionality could be detected with specific activation and inactivation of subpopulations of neuronal ensembles. In conclusion, hCSF is an important component to consider for future human tissue studies, especially for experiments designed to mimic the in vivo situation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Converging intracortical signatures of two separated processing timescales in human early auditory cortex.</title>

	<description>Neural oscillations in auditory cortex are argued to support parsing and representing speech constituents at their corresponding temporal scales. Yet, how incoming sensory information interacts with ongoing spontaneous brain activity, what features of the neuronal microcircuitry underlie spontaneous and stimulus-evoked spectral fingerprints, and what these fingerprints entail for stimulus encoding, remain largely open questions. We used a combination of human invasive electrophysiology, computational modeling and decoding techniques to assess the information encoding properties of brain activity and to relate them to a plausible underlying neuronal microarchitecture. We analyzed intracortical auditory EEG activity from 10 patients while they were listening to short sentences. Pre-stimulus neural activity in early auditory cortical regions often exhibited power spectra with a shoulder in the delta range and a small bump in the beta range. Speech decreased power in the beta range, and increased power in the delta-theta and gamma ranges. Using multivariate machine learning techniques, we assessed the spectral profile of information content for two aspects of speech processing: detection and discrimination. We obtained better phase than power information decoding, and a bimodal spectral profile of information content with better decoding at low (delta-theta) and high (gamma) frequencies than at intermediate (beta) frequencies. These experimental data were reproduced by a simple rate model made of two subnetworks with different timescales, each composed of coupled excitatory and inhibitory units, and connected via a negative feedback loop. Modeling and experimental results were similar in terms of pre-stimulus spectral profile (except for the iEEG beta bump), spectral modulations with speech, and spectral profile of information content. Altogether, we provide converging evidence from both univariate spectral analysis and decoding approaches for a dual timescale processing infrastructure in human auditory cortex, and show that it is consistent with the dynamics of a simple rate model.nnAuthor summaryLike most animal vocalizations, speech results from a pseudo-rhythmic process that reflects the convergence of motor and auditory neural substrates and the natural resonance properties of the vocal apparatus towards efficient communication. Here, we leverage the excellent temporal and spatial resolution of intracranial EEG to demonstrate that neural activity in human early auditory cortical areas during speech perception exhibits a dual-scale spectral profile of power changes, with speech increasing power in low (delta-theta) and high (gamma - high-gamma) frequency ranges, while decreasing power in intermediate (alpha-beta) frequencies. Single-trial multivariate decoding also resulted in a bimodal spectral profile of information content, with better decoding at low and high frequencies than at intermediate ones. From both spectral and informational perspectives, these patterns are consistent with the activity of a relatively simple computational model comprising two reciprocally connected excitatory/inhibitory sub-networks operating at different (low and high) timescales. By combining experimental, decoding and modeling approaches, we provide consistent evidence for the existence, information coding value and underlying neuronal architecture of dual timescale processing in human auditory cortex.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: On the optimal design of metabolic RNA labeling experiments</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexey Uvarovskii, Isabel S. Naarmann-de Vries, Christoph Dieterich&lt;/p&gt;

Massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in combination with metabolic labeling has become the &lt;i&gt;de facto&lt;/i&gt; standard approach to study alterations in RNA transcription, processing or decay. Regardless of advances in the experimental protocols and techniques, every experimentalist needs to specify the key aspects of experimental design: For example, which protocol should be used (biochemical separation vs. nucleotide conversion) and what is the optimal labeling time? In this work, we provide approximate answers to these questions using the asymptotic theory of optimal design. Specifically, we investigate, how the variance of degradation rate estimates depends on the time and derive the optimal time for any given degradation rate. Subsequently, we show that an increase in sample numbers should be preferred over an increase in sequencing depth. Lastly, we provide some guidance on use cases when laborious biochemical separation outcompetes recent nucleotide conversion based methods (such as SLAMseq) and show, how inefficient conversion influences the precision of estimates.

Although Polycomb group proteins (PcG) are key factors for both temporary and persistent repression of the developmental genes, how the same group of proteins can differentially repress target genes remains unclarified. The identification of a variety of PcG complexes and activities sheds light on these issues. In this review, based on the recent findings including those with the use of interactome and Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C)-type analyses, we summarize the molecular mechanisms of PcG-mediated gene regulation and discuss how PcG regulates cell fate specification during neural development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) is a PI3K-like kinase best known for its role in the DNA damage response (DDR), especially after double-strand breaks. Mutations in the ATM gene result in a condition known as ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) that is characterized by cancer predisposition, radiosensitivity, neurodegeneration, sterility, and acquired immune deficiency. We show here that the innate immune system is not spared in A-T. ATM-deficient microglia adopt an active phenotype that includes the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines that are toxic to cultured neurons and likely contribute to A-T neurodegeneration. Causatively, ATM dysfunction results in the accumulation of DNA in the cytoplasm of microglia as well as a variety of other cell types. In microglia, cytoplasmic DNA primes an antiviral response via the DNA sensor, STING (stimulator of interferon genes). The importance of this response pathway is supported by our finding that inhibition of STING blocks the overproduction of neurotoxic cytokines. Cytosolic DNA also activates the AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) containing inflammasome and induces proteolytic processing of cytokine precursors such as pro-IL-1β. Our study furthers our understanding of neurodegeneration in A-T and highlights the role of cytosolic DNA in the innate immune response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Conventionally, the immune deficiencies found in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients are viewed as defects of the B and T cells of the acquired immune system. In this study, we demonstrate the microglia of the innate immune system are also affected and uncover the mechanism by which this occurs. Loss of ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) activity leads to a slowing of DNA repair and an accumulation of cytoplasmic fragments of genomic DNA. This ectopic DNA induces the antivirus response, which triggers the production of neurotoxic cytokines. This expands our understanding of the neurodegeneration found in A-T and offers potentially new therapeutic options.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Impaired Glymphatic Transport in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/32/6365?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The glymphatic system is a brainwide CSF transport system that uses the perivascular space for fast inflow of CSF. Arterial pulsations are a major driver of glymphatic CSF inflow, and hypertension that causes vascular pathologies, such as arterial stiffening and perivascular alterations, may impede the inflow. We used dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to assess the effect of hypertension on glymphatic transport kinetics in male young and adult spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats compared with age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). We anesthetized the rats with dexmedetomidine/isoflurane and infused paramagnetic contrast (Gd-DOTA) into the cisterna magna during dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to quantify glymphatic transport kinetics. Structural MRI analysis showed that cerebroventricular volumes are larger and brain volumes significantly smaller in SHR compared with WKY rats, regardless of age. We observed ventricular reflux of Gd-DOTA in SHR rats only, indicating abnormal CSF flow dynamics secondary to innate hydrocephalus. One-tissue compartment analysis revealed impeded glymphatic transport of Gd-DOTA in SHR compared with WKY rats in both age groups, implying that glymphatic transport, including solute clearance from brain parenchyma, is impaired during evolving hypertension in young SHR, an effect that worsens in states of chronic hypertension. The study demonstrates the suppression of glymphatic clearance in SHR rats and thus offers new insight into the coexistence of hypertension and concomitant vascular pathologies in Alzheimer's disease. The study further highlights the importance of considering the distribution of tracers in the CSF compartment in the analysis of the glymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The glymphatic system contributes to the removal of amyloid β from the brain and is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease and aging. Using a rat model of hypertension, we measured gross CSF flow and tracked glymphatic influx and efflux rates with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, showing that glymphatic transport is compromised in both early and advanced stages of hypertension. The study provides a new perspective on the importance for brain metabolite and fluid homeostasis of maintaining healthy blood vessels, an increasingly pertinent issue in an aging population that in part may explain the link between vascular pathology and Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Posterior Cingulate Cortical Response to Active Avoidance Mediates the Relationship between Punishment Sensitivity and Problem Drinking</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many people drink to alleviate negative affect, reflecting an avoidance strategy which can lead to alcohol misuse. Individuals with heightened sensitivity to punishment (SP) are especially susceptible to problem drinking via this maladaptive coping mechanism. As imaging studies have largely focused on sensation-seeking traits and approach behavior, the neural substrates underlying behavioral avoidance as well as their relationship with punishment sensitivity and alcohol use remain unclear. Here, we examined in humans the cerebral correlates of response inhibition to avoid a penalty in relation to both problem drinking and SP, as evaluated by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire, respectively. Seventy nondependent female and male drinkers performed a reward go/no-go task with approximately two-thirds go and one-third no-go trials. Correct go and no-go responses were rewarded, and incorrect responses were punished. The results showed that SP and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test scores were both positively correlated with brain activations during response inhibition, and these activations overlapped in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Thus, the PCC may represent a shared neural substrate for avoidance, punishment sensitivity, and problem drinking. Mediation analyses further suggested that PCC response to avoidance completely and bidirectionally mediated the relationship between SP and hazardous alcohol use. These findings substantiated the role of the PCC in behavioral avoidance and its link to problem drinking in punishment-sensitive nondependent drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Many people drink to alleviate negative affect, reflecting an avoidance strategy that can lead to alcohol misuse. Individuals with heightened punishment sensitivity (SP) trait are particularly vulnerable to this maladaptive coping mechanism. The current study examined the neural substrates underlying behavioral avoidance and their relationship with SP and problem drinking. Using a reward go/no-go task, we showed both SP and drinking severity were positively correlated with the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) activation during action inhibition. Thus, the PCC may represent a shared neural substrate for avoidance behavior, punishment sensitivity, and problem drinking. Further, PCC response to avoidance mediated the relationship between SP and alcohol use. These findings substantiated the neural processes linking avoidance tendency to alcohol misuse in punishment-sensitive drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Deletion of Class II ADP-Ribosylation Factors in Mice Causes Tremor by the Nav1.6 Loss in Cerebellar Purkinje Cell Axon Initial Segments</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/32/6339?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/32/6339?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are a family of small monomeric GTPases comprising six members categorized into three classes: class I (ARF1, 2, and 3), class II (ARF4 and 5), and class III (ARF6). In contrast to class I and III ARFs, which are the key regulators in vesicular membrane trafficking, the cellular function of class II ARFs remains unclear. In the present study, we generated class II ARF-deficient mice and found that ARF4&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;/ARF5&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited essential tremor (ET)-like behaviors. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological recordings revealed that ARF4&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;/ARF5&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice of both sexes exhibited abnormal brain activity when moving, raising the possibility of abnormal cerebellar excitability. Slice patch-clamp experiments demonstrated the reduced excitability of the cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) in ARF4&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;/ARF5&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Immunohistochemical and electrophysiological analyses revealed a severe and selective decrease of pore-forming voltage-dependent Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel subunit Nav1.6, important for maintaining repetitive action potential firing, in the axon initial segment (AIS) of PCs. Importantly, this decrease in Nav1.6 protein localized in the AIS and the consequent tremors in ARF4&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;/ARF5&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice could be alleviated by the PC-specific expression of ARF5 using adeno-associated virus vectors. Together, our data demonstrate that the decreased expression of the class II ARF proteins in ARF4&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;/ARF5&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, leading to a haploinsufficiency of ARF4 in the absence of ARF5, impairs the localization of Nav1.6 to the AIS and hence reduces the membrane excitability in PCs, resulting in the ET-like movement disorder. We suggest that class II ARFs function in localizing specific proteins, such as Nav1.6, to the AIS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We found that decreasing the expression of class II ARF proteins, through the generation of ARF4&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;/ARF5&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, impairs Nav1.6 distribution to the axon initial segment (AIS) of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs), thereby resulting in the impairment of action potential firing of PCs. The ARF4&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;/ARF5&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mutant mice exhibited movement-associated essential tremor (ET)-like behavior with pharmacological profiles similar to those in ET patients. The exogenous expression of ARF5 reduced the tremor phenotype and restored the localization of Nav1.6 immunoreactivity to the AIS in ARF4&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;/ARF5&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Thus, our results suggest that class II ARFs are involved in the localization of Nav1.6 to the AISs in cerebellar PCs and that the reduction of class II ARF activity leads to ET-like movement disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Inhibition of RasGRF2, But Not RasGRF1, Alters Cocaine Reward in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/32/6325?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK (Ras-ERK) signaling has been implicated in the effects of drugs of abuse. Inhibitors of MEK1/2, the kinases upstream of ERK1/2, have been critical in defining the role of the Ras-ERK cascade in drug-dependent alterations in behavioral plasticity, but the Ras family of small GTPases has not been extensively examined in drug-related behaviors. We examined the role of Ras Guanine Nucleotide Releasing Factor 1 (RasGRF1) and 2 (RasGRF2), upstream regulators of the Ras-ERK signaling cascade, on cocaine self-administration (SA) in male mice. We first established a role for Ras-ERK signaling in cocaine SA, demonstrating that pERK1/2 is upregulated following SA in C57BL/6N mice in striatum. We then compared RasGRF1 and RasGRF2 KO mouse lines, demonstrating that cocaine SA in RasGRF2 KO mice was increased relative to WT controls, whereas RasGRF1 KO and WT mice did not differ. This effect in RasGRF2 mice is likely mediated by the Ras-ERK signaling pathway, as pERK1/2 upregulation following cocaine SA was absent in RasGRF2 KO mice. Interestingly, the lentiviral knockdown of RasGRF2 in the NAc had the opposite effect to that in RasGRF2 KO mice, reducing cocaine SA. We subsequently demonstrated that the MEK inhibitor PD325901 administered peripherally prior to cocaine SA increased cocaine intake, replicating the increase seen in RasGRF2 KO mice, whereas PD325901 administered into the NAc decreased cocaine intake, similar to the effect seen following lentiviral knockdown of RasGRF2. These data indicate a role for RasGRF2 in cocaine SA in mice that is ERK-dependent, and suggest a differential effect of global versus site-specific RasGRF2 inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Exposure to drugs of abuse activates a variety of intracellular pathways, and following repeated exposure, persistent changes in these pathways contribute to drug dependence. Downstream components of the Ras-ERK signaling cascade are involved in the acute and chronic effects of drugs of abuse, but their upstream mediators have not been extensively characterized. Here we show, using a combination of molecular, pharmacological, and lentiviral techniques, that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor RasGRF2 mediates cocaine self-administration via an ERK-dependent mechanism, whereas RasGRF1 has no effect on responding for cocaine. These data indicate dissociative effects of mediators of Ras activity on cocaine reward and expand the understanding of the contribution of Ras-ERK signaling to drug-taking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sleep as a Potential Biomarker of Tau and {beta}-Amyloid Burden in the Human Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/32/6315?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/32/6315?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent proposals suggest that sleep may be a factor associated with accumulation of two core pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD): tau and β-amyloid (Aβ). Here we combined PET measures of Aβ and tau, electroencephalogram sleep recordings, and retrospective sleep evaluations to investigate the potential utility of sleep measures in predicting &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; AD pathology in male and female older adults. Regression analyses revealed that the severity of impaired slow oscillation-sleep spindle coupling predicted greater medial temporal lobe tau burden. Aβ burden was not associated with coupling impairment but instead predicted the diminished amplitude of &amp;lt;1 Hz slow-wave-activity, results that were statistically dissociable from each other. Additionally, comparisons of AD pathology and retrospective, self-reported changes in sleep duration demonstrated that changes in sleep across the lifespan can predict late-life Aβ and tau burden. Thus, quantitative and qualitative features of human sleep represent potential noninvasive, cost-effective, and scalable biomarkers (current and future forecasting) of AD pathology, and carry both therapeutic and public health implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Several studies have linked sleep disruption to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau and β-amyloid (Aβ), the primary pathological features of AD, are associated with both objective and subjective changes in sleep. However, it remains unknown whether late life tau and Aβ burden are associated with distinct impairments in sleep physiology or changes in sleep across the lifespan. Using polysomnography, retrospective questionnaires, and tau- and Aβ-specific PET, the present study reveals human sleep signatures that dissociably predict levels of brain tau and Aβ in older adults. These results suggest that a night of polysomnography may aid in evaluating tau and Aβ burden, and that treating sleep deficiencies within decade-specific time windows may serve in delaying AD progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Perceptual Function and Category-Selective Neural Organization in Children with Resections of Visual Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The consequences of cortical resection, a treatment for humans with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy, provide a unique opportunity to advance our understanding of the nature and extent of cortical (re)organization. Despite the importance of visual processing in daily life, the neural and perceptual sequellae of occipitotemporal resections remain largely unexplored. Using psychophysical and fMRI investigations, we compared the neural and visuoperceptual profiles of 10 children or adolescents following unilateral cortical resections and their age- and gender-matched controls. Dramatically, with the exception of two individuals, both of whom had relatively greater cortical alterations, all patients showed normal perceptual performance on tasks of intermediate- and high-level vision, including face and object recognition. Consistently, again with the exception of the same two individuals, both univariate and multivariate fMRI analyses revealed normal selectivity and representational structure of category-selective regions. Furthermore, the spatial organization of category-selective regions obeyed the typical medial-to-lateral topographic organization albeit unilaterally in the structurally preserved hemisphere rather than bilaterally. These findings offer novel insights into the malleability of cortex in the pediatric population and suggest that, although experience may be necessary for the emergence of neural category-selectivity, this emergence is not necessarily contingent on the integrity of particular cortical structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; One approach to reduce seizure activity in patients with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy involves the resection of the epileptogenic focus. The impact of these resections on the perceptual behaviors and organization of visual cortex remain largely unexplored. Here, we characterized the visuoperceptual and neural profiles of ventral visual cortex in a relatively large sample of post-resection pediatric patients. Two major findings emerged. First, most patients exhibited preserved visuoperceptual performance across a wide-range of visual behaviors. Second, normal topography, magnitude, and representational structure of category-selective organization were uncovered in the spared hemisphere. These comprehensive imaging and behavioral investigations uncovered novel evidence concerning the neural representations and visual functions in children who have undergone cortical resection, and have implications for cortical plasticity more generally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Tracking Transient Changes in the Neural Frequency Architecture: Harmonic Relationships between Theta and Alpha Peaks Facilitate Cognitive Performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/32/6291?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The synchronization between neural oscillations at different frequencies has been proposed as a core mechanism for the coordination and integration of neural systems at different spatiotemporal scales. Because neural oscillations of different frequencies can only fully synchronize when their &quot;peak&quot; frequencies form harmonic relationships (e.g., &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/2), the present study explored whether the transient occurrence of harmonic cross-frequency relationship between task-relevant rhythms underlies efficient cognitive processing. Continuous EEG recordings (51 human participants; 14 males) were obtained during an arithmetic task, rest and breath focus. In two separate experiments, we consistently show that the proportion of epochs displaying a 2:1 harmonic relationship between alpha (8–14 Hz) and theta (4–8 Hz) peak frequencies (i.e., alpha&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt;  10.6 Hz; theta&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt;  5.3 Hz), was significantly higher when cognitive demands increased. In addition, a higher incidence of 2:1 harmonic cross-frequency relationships was significantly associated with increased alpha–theta phase synchrony and improved arithmetic task performance, thereby underlining the functional relevance of this cross-frequency configuration. Notably, opposite dynamics were identified for a specific range of &quot;nonharmonic&quot; alpha–theta cross-frequency relationships (i.e., alpha&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt;/theta&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.1–1.6), which showed a higher incidence during rest compared with the arithmetic task. The observation that alpha and theta rhythms shifted into harmonic versus nonharmonic cross-frequency relationships depending on (cognitive) task demands is in line with the notion that the neural frequency architecture entails optimal frequency arrangements to facilitate cross-frequency &quot;coupling&quot; and &quot;decoupling&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neural activity is known to oscillate within discrete frequency bands and the interplay between these brain rhythms is hypothesized to underlie cognitive functions. A recent theory posits that shifts in the peak frequencies of oscillatory rhythms form the principal mechanism by which cross-frequency coupling and decoupling is implemented in the brain. In line with this notion, we show that the occurrence of a cross-frequency arrangement that mathematically enables coupling between alpha and theta rhythms is more prominent during active cognitive processing (compared with rest and non-cognitively demanding tasks) and is associated with improved cognitive performance. Together, our results open new vistas for future research on cross-frequency dynamics in the brain and their functional role in cognitive processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Amblyopia Affects the ON Visual Pathway More than the OFF</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/32/6276?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/32/6276?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual information reaches the cerebral cortex through parallel ON and OFF pathways that signal the presence of light and dark stimuli in visual scenes. We have previously demonstrated that optical blur reduces visual salience more for light than dark stimuli because it removes the high spatial frequencies from the stimulus, and low spatial frequencies drive weaker ON than OFF cortical responses. Therefore, we hypothesized that sustained optical blur during brain development should weaken ON cortical pathways more than OFF, increasing the dominance of darks in visual perception. Here we provide support for this hypothesis in humans with anisometropic amblyopia who suffered sustained optical blur early after birth in one of the eyes. In addition, we show that the dark dominance in visual perception also increases in strabismic amblyopes that have their vision to high spatial frequencies reduced by mechanisms not associated with optical blur. Together, we show that amblyopia increases visual dark dominance by 3–10 times and that the increase in dark dominance is strongly correlated with amblyopia severity. These results can be replicated with a computational model that uses greater luminance/response saturation in ON than OFF pathways and, as a consequence, reduces more ON than OFF cortical responses to stimuli with low spatial frequencies. We conclude that amblyopia affects the ON cortical pathway more than the OFF, a finding that could have implications for future amblyopia treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Amblyopia is a loss of vision that affects 2–5% of children across the world and originates from a deficit in visual cortical circuitry. Current models assume that amblyopia affects similarly ON and OFF visual pathways, which signal light and dark features in visual scenes. Against this current belief, here we demonstrate that amblyopia affects the ON visual pathway more than the OFF, a finding that could have implications for new amblyopia treatments targeted at strengthening a weak ON visual pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dynamic Causal Modelling of Active Vision</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/32/6265?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/32/6265?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we draw from recent theoretical work on active perception, which suggests that the brain makes use of an internal (i.e., generative) model to make inferences about the causes of sensations. This view treats visual sensations as consequent on action (i.e., saccades) and implies that visual percepts must be actively constructed via a sequence of eye movements. Oculomotor control calls on a distributed set of brain sources that includes the dorsal and ventral frontoparietal (attention) networks. We argue that connections from the frontal eye fields to ventral parietal sources represent the mapping from &quot;where&quot;, fixation location to information derived from &quot;what&quot; representations in the ventral visual stream. During scene construction, this mapping must be learned, putatively through changes in the effective connectivity of these synapses. Here, we test the hypothesis that the coupling between the dorsal frontal cortex and the right temporoparietal cortex is modulated during saccadic interrogation of a simple visual scene. Using dynamic causal modeling for magnetoencephalography with (male and female) human participants, we assess the evidence for changes in effective connectivity by comparing models that allow for this modulation with models that do not. We find strong evidence for modulation of connections between the two attention networks; namely, a disinhibition of the ventral network by its dorsal counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This work draws from recent theoretical accounts of active vision and provides empirical evidence for changes in synaptic efficacy consistent with these computational models. In brief, we used magnetoencephalography in combination with eye-tracking to assess the neural correlates of a form of short-term memory during a dot cancellation task. Using dynamic causal modeling to quantify changes in effective connectivity, we found evidence that the coupling between the dorsal and ventral attention networks changed during the saccadic interrogation of a simple visual scene. Intuitively, this is consistent with the idea that these neuronal connections may encode beliefs about &quot;what I would see if I looked there&quot;, and that this mapping is optimized as new data are obtained with each fixation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Radiation Force as a Physical Mechanism for Ultrasonic Neurostimulation of the Ex Vivo Retina</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Focused ultrasound has been shown to be effective at stimulating neurons in many animal models, both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Ultrasonic neuromodulation is the only noninvasive method of stimulation that could reach deep in the brain with high spatial-temporal resolution, and thus has potential for use in clinical applications and basic studies of the nervous system. Understanding the physical mechanism by which energy in a high acoustic frequency wave is delivered to stimulate neurons will be important to optimize this technology. We imaged the isolated salamander retina of either sex during ultrasonic stimuli that drive ganglion cell activity and observed micron scale displacements, consistent with radiation force, the nonlinear delivery of momentum by a propagating wave. We recorded ganglion cell spiking activity and changed the acoustic carrier frequency across a broad range (0.5–43 MHz), finding that increased stimulation occurs at higher acoustic frequencies, ruling out cavitation as an alternative possible mechanism. A quantitative radiation force model can explain retinal responses and could potentially explain previous &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; results in the mouse, suggesting a new hypothesis to be tested &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Finally, we found that neural activity was strongly modulated by the distance between the transducer and the electrode array showing the influence of standing waves on the response. We conclude that radiation force is the dominant physical mechanism underlying ultrasonic neurostimulation in the &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; retina and propose that the control of standing waves is a new potential method to modulate these effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Ultrasonic neurostimulation is a promising noninvasive technology that has potential for both basic research and clinical applications. The mechanisms of ultrasonic neurostimulation are unknown, making it difficult to optimize in any given application. We studied the physical mechanism by which ultrasound is converted into an effective energy form to cause neurostimulation in the retina and find that ultrasound acts via radiation force leading to a mechanical displacement of tissue. We further show that standing waves have a strong modulatory effect on activity. Our quantitative model by which ultrasound generates radiation force and leads to neural activity will be important in optimizing ultrasonic neurostimulation across a wide range of applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Close Homolog of L1 Regulates Dendritic Spine Density in the Mouse Cerebral Cortex Through Semaphorin 3B</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dendritic spines in the developing mammalian neocortex are initially overproduced and then eliminated during adolescence to achieve appropriate levels of excitation in mature networks. We show here that the L1 family cell adhesion molecule Close Homolog of L1 (CHL1) and secreted repellent ligand Semaphorin 3B (Sema3B) function together to induce dendritic spine pruning in developing cortical pyramidal neurons. Loss of CHL1 in null mutant mice in both genders resulted in increased spine density and a greater proportion of immature spines on apical dendrites in the prefrontal and visual cortex. Electron microscopy showed that excitatory spine synapses with postsynaptic densities were increased in the CHL1-null cortex, and electrophysiological recording in prefrontal slices from mutant mice revealed deficiencies in excitatory synaptic transmission. Mechanistically, Sema3B protein induced elimination of spines on apical dendrites of cortical neurons cultured from wild-type but not CHL1-null embryos. Sema3B was secreted by the cortical neuron cultures, and its levels increased when cells were treated with the GABA antagonist gabazine. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; CHL1 was coexpressed with Sema3B in pyramidal neuron subpopulations and formed a complex with Sema3B receptor subunits Neuropilin-2 and PlexinA4. CHL1 and NrCAM, a closely related L1 adhesion molecule, localized primarily to distinct spines and promoted spine elimination to Sema3B or Sema3F, respectively. These results support a new concept in which selective spine elimination is achieved through different secreted semaphorins and L1 family adhesion molecules to sculpt functional neural circuits during postnatal maturation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dendritic spines in the mammalian neocortex are initially overproduced and then pruned in adolescent life through unclear mechanisms to sculpt maturing cortical circuits. Here, we show that spine and excitatory synapse density of pyramidal neurons in the developing neocortex is regulated by the L1 adhesion molecule, Close Homolog of L1 (CHL1). CHL1 mediated spine pruning in response to the secreted repellent ligand Semaphorin 3B and associated with receptor subunits Neuropilin-2 and PlexinA4. CHL1 and related L1 adhesion molecule NrCAM localized to distinct spines, and promoted spine elimination to Semaphorin 3B and -3F, respectively. These results support a new concept in which selective elimination of individual spines and nascent synapses can be achieved through the action of distinct secreted semaphorins and L1 adhesion molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Role of the Anion in Salt (NaCl) Detection by Mouse Taste Buds</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/32/6224?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;How taste buds detect NaCl remains poorly understood. Among other problems, applying taste-relevant concentrations of NaCl (50–500 mm) onto isolated taste buds or cells exposes them to unphysiological (hypo/hypertonic) conditions. To overcome these limitations, we used the anterior tongue of male and female mice to implement a slice preparation in which fungiform taste buds are in a relatively intact tissue environment and stimuli are limited to the taste pore. Taste-evoked responses were monitored using confocal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging via GCaMP3 expressed in Type 2 and Type 3 taste bud cells. NaCl evoked intracellular mobilization of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the apical tips of a subset of taste cells. The concentration dependence and rapid adaptation of NaCl-evoked cellular responses closely resembled behavioral and afferent nerve responses to NaCl. Importantly, taste cell responses were not inhibited by the diuretic, amiloride. &lt;i&gt;Post hoc&lt;/i&gt; immunostaining revealed that &amp;gt;80% of NaCl-responsive taste bud cells were of Type 2. Many NaCl-responsive cells were also sensitive to stimuli that activate Type 2 cells but never to stimuli for Type 3 cells. Ion substitutions revealed that amiloride-insensitive NaCl responses depended on Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; rather than Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, choline chloride, an established salt taste enhancer, was equally effective a stimulus as sodium chloride. Although the apical transducer for Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; remains unknown, blocking known chloride channels and cotransporters had little effect on NaCl responses. Together, our data suggest that chloride, an essential nutrient, is a key determinant of taste transduction for amiloride-insensitive salt taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sodium and chloride are essential nutrients and must be regularly consumed to replace excreted NaCl. Thus, understanding salt taste, which informs salt appetite, is important from a fundamental sensory perspective and forms the basis for interventions to replace/reduce excess Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; consumption. This study examines responses to NaCl in a semi-intact preparation of mouse taste buds. We identify taste cells that respond to NaCl in the presence of amiloride, which is significant because much of human salt taste also is amiloride-insensitive. Further, we demonstrate that Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;, not Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, generates these amiloride-insensitive salt taste responses. Intriguingly, choline chloride, a commercial salt taste enhancer, is also a highly effective stimulus for these cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Balancing Extrasynaptic Excitation and Synaptic Inhibition within Olfactory Bulb Glomeruli</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Glutamatergic transmission in the brain typically occurs at well-defined synaptic connections, but increasing evidence indicates that neural excitation can also occur through activation of &quot;extrasynaptic&quot; glutamate receptors. Here, we investigated the underlying mechanisms and functional properties of extrasynaptic signals that are part of a feedforward path of information flow in the olfactory bulb. This pathway involves glutamatergic interneurons, external tufted cells (eTCs), that are excited by olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and in turn excite output mitral cells (MCs) extrasynaptically. Using pair-cell and triple-cell recordings in rat bulb slices (of either sex), combined with ultrastructural approaches, we first present evidence that eTC-to-MC signaling results from &quot;spillover&quot; of glutamate released at eTC synapses onto GABAergic periglomerular (PG) cells in glomeruli. Thus, feedforward excitation is an indirect result of and must cooccur with activation of inhibitory circuitry. Next, to examine the dynamics of the competing signals, we assayed the relationship between the number of spikes in eTCs and excitation of MCs or PG cells in pair-cell recordings. This showed that extrasynaptic excitation in MCs is very weak due to single spikes but rises sharply and supralinearly with increasing spikes, differing from sublinear behavior for synaptic excitation of PG cells. Similar dynamics leading to a preference for extrasynaptic excitation were also observed during recordings of extrasynaptic and inhibitory currents in response to OSN input of increasing magnitude. The observed alterations in the balance between extrasynaptic excitation and inhibition in glomeruli with stimulus strength could underlie an intraglomerular mechanism for olfactory contrast enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although the currently popular deep learning networks achieve unprecedented
performance on some tasks, the human brain still has a monopoly on general
intelligence. Motivated by this and biological implausibility of deep learning
networks, we developed a family of biologically plausible artificial neural
networks (NNs) for unsupervised learning. Our approach is based on optimizing
principled objective functions containing a term that matches the pairwise
similarity of outputs to the similarity of inputs, hence the name -
similarity-based. Gradient-based online optimization of such similarity-based
objective functions can be implemented by NNs with biologically plausible local
learning rules. Similarity-based cost functions and associated NNs solve
unsupervised learning tasks such as linear dimensionality reduction, sparse
and/or nonnegative feature extraction, blind nonnegative source separation,
clustering and manifold learning.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: What the odor is not: Estimation by elimination. (arXiv:1903.02580v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02580</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02580</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The olfactory system uses responses of a small number of broadly sensitive
receptors to combinatorially encode a vast number of odors. Here, we propose a
method for decoding such a distributed representation. Our main idea is that a
receptor that does not respond to an odor carries more information than a
receptor that does, because a typical receptor binds to many odorants. So a
response below threshold signals absence of all such odorants. As a result, it
is easier to identify what the odor is not, rather than what the odor is. We
demonstrate that, for biologically realistic numbers of receptors, response
functions, and odor mixture complexity, this remarkably simple method of
elimination turns an underdetermined decoding problem into an overdetermined
one, allowing accurate determination of odorants in a mixture and their
concentrations. We give a simple neural network realization of our algorithm
resembling the circuit architecture in piriform cortex, and propose
experimental tests.

	<description>Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)Rs) mediate the majority of fast synaptic inhibition in the central nervous system (CNS). GABAARs belong to the Cys-loop superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGIC) and are assembled from 19 different subunits. As dysfunctional GABAergic neurotransmission manifests itself in neurodevelopmental disorders including epilepsy and anxiety, GABAARs are key drug targets. The majority of synaptic GABA(A)Rs are anchored at the inhibitory postsynaptic membrane by the principal scaffolding protein gephyrin, which acts as the central organizer in maintaining the architecture of the inhibitory postsynaptic density (iPSD). This interaction is mediated by the long intracellular loop located in between transmembrane helices 3 and 4 (M3-M4 loop) of the receptors and the universal receptor-binding pocket residing in the C-terminal domain of gephyrin. In 2014, the crystal structure of the beta3-homopentameric GABA(A)R provided crucial information regarding the architecture of the receptor; however, a clear understanding of the structure and assembly of heteropentameric receptors, as well as the mechanism of action of these receptors, remained enigmatic. This review will highlight recent advances in understanding the structure of heteropentameric synaptic GABA(A)Rs and how these structures have provided fundamental insights into the assembly of these multi-subunit receptors as well as their modulation by diverse ligands including the physiological agonist GABA. We will further discuss the role of gephyrin in anchoring of synaptic GABAARs and also glycine receptors, thus maintaining the architecture of the iPSD. Finally, we will also summarize how anti-malarial artemisinin drugs modulate gephyrin-specific inhibitory neurotransmission.</description>

	<description>Extracellular adenine nucleotides play important roles in cell-cell communication and tissue homeostasis. High concentrations of extracellular ATP released by dying cells are sensed as a danger signal by the P2X7 receptor, a non-specific cation channel. Studies in P2X7 knockout mice and numerous disease models have demonstrated an important role of this receptor in inflammatory processes. P2X7 activation has been shown to induce a variety of cellular responses that are not usually associated with ion channel function, for example changes in the plasma membrane composition and morphology, ectodomain shedding, activation of lipases, kinases, and transcription factors, as well as cytokine release and apoptosis. In contrast to all other P2X family members, the P2X7 receptor contains a long intracellular C-terminus that constitutes 40% of the whole protein and is considered essential for most of these effects. So far, over 50 different proteins have been identified to physically interact with the P2X7 receptor. However, few of these interactions have been confirmed in independent studies and for the majority of these proteins, the interaction domains and the physiological consequences of the interactions are only poorly described. Also, while the structure of the P2X7 extracellular domain has recently been resolved, information about the organisation and structure of its C-terminal tail remains elusive. After shortly describing the structure and assembly of the P2X7 receptor, this review gives an update of the identified or proposed interaction domains within the P2X7 C-terminus, describes signalling pathways in which this receptor has been involved, and provides an overlook of the identified interaction partners.</description>

	<description>The high mortality and morbidity rate of stroke has been a chronic problem plaguing human society. The activation of microglia is one of the principal reasons why neuroinflammation induces cerebral dysfunction. Because of their vital functions in the regulation of neuroinflammation, microglia constitute an important target for stroke. Given that there is an innate self-preservation mechanism between neurons and microglia, the transmembrane glycoproteins on the surface of their membranes, namely CD200 and CD200R, have become a popular topic of research. Numerous studies have demonstrated that CD200-CD200R interaction, microglial activation, and poststroke neuroinflammatory damage are inextricably linked. In this review, we describe the above relationship from a new perspective. Specifically, we will focus on neuroinflammation after stroke. The role of crosstalk of CD200-CD200R inhibitory immune ligand receptors in immune regulation will also be illustrated.  Thus, we will see how poststroke injury can be influenced by the CD200-CD200R crosstalk. Finally, we will discuss the possibility of clinical application of the result of CD200-CD200R interaction to manage the neuroinflammatory injury after stroke.</description>

	<description>The interaction between the gut microbiota and alpha-synuclein (Syn) aggregation in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is receiving increasing attention. The objective of this study was to investigate gut microbiota, and effects of an inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) trigger in a human Syn over-expressing mouse model of PD (Thy1-αSyn). Stool samples from patients with confirmed PD and Thy1-Syn mice were analysed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing.  Compared to healthy controls, the relative abundance of mucin-degrading Verrucomicrobiae and LPS-producing Gammaproteobacteria were greater in PD patients. In mice, the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria was negligible in both Thy1-αSyn and wild-type (WT) animals, while Verrucomicrobiae were reduced in Thy1-αSyn mice. The effect of LPS on intestinal barrier function was investigated in vitro using intestinal epithelial (IEC-6) cells, and in vivo via administration of LPS in drinking water to Thy1-Syn mice. Acute exposure to LPS in vitro resulted in a reduction and altered distribution of the tight junction markers ZO-1 and e-Cadherin around the cell membrane in IEC-6 cells, as shown by immunohistochemistry. LPS administration in Thy1-Syn mice resulted in the emergence of early motor manifestations at 10 weeks, compared to untreated mice who were still asymptomatic at this age. This study reaffirms that an altered microbiome exists in patients with PD, and supports the notion of  a proinflammatory gut microbiome environment as a trigger for PD pathogenesis.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Different Re-referencing Methods on Spontaneously Generated Ear-EEG</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00822</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00822</link>
	<description>In recent years, electroencephalography (EEG) measured around the ears, called ear-EEG, has been introduced to develop unobtrusive and ambulatory EEG-based applications. When measuring ear-EEGs, the availability of a reference site is restricted due to the miniaturized device structure, and therefore a reference electrode is generally placed near the recording electrodes. As the electrical brain activity recorded at a reference electrode closely placed to recording electrodes may significantly cancel or influence the brain activity recorded by the recording electrodes, an appropriate re-referencing method is often required to mitigate the impact of the reference brain activity. In this study, therefore, we systematically investigated the impact of different re-referencing methods on ear-EEGs spontaneously generated from endogenous paradigms. To this end, we used two ear-EEG datasets recorded behind both ears while subjects performed an alpha modulation task (eyes-closed and eyes-open) and two mental tasks (mental arithmetic and mental singing). The measured ear-EEGs were independently re-referenced using five different methods: i) all-mean, ii) contralateral-mean, iii) ipsilateral-mean, iv) contralateral-bipolar, and v) ipsilateral-bipolar. We investigated the changes in alpha power during eyes-open and eyes-closed tasks, as well as event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) during mental arithmetic and mental singing. To evaluate the effects of re-referencing methods on ear-EEGs, we also estimated the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the two ear-EEG datasets, as well as assessed the classification performance of the two mental tasks (mental arithmetic vs. mental singing). Overall patterns of changes in alpha power and ERD/ERS were similar among the five re-referencing methods, but the contralateral-mean method showed statistically higher SNRs than did the other methods for both ear-EEG datasets, except in the contralateral-bipolar method for the two mental tasks. In concordance with the SNR results, classification performance was also statistically higher for the contralateral-mean method than it was for the other re-referencing methods. The results suggest that employing contralateral mean information can be an efficient way to re-reference spontaneously generated ear-EEGs, thereby maximizing the reliability of ear-EEG-based applications in endogenous paradigms.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Safety Aspects, Tolerability and Modeling of Retinofugal Alternating Current Stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00783</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00783</link>
	<description>Background
While alternating current stimulation (ACS) is gaining relevance as a tool in research and approaching clinical applications, its mechanisms of action remain unclear. A review by Schutter and colleagues argues for a retinal origin of transcranial ACS’ neuromodulatory effects. Interestingly, there is an alternative application form of ACS specifically targeting α-oscillations in the visual cortex via periorbital electrodes (retinofugal alternating current stimulation, rACS). To further compare these two methods and investigate retinal effects of ACS, we first aim to establish the safety and tolerability of rACS. 

Objective
The goal of our research was to evaluate the safety of retinofugal alternating current stimulation (rACS) via finite-element modeling, theoretical safety limits and subjective report.

Methods
20 healthy subjects were stimulated with rACS as well as photic stimulation and reported adverse events following stimulation. We analyzed stimulation parameters at electrode level as well as distributed metric estimates from an ultra-high spatial resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived finite element human head model and compared them to existing safety limits.

Results
Topographical modeling revealed the highest current densities in the anterior visual pathway, particularly retina and optic nerve. Stimulation parameters and finite element modeling estimates of rACS were found to be well below existing safety limits. No serious adverse events occurred. 
 
Conclusion
Our findings are in line with existing safety guidelines for retinal and neural damage and establish the tolerability and feasibility of rACS. In comparison to tACS, retinofugal stimulation of the visual cortex provides an anatomically circumscribed model to systematically study the mechanisms of action of ACS.</description>

	<description>Background: Tumor necrosis factor, which exists both as a soluble (solTNF) and a transmembrane (tmTNF) protein, plays an important role in post-stroke inflammation. The objective of the present study was to test the effect of topical versus intracerebroventricular administration of XPro1595 (a solTNF inhibitor) and etanercept (a solTNF and tmTNF inhibitor) compared to saline on output measures such as infarct volume and post-stroke inflammation in mice.
Methods: Adult male C57BL/6 mice were treated topically (2.5 mg/ml/1µl/hr for 3 consecutive days) or intracerebroventricularly (1.25 mg/kg/0.5 ml, once) with saline, XPro1595, or etanercept immediately after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). Mice were allowed to survive 1 or 3 days. Infarct volume, microglial and leukocyte profiles, and inflammatory markers were evaluated.
Results: We found that topical, and not intracerebroventricular, administration of XPro1595 reduced infarct volume at both 1 day and 3 days after pMCAO. Etanercept showed no effect. We observed no changes in microglial or leukocyte populations. XPro1595 increased gene expression of P2ry12 at 1 day and Trem2 at 1 and 3 days, while decreasing Cx3cr1 expression at 1 and 3 days after pMCAO, suggesting a change in microglial activation towards a phagocytic phenotype.
Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that topical administration of XPro1595 for three consecutive days decreases infarct volumes after ischemic stroke, while modifying microglial activation and the inflammatory response post-stroke. This suggests that inhibitors of solTNF hold great promise for future neuroprotective treatment in ischemic stroke.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: In vivo Probabilistic Structural Atlas of the Inferior and Superior Colliculi, Medial and Lateral Geniculate Nuclei and Superior Olivary Complex in Humans Based on 7 Tesla MRI</title>

	<description>Despite extensive neuroimaging research of primary sensory cortices involved in auditory and visual functions, subcortical structures within these domains, such as the inferior and superior colliculi, the medial and lateral geniculate nuclei and the superior olivary complex, are currently understudied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in living humans. This is because a precise localization of these nuclei is hampered by the limited contrast and sensitivity of conventional neuroimaging methods for deep brain nuclei. In this work, we used 7 Tesla multi-modality (T2-weighted and diffusion fractional anisotropy) 1.1mm isotropic resolution MRI to achieve high sensitivity and contrast for single-subject brainstem and thalamic nuclei delineation. After precise coregistration to stereotactic space, we generated an in vivo human probabilistic atlas of auditory (medial geniculate nucleus, inferior colliculus, and superior olivary complex) and visual (lateral geniculate nucleus and superior colliculus) subcortical nuclei. We foresee the use of this atlas as a tool to precisely identify the location and shape of auditory/visual deep nuclei in research as well as clinical studies.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Curated Model Development Using NEUROiD: A Web-Based NEUROmotor Integration and Design Platform</title>

	<description>Decades of research on neuromotor circuits and systems has provided valuable information on neuronal control of movement.  Computational models of several elements of the neuromotor system have been developed at various scales, from  sub-cellular to system.   While several small models abound, their structured integration is the key to building larger and more biologically realistic models which can predict the behavior of the system in different scenarios.  This effort calls for integration of elements across neuroscience and musculoskeletal biomechanics. There is also a need for development of methods and tools for structured integration that yield larger \textit{in silico} models demonstrating a set of desired system responses.  
We take a small step in this direction with the NEUROmotor integration and Design (NEUROiD) platform.  NEUROiD helps integrate results from motor systems anatomy, physiology, and biomechanics into an integrated neuromotor system model.  Simulation and visualization of the model across multiple scales is supported.  Standard electrophysiological operations such as slicing, current injection, recording of membrane potential and local field potential are part of NEUROiD. The platform allows traceability of model parameters to primary literature.  We illustrate the power and utility of NEUROiD by building a simple ankle model and its controlling neural circuitry by curating a set of published components. NEUROiD allows researchers to utilize remote high-performance computers for simulation, while controlling the model using a web browser.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Space and Memory (Far) Beyond the Hippocampus: Many Subcortical Structures Also Support Cognitive Mapping and Mnemonic Processing</title>

	<description>Memory research remains focused on just a few brain structures – in particular, the hippocampal formation (the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex). Three key discoveries promote this continued focus:  the striking demonstrations of enduring anterograde amnesia after bilateral hippocampal damage; the realisation that synapses in the hippocampal formation are plastic e.g., when responding to short bursts of patterned stimulation (‘long-term potentiation’ or LTP); and the discovery of a panoply of spatially-tuned cells, principally surveyed in the hippocampal formation (place cells coding for position; head-direction cells, providing compass-like information; and grid cells, providing a metric for 3D space). Recent anatomical, behavioural, and electrophysiological work extends this picture to a growing network of subcortical brain structures, including the anterior thalamic nuclei, rostral midline thalamic nuclei, and the claustrum. There are, for example, spatially-tuned cells in all of these regions, including cells with properties similar to place cells of the hippocampus proper. These findings add new perspectives to what had been originally been proposed - but often overlooked - half a century ago: that damage to an extended network of structures connected to the hippocampal formation results in diencephalic amnesia. We suggest these new findings extend spatial signalling in the brain far beyond the hippocampal formation, with profound implications for theories of the neural bases of spatial and mnemonic functions.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor: A Key Molecule for Memory in the Healthy and the Pathological Brain</title>

	<description>Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a key molecule involved in plastic changes related to learning and memory. The expression of BDNF is highly regulated, and can lead to great variability in BDNF levels in healthy subjects. Changes in BDNF expression are associated with both normal and pathological aging and also psychiatric disease, in particular in structures important for memory processes such as the hippocampus and parahippocampal areas. Some interventions like exercise or antidepressant administration enhance the expression of BDNF in normal and pathological conditions. In this review, we will describe studies from rodents and humans to bring together research on how BDNF expression is regulated, how this expression changes in the pathological brain and also exciting work on how interventions known to enhance this neurotrophin could have clinical relevance. We propose that, although BDNF may not be a valid biomarker for neurodegenerative/neuropsychiatric diseases because of its disregulation common to many pathological conditions, it could be thought of as a marker that specifically relates to the occurrence and/or progression of the mnemonic symptoms that are common to many pathological conditions.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Modeling Retinitis Pigmentosa: Retinal Organoids Generated From the iPSCs of a Patient With the USH2A Mutation Show Early Developmental Abnormalities</title>

	<description>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) represents a group of inherited retinopathies with early-onset nyctalopia followed by progressive photoreceptor degeneration causing irreversible vision loss. Mutations in USH2A are the most common cause of nonsyndromic RP. Here, we reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a RP patient with a mutation in USH2A (c.8559-2A&amp;gt;G/c.9127_9129delTCC). Then, multilayer retinal organoids including neural retina (NR) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) were generated by three-step “induction-reversal culture”. The early retinal organoids derived from the RP patient with the USH2A mutation exhibited significant defects in terms of morphology, immunofluorescence staining and transcriptional profiling. To the best of our knowledge, the pathogenic mutation (c.9127_9129delTCC) in USH2A has not been reported previously among RP patients. Notably, the expression of laminin in the USH2A mutation organoids was significantly lower than in the iPSCs derived from healthy, age- and sex-matched controls during the retinal organogenesis. We also observed that abnormal retinal neuroepithelium differentiation and polarization caused defective retinal progenitor cell development and retinal layer formation, disordered organization of neural retinas in the presence of the USH2A mutation. Furthermore, the USH2A mutation bearing RPE cells presented abnormal morphology, lacking pigmented foci and showing an apoptotic trend and reduced expression of specific makers, such as MITF, PEDF and RPE65. In addition, the USH2A mutation organoids had lower expression of cilium-associated (especially CFAP43, PIFO) and dopaminergic synapse-related genes (including DLGAP1, GRIK1, SLC17A7 and SLC17A8), while there was higher expression of neuron apoptotic process-related genes (especially HIF1A, ADARB1 and CASP3). This study may provide essential assistance in the molecular diagnosis and screening of RP. This work recapitulates the pathogenesis of USH2A using patient-specific organoids and demonstrated that alterations in USH2A function due to mutations may lead to cellular and molecular abnormalities.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Exogenous Hydrogen Sulfide Offers Neuroprotection on Intracerebral Hemorrhage Injury Through Modulating Endogenous H2S Metabolism in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00349</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00349</link>
	<description>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a novel gaseous mediator, has been recognized as an important neuromodulator and neuroprotective agent in the central nervous system. The present study was undertaken to study the effects of exogenous H2S on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and the underlying mechanisms. The effects of exogenous H2S on ICH were examined by using measurement of brain edema, behavior assessment, injury volume, propidium iodide (PI) staining, and Western blotting, respectively. ICH induced significant downregulation of endogenous H2S production in the brain, which may be the result of decreasing in CBS, the predominant cerebral H2S-generating enzyme. Administration of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a classical exogenous H2S donor, not only restored brain CBS expression and H2S content but also attenuated brain edema, improved motor performance and ameliorated performance in Morris water maze test after ICH. Immunoblotting results showed that H2S pretreatment reversed ICH-induced cleavage of caspase-3 and decline of Bcl-2, suppressed LC3-II and Beclin-1 activation and maintained p62 level in injured striatum post ICH. However, H2S could not restore brain CBS expression and H2S content, reduce brain edema and improve motor performance and memory function after ICH through modulating autophagy and apoptosis when pretreated with the CBS inhibitor, aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA). We also found that AOAA reduced the endogenous H2S production through inhibiting the enzyme activity of CBS rather than modulating the expression of CBS protein level. These results suggest a protective effect and therapeutic potential of H2S in the treatment of brain injury after ICH and the protective effect of exogenous H2S against ICH may be not a direct action but an indirect effect through inducing endogenous H2S metabolism responses.</description>

	<description>Although the mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease are diverse and unclear, the past 20 years have witnessed the unprecedented development of the AD inflammation theory. As a key inflammatory receptor family, the C-C chemokine receptor family is a remarkable participant in the cause of Alzheimer's disease; of this family, CCR5 is the most widely studied. CCR5 is an essential entrance when HIV infects immune cells and is also involved in other inflammatory and immune activities. New evidence on the inevitably intertwined link between Alzheimer's disease and CCR5 indicates that CCR5 accelerates the development of Alzheimer's disease, and few studies disputed it. The role of CCR5 in Alzheimer's disease remains elusive. However, as the research progresses, this intricate relationship will gradually be uncovered.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Role of Tau as a Microtubule-Associated Protein: Structural and Functional Aspects</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00204</guid>

	<description>Microtubules (MTs) play a fundamental role in many vital processes such as cell division and neuronal activity. They are key structural and functional elements in axons, supporting neurite differentiation and growth, as well as transport along the axons by the motor proteins, which use MTs as support tracks. Tau is a stabilizing MT associated protein, whose functions are mainly regulated by phosphorylation. A disruption of the MT network, which might be caused by Tau loss of function, is observed in a group of related diseases called tauopathies, which includes Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Tau is found hyperphosphorylated in AD, which might account for its loss of MT stabilizing capacity. Since destabilization of MTs after dissociation of Tau could contribute to toxicity in neurodegenerative diseases, a molecular understanding of this interaction and its regulation, is essential.</description>

	<description>Removing or preventing the formation of α-synuclein aggregates is a plausible strategy against Parkinson's disease. To this end we have engineered the β-wrapin AS69 to bind monomeric α-synuclein with high affinity. In cultured cells, AS69 reduced the self-interaction of α-synuclein and the formation of visible α-synuclein aggregates. In flies, AS69 reduced α-synuclein aggregates and the locomotor deficit resulting from α-synuclein expression in neuronal cells. In biophysical experiments in vitro, AS69 highly sub-stoichiometrically inhibited both primary and autocatalytic secondary nucleation processes, even in the presence of a large excess of monomer. We present evidence that the AS69-α-synuclein complex, rather than the free AS69, is the inhibitory species responsible for sub-stoichiometric inhibition of secondary nucleation. These results represent a new paradigm that high affinity monomer binders can lead to strongly sub-stoichiometric inhibition of nucleation processes.</description>

Model-based phylodynamic approaches recently employed generalized linear models (GLMs) to uncover potential predictors of viral spread. Very recently some of these models have allowed both the predictors and their coefficients to be time-dependent. However, these studies mainly focused on predictors that are assumed to be constant through time. Here we inferred the phylodynamics of avian influenza A virus H9N2 isolated in 12 Asian countries and regions under both discrete trait analysis (DTA) and structured coalescent (MASCOT) approaches. Using MASCOT we applied a new time-dependent GLM to uncover the underlying factors behind H9N2 spread. We curated a rich set of time-series predictors including annual international live poultry trade and national poultry production figures. This time-dependent phylodynamic prediction model was compared to commonly employed time-independent alternatives. Additionally the time-dependent MASCOT model allowed for the estimation of viral effective sub-population sizes and their changes through time, and these effective population dynamics within each country were predicted by a GLM. International annual poultry trade is a strongly supported predictor of virus migration rates. There was also strong support for geographic proximity as a predictor of migration rate in all GLMs investigated. In time-dependent MASCOT models, national poultry production was also identified as a predictor of virus genetic diversity through time and this signal was obvious in mainland China. Our application of a recently introduced time-dependent GLM predictors integrated rich time-series data in Bayesian phylodynamic prediction. We demonstrated the contribution of poultry trade and geographic proximity (potentially unheralded wild bird movements) to avian influenza spread in Asia. To gain a better understanding of the drivers of H9N2 spread, we suggest increased surveillance of the H9N2 virus in countries that are currently under-sampled as well as in wild bird populations in the most affected countries.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WuyKSDZx6Cs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

As malignant transformation requires synchronization of growth-driving signaling (S) and metabolic (M) pathways, defining cancer-specific S-M interconnected networks (SMINs) could lead to better understanding of oncogenic processes. In a systems-biology approach, we developed a mathematical model for SMINs in mutated EGF receptor (EGFRvIII) compared to wild-type EGF receptor (EGFRwt) expressing glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Starting with experimentally validated human protein-protein interactome data for S-M pathways, and incorporating proteomic data for EGFRvIII and EGFRwt GBM cells and patient transcriptomic data, we designed a dynamic model for EGFR-driven GBM-specific information flow. Key nodes and paths identified by &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; perturbation were validated experimentally when inhibition of signaling pathway proteins altered expression of metabolic proteins as predicted by the model. This demonstrated capacity of the model to identify unknown connections between signaling and metabolic pathways, explain the robustness of oncogenic SMINs, predict drug escape, and assist identification of drug targets and the development of combination therapies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9vkkfNSOLvI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Longitudinal spinal cord atrophy in multiple sclerosis using the generalised boundary shift integral</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25571?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord atrophy is a clinically relevant feature of multiple sclerosis (MS), but longitudinal assessments on MRI using segmentation‐based methods suffer from measurement variability, especially in multicentre studies. We compared the generalised boundary shift integral (GBSI), a registration‐based method, with standard segmentation‐based method.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baseline and 1‐year spinal cord 3DT1‐weighted images (1mm isotropic) were obtained from 282 patients (52 clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 196 relapsing‐remitting MS (RRMS), 34 progressive MS (PMS)), and 82 controls from eight MAGNIMS sites, on multi‐manufacturer and multi‐field strength scans. Spinal Cord Toolbox was used for C2‐5 segmentation and cross‐sectional area (CSA) calculation. After cord straightening and registration, GBSI measured atrophy based on the probabilistic boundary‐shift region‐of‐interest. CSA and GBSI percent annual volume change was calculated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GBSI provided similar rates of atrophy, but reduced measurement variability than CSA in all MS subtypes (CIS: ‐0.95±2.11% vs. ‐1.19±3.67%; RRMS: ‐1.74±2.57% vs. ‐1.74±4.02%; PMS: ‐2.29±2.40% vs. ‐1.29±3.20%), and healthy controls (0.02±2.39% vs. ‐0.56 ±3.77%). GBSI performed better than CSA in differentiating healthy controls from CIS (AUC=0.66 vs. 0.53; p=0.03), RRMS (AUC=0.73 vs. 0.59; p&amp;lt;0.001), PMS (AUC=0.77 vs. 0.53; p&amp;lt;0.001), and patients with disability progression from patients without progression (AUC=0.59 versus 0.50; p=0.04). Sample size to detect 60% treatment effect on spinal cord atrophy over one year was lower for GBSI than CSA (CIS: 106 vs. 830; RRMS: 95 vs. 335; PMS: 44 vs. 215) (power=80%; alpha=5%).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The registration‐based method (GBSI) allowed better separation between MS patients and healthy controls and improved statistical power, when compared with conventional segmentation‐based method (CSA), though still far from perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Breathing requires precise control of respiratory muscles to ensure adequate ventilation. Neurons within discrete regions of the brainstem produce oscillatory activity to control the frequency of breathing. Less is understood about how spinal and pontomedullary networks modulate the activity of respiratory motor neurons to produce different patterns of activity during different behaviors (i.e., during exercise, coughing, swallowing, vocalizing, or at rest) or following disease or injury. Here, we use a chemogenetic approach to inhibit the activity of glutamatergic V2a neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord of neonatal and adult mice to assess their potential roles in respiratory rhythm generation and patterning respiratory muscle activity. Using whole-body plethysmography (WBP), we show that V2a neuron function is required in neonatal mice to maintain the frequency and regularity of respiratory rhythm. However, silencing V2a neurons in adult mice increases respiratory frequency and ventilation, without affecting regularity. Thus, the excitatory drive provided by V2a neurons is less critical for respiratory rhythm generation in adult compared to neonatal mice. In addition, we used simultaneous EMG recordings of the diaphragm and extradiaphragmatic respiratory muscles in conscious adult mice to examine the role of V2a neurons in patterning respiratory muscle activity. We find that silencing V2a neurons activates extradiaphragmatic respiratory muscles at rest, when they are normally inactive, with little impact on diaphragm activity. Thus, our results indicate that V2a neurons participate in a circuit that serves to constrain the activity of extradiaphragmatic respiratory muscles so that they are active only when needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Sphingomyelin (SM) supports brain myelination, a process closely associated with cognitive maturation. The presence of SM in breast milk suggests a role in infant nutrition; however, little is known about SM contribution to healthy cognitive development. We investigated the link between early life dietary SM, later cognitive development and myelination using an exploratory observational study of neurotypical children. SM levels were quantified in infant nutrition products fed in the first three months of life and associated with myelin content (brain MRI) as well as cognitive development (Mullen scales of early learning; MSEL). Higher levels of SM were significantly associated with higher rates of change in verbal development in the first two years of life (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.65, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), as well as, higher levels of myelin content at 12–24 months, delayed onset and/or more prolonged rates of myelination in different brain areas. Second, we explored mechanisms of action using in vitro models (Sprague Dawley rat pups). In vitro data showed SM treatment resulted in increased proliferation [&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0133 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0434 at 4 and 10 d &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; (DIV)], maturation (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.467 at 4 d DIV) and differentiation (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0123 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0369 at 4 and 10 DIV) of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), as well as increased axon myelination (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0005 at 32 DIV). These findings indicate an impact of dietary SM on cognitive development in healthy children, potentially modulated by oligodendrocytes and increased axon myelination. Future research should include randomized controlled trials to substantiate efficacy of SM for cognitive benefits together with preclinical studies examining SM bioavailability and brain uptake.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Postnatal Increases in Axonal Conduction Velocity of an Identified Drosophila Interneuron Require Fast Sodium, L-Type Calcium and Shaker Potassium Channels</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;During early postnatal life, speed up of signal propagation through many central and peripheral neurons has been associated with an increase in axon diameter or/and myelination. Especially in unmyelinated axons postnatal adjustments of axonal membrane conductances is potentially a third mechanism but solid evidence is lacking. Here, we show that axonal action potential (AP) conduction velocity in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; giant fiber (GF) interneuron, which is required for fast long-distance signal conduction through the escape circuit, is increased by 80% during the first day of adult life. Genetic manipulations indicate that this postnatal increase in AP conduction velocity in the unmyelinated GF axon is likely owed to adjustments of ion channel expression or properties rather than axon diameter increases. Specifically, targeted RNAi knock-down of either Para fast voltage-gated sodium, Shaker potassium (&lt;i&gt;Kv1&lt;/i&gt; homologue), or surprisingly, L-type like calcium channels counteracts postnatal increases in GF axonal conduction velocity. By contrast, the calcium-dependent potassium channel Slowpoke (BK) is not essential for postnatal speeding, although it also significantly increases conduction velocity. Therefore, we identified multiple ion channels that function to support fast axonal AP conduction velocity, but only a subset of these are regulated during early postnatal life to maximize conduction velocity. Despite its large diameter (~7 µm) and postnatal regulation of multiple ionic conductances, mature GF axonal conduction velocity is still 20–60 times slower than that of vertebrate Aβ sensory axons and α motoneurons, thus unraveling the limits of long-range information transfer speed through invertebrate circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Brain oscillations from EEG and MEG shed light on neurophysiological mechanisms of human behavior. However, to extract information on cortical processing, researchers have to rely on source localization methods that can be very broadly classified into current density estimates such as exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA), minimum norm estimates (MNE), and beamformers such as dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS) and linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV). These algorithms produce a distributed map of brain activity underlying sustained and transient responses during neuroimaging studies of behavior. On the other hand, there are very few comparative analyses that evaluates the &quot;ground truth detection&quot; capabilities of these methods. The current article evaluates the reliability in estimation of sources of spectral event generators in the cortex using a two-pronged approach. First, simulated EEG data with point dipoles and distributed dipoles are used to validate the accuracy and sensitivity of each one of these methods of source localization. The abilities of the techniques were tested by comparing the localization error, focal width, false positive (FP) ratios while detecting already known location of neural activity generators under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Second, empirical EEG data during auditory steady state responses (ASSRs) in human participants were used to compare the distributed nature of source localization. All methods were successful in recovery of point sources in favorable signal to noise scenarios and could achieve high hit rates if FPs are ignored. Interestingly, focal activation map is generated by LCMV and DICS when compared to eLORETA while control of FPs is much superior in eLORETA. Subsequently drawbacks and strengths of each method are highlighted with a detailed discussion on how to choose a technique based on empirical requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sex differences and effects of predictive cues on delayed punishment discounting</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The majority of the research studying punishment has focused on an aversive stimulus delivered immediately after an action. However, in real-world decision-making, negative consequences often occur long after a decision has been made. This can engender myopic decisions that fail to appropriately respond to consequences. Whereas discounting of delayed rewards has been well studied in both human and animal models, systematic discounting of delayed consequences remains largely unexplored. To address this gap in the literature, we developed the Delayed Punishment Decision-making Task (DPDT). Rats chose between a small, single pellet reinforcer and a large, three pellet reinforcer accompanied by a mild foot shock. The shock was preceded by a delay, which systematically increased throughout the session (0s, 4s, 8s, 12s, 16s). On average, rats discounted the negative value of delayed punishment, as indicated by increased choice of the large, punished reward as the delay preceding the shock lengthened. Female rats discounted delayed punishment less than males, and this behavior was not influenced by estrous cycling. The addition of a cue light significantly decreased the undervaluation of delayed consequences for both sexes. Finally, there was no correlation between the discounting of delayed punishments and a traditional reward delay discounting task for either sex. These data indicate that the ability of punishment to regulate decision-making is attenuated when punishment occurs later in time. This task provides an avenue for exploration of the neural circuitry underlying the devaluation of delayed punishment and may assist in developing treatments for substance use disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Consequences that occur long after a decision are often undervalued, particularly in substance use disorder. However, &quot;delayed punishment discounting&quot; is widely understudied in decision neuroscience. Here, we present a novel delayed punishment decision-making task in rats that reveals robust sex differences, demonstrates the efficacy of punishment predictive cues for reducing punishment discounting, and shows that punishment discounting is independent of reward-discounting. This provides critical information regarding a cognitive process that can contribute to maladaptive decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Two Pathways for the Activity-Dependent Growth and Differentiation of Synaptic Boutons in Drosophila</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Synapse formation can be promoted by intense activity. At the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ), new synaptic boutons can grow acutely in response to patterned stimulation. We combined confocal imaging with electron microscopy and tomography to investigate the initial stages of growth and differentiation of new presynaptic boutons at the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; NMJ. We found that the new boutons can form rapidly in intact larva in response to intense crawling activity, and we observed two different patterns of bouton formation and maturation. The first pathway involves the growth of filopodia followed by a formation of boutons that are initially devoid of synaptic vesicles (SVs) but filled with filamentous matrix. The second pathway involves rapid budding of synaptic boutons packed with SVs, and these more mature boutons are sometimes capable of exo/endocytosis. We demonstrated that intense activity predominantly promotes the second pathway, i.e. budding of more mature boutons filled with SVs. We also showed that this pathway depends on synapsin (Syn), a neuronal protein which reversibly associates with SVs and mediates their clustering via a protein kinase A (PKA) – dependent mechanism. Finally, we took advantage of the temperature-sensitive mutant &lt;i&gt;sei&lt;/i&gt; to demonstrate that seizure activity can promote very rapid budding of new boutons filled with SVs, and this process occurs at scale of minutes. Altogether, these results demonstrate that intense activity acutely and selectively promotes rapid budding of new relatively mature presynaptic boutons filled with SVs, and that this process is regulated via a PKA/Syn – dependent pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Neurons can grow and form new synapses in response to intense activity. We investigated the stages of synapse formation at intact and dissected &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larvae and identified a very rapid initial step, which is especially sensitive to nerve stimulation. Specifically, we demonstrated that intense activity triggers budding of new synaptic boutons filled with vesicles, and this pathway becomes very prominent under the conditions of pathological activity, such as seizures. We found that this pathway depends on protein kinase A and its target synapsin, the protein regulating clustering of synaptic vesicles. These findings suggest a new function for dynamic vesicle clustering in neuronal development and demonstrate that this mechanism can create a positive feedback loop during seizure activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are rare mammalian photoreceptors essential for non-image-forming vision functions, such as circadian photoentrainment and the pupillary light reflex. They comprise multiple subtypes distinguishable by morphology, physiology, projections, and levels of expression of melanopsin (Opn4), their photopigment. The molecular programs that distinguish ipRGCs from other ganglion cells and ipRGC subtypes from one another remain elusive. Here, we present comprehensive gene expression profiles of early postnatal and adult mouse ipRGCs purified from two lines of reporter mice that mark different sets of ipRGC subtypes. We find dozens of novel genes highly enriched in ipRGCs. We reveal that &lt;i&gt;Rasgrp1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tbx20&lt;/i&gt; are selectively expressed in subsets of ipRGCs, though these molecularly defined groups imperfectly match established ipRGC subtypes. We demonstrate that the ipRGCs regulating circadian photoentrainment are diverse at the molecular level. Our findings reveal unexpected complexity in gene expression patterns across mammalian ipRGC subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; A comprehensive transcriptomic analysis has identified dozens of genes differentially expressed in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, including some linked to signaling, gene regulation, and melanopsin phototransduction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The perirhinal (PER) and lateral entorhinal (LEC) cortex function as a gateway for information transmission between (sub)cortical areas and the hippocampus. It is hypothesized that the amygdala, a key structure in emotion processing, can modulate PER-LEC neuronal activity before information enters the hippocampal memory pathway. This study determined the integration of synaptic activity evoked by simultaneous neocortical and amygdala electrical stimulation in PER-LEC deep layer principal neurons and PV interneurons in mouse brain slices. The data revealed that both deep layer PER-LEC principal neurons and PV interneurons receive synaptic input from the neocortical agranular insular cortex (AiP) and the lateral amygdala (LA). Furthermore, simultaneous stimulation of the AiP and LA never reached the firing threshold in principal neurons of the PER-LEC deep layers. PV interneurons however, mainly showed linear summation of simultaneous AiP and LA inputs and reached their firing threshold earlier. This early PV firing was reflected in the forward shift of the evoked inhibitory conductance in principal neurons, thereby creating a more precise temporal window for coincidence detection which likely plays a crucial role in information processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The perirhinal and lateral entorhinal cortices (PER-LEC) function as a gateway for information transmission between the neocortex and the hippocampus and this information flow can be modulated by the amygdala. Here, we showed that simultaneous input of the neocortex and the amygdala coincided onto principal neurons and PV interneurons of the PER-LEC deep layers. PV interneurons linearly summated these synaptic inputs and reached their firing threshold earlier. This earlier PV firing resulted in an earlier rise of the inhibitory conductance in principal neurons, likely causing a more precise temporal window for excitatory coincidence detection. This process probably indicates a significant role for the inhibitory network in regulating integration of emotion and information for processing in the PER-LEC deep layer network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The mammalian PIM family of serine/threonine kinases regulate several cellular functions, such as cell survival and motility. Since PIM expression is observed in sensory organs, such as olfactory epithelium, we now wanted to explore the physiological roles of PIM kinases there. As our model organism, we used the &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; nematodes, which express two PIM-related kinases, PRK-1 and PRK-2. We demonstrated PRKs to be true PIM orthologs with similar substrate specificity as well as sensitivity to PIM-inhibitory compounds. When we analysed the effects of pan-PIM inhibitors on &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; sensory functions, we observed that PRK activity is selectively required to support olfactory sensations to volatile repellents and attractants sensed by AWB and AWC&lt;sup&gt;ON&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, respectively, but is dispensable for gustatory sensations. Analyses of &lt;i&gt;prk&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mutant strains confirmed these findings and suggested that PRK-1, but not PRK-2 is responsible for the observed effects on olfaction. This regulatory role of PRK-1 is further supported by its observed expression in the head and tail neurons, including AWB and AWC neurons. Based on the evolutionary conservation of PIM-related kinases, our data may have implications in regulation of also mammalian olfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; nematodes provide a useful model organism to study evolutionarily conserved physiological phenomena, such as the roles of kinases in modulation of chemosensory functions, since over 80% of mammalian kinases have orthologs there, including also PIM kinases.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging-driven prediction of brain age, defined as the predicted
biological age of a subject using only brain imaging data, is an exciting
avenue of research. In this work we seek to build models of brain age based on
functional connectivity while prioritizing model interpretability and
understanding. This way, the models serve to both provide accurate estimates of
brain age as well as allow us to investigate changes in functional connectivity
which occur during the ageing process. The methods proposed in this work
consist of a two-step procedure: first, linear latent variable models, such as
PCA and its extensions, are employed to learn reproducible functional
connectivity networks present across a cohort of subjects. The activity within
each network is subsequently employed as a feature in a linear regression model
to predict brain age. The proposed framework is employed on the data from the
CamCAN repository and the inferred brain age models are further demonstrated to
generalize using data from two open-access repositories: the Human Connectome
Project and the ATR Wide-Age-Range.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Characterizing signal encoding and transmission in class I and class II neurons via ordinal time-series analysis. (arXiv:1908.01548v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01548</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01548</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons encode and transmit information in spike sequences. However, despite
the effort devoted to quantify their information content, little progress has
been made in this regard. Here we use a nonlinear method of time-series
analysis (known as ordinal analysis) to compare the statistics of spike
sequences generated by applying an input signal to the neuronal model of
Morris-Lecar. In particular we consider two different regimes for the neurons
which lead to two classes of excitability: class I, where the frequency-current
curve is continuous and class II, where the frequency-current curve is
discontinuous.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By applying ordinal analysis to sequences of inter-spike-intervals (ISIs) our
goals are (1) to investigate if different neuron types can generate spike
sequences which have similar symbolic properties;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) to get deeper understanding on the effects that electrical (diffusive)
and excitatory chemical (i.e., excitatory synapse) couplings have; and (3) to
compare, when a small--amplitude periodic signal is applied to one of the
neurons, how the signal features (amplitude and frequency) are encoded and
transmitted in the generated ISI sequences for both class I and class II type
neurons and electrical or chemical couplings. We find that depending on the
frequency, specific combinations of neuron/class and coupling-type allow a more
effective encoding, or a more effective transmission of the signal.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Divisive Normalization and the Wilson-Cowan equations are influential models
of neural interaction and saturation [Carandini and Heeger Nat.Rev.Neurosci.
2012; Wilson and Cowan Kybernetik 1973]. However, they have not been
analytically related yet. In this work we show that Divisive Normalization can
be obtained from the Wilson-Cowan model. Specifically, assuming that Divisive
Normalization is the steady state solution of the Wilson-Cowan differential
equation, we find that the kernel that controls neural interactions in Divisive
Normalization depends on the Wilson-Cowan kernel but also has a
signal-dependent contribution. A standard stability analysis of a Wilson-Cowan
model with the parameters obtained from our relation shows that the Divisive
Normalization solution is a stable node. This stability demonstrates the
consistency of our steady state assumption, and is in line with the
straightforward use of Divisive Normalization with time-varying stimuli.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed theory provides a physiological foundation (a relation to a
dynamical network with fixed wiring among neurons) for the functional
suggestions that have been done on the need of signal-dependent Divisive
Normalization [e.g. in Coen-Cagli et al., PLoS Comp.Biol. 2012]. Moreover, this
theory explains the modifications that had to be introduced ad-hoc in Gaussian
kernels of Divisive Normalization in [Martinez et al. Front. Neurosci. 2019] to
reproduce contrast responses. The proposed relation implies that the
Wilson-Cowan dynamics also reproduces visual masking and subjective image
distortion metrics, which up to now had been mainly explained via Divisive
Normalization. Finally, this relation allows to apply to Divisive Normalization
the methods which up to now had been developed for dynamical systems such as
Wilson-Cowan networks.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Effect of Signaling Latencies and Node Refractory States on the Dynamics of Networks. (arXiv:1804.07609v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We describe the construction and theoretical analysis of a framework derived
from canonical neurophysiological principles that model the competing dynamics
of incident signals into nodes along directed edges in a network. The framework
describes the dynamics between the offset in the latencies of propagating
signals, which reflect the geometry of the edges and conduction velocities, and
the internal refractory dynamics and processing times of the downstream node
receiving the signals. This framework naturally extends to the construction of
a perceptron model that takes into account such dynamic geometric
considerations. We first describe the model in detail, culminating with the
model of a geometric dynamic perceptron. We then derive upper and lower bounds
for a notion of optimal efficient signaling between vertex pairs based on the
structure of the framework. Efficient signaling in the context of the framework
we develop here means that there needs to be a temporal match between the
arrival time of the signals relative to how quickly nodes can internally
process signals. These bounds reflect numerical constraints on the compensation
of the timing of signaling events of upstream nodes attempting to activate
downstream nodes they connect into that preserve this notion of efficiency.
When a mismatch between signal arrival times and the internal states of
activated nodes occurs, it can cause a break down in the signaling dynamics of
the network. In contrast to essentially all the current state of the art in
machine learning, this work provides a theoretical foundation for machine
learning and intelligence architectures based on the timing of node activations
and their abilities to respond, rather than necessary changes in synaptic
weights. At the same time, this work is guiding the discovery of experimentally
testable new structure-function principles in the biological brain.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Injection of α-syn-98 Aggregates Into the Brain Triggers α-Synuclein Pathology and an Inflammatory Response</title>

	<description>Pathological aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) is a major component of Lewy bodies (LB) which play a central role in pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Differential expression of α-syn isoforms has been shown in PD. Isoform α-syn98 is generated by excision of exon-3 and exon-5 of the α-syn gene. In contrast to the canonical full-length α-syn isoform (α-syn140), little is known about function of the α-syn98 isoform. In the present study, to identify the potential role of α-syn98 protein in PD, we examined effects of exogenous recombinant insoluble α-syn98 aggregates on α-syn pathology and inflammatory responses in the midbrain. After injection of α-syn98 aggregates into the substantia nigra (SN), mice exhibited motor dysfunction accompanied by nigral dopaminergic neuron loss. In addition, α-syn98 aggregates injection resulted in a significant increase in phosphorylation of endogenous α-syn. Accumulations of α-syn were co-localized with p62 and ubiquitin, which suggests α-syn98 aggregates-induced pathology exhibits properties similar to human LB. Many glial cells were activated after α-syn98 aggregates injection. In addition, expression of NF-κB, interleukin 6 (IL6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and levels of oxidative stress increased after α-syn98 aggregates injection. Our results suggest that α-syn98 may play a crucial role in pathogenesis of PD.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Emerging Evidence of Macrophage Contribution to Hyperinnervation and Nociceptor Sensitization in Vulvodynia</title>

	<description>Vulvodynia is an idiopathic chronic pain disorder and a leading cause of dyspareunia, or pain associated with sexual intercourse, for women. The key pathophysiological features of vulvodynia are vaginal hyperinnervation and nociceptor sensitization. These features have been described consistently by research groups over the past 30 years, but currently there is no first-line recommended treatment that targets this pathophysiology. Instead, psychological interventions, pelvic floor physiotherapy and surgery to remove painful tissue are recommended, as these are the few interventions that have shown some benefit in clinical trials. Recurrence of vulvodynia is frequent, even after vestibulectomy and questions regarding etiology remain. Vestibular biopsies from women with vulvodynia contain increased abundance of immune cells including macrophages as well as increased numbers of nerve fibers. Macrophages have multiple roles in the induction and resolution of inflammation and their function can be broadly described as pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory depending on their polarization state. This state is not fixed and can alter rapidly in response to the microenvironment. Essentially, M1, or classically activated macrophages, produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and promote nociceptor sensitization and mechanical allodynia, whereas M2, or alternately activated macrophages produce anti-inflammatory cytokines and promote functions such as wound healing. Signaling between macrophages and neurons has been shown to promote axonal sprouting and nociceptor sensitization. This mini review considers emerging evidence that macrophages may play a role in nociceptor sensitization and hyperinnervation relevant to vulvodynia and considers the implications for development of new therapeutic strategies.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Brain Derived Neurotropic Factors in Speed vs. Inclined Treadmill in Young Adult Healthy Male With Occult Balance Disorder</title>

	<description>Background: Fall risk has increased among elders and young adult sequentially prior to any cause. Occult balance disorder may become one of the morbidity cause of fall in young adult and eventually to elders. Occult balance can be predicted by one leg stance test as an evidenced test to measure static balance function which leading to dynamic balance function. Treadmill exercise has been proven as a dynamic balance exercise aside from cardiopulmonary exercise. As inclination and speed are the components of treadmill exercise, supposingly increase the balance function through the the act of brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF).  Brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) was one of tropic hormones produced in neuron, muscle, hematopoietic tissue characterized in neurons morphology regulation and neuroplasticity. Material and method: 20 healthy young adult men were included, divided to inclination and speed treadmill exercise groups. We observed the immediate effect of serum BDNF in blood as first blood drawn for BDNF taken before exercise and 30 minutes after exercise at the first training, second blood drawn taken before exercise and  30 minutes after exercise at the last training in 2nd  week completion of treadmill exercise. Result: Significant increased of serum BDNF value in speed group before exercise first day and before exercise last day (p=0,001), after exercise first day and after exercise last day (p=0,001). No significant increase of BDNF serum at speed group before exercise first day and after exercise first day (p=0,159), before exercise last day and after exercise last day (p=0,892). There were no significant increase BDNF serum at inclination group at all parameters (p&amp;gt;0,05). BDNF serum was an actual neurotropic factor affect not only neuronal system, but also molecular energy and metabolism regulation. BDNF serum production depend on the aerobic capacity, lactate production, muscle calcium uptake, and muscle fiber type used in exercise. Treadmill exercise with gradual speed increase the BDNF serum in blood stream that also reflect the BDNF percentage in brain. Conclusion: Treadmill exercise with gradual escalation of speed increase the BDNF serum</description>

	<description>Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a clinical syndrome that encompasses all forms of cognitive deficits caused by cerebrovascular disease, from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. Vascular dementia (VD),the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD), accounts for approximately 20% of dementia patients.Ferroptosis is a recently defined iron-dependent form of cell death, which is distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy and other forms of cell death. Emerging evidence suggested that ferroptosis has significant implications in neurological diseases such as stroke, traumatic brain injury and AD.And  ferroptosis inhibition have obvious neuroprotective effect and ameliorate cognitive impairment in various animals models . Here,we summarizes the underlying mechanisms of ferroptosis, and reviews the close relationship between ferroptosis and VCI.</description>

	<description>Patients who survive brain injuries may develop Disorders of Consciousness (DOC) such as Coma,  Vegetative State (VS) or Minimally Conscious State (MCS). Unfortunately, the rate of misdiagnosis between VS and MCS due to clinical judgment is high. Therefore, diagnostic decision support systems aiming to correct any differentiation between VS and MCS are essential for the characterization of an adequate treatment and an effective prognosis. In recent decades, there has been a growing interest in the new EEG computational techniques. We have reviewed how resting-state EEG is computationally analyzed to support differential diagnosis between VS and MCS in view of applicability of these methods in clinical practice. The studies available so far have used different techniques and analyses; it is therefore hard to draw general conclusions. Studies using a discriminant analysis with a combination of various factors and reporting a cut-off are among the most interesting ones for a future clinical application.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: The Use of Biomarkers and Genetic Screening to Diagnose Frontotemporal Dementia: Evidence and Clinical Implications</title>

	<description>Within the wide range of neurodegenerative brain diseases, the differential diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) frequently poses a challenge. Often, signs and symptoms are not characteristic of the disease and may instead reflect atypical presentations. Consequently, the use of disease biomarkers is of importance to correctly identify the patients.. 
Here, we describe how neuropsychological characteristics, neuroimaging and neurochemical biomarkers and screening for causal gene mutations can be used to differentiate FTD from other neurodegenerative diseases as well as to distinguish between FTD subtypes. Summarizing current evidence, we propose a stepwise approach in the diagnostic evaluation.
Clinical consensus criteria that take into account a full neuropsychological examination have relatively good accuracy (sensitivity [se] 75-95%, specificity [sp] 82-95%) to diagnose FTD, although misdiagnosis (mostly AD) is common. Structural brain MRI (se 70-94%, sp 89-99%) and FDG PET (se 47-90%, sp 68-98%) or SPECT (se 36-100%, sp 41-100%) brain scans greatly increase diagnostic accuracy, showing greater involvement of frontal and anterior temporal lobes, with sparing of hippocampi and medial temporal lobes. If these results are inconclusive, we suggest detecting amyloid and tau cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers that can indicate the presence of AD with good accuracy (se 74-100%, sp 82-97%). The use of P-tau181 and the Aβ1–42/ Aβ1–40 ratio significantly increases the accuracy of correctly identifying FTD vs AD. Alternatively, an amyloid brain PET scan can be performed to differentiate FTD from AD.   
When autosomal dominant inheritance is suspected, or in early onset dementia, mutation screening of causal genes is indicated and may also be offered to at-risk family members. We have summarized genotype-phenotype correlations for several genes that are known to cause familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), which is the neuropathological substrate of FTD. The genes most commonly associated with this disease (C9orf72, MAPT, GRN, TBK1) are discussed, as well as some less frequent ones (CHMP2B, VCP). 
Several other techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging, tau PET imaging and measuring serum neurofilament levels, show promise for future implementation as diagnostic biomarkers.</description>

	<description>The neural interface is a critical factor in governing efficient and safe charge transfer between a stimulating electrode and biological tissue. The interface plays a crucial role in the efficacy of electric stimulation in chronic implants and both electromechanical properties and biological properties shape this.  In the case of cochlear implants, it has long been recognized that neurotrophins can stimulate growth of the target auditory nerve fibers into a favorable apposition with the electrode array, and recently such arrays have been re-purposed to enable electrotransfer (electroporation)-based neurotrophin gene augmentation to improve the ‘bionic ear’. For both this acute bionic array-directed electroporation and for chronic conventional cochlear implant arrays, the electric fields generated in target tissue during pulse delivery are central to efficacy, but are challenging to map. We present a computational model for predicting electric fields generated by array-driven DNA electrotransfer in the cochlea. The anatomically-realistic model geometry was reconstructed from magnetic resonance images of the guinea pig cochlea and an eight-channel electrode array embedded within this geometry. The model incorporates a description of both Faradaic and non-Faradaic mechanisms occurring at the electrode-electrolyte interface with frequency dependency optimized to match experiment impedance spectrometry measurements. Our simulations predict that a tandem electrode configuration with four ganged cathodes and four ganged anodes produces three- to four-fold larger area in target tissue where the electric field is within the range for successful gene transfer compared to an alternate paired anode-cathode electrode configuration. These findings matched in vivo transfection efficacy of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter following array-driven electrotransfer of the reporter-encoding plasmid DNA. This confirms utility of the developed model as a tool to optimize the safety and efficacy of electroporation protocols for delivery of neurotrophin growth factors, with the ultimate aim of using gene augmentation approaches to improve the characteristics of the electrode-neural interfaces in chronically-implanted neurostimulation devices.</description>

	<description>Brain injuries causing chronic sensory or motor deficit, such as stroke, are among the leading causes of disability worldwide, according to the World Health Organization; furthermore, they carry heavy social and economic burdens due to decreased quality of life and need of assistance. Given the limited effectiveness of rehabilitation, novel therapeutic strategies are required to enhance functional recovery. Since cell-based approaches have emerged as an intriguing and promising strategy to promote brain repair, many efforts have been made to study the functional integration of neurons  derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), or fetal neurons, after grafting into the damaged host tissue. 
PSCs hold great promises for their clinical applications, such as cellular replacement of damaged neural tissues with autologous neurons. They also offer the possibility to create in vitro models to assess the efficacy of drugs and therapies. Notwithstanding these potential applications, PSC-derived transplanted neurons have to match the precise sub-type, positional and functional identity of the lesioned neural tissue. Thus, the requirement of highly specific and efficient differentiation protocols of PSCs in neurons with appropriate neural  identity constitutes the main challenge limiting the clinical use of stem cells in the near future.
In this Review, we discuss the recent advances in the derivation of telencephalic (cortical and hippocampal) neurons from PSCs, assessing specificity and efficiency of the differentiation protocols, with particular emphasis on the genetic  and molecular characterization of PSC-derived neurons. Second, we address the remaining challenges for cellular replacement therapies in cortical brain injuries, focusing on electrophysiological properties, functional integration and therapeutic effects of the transplanted neurons.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping and Resting State Network Analyses in Parkinsonian Phenotypes—A Systematic Review of the Literature</title>

	<description>An imbalance of iron metabolism with consecutive aggregation of α-synuclein and an axonal degeneration of neurons has been postulated as main pathological feature in the development of Parkinson's disease. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a new imaging technique, which enables to measure structural changes caused by defective iron deposition in parkinsonian brains. Due to its novelty, its potential for disease specific characterisation of motor and non-motor symptoms (characterizing the individual parkinsonian phenotype) as new imaging technique remains elusive. Functional network changes associated with these symptoms are however frequently described for both, magnetoencephalography (MEG) and resting state functional magnetic imaging (rs-fMRI). 
Here, we performed a systematic review of the current literature about QSM imaging, MEG and rs-fMRI in order to collect existing data about structural and functional changes caused by motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. 
Whereas all three techniques provide an affection in the motor domain, the understanding of network changes caused by non-motor symptoms is much more lacking for MEG and rs-fMRI, and do not yet really exist for QSM imaging. 
In order to better understand the influence of pathological iron distribution onto the functional outcome, whole brain QSM analyses should be integrated in functional analyses (especially for the non-motor domain), to enable a proper pathophysiological interpretation of MEG and rs-fMRI network changes in Parkinson's disease. Herewith, a better understanding of the relationship between neuropathological changes, functional network changes and clinical phenotype might become possible.</description>

	<description>The inflammatory response plays a pivotal role in blood-brain barrier (BBB) destruction following ischemic brain injury. Enhanced leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelial cells is an essential event in the inflammatory process. TMEM16A, a newly discovered protein regulating calcium-activated chloride channels, is widely expressed in eukaryotes. Recent studies have suggested that upregulated expression of TMEM16A is associated with the occurrence and development of many diseases. However, the role of TMEM16A in regulating BBB integrity after ischemic stroke has not been fully investigated. In this study, we found that TMEM16A is mainly expressed in brain endothelial cells and upregulated after ischemic stroke in the mouse brain. Caccinh-A01, an TMEM16A inhibitor that reduced its upregulation, attenuated brain infarct size and neurological deficits after ischemic stroke. ICAM-1 and MPO expression and BBB permeability were decreased after TMEM16A inhibitor administration. In addition, TMEM16A silencing rescued oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced transendothelial permeability in vitro accompanied by decreased ICAM-1 expression and leukocyte adhesion. Furthermore, our mechanistic study showed that TMEM16A knockdown alleviated NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation, indicating that TMEM16A knockdown downregulated OGD/R-induced ICAM-1 expression in an NF-κB-dependent manner. Finally, NF-κB inhibitor treatment also alleviated OGD/R-induced BBB permeability, confirming that activated NF-κB and increased ICAM-1 are essential factors involved in ischemia-induced BBB damage. Thus, our research provides a promising treatment strategy against BBB destruction after ischemic stroke, and TMEM16A may become a potential target for the treatment of ischemic stroke.</description>

	<description>Glutamate uptake is a process mediated by sodium-dependent glutamate transporters, preventing glutamate spillover from the synapse. Typically, astrocytes express higher amounts of glutamate transporters, thus being responsible for most of the glutamate uptake; nevertheless, neurons can also express these transporters, albeit in smaller concentrations. When not regulated, glutamate uptake can lead to neuronal death. Indeed, the majority of the studies regarding glutamate transporters have focused on excitotoxicity and the subsequent neuronal loss. However, later studies have found that glutamate uptake is not a static process, evincing a possible correlation between this phenomenon and the efficiency of synaptic transmission and plasticity. In this review, we will focus on the role of the increase in glutamate uptake that occurs during long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, as well as on the impairment of long-term depression (LTD) under the same conditions. The mechanism underpinning the modulatory effect of glutamate transporters over synaptic plasticity still remains unascertained; yet, it appears to have a more prominent effect over the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), despite changes in other glutamate receptors may also occur.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: A Derived Positional Mapping of Inhibitory Subtypes in the Somatosensory Cortex</title>

	<description>Obtaining a catalog of cell-types is a fundamental building block for understanding the brain. The ideal classification of cell-types is based on the profile of molecules expressed by a cell, in particular the profile of genes expressed. One strategy is therefore to obtain as many single-cell transcriptomes as possible and isolate clusters of neurons with similar gene expression profiles. In this study, we explored an alternative strategy. We explored whether cell-types can be algorithmically derived by combining protein tissue stains with transcript expression profiles on 3D space. We developed an algorithm that aims to distribute cell-types in the different layers of a column of cortical tissue of the developing rat constrained by the tissue- and cellular level data. We found that the spatial distribution of major inhibitory cell types can be approximated using the available data. The result is a mini atlas of inhibitory cell-types of the rat somatosensory cortex. In principle, any data that constrains what can occur in a particular part of the brain can also strongly constrain the derivation of cell-types. This draft inhibitory cell-type mapping is therefore dynamic and can iteratively converge towards the ground truth as further data is integrated. It is made available as a public resource and open for collaborative improvement. The approach developed should scale to the whole brain. 
Neurons are known to express particular combinations of molecules, which can be used as markers to classify different cell types (Rudy et al. 2011). However, we still lack actual numbers of each type of interneuron through the cortical depth. This is largely due to the time-consuming methods classically used, which rely on large-scale sampling and characterization of cellular composition. To overcome these challenges and to systematically describe cellular composition throughout the cortical depth, we apply a marker-fitting method that combines immunohistochemistry data with RNA transcript expression (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR) profiles of individual cells to predict interneuron cell types. We show the layer-dependent distribution of major inhibitory cell types can be predicted in P14 rat somatosensory cortex, based on protein and transcriptome markers.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Distribution of α7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Subunit mRNA in the Developing Mouse</title>

	<description>Homomeric α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are abundantly expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system (CNS and PNS, respectively), and spinal cord. In addition, expression and functional responses have been reported in non-neuronal tissue. In the nervous system, α7 nAChR subunit expression appears early during embryonic development and is often transiently upregulated, but little is known about their prenatal expression outside of the nervous system.  For understanding potential short-term and long-term effects of gestational nicotine exposure, it is important to know the temporal and spatial expression of α7 nAChRs throughout the body. To that end, we studied the expression of α7 nAChR subunit mRNA using highly sensitive isotopic in situ hybridization in embryonic and neonatal whole-body mouse sections starting at gestational day 13.  The results revealed expression of α7 mRNA as early as embryonic day 13 in the PNS, including dorsal root ganglia, parasympathetic and sympathetic ganglia, with the strongest expression in the superior cervical ganglion, and low to moderate levels were detected in brain and spinal cord, respectively, which rapidly increased in intensity with embryonic age. In addition, robust α7 mRNA expression was detected in the adrenal medulla, and low to moderate expression in selected peripheral tissues during embryonic development, potentially related to cells derived from the neural crest. Little or no mRNA expression was detected in thymus or spleen, sites of immune cell maturation. The results suggest that prenatal nicotine exposure could potentially affect cells in neuronal tissue with limited effects in non-neural tissues.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Genetic Silencing of Fatty Acid Desaturases Modulates α-Synuclein Toxicity and Neuronal Loss in Parkinson-Like Models of C. elegans</title>

	<description>The molecular basis of Parkinson’s (PD) disease is currently unknown. There is increasing evidence that fat metabolism is at the crossroad of key molecular pathways associated with the pathophysiology of PD. Fatty acid desaturases catalyze synthesis of saturated fatty acids from monounsaturated fatty acids thereby mediating several cellular mechanisms that are associated with diseases including cancer and metabolic disorders. The role of desaturases in modulating age related neurodegenerative manifestations such as PD is poorly understood. Here we investigated the effect of silencing Δ9 desaturase enzyme encoding fat-5 and fat-7 genes which are known to reduce fat content, on α-synuclein expression, neuronal morphology and dopamine related behaviors in transgenic PD-like models of C. elegans. The silencing of the fat-5 and fat-7 genes rescued both degeneration of dopamine neurons and deficits in dopamine-dependent behaviors, including basal slowing and ethanol avoidance in worm models of PD. Similarly, silencing of these genes also decreased the formation of protein aggregates in a nematode model of PD expressing α-synuclein in the body wall muscles and rescued deficits in resistance to heat and osmotic stress. On the contrary, silencing of nhr-49 and tub-1 genes that are known to increase total fat content did not alter behavioral and pathological endpoints in the PD worm strains. Interestingly, the genetic manipulation of all four selected genes resulted in differential fat levels in the PD models without having significant effect on the lifespan, further indicating a complex fat homeostasis unique to neurodegenerative pathophysiology. Overall, we provide a comprehensive understanding of how Δ9 desaturase can alter PD-like pathology due to environmental exposures and proteotoxic stress, suggesting new avenues in deciphering the disease etiology and possible therapeutic targets.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Association of Blood Pressure Variability and Intima-Media Thickness With White Matter Hyperintensities in Hypertensive Patients</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00192</link>
	<description>Background and Purpose: Ambulatory blood pressure variability (ABPV), ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) are closely associated with  white matter hyperintensities (WMH), few studies focused on establishing  effective models based on ABP, ABPV and IMT to predict the WMH burden, we aimed to evaluate the value of predictive model based on metrics of ABP, ABPV and IMT which were independently associated with the WMH burden.
Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 140 hypertensive inpatients for physical examinations in Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine between February, 2018 to January, 2019. The basic clinical information of all subjects were recorded and we also collected the metrics of  ABP, ABPV and IMT.  Patients with Fazekas scale grade ≥2 were classified into heavy burden of WMH group.  Then we analyzed the association between all characteristics and the WMH burden. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess whether metrics of ABP, ABPV and IMT were independently associated with WMH and we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) to evaluate the value of predictive model based on metrics of ABP, ABPV and IMT. 
Results: Higher WMH grade was associated with increasing age, diabetes mellitus, higher TC, higher LDL, higher IMT, higher 24-hSBP, higher daytime SBP, higher nocturnal SBP, 24-h and daytime SD of SBP, and 24-h SBP weight SD; 24-h SBP, 24-h SBP-SD and IMT were independently related to the burden of WMH even after adjusting for the clinical variables; In addition, we also established a model which has a higher predictive capacity using 24-h SBP, 24-h SBP-SD and IMT in ROC analysis to assess the WMH burden in hypertensive patients.
Conclusions: Higher 24-h SBP, higher 24-h SBP-SD, and larger IMT were independently associated with greater burden of WMH among elderly Asian primary hypertension patients, establishing a model based on these factors might provide a new approach for enhancing the accuracy of diagnosis of WMH using metrics in 24-h ABPM and carotid ultrasound.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Tyr1 phosphorylation promotes phosphorylation of Ser2 on the C-terminal domain of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II by P-TEFb</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.48725</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/48725</link>
	<description>The Positive Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb) phosphorylates Ser2 residues of C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit (RPB1) of RNA polymerase II and is essential for the transition from transcription initiation to elongation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Surprisingly, P-TEFb exhibits Ser5 phosphorylation activity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. The mechanism garnering Ser2 specificity to P-TEFb remains elusive and hinders understanding of the transition from transcription initiation to elongation. Through &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; reconstruction of CTD phosphorylation, mass spectrometry analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis, we uncover a mechanism by which Tyr1 phosphorylation directs the kinase activity of P-TEFb and alters its specificity from Ser5 to Ser2. The loss of Tyr1 phosphorylation causes an accumulation of RNA polymerase II in the promoter region as detected by ChIP-seq. We demonstrate the ability of Tyr1 phosphorylation to generate a heterogeneous CTD modification landscape that expands the CTD’s coding potential. These findings provide direct experimental evidence for a combinatorial CTD phosphorylation code wherein previously installed modifications direct the identity and abundance of subsequent coding events by influencing the behavior of downstream enzymes.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Linking Individual Movements to a Skilled Repertoire: Fast Modulation of Motor Synergies by Repetition of Stereotyped Movements</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Motor skills emerge when practicing individual movements enables the motor system to extract building instructions that facilitate the generation of future diverse movements. Here we asked how practicing stereotyped movements for minutes affects motor synergies that encode human motor skills acquired over years of training. Participants trained a kinematically highly constrained combined index-finger and thumb movement. Before and after training, finger movements were evoked at rest by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Post-training, the angle between posture vectors describing TMS-evoked movements and the training movements temporarily decreased, suggesting the presence of a short-term memory for the trained movement. Principal component analysis was used to identify joint covariance patterns in TMS-evoked movements. The quality of reconstruction of training or grasping movements from linear combinations of a small subset of these TMS-derived synergies was used as an index of neural efficiency of movement generation. The reconstruction quality increased for the trained movement but remained constant for grasping movements. These findings suggest that the motor system rapidly reorganizes to enhance the coding efficiency of a difficult movement without compromising the coding efficiency of overlearned movements. Practice of individual movements may drive an unsupervised bottom-up process that ultimately shapes synergistic neuronal organization by constant competition of action memories.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>There are three neural feedback pathways to the primary visual cortex (V1): corticocortical, pulvinocortical, and cholinergic. What are the respective functions of these three projections? Possible functions range from contextual modulation of stimulus processing and feedback of high-level information to predictive processing (PP). How are these functions subserved by different pathways and can they be integrated into an overarching theoretical framework? We propose that corticocortical and pulvinocortical connections are involved in all three functions, whereas the role of cholinergic projections is limited by their slow response to stimuli.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Reduced model to predict thrombin and fibrin during thrombosis on collagen/tissue factor under venous flow: Roles of γ’-fibrin and factor XIa</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jason Chen, Scott L. Diamond&lt;/p&gt;

During thrombosis, thrombin generates fibrin, however fibrin reversibly binds thrombin with low affinity E-domain sites (K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.8 μM) and high affinity γ’-fibrin sites (K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.1 μM). For blood clotting on collagen/tissue factor (1 TF-molecule/μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) at 200 s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; wall shear rate, high μM-levels of intraclot thrombin suggest robust prothrombin penetration into clots. Setting intraclot zymogen concentrations to plasma levels (and neglecting cofactor rate limitations) allowed the linearization of 7 Michaelis-Menton reactions between 6 species to simulate intraclot generation of: Factors FXa (via TF/VIIa or FIXa), FIXa (via TF/FVIIa or FXIa), thrombin, fibrin, and FXIa. This reduced model [7 rates, 2 K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;’s, enzyme half-lives~1 min] predicted the measured clot elution rate of thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) and fragment F1.2 in the presence and absence of the fibrin inhibitor Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro. To predict intraclot fibrin reaching 30 mg/mL by 15 min, the model required fibrinogen penetration into the clot to be strongly diffusion-limited (actual rate/ideal rate = 0.05). The model required free thrombin in the clot (~100 nM) to have an elution half-life of ~2 sec, consistent with measured albumin elution, with most thrombin (&amp;gt;99%) being fibrin-bound. Thrombin-feedback activation of FXIa became prominent and reached 5 pM FXIa at &amp;gt;500 sec in the simulation, consistent with anti-FXIa experiments. In predicting intrathrombus thrombin and fibrin during 15-min microfluidic experiments, the model revealed “cascade amplification” from 30 pM levels of intrinsic tenase to 15 nM prothrombinase to 15 μM thrombin to 90 μM fibrin. Especially useful for multiscale simulation, this reduced model predicts thrombin and fibrin co-regulation during thrombosis under flow.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8Nw3gP6JH3k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Seemingly minor details of mathematical and computational models of evolution are known to change the effect of population structure on the outcome of evolutionary processes. For example, birth-death dynamics often result in amplification of selection, while death-birth processes have been associated with suppression. In many biological populations the interaction structure is not static. Instead, members of the population are in motion and can interact with different individuals at different times. In this work we study populations embedded in a flowing medium; the interaction network is then time dependent. We use computer simulations to investigate how this dynamic structure affects the success of invading mutants, and compare these effects for different coupled birth and death processes. Specifically, we show how the speed of the motion impacts the fixation probability of an invading mutant. Flows of different speeds interpolate between evolutionary dynamics on fixed heterogeneous graphs and well-stirred populations; this allows us to systematically compare against known results for static structured populations. We find that motion has an active role in amplifying or suppressing selection by fragmenting and reconnecting the interaction graph. While increasing flow speeds suppress selection for most evolutionary models, we identify characteristic responses to flow for the different update rules we test. In particular we find that selection can be maximally enhanced or suppressed at intermediate flow speeds.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NoRzxfIPq78&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Julia Jade Harris, Elisabeth Engl, David Attwell, Renaud Blaise Jolivet&lt;/p&gt;

We have previously shown that the physiological size of postsynaptic currents maximises energy efficiency rather than information transfer across the retinothalamic relay synapse. Here, we investigate information transmission and postsynaptic energy use at the next synapse along the visual pathway: from relay neurons in the thalamus to spiny stellate cells in layer 4 of the primary visual cortex (L4SS). Using both multicompartment Hodgkin-Huxley-type simulations and electrophysiological recordings in rodent brain slices, we find that increasing or decreasing the postsynaptic conductance of the set of thalamocortical inputs to one L4SS cell decreases the energy efficiency of information transmission from a single thalamocortical input. This result is obtained in the presence of random background input to the L4SS cell from excitatory and inhibitory corticocortical connections, which were simulated (both excitatory and inhibitory) or injected experimentally using dynamic-clamp (excitatory only). Thus, energy efficiency is not a unique property of strong relay synapses: even at the relatively weak thalamocortical synapse, each of which contributes minimally to the output firing of the L4SS cell, evolutionarily-selected postsynaptic properties appear to maximise the information transmitted per energy used.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/e0Kf8m4eeWA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Colony entropy—Allocation of goods in ant colonies</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Efrat Greenwald, Jean-Pierre Eckmann, Ofer Feinerman&lt;/p&gt;

Allocation of goods is a key feature in defining the connection between the individual and the collective scale in any society. Both the process by which goods are to be distributed, and the resulting allocation to the members of the society may affect the success of the population as a whole. One of the most striking natural examples of a highly successful cooperative society is the ant colony which often acts as a single superorganism. In particular, each individual within the ant colony has a “communal stomach” which is used to store and share food with the other colony members by mouth to mouth feeding. Sharing food between communal stomachs allows the colony as a whole to get its food requirements and, more so, allows each individual within the colony to reach its nutritional intake target. The vast majority of colony members do not forage independently but obtain their food through secondary interactions in which food is exchanged between individuals. The global effect of this exchange is not well understood. To gain better understanding into this process we used fluorescence imaging to measure how food from a single external source is distributed and mixed within a &lt;i&gt;Camponotus sanctus&lt;/i&gt; ant colony. Using entropic measures to quantify food-blending, we show that while collected food flows into all parts of the colony it mixes only partly. We show that mixing is controlled by the ants’ interaction rule which implies that only a fraction of the maximal potential is actually transferred. This rule leads to a robust blending process: &lt;i&gt;i.e&lt;/i&gt;., neither the exact food volume that is transferred, nor the interaction schedule are essential to generate the global outcome. Finally, we show how the ants’ interaction rules may optimize a trade-off between fast dissemination and efficient mixing. Our results regarding the distribution of a single food source provide a baseline for future studies on distributed regulation of multiple food sources in social insect colonies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xLco488JEoM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Predicting kinase inhibitors using bioactivity matrix derived informer sets</title>

Prediction of compounds that are active against a desired biological target is a common step in drug discovery efforts. Virtual screening methods seek some active-enriched fraction of a library for experimental testing. Where data are too scarce to train supervised learning models for compound prioritization, initial screening must provide the necessary data. Commonly, such an initial library is selected on the basis of chemical diversity by some pseudo-random process (for example, the first few plates of a larger library) or by selecting an entire smaller library. These approaches may not produce a sufficient number or diversity of actives. An alternative approach is to select an informer set of screening compounds on the basis of chemogenomic information from previous testing of compounds against a large number of targets. We compare different ways of using chemogenomic data to choose a small informer set of compounds based on previously measured bioactivity data. We develop this Informer-Based-Ranking (IBR) approach using the Published Kinase Inhibitor Sets (PKIS) as the chemogenomic data to select the informer sets. We test the informer compounds on a target that is not part of the chemogenomic data, then predict the activity of the remaining compounds based on the experimental informer data and the chemogenomic data. Through new chemical screening experiments, we demonstrate the utility of IBR strategies in a prospective test on three kinase targets not included in the PKIS.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4qZGRCNb0lI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: RIGHT STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL REORGANIZATION IN 4-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN WITH PERINATAL ARTERIAL ISCHEMIC STROKE PREDICT LANGUAGE PRODUCTION</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging methods have contributed to shed light on the mechanisms of recovery after early brain insult. The assumption that the unaffected right hemisphere can take over language functions after left perinatal stroke is still under debate. Here, we report how patterns of brain structural and functional reorganization were associated with language outcomes in a group of 4-year-old children with left perinatal arterial ischemic stroke. Specifically, we gathered specific fine-grained developmental measures of receptive and productive aspects of language as well as standardized measures of cognitive development. We also collected structural neuroimaging data as well as functional activations during a passive listening story-telling fMRI task and a resting state session (rs-fMRI). Children with a left perinatal stroke showed larger lateralization indices of both structural and functional connectivity of the dorsal language pathway towards the right hemisphere that, in turn, were associated with better language outcomes. Importantly, the pattern of structural asymmetry was significantly more right-lateralized in children with a left perinatal brain insult than in a group of matched healthy controls. These results strongly suggest that early lesions of the left dorsal pathway and the associated perisylvian regions can induce the inter-hemispheric transfer of language functions to right homolog regions. This study provides combined evidence of structural and functional brain reorganization of language networks after early stroke with strong implications for neurobiological models of language development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The prevalent theories explaining the functional recovery of language functions after perinatal ischemic stroke strikingly differ on the role of perilesional functionally spared regions as opposed to the homologous non-affected contralesional brain areas. Here, we assessed how patterns of brain functional and structural reorganization were associated with language outcomes in a group of 4-year-old children with left perinatal arterial ischemic stroke. Larger lateralization indices of both functional and structural connectivity towards the right hemisphere were associated with higher levels of language development. Thus, inter-hemispheric plasticity through structural and functional hyper-connectivity mechanisms might be crucial in early damage, probably through the degeneration of neurons projecting from temporal to frontal areas together with contralateral axonal sprouting over the right hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: MVPA analysis of intertrial phase coherence of neuromagnetic responses to words reliably classifies multiple levels of language processing in the brain</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Neural processing of language is still among the most poorly understood functions of the human brain, whereas a need to objectively assess the neurocongitve status of the language function in a participant-friendly and noninvasive fashion arises in various situations. Here, we propose a solution for this based on a short task-free recording of MEG responses to a set of spoken linguistic contrasts. We used spoken stimuli that diverged lexically (words/pseudowords), semantically (action-related/abstract) or morphosyntactically (grammatically correct/ungrammatical). Based on beamformer source reconstruction we investigated inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) in five canonical bands (alpha, beta, and low, medium and high gamma) using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). Using this approach, we could successfully classify brain responses to meaningful words from meaningless pseudowords, correct from incorrect syntax, as well as semantic differences. The best classification results indicated distributed patterns of activity dominated by core temporofrontal language circuits and complemented by other areas. They varied between the different neurolinguistic properties across frequency bands, with lexical processes classified predominantly by broad gamma, semantic distinctions – by alpha and beta, and syntax – by low gamma feature patterns. Crucially, all types of processing commenced in a near-parallel fashion from ~100 ms after the auditory information allowed for disambiguating the spoken input. This shows that individual neurolinguistic properties take place simultaneously and involve overlapping yet distinct neuronal networks that operate at different frequency bands. This brings further hope that brain imaging can be used to assess neurolinguistic processes objectively and noninvasively in a range of populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; In an MEG study that was optimally designed to test several language features in a non-attentive paradigm, we found that, by analysing cortical source-level inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) in five canonical bands (alpha, beta, and low, medium and high gamma) with machine-learning classification tools (multivariate pattern analysis, MVPA), we could successfully classify meaningful words from meaningless pseudowords, correct from incorrect syntax, and semantic differences between words, based on passive brain responses recorded in a task-free fashion. The results show different time courses for the different processes that involve different frequency bands. It is to our knowledge the first study to simultaneously map and objectively classify multiple neurolinguistics processes in a comparable manner across language features and frequency bands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the connectivity in the brain is an important prerequisite for
understanding how the brain processes information. In the Brain/MINDS project,
a connectivity study on marmoset brains uses two-photon microscopy fluorescence
images of axonal projections to collect the neuron connectivity from defined
brain regions at the mesoscopic scale. The processing of the images requires
the detection and segmentation of the axonal tracer signal. The objective is to
detect as much tracer signal as possible while not misclassifying other
background structures as the signal. This can be challenging because of imaging
noise, a cluttered image background, distortions or varying image contrast
cause problems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are developing MarmoNet, a pipeline that processes and analyzes tracer
image data of the common marmoset brain. The pipeline incorporates
state-of-the-art machine learning techniques based on artificial convolutional
neural networks (CNN) and image registration techniques to extract and map all
relevant information in a robust manner. The pipeline processes new images in a
fully automated way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report introduces the current state of the tracer signal analysis part
of the pipeline.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Distinguishing states of conscious arousal using statistical complexity. (arXiv:1905.13173v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13173</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13173</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We apply techniques from the field of computational mechanics to evaluate the
statistical complexity of neural recording data in fruit flies. We connect
statistical complexity to the flies' level of conscious arousal, which is
manipulated by general anaesthesia (isoflurane). We show that the complexity of
even single channel time series data decreases under anaesthesia. The observed
difference in complexity between the two states of conscious arousal increases
as higher orders of temporal correlations are taken into account. In contrast
to prior work, our results show that complexity differences can emerge at very
short time scales and across broad regions of the fly brain without the need to
saturate Markov order, thus heralding the macroscopic state of anaesthesia in a
previously unforeseen manner. Furthering the links between physics, complexity
science and neuroscience promotes the understanding of the physical basis that
supports the level of conscious arousal in biological organisms.

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Revisiting the MotionWatch8©: Calibrating Cut-Points for Measuring Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Among Adults With Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00203</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00203</link>
	<description>Poor sleep quality, low physical activity (PA), and high sedentary behaviour (SB) are common following stroke, which can limit stroke recovery and contribute to greater cognitive decline post-stroke. There is also increasing evidence that sleep quality, PA, and SB are dynamically related to each other and to cognitive health. Hence, the sleep quality, PA, and SB of adults with stroke should be measured concurrently using objective methods. One currently available method for objectively measuring PA, SB, and sleep is the MotionWatch8© (MW8), a wrist-worn accelerometer we have previously shown has evidence of validity and reliability for healthy older adults. However, adults with stroke can have significant mobility restrictions (depending on stroke severity) and thus it is important to determine separate PA and SB cut-points for adults with stroke, as well as validate separate cut-points 1) when the MW8 is worn on the stroke affected side compared to the non-affected side; and 2) for adults with mild stroke versus adults with moderate-to-severe stroke. In the current study, we concurrently measured MW8 actigraphy (worn on both the stroke affected side and the non-affected side) and indirect calorimetry during 10 different activities of daily living for 43 adults with stroke (aged 55-87 years). Using intra-class correlations, we first investigated the reliability and consistency of the MW8 when placed on the stroke affected side as compared to the non-affected side for 1) all participants irrespective of stroke severity; 2) participants with mild stroke, classified as a Fugl Meyer motor score of ≥ 79/100; and 3) participants with moderate-to-severe stroke (i.e., Fugl Meter &amp;lt; 79/100). We then determined cut-points for all participants—as well as separate cut-points based on stroke severity—on both the stroke affected side and non-affected side for SB, light PA, and moderate-to-vigorous PA using receiver operating characteristic curves. Our results support using different cut-points for the stroke affected side vs. non-affected side, and for different levels of stroke severity. Hence, these data provide a new measure for concurrently examining the dynamic relationships between PA, SB, and sleep quality among adults with stroke.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Beyond the disconnectivity hypothesis of schizophrenia</title>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz161/5543640?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;To go beyond the disconnectivity hypothesis of schizophrenia, directed (effective) connectivity was measured between 94 brain regions, to provide evidence on the source of the changes in schizophrenia and a mechanistic model. Effective connectivity (EC) was measured in 180 participants with schizophrenia and 208 controls. For the significantly different effective connectivities in schizophrenia, on average the forward (stronger) effective connectivities were smaller, whereas the backward connectivities tended to be larger. Further, higher EC in schizophrenia was found from the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) to areas such as the parahippocampal, hippocampal, temporal, fusiform, and occipital cortices. These are backward effective connectivities and were positively correlated with the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Lower effective connectivities were found from temporal and other regions and were negatively correlated with the symptoms, especially the negative and general symptoms. Further, a signal variance parameter was increased for areas that included the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, consistent with the hypothesis that hippocampal overactivity is involved in schizophrenia. This investigation goes beyond the disconnectivity hypothesis by drawing attention to differences in schizophrenia between backprojections and forward connections, with the backward connections from the precuneus and PCC implicated in memory stronger in schizophrenia.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Inter-Individual Differences in Striatal Connectivity Is Related to Executive Function Through Fronto-Parietal Connectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz117</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The striatum has long been associated with cognitive functions, but the mechanisms behind this are still unclear. Here we tested a new hypothesis that the striatum contributes to executive function (EF) by strengthening cortico-cortical connections. Striatal connectivity was evaluated by measuring the resting-state functional connectivity between ventral and dorsal striatum in 570 individuals, aged 3–20 years. Using structural equation modeling, we found that inter-individual differences in striatal connectivity had an indirect effect (via fronto-parietal functional connectivity) and a direct effect on a compound EF measure of working memory, inhibition, and set-shifting/flexibility. The effect of fronto-parietal connectivity on cognition did not depend on age: the influence was as strong in older as younger children. In contrast, striatal connectivity was closely related to changes in cognitive ability during childhood development, suggesting a specific role of the striatum in cognitive plasticity. These results support a new principle for striatal functioning, according to which striatum promotes cognitive development by strengthening of cortico-cortical connectivity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Amylin as a potential link between type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and although its etiology remains unclear, it seems that type two diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and other pre‐diabetic states of insulin resistance could contribute to the appearance of sporadic AD. As such, we have assessed whether tau and Aβ deposits might be present in pancreatic tissue of subjects with AD, and whether amylin, an amyloidogenic protein deposited in the pancreas of T2DM patients, might accumulate in the brain of AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied pancreatic and brain tissue from 48 individuals with no neuropathological alterations, and from 87 subjects diagnosed with AD. We examined Aβ and tau accumulation in the pancreas, as well as that of amylin in the brain. Moreover, we performed proximity ligation assays to ascertain whether tau and/or Aβ interact with amylin in either the pancreas or brain of these subjects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytoplasmic tau and Aβ protein deposits were detected in pancreatic β‐cells of subjects with AD, as well as in subjects with a normal neuropathological examination but with a history of T2DM and in a small cohort of control subjects without T2DM. Furthermore, we found amylin deposits in the brain of these subjects, providing histological evidence that amylin can interact with Aβ and tau in both the pancreas and hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of both tau and Aβ inclusions in pancreatic β cells, and of amylin deposits in the brain, provides new evidence of a potential overlap in the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of T2DM and AD.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether functional sweetspots of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) can predict motor improvement in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulation effects of 449 DBS settings in 21 PD patients were clinically and quantitatively assessed through standardized monopolar reviews and mapped into standard space. A sweetspot for best motor outcome was determined using voxel‐wise and nonparametric permutation statistics. Two independent cohorts were used to investigate whether stimulation overlap with the sweetspot could predict acute motor outcome (10 patients, 163 settings) and long term overall UPDRS‐III improvement (63 patients).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significant clusters for suppression of rigidity and akinesia, as well as for overall motor improvement resided around the dorsolateral border of the STN. Overlap of the volume of tissue activated with the sweetspot for overall motor improvement explained R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=37 % of the variance in acute motor improvement, more than triple to what was explained by overlap with the STN (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=9 %) and its sensorimotor subpart (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=10 %). In the second independent cohort sweetspot overlap explained R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=20 % of the variance in long‐term UPDRS‐III improvement, which was equivalent to the variance explained by overlap to the STN (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=21 %) and sensorimotor STN (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=19 %).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to predict clinical improvement of Parkinsonian motor symptoms across cohorts based on local DBS effects only. The new approach revealed a distinct sweetspot for STN‐DBS in PD. Stimulation overlap with the sweetspot can predict short‐ and long‐term motor outcome and may be used to guide DBS programming.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Imaging gradual neurodegeneration in a basal ganglia model disease</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X‐linked dystonia‐parkinsonism (XDP) is a neurodegenerative disease with adult‐onset dystonia and subsequent parkinsonism. Post‐mortem and imaging studies revealed remarkable striatal pathology with a predominant involvement of the striosomal compartment in the early phase. Here, we aimed to disentangle sequential neurodegeneration in the striatum of XDP patients, to provide evidence for preferential loss of distinct striatal areas in the early phase and to investigate if iron accumulation is present.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used multimodal structural MR imaging (voxel‐based morphometry and relaxometry) in 18 male XDP patients carrying a &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt; mutation and 19 age‐matched male controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voxel‐based relaxometry and morphometry revealed (i) a cluster in the anteromedial putamen showing high iron content and severe atrophy (‐55%), and (ii) a cluster with reduced relaxation rates as a marker for increased water levels and a lower degree of atrophy (‐20%) in the dorsolateral putamen. Iron deposition correlated with the degree of atrophy (rho= ‐.585, p=.011) and disease duration (rho= .632, p= .005) in the anteromedial putamen. In the dorsolateral, sensorimotor putamen atrophy correlated with disease severity (rho= ‐.649, p= .004).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multimodal approach identified a patchy pattern of atrophy within the putamen. Atrophy is advanced and associated with iron accumulation in rostral regions of the striatum, whereas neurodegeneration is moderate and still ongoing in dorsolateral areas. Given the short disease duration and predominant dystonic phenotype, these results are well in line with early and preferential degeneration of striosome‐rich striatal areas in XDP.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess patterns and impact of small nerve fiber dysfunction and pathology in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;117 women with FMS underwent neurological examination, questionnaire assessment, neurophysiology, and small fiber tests: skin punch biopsy, corneal confocal microscopy, microneurography, quantitative sensory testing including C‐tactile afferents, and pain‐related evoked potentials. Data were compared with those of women with major depressive disorder and chronic widespread pain (MD‐P), and healthy women.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) was reduced at different biopsy sites in 63% of FMS patients (MD‐P: 10%, controls: 18%, p&amp;lt;0.001 each). We found four patterns of skin innervation in FMS: normal, distally reduced, proximally reduced, and both distally and proximally reduced (p&amp;lt;0.01 each compared to controls). Microneurography revealed initial activity‐dependent acceleration of conduction velocity upon low frequencies of stimulation in 1A fibers, besides 1B fiber spontaneous activity and mechanical sensitization in FMS patients. FMS patients had elevated warm detection thresholds (p&amp;lt;0.01), impaired C‐tactile afferents (p&amp;lt;0.05), and reduced amplitudes (p&amp;lt;0.001) of pain‐related evoked potentials compared to controls. Compared to FMS patients with normal skin innervation, those with generalized IENFD reduction had higher pain intensity and impairment due to pain, higher disease burden, more stabbing pain and paresthesias, and more anxiety (p&amp;lt;0.05 each). FMS patients with generalized IENFD reduction also had lower corneal nerve fiber density (p&amp;lt;0.01) and length (p&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extent of small fiber pathology is related to symptom severity in FMS. This knowledge may have implications for the diagnostic classification and treatment of patients with FMS.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Reappraising the utility of Google Flu Trends</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Sasikiran Kandula, Jeffrey Shaman&lt;/p&gt;

Estimation of influenza-like illness (ILI) using search trends activity was intended to supplement traditional surveillance systems, and was a motivation behind the development of Google Flu Trends (GFT). However, several studies have previously reported large errors in GFT estimates of ILI in the US. Following recent release of time-stamped surveillance data, which better reflects real-time operational scenarios, we reanalyzed GFT errors. Using three data sources—GFT: an archive of weekly ILI estimates from Google Flu Trends; ILIf: fully-observed ILI rates from ILINet; and, ILIp: ILI rates available in real-time based on partial reporting—five influenza seasons were analyzed and mean square errors (MSE) of GFT and ILIp as estimates of ILIf were computed. To correct GFT errors, a random forest regression model was built with ILI and GFT rates from the previous three weeks as predictors. An overall reduction in error of 44% was observed and the errors of the corrected GFT are lower than those of ILIp. An 80% reduction in error during 2012/13, when GFT had large errors, shows that extreme failures of GFT could have been avoided. Using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, one- to four-week ahead forecasts were generated with two separate data streams: ILIp alone, and with both ILIp and corrected GFT. At all forecast targets and seasons, and for all but two regions, inclusion of GFT lowered MSE. Results from two alternative error measures, mean absolute error and mean absolute proportional error, were largely consistent with results from MSE. Taken together these findings provide an error profile of GFT in the US, establish strong evidence for the adoption of search trends based 'nowcasts' in influenza forecast systems, and encourage reevaluation of the utility of this data source in diverse domains.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vJsq6_Rxi7I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Every which way? On predicting tumor evolution using cancer progression models</title>

Successful prediction of the likely paths of tumor progression is valuable for diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment purposes. Cancer progression models (CPMs) use cross-sectional samples to identify restrictions in the order of accumulation of driver mutations and thus CPMs encode the paths of tumor progression. Here we analyze the performance of four CPMs to examine whether they can be used to predict the true distribution of paths of tumor progression and to estimate evolutionary unpredictability. Employing simulations we show that if fitness landscapes are single peaked (have a single fitness maximum) there is good agreement between true and predicted distributions of paths of tumor progression when sample sizes are large, but performance is poor with the currently common much smaller sample sizes. Under multi-peaked fitness landscapes (i.e., those with multiple fitness maxima), performance is poor and improves only slightly with sample size. In all cases, detection regime (when tumors are sampled) is a key determinant of performance. Estimates of evolutionary unpredictability from the best performing CPM, among the four examined, tend to overestimate the true unpredictability and the bias is affected by detection regime; CPMs could be useful for estimating upper bounds to the true evolutionary unpredictability. Analysis of twenty-two cancer data sets shows low evolutionary unpredictability for several of the data sets. But most of the predictions of paths of tumor progression are very unreliable, and unreliability increases with the number of features analyzed. Our results indicate that CPMs could be valuable tools for predicting cancer progression but that, currently, obtaining useful predictions of paths of tumor progression from CPMs is dubious, and emphasize the need for methodological work that can account for the probably multi-peaked fitness landscapes in cancer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9-CQDeI5DNk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Variability, stochastic or otherwise, is a central feature of neural activity. Yet the means by which estimates of variation and uncertainty are derived from noisy observations of neural activity is often heuristic, with more weight given to numerical convenience than statistical rigour. For two-photon imaging data, composed of fundamentally probabilistic streams of photon detections, the problem is particularly acute. Here, we present a statistical pipeline for the inference and analysis of neural activity using Gaussian Process regression, applied to two-photon recordings of light-driven activity in &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; mouse retina. We demonstrate the flexibility and extensibility of these models, considering cases with non-stationary statistics, driven by complex parametric stimuli, in signal discrimination, hierarchical clustering and other inference tasks. Sparse approximation methods allow these models to be fitted rapidly, permitting them to actively guide the design of light stimulation in the midst of ongoing two-photon experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/d0-u-davlGg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Prominent among such regulatory mechanisms are modifications of histones, along with the ‘writers,’ ‘erasers,’ and ‘readers’ of these modifications. Much of the work delineating these mechanisms has contributed to the idea that a ‘histone code’ may be a central determinant of a gene’s activity and its potential to be activated or repressed in response to environmental perturbations (both beneficial and aberrant). Indeed, increasing evidence has demonstrated the significance of histone regulation in neurological plasticity and disease, although we are still at the earliest stages of examining all of the many potential chromatin changes involved. In this short review, we provide an emerging perspective on putative roles for histones, and their combinatorial readouts, in the context of neural plasticity, and we provide a conceptual framework for future mechanistic studies aimed at uncovering causal links between the neural ‘histone code’ and brain function/disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Learning in brain-computer interface control evidenced by joint decomposition of brain and behavior. (arXiv:1908.00077v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) use an individuals
ability to volitionally modulate localized brain activity as a therapy for
motor dysfunction or to probe causal relations between brain activity and
behavior. However, many individuals cannot learn to successfully modulate their
brain activity, greatly limiting the efficacy of BCI for therapy and for basic
scientific inquiry. Previous research suggests that coherent activity across
diverse cognitive systems is a hallmark of individuals who can successfully
learn to control the BCI. However, little is known about how these distributed
networks interact through time to support learning. Here, we address this gap
in knowledge by constructing and applying a multimodal network approach to
decipher brain-behavior relations in motor imagery-based brain-computer
interface learning using MEG. Specifically, we employ a minimally constrained
matrix decomposition method (non-negative matrix factorization) to
simultaneously identify regularized, covarying subgraphs of functional
connectivity, to assess their similarity to task performance, and to detect
their time-varying expression. Individuals also displayed marked variation in
the spatial properties of subgraphs such as the connectivity between the
frontal lobe and the rest of the brain, and in the temporal properties of
subgraphs such as the stage of learning at which they reached maximum
expression. From these observations, we posit a conceptual model in which
certain subgraphs support learning by modulating brain activity in regions
important for sustaining attention. To test this model, we use tools that
stipulate regional dynamics on a networked system (network control theory), and
find that good learners display a single subgraph whose temporal expression
tracked performance and whose architecture supports easy modulation of brain
regions important for attention.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neuroradiological Changes Following Single or Repetitive Mild TBI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00034</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00034</link>
	<description>Objectives: To test the hypothesis that there are differences in neuroradiological measures between single and repeated mild TBI using multimodal MRI.
Methods: A closed-head momentum exchange model was used to produce one or three mild head injuries in young adult male rats as compared to non-injured, age and weight-matched controls. Six-seven weeks post-injury, rats were studied for deficits in cognitive and motor function.  Seven-eight weeks post-injury changes in brain anatomy and function were evaluated through analysis of high resolution T2 weighted images, resting state BOLD functional connectivity, and diffusion weighted imaging with quantitative anisotropy. 
Results: Head injuries occurred without skull fracture or signs of intracranial bleeding or contusion. There were no significant differences in cognitive or motors behaviors between experimental groups. With a single mild hit, the affected areas were limited to the caudate/putamen and central amygdala.  Rats hit three times showed altered diffusivity in white matter tracts, basal ganglia, central amygdala, brainstem, and cerebellum.  Comparing three hits to one hit showed a similar pattern of change underscoring a dose effect of repeated head injury on the brainstem and cerebellum.  Disruption of functional connectivity was pronounced with three mild hits. The midbrain dopamine system, hippocampus, and brainstem/cerebellum showed hypoconnectivity. Interestingly, rats exposed to one hit showed enhanced functional connectivity (or hyperconnectivity) across brain sites, particularly between the olfactory system and the cerebellum.
Interpretation: Neuroradiological evidence of altered brain structure and function, particularly in striatal and midbrain dopaminergic areas, persists long after mild repetitive head injury. These changes may serve as biomarkers of neurodegeneration and risk for dementia later in life.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Investigating Potential Biomarkers in Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00031</link>
	<description>Background: Early identification and treatment of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) improves outcomes, but specific evidence needed to individualize treatment recommendations is lacking. Biomarkers that could be routinely measured within the clinical setting could potentially transform clinical care for patients with ASD. This demonstration project employed collection of biomarker data during regular autism specialty clinical visits and explored the relationship of biomarkers with clinical ASD symptoms. 
Methods: Eighty-three children with ASD, aged 5-10 years, completed a multi-site feasibility study integrating the collection of biochemical (blood serotonin, urine melatonin sulfate excretion) and clinical (head circumference, dysmorphology exam, digit ratio, cognitive and behavioral function) biomarkers during routine ASD clinic visits. Parents completed a demographic survey and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community. Cognitive function was determined by record review. Data analysis utilized Wilcoxon two-sample tests and Spearman correlations.
Results: Participants were 82% male, 63% White, 19% Hispanic, with a broad range of functioning. Group means indicated hyperserotonemia. In a single regression analysis adjusting for race and median household income, higher income was associated with higher levels of blood serotonin and urine melatonin sulfate excretion levels (p=.004 and p=.04, respectively). Melatonin correlated negatively with age (p= 0.048) and reported neurologic problems (p=0.02). Dysmorphic status correlated with higher reported stereotyped behavior (p=0.02) and inappropriate speech (p=0.04).
Conclusions: This demonstration project employed collection of multiple biomarkers, allowed for examination of associations between biochemical and clinical measures, and identified several findings that suggest direction for future studies. This clinical research model has promise for integrative biomarker research in individuals with complex, heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD.</description>

	<description>Almost 50 million people in the world are affected by dementia; the most prevalent form of which is Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although aging is considered to be the main risk factor for AD, growing evidence from epidemiological studies suggests that Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) increases the risk of dementia including AD. Defective brain insulin signaling has been suggested as an early event  in AD and other tauopathies but the mechanisms that link these diseases are largely unknown. Tau hyperphosphorylation is a hallmark of neurofibrillary pathology and insulin resistance increases the number of neuritic plaques particularly in AD. Utilizing a combination of our Drosophila models of tauopathy (expressing the 2N4R-Tau) and neuroblastoma cells, we have attempted to decipher the pathways downstream of the insulin signaling cascade that lead to tau hyperphosphorylation, aggregation and autophagic defects. Using cell-based, genetic and biochemical approaches we have demonstrated that tau phosphorylation at AT8 and PHF1 residues is enhanced in an insulin-resistant environment. We also show that insulin-induced changes in total and phospho-tau are mediated by the crosstalk of AKT, GSK-3β and ERK located downstream of the insulin receptor pathway. Finally, we demonstrate a significant change in the levels of the key proteins in the mTOR/autophagy pathway, implying an increased impairment of aggregated protein clearance in our transgenic Drosophila models and cultured neuroblastoma cells.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: How Sensitive Are Conventional MEG Functional Connectivity Metrics With Sliding Windows to Detect Genuine Fluctuations in Dynamic Functional Connectivity?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00797</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00797</link>
	<description>Despite advances in the field of dynamic connectivity, fixed sliding window approaches for the detection of fluctuations in functional connectivity are still widely used. The use of conventional connectivity metrics in conjunction with a fixed sliding window comes with the arbitrariness of the chosen window lengths. In this paper we use multivariate autoregressive and neural mass models with a-priori defined ground truths to systematically analyse the sensitivity of conventional metrics in combination with different window lengths to detect genuine fluctuations in connectivity for various underlying state durations. Metrics of interest are the coherence, imaginary coherence, phase lag index, phase locking value and the amplitude envelope correlation. We performed analysis for two nodes and at the network level. We demonstrate that these metrics show indeed higher variability for genuine temporal fluctuations in connectivity compared to a static connectivity state superimposed by noise. Overall, the error of the connectivity estimates themselves decreases for longer state durations (order of seconds). The reverse was true for the correlations of the connectivity fluctuations with the ground truth. In general, metrics, in combination with a sliding window, perform poorly for very short state durations. Increasing the SNR of the system only leads to a moderate improvement. A window length that matches the temporal duration of the underlying states usually leads to the highest correlation with the ground truth. This also indicates that a mismatch between underlying state duration and window length could lead to an underestimation of functional connectivity. In addition, at the network level, only longer window widths were sufficient to detect plausible resting state networks that matched the underlying ground truth, especially for the phase locking value, amplitude envelope correlation and coherence. We conclude that fixed sliding window approaches for connectivity can detect modulations of connectivity, but mostly if the underlying dynamics operate on moderate to slow timescales. In practice, this can be a drawback, as state durations can vary significantly in empirical data.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Paired Associative Stimulation as a Tool to Assess Plasticity Enhancers in Chronic Stroke</title>

	<description>Background &amp;amp; Purpose: The potential for adaptive plasticity in the post-stroke brain is difficult to estimate, as is the demonstration of central nervous system (CNS) target engagement of drugs that show promise in facilitating stroke recovery. We set out to determine if paired associative stimulation (PAS) can be used a) as an assay of CNS plasticity in patients with chronic stroke, and b) to demonstrate CNS engagement by memantine, a drug which has potential plasticity-modulating effects for use in motor recovery following stroke. 

Methods: We examined the effect of PAS in fourteen participants with chronic hemiparetic stroke at five time-points in a within-subjects repeated measures design study: baseline off-drug, and following a week of orally administered memantine at doses of 5, 10, 15, and 20mg, comprising a total of seventy sessions. Each week, MEP amplitude pre and post-PAS was assessed in the contralesional hemisphere as a marker of enhanced or diminished plasticity. Strength and dexterity were recorded each week to monitor motor-specific clinical status across the study period. 

Results: We found that MEP amplitude was significantly larger after PAS in baseline sessions off-drug, and responsiveness to PAS in these sessions was associated with increased clinical severity. There was no observed increase in MEP amplitude after PAS with memantine at any dose. Motor threshold, strength, and dexterity remained unchanged during the study.

Conclusions: PAS successfully induced corticospinal excitability enhancement in chronic stroke subjects at the group level. However, this response did not occur in all participants, and was associated with increased clinical severity. This could be an important way to stratify patients for future PAS-drug studies. PAS was suppressed by memantine at all doses, regardless of responsiveness to PAS off-drug, indicating CNS engagement.</description>

	<description>Stroke remains the leading cause of long-term disability with limited options available to aid in recovery. Significant effort has been made to try and minimize neuronal damage following stroke with use of neuroprotective agents, however, these treatments have yet to show clinical efficacy. Regenerative interventions have since become of huge interest as they provide the potential to restore damaged neural tissue without being limited by a narrow therapeutic window. Neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and their high affinity receptors are actively produced throughout the brain and are involved in regulating neuronal activity and normal day-to-day function. Furthermore, neurotrophins are known to play a significant role in both protection and recovery of function following neurodegenerative diseases such as stroke and traumatic brain injury. Unfortunately, exogenous administration of these neurotrophins is limited by a lack of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability, poor half-life and rapid degradation. Therefore, we have focused this review on approaches that provide a direct and sustained neurotrophic support using pharmacological therapies and mimetics, physical activity and potential drug delivery systems, including discussion around advantages and limitations for use of each of these systems. Finally, we discuss future directions of biomaterial drug-delivery systems, including the incorporation of heparan sulfate in conjunction with neurotrophin-based interventions.using pharmacological therapies and mimetics, physical activity and potential drug delivery systems, including discussion around advantages and limitations for use of each of these systems.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: The Effect of Cochlear Implants on Cognitive Function in Older Adults: Initial Baseline and 18-Month Follow Up Results for a Prospective International Longitudinal Study</title>

	<description>In older adults, hearing loss is independently associated with an increased rate of cognitive decline, and has been identified to be a modifiable risk factor for dementia.  The mechanism underlying the cognitive decline associated with hearing loss is not understood, but it is known that the greater the hearing loss, the faster the rate of decline.  It is unknown whether remediation of hearing loss with hearing devices can delay cognitive decline. This 5-year international longitudinal study is investigating the impact of cochlear implants on cognitive function in older people with severe-profound hearing loss, and whether remediation of hearing loss could delay the onset of cognitive impairment.  This is the first study to examine the major primary risk factors associated with dementia in the same cohort.  Participants were assessed before cochlear implantation and 18 months later using an identical battery including a visually presented cognitive assessment tool (Cogstate battery) that is highly sensitive to small changes in cognition and suitable for use with people with hearing loss.  Hearing and speech perception ability were assessed in sound -treated conditions by an audiologist, and a range of questionnaire tools was administered to assess self-perceived ease of listening, quality of life, physical activity, diet, social and emotional loneliness, isolation, anxiety and depression.  A detailed medical health history was taken.  Pre-operatively despite the small initial sample size (n = 59), increased hearing loss and age predicted significantly poorer executive function and visual attention, while tertiary education predicted better executive function. Better self-reported quality of life was correlated with better visual learning performance, and engaging in frequent vigorous physical activity was correlated with poorer visual learning performance.  At 18 months, for the first 20 participants, significant benefits of cochlear implants were seen in terms of speech perception, communication ability, and quality of life.  Multiple linear regression modelling showed executive function improved significantly for non-tertiary educated males, while cognitive function remained stable for other participants.  Further follow-up at 18 month intervals with a larger sample will reveal the effects of cochlear implant intervention on all outcomes, and whether this can delay cognitive decline.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Therapeutic Effect of Modulating TREM-1 via Anti-inflammation and Autophagy in Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common age-related neurodegenerative diseases, and neuroinflammation has been identified as one of its key pathological characteristics. Triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) amplifies the inflammatory response and plays a role in sepsis and cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated that the attenuation of TREM-1 activity produces cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in macrophages. However, no study has examined the role of TREM-1 in neurodegeneration. We showed that LP17, a synthetic peptide blocker of TREM-1, significantly inhibited the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced upregulation of proinflammatory cascades of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2, and nuclear factor-B. Moreover, LP17 enhanced the LPS-induced upregulation of autophagy-related proteins such as light chain-3 and histone deacetylase-6. We also knocked down TREM-1 expression in a BV2 cell model to further confirm the role of TREM-1. LP17 inhibited 6-hydroxydopamine-induced locomotor deficit and iNOS messenger RNA expression in zebrafish. We also observed therapeutic effects of LP17 administration in 6-OHDA-induced PD syndrome using a rat model. These data suggest that the attenuation of TREM-1 could ameliorate neuroinflammatory responses in PD and that this neuroprotective effect might occur via the activation of autophagy and anti-inflammatory pathways.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Post-hoc Labeling of Arbitrary M/EEG Recordings for Data-Efficient Evaluation of Neural Decoding Methods</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00055</guid>

	<description>Many cognitive, sensory and motor processes have correlates in oscillatory neural source activity, which is embedded as a subspace in the recorded brain signals. Decoding such processes from noisy magnetoencephalogram/electroencephalogram (M/EEG) signals usually requires data-driven analysis methods. The objective evaluation of such decoding algorithms on experimental raw signals, however, is a challenge: the amount of available M/EEG data typically is limited, labels can be unreliable, and raw signals often are contaminated with artifacts. To overcome some of these problems, simulation frameworks have been introduced which support the development of data-driven decoding algorithms and their benchmarking. For generating artificial brain signals, however, most of the existing frameworks make strong and partially unrealistic assumptions about brain activity. This limits the generalization of results observed in the simulation to real-world scenarios.

In the present contribution, we show how to overcome several shortcomings of existing simulation frameworks. We propose a versatile alternative, which allows for an objective evaluation and benchmarking of novel decoding algorithms using real neural signals. It allows to generate comparatively large datasets with labels being deterministically recoverable from the arbitrary M/EEG recordings.
A novel idea to generate these labels is central to this framework: we determine a subspace of the true M/EEG recordings and utilize it to derive novel labels. These labels contain realistic information about the oscillatory activity of some underlying neural sources. For two categories of subspace-defining methods, we showcase how such labels can be obtained---either by an exclusively data-driven approach  (independent component analysis---ICA), or by a method exploiting additional anatomical constraints (minimum norm estimates---MNE). We term our framework \textit{post-hoc labeling} of M/EEG recordings.
To support the adoption of the framework by practitioners, we have exemplified its use by benchmarking three standard decoding methods---i.e., common spatial patterns (CSP),  source power-comodulation (SPoC), and convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)---wrt. Varied dataset sizes, label noise, and label variability. Source code and data are made available to the reader for facilitating the application of our post-hoc labeling framework.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Concrete vs. Abstract Semantics: From Mental Representations to Functional Brain Mapping</title>

	<description>The nature of abstract and concrete semantics and differences between them have remained a debated issue in psycholinguistic and cognitive studies for decades. Most of the available behavioral and neuroimaging studies reveal distinctions between these two types of semantics, typically associated with a so-called “concreteness effect”. Many attempts have been made to explain these differences using various approaches, from purely theoretical linguistic and cognitive frameworks to neuroimaging experiments. In this brief overview, we will try to provide a snapshot of these diverse views and relationships between them and highlight the crucial issues preventing this problem from being solved. We will argue that one potentially beneficial way forward is to identify the neural mechanisms underpinning acquisition of the different types of semantics (e.g., by using neurostimulation techniques to establish causal relationships), which may help explain the distinctions found between the processing of concrete and abstract semantics.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Girls-Boys: An Investigation of Gender Differences in the Behavioral and Neural Mechanisms of Trust and Reciprocity in Adolescence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00257</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00257</link>
	<description>Background: Trust and reciprocity towards others have often been found to increase from childhood to adulthood. Gender differences in these social behaviors have been reported in adults. While adolescence is a key-period of change in social behavior, gender differences in trust and reciprocity during this developmental stage have rarely been investigated. 

Method: Here we investigate age-related gender differences in trust and reciprocity (n = 100, 51 female) and associated neural mechanisms (n = 44, 20 female) in adolescents between 13 and 19 years of age. Participants played two multi-round trust games with a pre-programmed cooperative and an unfair partner. Forty-four of 100 participants completed the trust game while undergoing functional brain imaging.

Results: Participants’ investments were greater towards a cooperative than unfair game partner (p &amp;lt; 0.01), showing sensitivity to the degree of trustworthiness. There were no gender or age or related differences in baseline trust. In repeated cooperative interactions no gender differences were found, but younger adolescents showed slightly steeper increase of investments than older adolescents. In unfair interactions, younger males reacted with stronger decrease of investments than older males. Region of interest analysis of brain areas associated with in mentalizing, reward learning, conflict processing, and cognitive control revealed gender-by-age interactions on trusting behavior in the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and the caudate, showing stronger influence of age in males than in females during cooperation, and the reverse in unfair interactions. Additionally, main effects of gender were found in the TPJ, with higher activation in males, and in the caudate, with females showing greater activation. 

Conclusion: In first interactions and during repeated cooperative interactions, adolescent males and females showed similar trusting behavior. Younger males showed stronger responses to unfairness by others. Gender-by-age interactions in specific ROIs suggest differential development in mentalizing and reward related cognitive processes. In conjunction with previous research, our findings suggest the presence of subtle gender and age-related changes in trust and cooperation that are only detectable using larger age windows.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: FAST: A Novel, Executive Function-Based Approach to Cognitive Enhancement</title>

	<description>The present study introduces a novel cognitive intervention aimed at improving fluid intelligence (Gf), based on a framework we refer to as FAST: Flexible, Adaptive, Synergistic Training. FAST leverages a combination of novel game-based executive function training -- designed specifically to enhance the likelihood of transfer -- and transcranial electrical stimulation, with aims to synergistically activate and strengthen mechanisms of cognitive control critical to Gf. To test our intervention we collected three Gf measures from 113 participants (the advanced short Bochumer Matrizen-Test [BOMAT], Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices, and matrices similar to Raven’s generated by Sandia labs), prior to and following one of three interventions: (1) the FAST+tRNS intervention, a combination of 30 minutes of daily training with our novel training game, Robot Factory, and 20 minutes of concurrent transcranial random noise stimulation applied to bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, (2) an adaptively difficult active control intervention comprised of visuospatial tasks that specifically do not target Gf, or (3) a no-contact control condition. Analyses of changes in a Gf factor from pre- to posttest found numerical increases for the FAST+tRNS group compared to the two control conditions, with a .3 sd increase relative to Active Control (p = .07), and a .19 sd increase relative to a No-contact Control condition (p = .26). This increase was found to be largely driven by significant differences in pre- and posttest Gf as measured on the BOMAT test. Progression through the FAST training game (Robot Factory) was significantly correlated with changes in Gf. This is in contrast with progress in the Active Control condition, as well as with changes in individual executive functions (EFs) during FAST training, which did not significantly correlate with changes in Gf. Taken together, this research represents a useful step forward in providing new insights into, and new methods for studying the nature of Gf and its malleability. Though our results await replication and extension, they provide preliminary evidence that the crucial characteristic of Gf may in fact be the ability to combine executive functions rapidly and adaptively according to changing demand, and that Gf may be susceptible to targeted training.</description>

	<description>Neural network simulation is an important tool for generating and evaluating hypotheses on the structure, dynamics and function of neural circuits. For scientific questions addressing organisms operating autonomously in their environments, in particular where learning is involved, it is crucial to be able to operate such simulations in a closed-loop fashion. In such a set-up, the neural agent continuously receives sensory stimuli from the environment and provides motor signals that manipulate the environment or move the agent within it. So far, most studies requiring such functionality have been conducted with custom simulation scripts and manually implemented tasks. This makes it difficult for other researchers to reproduce and build upon previous work and nearly impossible to compare the performance of different learning architectures. In this work, we present a novel approach to solve this problem, connecting benchmark tools from the field of machine learning and state-of-the-art neural network simulators from computational neuroscience. The resulting toolchain enables researchers in both fields to make use of well-tested high-performance simulation software supporting biologically plausible neuron, synapse and network models and allows them to evaluate and compare their approach on the basis of standardized environments with various levels of complexity. We demonstrate the functionality of the toolchain by implementing a neuronal actor-critic architecture for reinforcement learning in the NEST simulator and successfully training it on two different environments from the OpenAI Gym. We compare its performance to a previously suggested neural network model of reinforcement learning in the basal ganglia and a generic Q-learning algorithm.</description>

	<description>Analog signaling describes the use of graded voltage changes as signals in the axonal compartment. Analog signaling has been described originally in invertebrates but more recent work has established its presence in the mammalian brain. In recent years, many different groups have contributed to the understanding of the physiological significance of analog signaling from a cellular perspective (for a recent review the reader may take a look at the work by Zbili and Debanne in this Frontiers in Neuroscience Special Issue). The great majority of the experimental work related to analog signaling however, concerns the propagation of subthreshold voltage changes from the soma to the axon. Much less attention has been paid to the propagation of subthreshold voltage changes in the opposite direction, from the axon to the soma, or to the propagation of local signals within the axon. In this mini review we will describe these other variants of analog signaling that we call here “antidromic” coupling and “local” coupling.</description>

	<description>Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) is a disorder of chronic, generalized muscular pain, accompanied by sleep disturbances, fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. There is no definitive pathogenesis except for altered central pain pathways. We previously reported increased serum levels of the neuropeptides substance P (SP) and its structural analogue hemokinin-1 (HK-1) together with the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF in FMS patients as compared to sedentary controls. We hypothesize that thalamic mast cells contribute to inflammation and pain, by releasing neuro-sensitizing molecules that include histamine, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF, as well as calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP), HK-1 and SP. These molecules could either stimulate thalamic nociceptive neurons directly, or via stimulation of microglia in the diencephalon. As a result, inhibiting mast cell stimulation could be used as a novel approach for reducing pain and the symptoms of FMS.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Predicting MCI Status From Multimodal Language Data Using Cascaded Classifiers</title>

	<description>Recent work has indicated the potential utility of automated language analysis for the detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Most studies combining language processing and machine learning for the prediction of MCI focus on a single language task; here, we consider a cascaded approach to combine data from multiple language tasks. A cohort of 26 MCI participants and 29 healthy controls completed three language tasks: picture description, reading silently, and reading aloud. Information from each task is captured through different modes (audio, text, eye-tracking, and comprehension questions). Features are extracted from each mode, and used to train a series of cascaded classifiers which output predictions at the level of features, modes, tasks, and finally at the overall session level. The best classification result is achieved through combining the data at the task level (AUC = 0.88, accuracy = 0.83). This outperforms a classifier trained on neuropsychological test scores (AUC = 0.75, accuracy = 0.65) as well as the 'early fusion' approach to multimodal classification (AUC = 0.79, accuracy = 0.70). In a correlation analysis, classifier predictions are found to be moderately correlated () with participant scores on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). The cascaded approach for multimodal classification improves both system performance and interpretability. This modular architecture can be easily generalized to incorporate different types of classifiers as well as other heterogeneous sources of data (imaging, metabolic, etc.).</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Metabolic Obesity Profile Is Associated With Decreased Gray Matter Volume in Cognitively Healthy Older Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00202</guid>

	<description>Obesity is a risk factor for cognitive decline and gray matter volume loss in aging. Studies have shown that different metabolic factors, e.g. dysregulated glucose metabolism and systemic inflammation, might mediate this association. Yet, even though these risk factors tend to co-occur, they have mostly been investigated separately, making it difficult to establish their joint contribution to gray matter volume structure in aging. Here, we therefore aimed to determine a metabolic profile of obesity that takes into account different anthropometric and metabolic measures to explain differences in gray matter volume in aging. We included 748 elderly, cognitively healthy participants (age range: 60 – 79 years, BMI range: 17 – 42 kg/m2) of the LIFE-Adult Study. All participants had complete information on body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, glycated hemoglobin, total blood cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, adiponectin and leptin. Voxelwise gray matter volume was extracted from T1-weighted images acquired on a 3T Siemens MRI scanner. We used partial least squares correlation to extract latent variables with maximal covariance between anthropometric, metabolic and gray matter volume and applied permutation/bootstrapping and cross-validation to test significance and reliability of the result. We further explored the association of the latent variables with cognitive performance.
Permutation tests and cross-validation indicated that the first pair of latent variables was significant and reliable. The metabolic profile was driven by negative contributions from body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, glycated hemoglobin, C-reactive protein and leptin and a positive contribution from adiponectin. It positively covaried with gray matter volume in temporal, frontal and occipital lobe as well as subcortical regions and cerebellum. 
This result shows that a metabolic profile characterized by high body fat, visceral adiposity and systemic inflammation is associated with reduced gray matter volume and potentially reduced executive function in older adults. We observed the highest contributions for body weight and fat mass, which indicates that factors underlying sustained energy imbalance, like sedentary lifestyle or intake of energy-dense food, might be important determinants of gray matter structure in aging.</description>

	<description>Objectives
To assess the influence of age and sex on ten cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow dynamics parameters measured with an MR phase contrast (PC) sequence within the cerebral aqueduct at the level of the intercollicular sulcus.
Materials and Methods
128 healthy subjects (66 female subjects with a mean age of 52.9 years and 62 male subjects with a mean age of 51.8 years) with a normal Evans index, normal medial temporal atrophy score (MTA) and without known disorders of the cerebrospinal fluid circulation were included in the study. A phase contrast MR sequence on a 3T MR scanner was used. Ten different flow parameters were analyzed using postprocessing software. Ordinal and linear regression models were calculated.
Results
The parameters stroke volume (sex: p&amp;lt;0.001, age: p=0.003), forward flow volume (sex: p&amp;lt;0.001, age: p=0.002), backward flow volume (sex: p&amp;lt;0.001, age: p=0.018), absolute stroke volume (sex: p&amp;lt;0.001, age: p=0.005), mean flux (sex: p&amp;lt;0.001, age: p=0.001), peak velocity (sex: p=0.009, age: p=0.0016) and peak pressure gradient (sex: p=0.029, age: p=0.028) are significantly influenced by sex and age. The parameters regurgitant fraction, stroke distance and mean velocity are not significantly influenced by sex and age. 
Conclusions
CSF flow dynamics parameters measured in the cerebral aqueduct are partly age and sex dependent. For establishment of reliable reference values for clinical use in future studies, the impact of sex and age should be considered and incorporated.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Impairment in the Modern ART Era: Are We Close to Discovering Reliable Biomarkers in the Setting of Virological Suppression?</title>

	<description>The prevalence of the most severe forms of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders is decreasing due to worldwide availability and high efficacy of antiretroviral treatment (ART). However, several grades of HIV-related cognitive impairment persist with effective ART and remain a clinical concern for people with HIV.
The pathogenesis of these cognitive impairments has yet to be fully understood and probably multifactorial. In people with HIV (PWH) with undetectable peripheral HIV-RNA, the presence of viral escapes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) might explain a proportion of cases, but not all. Many other mechanisms have been hypothesized to be involved in disease progression, in order to identify possible therapeutic targets. As potential indicators of disease staging and progression, numerous biomarkers have been used to characterize and implicate chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of neuronal injury, such as certain phenotypes of activated monocytes/macrophages, in the context of persistent immune-activation. 
Despite none of them being disease-specific, the correlation of several CSF cellular biomarkers to HIV-induced neuronal damage have been investigated. Furthermore, recent studies have been evaluating specific microRNA profiles in the CSF of PWH with neurocognitive impairment.
The aim of the present study is to review the body of evidence on different biomarkers use in research and clinical settings, focusing on PWH on ART with undetectable plasma HIV-RNA.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Interleaving Motor Sequence Training With High-Frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Facilitates Consolidation</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The acquisition of novel motor skills is a fundamental process of lifelong learning and crucial for everyday behavior. Performance gains acquired by training undergo a transition from an initially labile state to a state that is progressively robust towards interference, a phenomenon referred to as motor consolidation. Previous work has demonstrated that the primary motor cortex (M1) is a neural key region for motor consolidation. However, it remains unknown whether physiological processes underlying posttraining motor consolidation in M1 are active already during an ongoing training phase or only after completion of the training. We examined whether 10-Hz interleaved repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (i-rTMS) of M1 during rest periods between active motor training in an explicit motor learning task affects posttraining offline consolidation. Relative to i-rTMS to the vertex (control region), i-rTMS to the M1&lt;sub&gt;hand&lt;/sub&gt; area of the nondominant hand facilitated posttraining consolidation assessed 6 h after training without affecting training performance. This facilitatory effect generalized to delayed performance of the mirror-symmetric sequence with the untrained (dominant) hand. These findings indicate that posttraining consolidation can be facilitated independently from training-induced performance increments and suggest that consolidation is initiated already during offline processing in short rest periods between active training phases.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Language Without Speech: Segregating Distinct Circuits in the Human Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Language is a fundamental part of human cognition. The question of whether language is processed independently of speech, however, is still heavily discussed. The absence of speech in deaf signers offers the opportunity to disentangle language from speech in the human brain. Using probabilistic tractography, we compared brain structural connectivity of adult deaf signers who had learned sign language early in life to that of matched hearing controls. Quantitative comparison of the connectivity profiles revealed that the core language tracts did not differ between signers and controls, confirming that language is independent of speech. In contrast, pathways involved in the production and perception of speech displayed lower connectivity in deaf signers compared to hearing controls. These differences were located in tracts towards the left pre-supplementary motor area and the thalamus when seeding in Broca’s area, and in ipsilateral parietal areas and the precuneus with seeds in left posterior temporal regions. Furthermore, the interhemispheric connectivity between the auditory cortices was lower in the deaf than in the hearing group, underlining the importance of the transcallosal connection for early auditory processes. The present results provide evidence for a functional segregation of the neural pathways for language and speech.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Efficiency of protein synthesis inhibition depends on tRNA and codon compositions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Sophia Rudorf&lt;/p&gt;

Regulation and maintenance of protein synthesis are vital to all organisms and are thus key targets of attack and defense at the cellular level. Here, we mathematically analyze protein synthesis for its sensitivity to the inhibition of elongation factor EF-Tu and/or ribosomes in dependence of the system’s tRNA and codon compositions. We find that protein synthesis reacts ultrasensitively to a decrease in the elongation factor’s concentration for systems with an imbalance between codon usages and tRNA concentrations. For well-balanced tRNA/codon compositions, protein synthesis is impeded more effectively by the inhibition of ribosomes instead of EF-Tu. Our predictions are supported by re-evaluated experimental data as well as by independent computer simulations. Not only does the described ultrasensitivity render EF-Tu a distinguished target of protein synthesis inhibiting antibiotics. It may also enable persister cell formation mediated by toxin-antitoxin systems. The strong impact of the tRNA/codon composition provides a basis for tissue-specificities of disorders caused by mutations of human mitochondrial EF-Tu as well as for the potential use of EF-Tu targeting drugs for tissue-specific treatments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RjxOXOWOMgM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Temporal coding in spiking neural networks with alpha synaptic function. (arXiv:1907.13223v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13223</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13223</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The timing of individual neuronal spikes is essential for biological brains
to make fast responses to sensory stimuli. However, conventional artificial
neural networks lack the intrinsic temporal coding ability present in
biological networks. We propose a spiking neural network model that encodes
information in the relative timing of individual neuron spikes. In
classification tasks, the output of the network is indicated by the first
neuron to spike in the output layer. This temporal coding scheme allows the
supervised training of the network with backpropagation, using locally exact
derivatives of the postsynaptic spike times with respect to presynaptic spike
times. The network operates using a biologically-plausible alpha synaptic
transfer function. Additionally, we use trainable synchronisation pulses that
provide bias, add flexibility during training and exploit the decay part of the
alpha function. We show that such networks can be trained successfully on noisy
Boolean logic tasks and on the MNIST dataset encoded in time. The results show
that the spiking neural network outperforms comparable spiking models on MNIST
and achieves similar quality to fully connected conventional networks with the
same architecture. We also find that the spiking network spontaneously
discovers two operating regimes, mirroring the accuracy-speed trade-off
observed in human decision-making: a slow regime, where a decision is taken
after all hidden neurons have spiked and the accuracy is very high, and a fast
regime, where a decision is taken very fast but the accuracy is lower. These
results demonstrate the computational power of spiking networks with biological
characteristics that encode information in the timing of individual neurons. By
studying temporal coding in spiking networks, we aim to create building blocks
towards energy-efficient and more complex biologically-inspired neural
architectures.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Signal Coding and Perfect Reconstruction using Spike Trains. (arXiv:1906.00092v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00092</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00092</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In many animal sensory pathways, the transformation from external stimuli to
spike trains is essentially deterministic. In this context, a new mathematical
framework for coding and reconstruction, based on a biologically plausible
model of the spiking neuron, is presented. The framework considers encoding of
a signal through spike trains generated by an ensemble of neurons via a
standard convolve-then-threshold mechanism. Neurons are distinguished by their
convolution kernels and threshold values. Reconstruction is posited as a convex
optimization minimizing energy. Formal conditions under which perfect
reconstruction of the signal from the spike trains is possible are then
identified in this setup. Finally, a stochastic gradient descent mechanism is
proposed to achieve these conditions. Simulation experiments are presented to
demonstrate the strength and efficacy of the framework

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Univariate analyses of structural neuroimaging data have produced heterogeneous results regarding anatomical sex- and gender-related differences. The current study aimed at delineating and cross-validating brain volumetric surrogates of sex and gender by comparing the structural magnetic resonance imaging data of cis- and transgender subjects using multivariate pattern analysis. Gray matter (GM) tissue maps of 29 transgender men, 23 transgender women, 35 cisgender women, and 34 cisgender men were created using voxel-based morphometry and analyzed using support vector classification. Generalizability of the models was estimated using repeated nested cross-validation. For external validation, significant models were applied to hormone-treated transgender subjects (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 32) and individuals diagnosed with depression (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 27). Sex was identified with a balanced accuracy (BAC) of 82.6% (false discovery rate [p&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt;] &amp;lt; 0.001) in cisgender, but only with 67.5% (p&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.04) in transgender participants indicating differences in the neuroanatomical patterns associated with sex in transgender despite the major effect of sex on GM volume irrespective of the self-identification as a woman or man. Gender identity and gender incongruence could not be reliably identified (all p&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). The neuroanatomical signature of sex in cisgender did not interact with depressive features (BAC = 74.7%) but was affected by hormone therapy when applied in transgender women (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Identifying important parameters in the inflammatory process with a mathematical model of immune cell influx and macrophage polarization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007172</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Marcella Torres, Jing Wang, Paul J. Yannie, Shobha Ghosh, Rebecca A. Segal, Angela M. Reynolds&lt;/p&gt;

In an inflammatory setting, macrophages can be polarized to an inflammatory M1 phenotype or to an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, as well as existing on a spectrum between these two extremes. Dysfunction of this phenotypic switch can result in a population imbalance that leads to chronic wounds or disease due to unresolved inflammation. Therapeutic interventions that target macrophages have therefore been proposed and implemented in diseases that feature chronic inflammation such as diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. We have developed a model for the sequential influx of immune cells in the peritoneal cavity in response to a bacterial stimulus that includes macrophage polarization, with the simplifying assumption that macrophages can be classified as M1 or M2. With this model, we were able to reproduce the expected timing of sequential influx of immune cells and mediators in a general inflammatory setting. We then fit this model to &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experimental data obtained from a mouse peritonitis model of inflammation, which is widely used to evaluate endogenous processes in response to an inflammatory stimulus. Model robustness is explored with local structural and practical identifiability of the proposed model &lt;i&gt;a posteriori&lt;/i&gt;. Additionally, we perform sensitivity analysis that identifies the population of apoptotic neutrophils as a key driver of the inflammatory process. Finally, we simulate a selection of proposed therapies including points of intervention in the case of delayed neutrophil apoptosis, which our model predicts will result in a sustained inflammatory response. Our model can therefore provide hypothesis testing for therapeutic interventions that target macrophage phenotype and predict outcomes to be validated by subsequent experimentation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/g-cMdqa9Zfo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Is Optogenetic Activation of Vglut1-Positive A{beta} Low-Threshold Mechanoreceptors Sufficient to Induce Tactile Allodynia in Mice after Nerve Injury?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/31/6202?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/31/6202?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mechanical allodynia is a cardinal feature of pathological pain. Recent work has demonstrated the necessity of Aβ-low-threshold mechanoreceptors (Aβ-LTMRs) for mechanical allodynia-like behaviors in mice, but it remains unclear whether these neurons are sufficient to produce pain under pathological conditions. We generated a transgenic mouse in which channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is conditionally expressed in vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (Vglut1) sensory neurons (Vglut1-ChR2), which is a heterogeneous population of large-sized sensory neurons with features consistent with Aβ-LTMRs. In naive male Vglut1-ChR2 mice, transdermal hindpaw photostimulation evoked withdrawal behaviors in an intensity- and frequency-dependent manner, which were abolished by local anesthetic and selective A-fiber blockade. Surprisingly, male Vglut1-ChR2 mice did not show significant differences in light-evoked behaviors or real-time aversion after nerve injury despite marked hypersensitivity to punctate mechanical stimuli. We conclude that optogenetic activation of cutaneous Vglut1-ChR2 neurons alone is not sufficient to produce pain-like behaviors in neuropathic mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Mechanical allodynia, in which innocuous touch is perceived as pain, is a common feature of pathological pain. To test the contribution of low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) to nerve-injury-induced mechanical allodynia, we generated and characterized a new transgenic mouse (Vglut1-ChR2) to optogenetically activate cutaneous vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (Vglut1)-positive LTMRs. Using this mouse, we found that light-evoked behaviors were unchanged by nerve injury, which suggests that activation of Vglut1-positive LTMRs alone is not sufficient to produce pain. The Vglut1-ChR2 mouse will be broadly useful for the study of touch, pain, and itch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dissociation of the Perirhinal Cortex and Hippocampus During Discriminative Learning of Similar Objects</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/31/6190?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Discriminative learning is a paradigm that has been used in animal studies, in which memory of a stimulus is enhanced when it is presented with a similar stimulus rather than with a different one. Human studies have shown that through discriminative learning of similar objects, both item memory and contextual memories are enhanced. However, the underlying neural mechanisms for it are unclear. The hippocampus and perirhinal cortex (PRC) are two possible regions involved in discriminating similar stimuli and forming distinctive memory representations. In this study, 28 participants (15 males) were scanned using high-resolution fMRI when a picture (e.g., a dog) was paired with the same picture, with a similar picture of the same concept (e.g., another dog), or with a picture of a different concept (e.g., a cat). Then, after intervals of 20 min and 1 week, the participants were asked to perform an old/new recognition task, followed by a contextual judgment. The results showed that during encoding, there was stronger activation in the PRC for the &quot;similar&quot; than for the &quot;same&quot; and &quot;different&quot; conditions and it predicted subsequent item memory for the &quot;similar&quot; condition. The hippocampal activation decreased for the &quot;same&quot; versus the &quot;different&quot; condition and the DG/CA3 activation predicted subsequent contextual memory for the &quot;similar&quot; condition. These results suggested that the PRC and hippocampus are functionally dissociated in encoding simultaneously presented objects and predicting subsequent item and contextual memories after discriminative learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; How the brain separates similar input into nonoverlapping representations and forms distinct memory for them is a fundamental question for the neuroscience of memory. By discriminative learning of similar (vs different) objects, both item and contextual memories are enhanced. This study found functional dissociations between perirhinal cortex (PRC) and hippocampus in discriminating pairs of similar and different objects and in predicting subsequent memory of similar objects in their item and contextual aspects. The results provided clear evidence on the neural mechanisms of discriminative learning and highlighted the importance of the PRC and hippocampus in processing different types of object information when the objects were simultaneously presented.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Functional Involvement of Human Periaqueductal Gray and Other Midbrain Nuclei in Cognitive Control</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/31/6180?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/31/6180?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent theoretical advances have motivated the hypothesis that the periaqueductal gray (PAG) participates in behaviors that involve changes in the autonomic control of visceromotor activity, including during cognitively demanding tasks. We used ultra-high-field (7 tesla) fMRI to measure human brain activity at 1.1 mm resolution while participants completed a working memory task. Consistent with prior work, participants were less accurate and responded more slowly with increasing memory load—signs of increasing task difficulty. Whole-brain fMRI analysis revealed increased activity in multiple cortical areas with increasing working memory load, including frontal and parietal cortex, dorsal cingulate, supplementary motor area, and anterior insula. Several dopamine-rich midbrain nuclei, such as the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, also exhibited load-dependent increases in activation. To investigate PAG involvement during cognitive engagement, we developed an automated method for segmenting and spatially normalizing the PAG. Analyses using cross-validated linear support vector machines showed that the PAG discriminated high versus low working memory load conditions with 95% accuracy in individual subjects based on activity increases in lateral and ventrolateral PAG. Effect sizes in the PAG were comparable in magnitude to those in many of the cortical areas. These findings suggest that cognitive control is not only associated with cortical activity in the frontal and parietal lobes, but also with increased activity in the subcortical PAG and other midbrain regions involved in the regulation of autonomic nervous system function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Functional neuroimaging in humans has shown that cognitive control engages multiple corticostriatal networks and brainstem nuclei, but theoretical advances suggest that the periaqueductal gray (PAG) should also be engaged during cognitively demanding tasks. Recent advances in ultra-high-field fMRI provided an opportunity to obtain the first evidence that increased activation of intermediate and rostral portions of lateral and ventrolateral PAG columns in humans is modulated by cognitive load. These findings suggest that cognitive control is not solely mediated by activity in the cortex, but that midbrain structures important for autonomic regulation also play a crucial role in higher-order cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) are two noninvasive methods commonly used to study neural mechanisms supporting visual attention in humans. Studies using these tools, which have complementary spatial and temporal resolutions, implicitly assume they index similar underlying neural modulations related to external stimulus and internal attentional manipulations. Accordingly, they are often used interchangeably for constraining understanding about the impact of bottom-up and top-down factors on neural modulations. To test this core assumption, we simultaneously manipulated bottom-up sensory inputs by varying stimulus contrast and top-down cognitive modulations by changing the focus of spatial attention. Each of the male and female subjects participated in both fMRI and EEG sessions performing the same experimental paradigm. We found categorically different patterns of attentional modulation on fMRI activity in early visual cortex and early stimulus-evoked potentials measured via EEG (e.g., the P1 component and steady-state visually-evoked potentials): fMRI activation scaled additively with attention, whereas evoked EEG components scaled multiplicatively with attention. However, across longer time scales, a contralateral negative-going potential and oscillatory EEG signals in the alpha band revealed additive attentional modulation patterns like those observed with fMRI. These results challenge prior assumptions that fMRI and early stimulus-evoked potentials measured with EEG can be interchangeably used to index the same neural mechanisms of attentional modulations at different spatiotemporal scales. Instead, fMRI measures of attentional modulations are more closely linked with later EEG components and alpha-band oscillations. Considered together, hemodynamic and electrophysiological signals can jointly constrain understanding of the neural mechanisms supporting cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; fMRI and EEG have been used as tools to measure the location and timing of attentional modulations in visual cortex and are often used interchangeably for constraining computational models under the assumption that they index similar underlying neural processes. However, by varying attentional and stimulus parameters, we found differential patterns of attentional modulations of fMRI activity in early visual cortex and commonly used stimulus-evoked potentials measured via EEG. Instead, across longer time scales, a contralateral negative-going potential and EEG oscillations in the alpha band exhibited attentional modulations similar to those observed with fMRI. Together, these results suggest that different physiological processes assayed by these complementary techniques must be jointly considered when making inferences about the neural underpinnings of cognitive operations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as focal neurological deficit caused by ischemia resolving within 24 hours. In a secondary analysis of a large monocentric cohort of 446 TIA patients, we explored the frequency and determinants of diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) lesions on high‐resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Overall, 240 (54%) of all TIA patients presented with DWI lesions. These patients had higher National Institute of Health Stroke Scale and ABCD2 scores and presented more frequently with vessel occlusion and perfusion deficits, but had similar functional outcome at 3 months. Taken together, high‐resolution DWI provides evidence of ischemic brain injury in the majority of TIA patients. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: SSBP1 mutations in dominant optic atrophy with variable retinal degeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25550?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25550?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) starts in early childhood with loss of visual acuity and color vision deficits. &lt;i&gt;OPA1&lt;/i&gt; mutations are responsible for the majority of cases, but in a portion of patients with a clinical diagnosis of ADOA, the cause remains unknown. This study aimed to identify novel ADOA‐associated genes and explore their causality.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linkage analysis and sequencing were performed in multigeneration families and unrelated patients to identify disease‐causing variants. Functional consequences were investigated in silico and confirmed experimentally using the zebrafish model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We defined a new ADOA locus on 7q33‐q35 and identified 3 different missense variants in &lt;i&gt;SSBP1&lt;/i&gt; (NM_001256510.1; c.113G&amp;gt;A [p.(Arg38Gln)], c.320G&amp;gt;A [p.(Arg107Gln)] and c.422G&amp;gt;A [p.(Ser141Asn)]) in affected individuals from 2 families and 2 singletons with ADOA and variable retinal degeneration. The mutated arginine residues are part of a basic patch that is essential for single‐strand DNA binding. The loss of a positive charge at these positions is very likely to lower the affinity of SSBP1 for single‐strand DNA. Antisense‐mediated knockdown of endogenous &lt;i&gt;ssbp1&lt;/i&gt; messenger RNA (mRNA) in zebrafish resulted in compromised differentiation of retinal ganglion cells. A similar effect was achieved when mutated mRNAs were administered. These findings point toward an essential role of &lt;i&gt;ssbp1&lt;/i&gt; in retinal development and the dominant‐negative nature of the identified human variants, which is consistent with the segregation pattern observed in 2 multigeneration families studied.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSBP1 is an essential protein for mitochondrial DNA replication and maintenance. Our data have established pathogenic variants in &lt;i&gt;SSBP1&lt;/i&gt; as a cause of ADOA and variable retinal degeneration. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Network‐targeted approach and postoperative resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging are associated with seizure outcome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25547?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postoperative resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children with intractable epilepsy has not been quantified in relation to seizure outcome. Therefore, its value as a biomarker for epileptogenic pathology is not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sample of children with intractable epilepsy who underwent prospective resting‐state seizure onset zone (SOZ)‐targeted epilepsy surgery, postoperative resting‐state functional MRI (rs‐fMRI) was performed 6 to 12 months later. Graded normalization of the postoperative resting‐state SOZ was compared to seizure outcomes, patient, surgery, and anatomical MRI characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 64 cases were evaluated. Network‐targeted surgery, followed by postoperative rs‐fMRI normalization was significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) correlated with seizure reduction, with a Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.83. Of 39 cases with postoperative rs‐fMRI SOZ normalization, 38 (97%) became completely seizure free. In contrast, of the 25 cases without complete rs‐fMRI SOZ normalization, only 3 (5%) became seizure free. The accuracy of rs‐fMRI as a biomarker predicting seizure freedom is 94%, with 96% sensitivity and 93% specificity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among seizure localization techniques in pediatric epilepsy, network‐targeted surgery, followed by postoperative rs‐fMRI normalization, has high correlation with seizure freedom. This study shows that rs‐fMRI SOZ can be used as a biomarker of the epileptogenic zone, and postoperative rs‐fMRI normalization is a biomarker for SOZ quiescence.

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significant hematoma expansion (HE) affects one‐fifth of people within 24 hours after acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and its prevention is an appealing treatment target. Although the CT‐Angiography spot sign predicts HE, only a minority of ICH patients receives contrast injection. Conversely, non‐contrast CT (NCCT) is used to diagnose nearly all ICH, so NCCT markers represent a widely‐available alternative for prediction of HE. However, different NCCT signs describe similar features, with lack of consensus on the optimal image acquisition protocol, assessment, terminology and diagnostic criteria. In this review we propose practical guidelines for detecting, interpreting and reporting NCCT predictors of HE.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Assessment and manipulation of the computational capacity of in vitro neuronal networks through criticality in neuronal avalanches. (arXiv:1907.13118v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this work, we report the preliminary analysis of the electrophysiological
behavior of in vitro neuronal networks to identify when the networks are in a
critical state based on the size distribution of network-wide avalanches of
activity. The results presented here demonstrate the importance of selecting
appropriate parameters in the evaluation of the size distribution and indicate
that it is possible to perturb networks showing highly synchronized---or
supercritical---behavior into the critical state by increasing the level of
inhibition in the network. The classification of critical versus non-critical
networks is valuable in identifying networks that can be expected to perform
well on computational tasks, as criticality is widely considered to be the
state in which a system is best suited for computation. This type of analysis
is expected to enable the identification of networks that are well-suited for
computation and the classification of networks as perturbed or healthy. This
study is part of a larger research project, the overarching aim of which is to
develop computational models that are able to reproduce target behaviors
observed in in vitro neuronal networks. These models will ultimately be used to
aid in the realization of these behaviors in nanomagnet arrays to be used in
novel computing hardwares.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Visual Information flow in Wilson-Cowan networks. (arXiv:1907.13046v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13046</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13046</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this work we study the communication efficiency of a
psychophysically-tuned cascade of Wilson-Cowan and Divisive Normalization
layers that simulate the retina-V1 pathway. This is the first analysis of
Wilson-Cowan networks in terms of multivariate total correlation. The
parameters of the cortical model have been derived through the relation between
the steady state of the Wilson-Cowan model and the Divisive Normalization
model.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The communication efficiency has been analyzed in two ways: First, we provide
an analytical expression for the reduction of the total correlation among the
responses of a V1-like population after the application of the Wilson-Cowan
interaction. Second, we empirically study the efficiency with visual stimuli
and statistical tools that were not available before: (1) we use a recent,
radiometrically calibrated, set of natural scenes, and (2) we use a recent
technique to estimate the multivariate total correlation in bits from sets of
visual responses which only involves univariate operations, thus giving better
estimates of the redundancy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theoretical and the empirical results show that although this cascade of
layers was not optimized for statistical independence in any way, the
redundancy between the responses gets substantially reduced along the neural
pathway. Specifically, we show that (1)~the efficiency of a Wilson-Cowan
network is similar to its equivalent Divisive Normalization model, (2) while
initial layers (Von-Kries adaptation and Weber-like brightness) contribute to
univariate equalization, the bigger contributions to the reduction in total
correlation come from the computation of nonlinear local contrast and the
application of local oriented filters, and (3)~psychophysically-tuned models
are more efficient (reduce more total correlation) in the more populated
regions of the luminance-contrast plane.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13004</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this work we have aimed to reproduce supra-threshold perception phenomena,
specifically visual illusions, with Wilson-Cowan-type models of neuronal
dynamics. We have found that it is indeed possible to do so, but that the
ability to replicate visual illusions is related to how well the neural
activity equations comply with the efficient representation principle. Our
first contribution is to show that the Wilson-Cowan equations can reproduce a
number of brightness and orientation-dependent illusions, and that the latter
type of illusions require that the neuronal dynamics equations consider
explicitly the orientation, as expected. Then, we formally prove that there
can't be an energy functional that the Wilson-Cowan equations are minimizing,
but that a slight modification makes them variational and yields a model that
is consistent with the efficient representation principle. Finally, we show
that this new model provides a better reproduction of visual illusions than the
original Wilson-Cowan formulation.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Currently self-report pain ratings are the gold standard in clinical pain
assessment. However, the development of objective automatic measures of pain
could substantially aid pain diagnosis and therapy. Recent neuroimaging studies
have shown the potential of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for
pain detection. This is a brain-imaging technique that provides non-invasive,
long-term measurements of cortical hemoglobin concentration changes. In this
study, we focused on fNIRS signals acquired exclusively from the prefrontal
cortex, which can be accessed unobtrusively, and derived an algorithm for the
detection of the presence of pain using Bayesian hierarchical modelling with
wavelet features. This approach allows personalization of the inference process
by accounting for inter-participant variability in pain responses. Our work
highlights the importance of adopting a personalized approach and supports the
use of fNIRS for pain assessment.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Large-scale directed network inference with multivariate transfer entropy and hierarchical statistical testing. (arXiv:1902.06828v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06828</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06828</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Network inference algorithms are valuable tools for the study of large-scale
neuroimaging datasets. Multivariate transfer entropy is well suited for this
task, being a model-free measure that captures nonlinear and lagged
dependencies between time series to infer a minimal directed network model.
Greedy algorithms have been proposed to efficiently deal with high-dimensional
datasets while avoiding redundant inferences and capturing synergistic effects.
However, multiple statistical comparisons may inflate the false positive rate
and are computationally demanding, which limited the size of previous
validation studies. The algorithm we present---as implemented in the IDTxl
open-source software---addresses these challenges by employing hierarchical
statistical tests to control the family-wise error rate and to allow for
efficient parallelisation. The method was validated on synthetic datasets
involving random networks of increasing size (up to 100 nodes), for both linear
and nonlinear dynamics. The performance increased with the length of the time
series, reaching consistently high precision, recall, and specificity (&amp;gt;98% on
average) for 10000 time samples. Varying the statistical significance threshold
showed a more favourable precision-recall trade-off for longer time series.
Both the network size and the sample size are one order of magnitude larger
than previously demonstrated, showing feasibility for typical EEG and MEG
experiments.

	<description>The N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction hypothesis has been proposed to help understand the etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia. This hypothesis was based on early observations that NMDAR antagonists could induce a full range of symptoms of schizophrenia in normal human subjects. Accumulating evidence in humans and animal studies points to NMDAR hypofunctionality as a convergence point for various symptoms of schizophrenia. Here we review animal models of NMDAR hypofunction generated by pharmacological and genetic approaches, and how they relate to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In addition, we discuss the limitations of animal models of NMDAR hypofunction and their potential utility for therapeutic applications.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Frizzled-9+ Supporting Cells Are Progenitors for the Generation of Hair Cells in the Postnatal Mouse Cochlea</title>

	<description>Lgr5+ cochlear supporting cells have been reported to be hair cell (HC) progenitor cells that have the ability to regenerate HCs in the neonatal mouse cochlea, and these cells are regulated by Wnt signaling. Frizzled-9 (Fzd9), one of the Wnt receptors, has been reported to be used to mark neuronal stem cells in the brain together with other markers and mesenchymal stem cells from human placenta and bone marrow. Here we used Fzd9-CreER mice to lineage label and trace Fzd9+ cells in the postnatal cochlea in order to investigate the progenitor characteristic of Fzd9+ cells. Lineage labeling showed that inner phalangeal cells, inner border cells, and third-row Deiters’ cells were Fzd9+ cells, but not inner pillar cells or GER cells at postnatal day (P)3, which suggests that Fzd9+ cells are a much smaller cell population than Lgr5+ progenitors. The expression of Fzd9 progressively decreased and was too low to allow lineage tracing after P14. Lineage tracing for 6 days in vivo showed that Fzd9+ cells could also generate similar numbers of new HCs compared to Lgr5+ progenitors. A sphere-forming assay showed that Fzd9+ cells could form spheres after sorting by flow cytometry, and when we compared the isolated Fzd9+ cells and Lgr5+ progenitors there were no significant differences in sphere number or sphere diameter. In a differentiation assay, the same number of Fzd9+ cells could produce similar amounts of Myo7a+ cells compared to Lgr5+ progenitors after 10 days of differentiation. All these data suggest that the Fzd9+ cells have a similar capacity for proliferation, differentiation, and HC generation as Lgr5+ progenitors and that Fzd9 can be used as a more restricted marker of HC progenitors.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Homomeric and Heteromeric Aβ Species Exist in Human Brain and CSF Regardless of Alzheimer’s Disease Status and Risk Genotype</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00176</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00176</link>
	<description>Background: A fundamental question in Alzheimer’s disease is whether amyloid-β peptides and their deposition in the brain signify a direct pathological role, or they are mere outcome of the disease pathophysiological events affecting neuronal function. It is therefore important to decipher their physiological role in the brain. So far, the overwhelming focus has been on the potential toxicity of amyloid-β, often studied outside the crucial Alzheimer’s disease characteristics, i.e. i) the slow, decades-long disease progression that precedes clinical symptoms; ii) the link to apolipoprotein-E ε4 allele as major risk factor; iii) the selective early degeneration of cholinergic neurons. Previous studies, in vitro and CSF only, indicated one possible native function of amyloid-β peptides is the allosteric modulation of acetylcholine homeostasis, via molecular interactions between amyloid-β, apolipoprotein-E, and the acetylcholine-degrading enzymes, cholinesterases, resulting in formation of acetylcholine-hydrolyzing complexes (BaβACs).
Methods: Here, by combining sucrose-density gradient fractionation of post-mortem brain and in-house developed sensitive ELISA assays on the obtained fractions, we investigated presence, levels and molecular interactions between amyloid-β, apolipoprotein-E and cholinesterases for the first time in brain tissues. We examined three distinct brain regions of Alzheimer and non-demented subjects, plus a large number of Alzheimer CSF samples.
Results: We report that both monomeric and oligomeric (homomeric and heteromeric) forms of amyloid-β peptides are present in the brain of Alzheimer and non-demented individuals. Heteromeric amyloid-β was found in stable complexes with apolipoprotein-E and/or cholinesterases, irrespective of APOE genotype or disease status, arguing in favor of a physiological dynamic formation and function for these complexes in the brain. The patterns and molecular sizes of the detected soluble amyloid-β forms were closely matched between CSF and brain samples. This evinces that the detected amyloid-β-apolipoprotein-E complexes and BAβACs in CSF most likely originate from the interstitial fluids of the brain.
Conclusions: In conclusion, both light homomeric amyloid-β oligomers and heteromeric amyloid-β -ApoE and BAβACs are present and readily detectable in the brain, regardless of disease status and APOE4 genotype. Deeper knowledge of the physiological function of amyloid-β is crucial for better understanding the early pathological events that decades later lead to manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Electrosensory Contrast Signals for Interacting Weakly Electric Fish</title>

	<description>Active sensory systems have evolved to properly encode natural stimuli including those created by conspecifics, yet little is known about the properties of such stimuli. We consider the electrosensory signal at the skin of a fixed weakly electric fish in the presence of a swimming conspecific. The dipole recordings are obtained in parallel with video tracking of the position of the animals. This enables the quantification of the relationships between the recording dipole and the positions of the head, midbody and tail of the freely swimming fish. The contrast of the signal at the skin is shown to be well-fitted by a decreasing exponential function of distance. It is thus anti-correlated with distance; it is also correlated with the second envelope (i.e. the envelope of the envelope) of the raw recorded signal. The variance of the contrast signal is highest at short range. However, the coefficient of variation of this signal increases with distance. We find a range of position and associated contrast patterns under quasi-2D swimming conditions.  This is quantified using global measures of the visit times of the free fish within measurable range, with each visit causing a bump in contrast. The durations of these bumps as well as the times between these bumps are well reproduced by a doubly stochastic process formed by a dichotomous (two-state) noise with Poisson statistics multiplying a colored noise (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process). Certain rapid body movements such as bending or turning are seen to produce contrast drops that may be part of cloaking strategies.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Increased P2X7 Receptor Binding Is Associated With Neuroinflammation in Acute but Not Chronic Rodent Models for Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>The purinergic P2X7 receptor is a key mediator in (neuro)inflammation, a process that is associated with neurodegeneration and excitotoxicity in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Recently, P2X7 imaging has become possible with [11C]JNJ-(54173)717. We investigated P2X7 availability, in comparison with availability of the translocator protein (TSPO), in two well-characterized rat models of PD using in vitro autoradiography at multiple time points throughout the disease progression. Rats received either a unilateral injection with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in the striatum, or with recombinant adeno-associated viral vector overexpressing human A53T alpha-synuclein (α-SYN) in the substantia nigra. Transverse cryosections were incubated with [11C]JNJ-717 for P2X7 or [18F]DPA-714 for TSPO. [11C]JNJ-717 binding ratios were transiently elevated in the striatum of 6-OHDA rats at day 14-28 post-injection, with peak P2X7 binding at day 14. This largely coincided with the time course of striatal [18F]DPA-714 binding which was elevated at day 7-21, with peak TSPO binding at day 7. Increased P2X7 availability co-localized with microglial, but not astrocyte or neuronal markers. In the chronic α-SYN model, no significant differences were found in P2X7 binding, although in vitro TSPO overexpression was reported previously. This first study showed an increased P2X7 availability in the acute PD model in a time window corresponding with elevated TSPO binding and motor behavior changes. In contrast, the dynamics of TSPO and P2X7 were divergent in the chronic α-SYN model where no P2X7 changes were detectable. Overall, extended P2X7 phenotyping is warranted prior to implementation of P2X7 imaging for monitoring of neuroinflammation.</description>

	<description>In the last decade, much attention has been devoted to the effects of nutrient-related signals on brain development and cognitive functions. A turning point was the discovery that brain areas other than the hypothalamus expressed receptors for hormones related to metabolism. In particular, insulin signaling has been demonstrated to impact on molecular cascades underlying hippocampal plasticity, learning and memory. Here, we summarize the molecular evidence linking alteration of hippocampal insulin sensitivity with changes of both adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. We also review the epidemiological studies and experimental models emphasizing the critical role of brain insulin resistance at the crossroad between metabolic and neurodegenerative disease. Finally, we brief novel findings suggesting how biomarkers of brain insulin resistance, involving the study of brain-derived extracellular vesicles and brain glucose metabolism, may predict the onset and/or the progression of cognitive decline.</description>

	<description>Positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are established imaging modalities for the study of neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, dementia, psychiatric disorders and so on. Since these two available modalities vary in imaging principle and physical performance, each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages over the other. To acquire the mutual complementary information and reinforce each other, there is a need for the fusion of PET and MRI. This combined dual-modality (either sequential or simultaneous) could generate preferable soft tissue contrast of brain tissue, flexible acquisition parameters and minimized exposure to radiation. The most unique superiority of PET/MRI is mainly manifested in MRI-based improvement for the inherent limitations of PET, such as motion artifacts, partial volume effect and invasive procedure in quantitative analysis. Head motion during scanning significantly deteriorates the effective resolution of PET image, especially for the dynamic scan with lengthy time. Hybrid PET/MRI device can offer motion correction (MC) for PET data through MRI information acquired simultaneously. Regarding the partial volume effect (PVE) associated with limited spatial resolution, the process and reconstruction of PET data can be further optimized by using acquired MRI either sequentially or simultaneously. The quantitative analysis of dynamic PET data mainly relies upon an invasive arterial blood sampling procedure to acquire arterial input function (AIF). An image-derived input function (IDIF) method without the need of arterial cannulization, can serve as a potential alternative estimation of AIF. Compared with using PET data only, combining anatomical or functional information from MRI for improving the accuracy in IDIF approach has been demonstrated. Yet, due to the interference and inherent disparity between the two modalities, these methods for optimizing PET image based on MRI still have many technical challenges. This review discussed upon the most recent progress, current challenges and future directions of MRI-driven PET data optimization for neurological applications, with either sequential or simultaneous acquisition approach.</description>

	<description>Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. However, little is known about the cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and functional connectivity changes in the disease. In this study, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data including 24 MSA-c-type patients and 20 healthy controls were collected. By using voxel wise arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion analysis, several regions of the altered rCBF were identified in the MSA c-type patients. And then, the changes of the functional connectivities of identified rCBF regions were analyzed by using functional MRI (fMRI). Finally, rCBF value of cerebellum was extracted to differentiate the MSA c-type patients and controls. Compared with the controls, the MSA c-type patients showed distinct disruption of rCBF in the cerebellum. The disconnection of the identified cerebellar regions was revealed in several regions in the MSA c-type patients, including right middle frontal gyrus (MFG), right precuneus, left superior temporal gyrus (STG), right lingual gyrus, left postcentral gyrus (PoCG), right cerebellum 7b, right cerebellum 8, and left cerebellum 4,5. These regions were involved in the default mode network (DMN), sensorimoter network, visual associated cortices and cerebellum. Using the rCBF value of vermis as biomarker, the two groups can be differentiated and reached a sensitivity of 95.8% and speciﬁcity of 100%. This is the first study to demonstrate the MSA-specific rCBF abnormalities using the ASL method, which are closely associated with several functional networks on resting state fMRI. The rCBF of vermis might be used as the potential imaging biomarker for the early diagnosis of MSA c-type.</description>

	<description>All cells respond to extracellular signals by altering their intracellular biochemical state. In neurons, such signaling regulates many aspects of cell and synapse biology and induces changes that are thought to be important for nervous system development, its adaptation in the face of a changing environment, and ongoing homeostatic maintenance.  Although great advances have been made in developing novel fluorescent reporters of intracellular signaling as well as in methods of fluorescence detection for use in freely moving animals, these approaches have generally not been combined. Thus, we know relatively little about how the intracellular biochemical state of neurons, and other cell classes, is dynamically regulated during animals’ behavior. Here we describe a single multi-mode fiber based fluorescent lifetime photometry system (FLiP) designed to monitor the state of fluorescence reporters of biochemical state in freely moving animals.  We demonstrate the utility of FLiP by monitoring the lifetime of FLIM-AKAR, a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter of PKA phosphorylation, in populations of direct and indirect pathway striatal projection neurons in mice receiving food rewards. We find that the activity of PKA in each pathway is transiently regulated by reward acquisition, with PKA phosphorylation being enhanced and repressed in direct and indirect pathway neurons, respectively. This study demonstrates the power of FLiP to detect changes in biochemical state induced by naturalistic experiences in behaving animals.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Electroencephalography and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Simultaneous Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in a Patient With Minimally Conscious State</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00746</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00746</link>
	<description>Objective:
A minimally conscious state (MCS) is characterized by discernible behavioral evidence of consciousness that cannot be reproduced consistently. This condition is highly challenging to treat. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential therapeutic effect of noninvasive brain stimulation in patients with MCS. In one patient in an MCS, we delivered simultaneous transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) based on an individual brain network analysis and evaluated the therapeutic effect.
Methods:
The directional transfer function (DTF) was calculated based on electroencephalograph (EEG) analysis. Global brain connectivity was calculated based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis. By referring to the EEG and fMRI results, we identified inferior parietal lobes (IPLs) as targets. In the two-week treatment period, fourteen sessions were applied to the identified bilateral parietal regions. Simultaneous 1.5 mA anodal tDCS and 5 Hz rTMS were delivered for 20 minutes per hemisphere in each session. Clinical evaluation scores were recorded weekly throughout the treatment. A second patient given the routine treatment was evaluated as a control.
Results:
The clinical scores of patient 1 with MCS improved after 2 weeks of stimulation treatment, and the effect lasted for up to 1 month. EEG analysis showed a significant increase (p &amp;lt; 0.001) in the DTF value in the gamma band in a bilateral set of posterior regions, and fMRI showed a trend toward normalized activity in the IPLs. The clinical scores of patient 2 with coma did not improve much after two weeks of routine treatment. The EEG analysis showed a significant increase (p = 0.021) in the DTF value in the gamma band in a bilateral set of posterior regions.
Conclusions:
The application of EEG and fMRI to characterize the functional connectivity features of the network in an MCS patient provided a reasonable and accurate stimulation target and verified the changes in functional connectivity resulting from stimulation.</description>

	<description>Stroke causes behavioral deficits in multiple cognitive domains and there is a growing interest in predicting patient performance from neuroimaging data using machine learning techniques. Here we investigated a deep learning approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for predicting the severity of language disorder from 3D MRI lesion images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a heterogeneous sample of stroke patients. CNN performance was compared to that of conventional (shallow) machine learning methods, including Ridge Regression on the images’ principal components and Support Vector Regression. We also devised a hybrid method based on re-using CNN’s high-level features as additional input to the Ridge Regression model. Predictive accuracy of the four different methods was further investigated in relation to the size of the training set and the level of redundancy across lesion images in the dataset, which was evaluated in terms of location and topological properties of the lesions. The hybrid model achieved the best performance in most cases, thereby suggesting that the high-level features extracted by CNNs are complementary to PCA features and improve the model’s predictive accuracy. Moreover, our analyses indicate that both the size of training data and image redundancy are critical factors in determining the accuracy of a computational model in predicting behavioural outcome from the structural brain imaging data of stroke patients.</description>

	<description>Insula plays an essential role in maintaining the addiction to cigarette smoking and smoking-related alterations on the insular volume and density have been reported in smokers. However, less is known about the effects of chronic cigarette smoking on the insular cortical thickness. In this study, we explored the region-specific changes of insular cortical thickness in heavy smokers and their relations with smoking-related variables. Thirty-seven heavy smokers (29 males; mean age 47.19±7.22 years) and 37 nonsmoking healthy controls (29 males; mean age 46.95±8.45 years) participated in the study. Subregional insular cortical thickness was evaluated and compared between the two groups. Correlation analysis was performed to investigate relationships between the insular cortical thickness and clinical characteristics in heavy smokers. There was no statistical difference on the cortical thickness in the left insula (p=0.536) between the two groups while heavy smokers had a slightly thinner cortical thickness in the right insula (p=0.048). In addition, heavy smokers showed a greater cortical thinning in the anterior (p=0.0084) and superior (p=0.0054) segment of the circular sulcus of the right insula as well as the inferior (p=0.012) segment of the circular sulcus of the left insula. Moreover, the cortical thickness of the superior segment of the circular sulcus of the left insula was correlated negatively with nicotine severity (r=-0.423; p=0.009) and the longer cigarette exposure was associated with the cortical thinning in the long insular gyrus and central sulcus of the right insula (r=-0.475; p=0.003). Our findings indicate that chronic cigarette use is associated with region-specific insular thinning, which has the potential to improve our understanding of the specific roles of insular subregions in nicotine addiction.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effect of Aging on Change of Intention</title>

	<description>Decision making often requires making arbitrary choices (‘picking’) between alternatives that make no difference to the agent, that are equally desirable, or when the potential rewards are unknown. Using event-related potentials we tested the effect of age on this common type of decision making. We compared two age groups: ages 18-25, and ages 41-67 on a masked-priming paradigm while recording EEG and EMG. Participants pressed a right or left button following either an instructive arrow cue or a neutral free-choice picking cue, both preceded by a masked arrow or neutral prime. The prime affected the behavior on the Instructed and the Free-choice picking conditions both in the younger and older groups. Moreover, electrophysiological ‘Change of Intention’ was observed via Lateralized Readiness Potential (LRP) in both age groups – the polarity of the LRP indicated first preparation to move the primed hand and then preparation to move the other hand. However, the older participants were more conservative in responding to the instructive cue, exhibiting a speed-accuracy trade-off, with slower response times, less errors in incongruent trials, and reduced probability of EMG activity in the non-responding hand. Additionally, ‘Change of Intention’ was observed in both age groups in slow RT trials with a neutral prime as a result of an endogenous early intention to respond in a direction opposite the eventual instructing arrow cue. We conclude that the basic behavioral and electrophysiological signatures of implicit change of intention are common to a wide range of ages. However, older subjects, despite showing a similar dynamic decision trajectory as younger adults, are slower, more prudent and finalize the decision making process before letting the information affect the peripheral motor system. In contrast, the flow of information in younger subjects occurs in parallel to the decision process.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Can Oscillatory Alpha-Gamma Phase-Amplitude Coupling be Used to Understand and Enhance TMS Effects?</title>

	<description>Recent applications of simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) suggest that adapting stimulation to underlying brain states may enhance neuroplastic effects of TMS. It is often assumed that longer-lasting effects of TMS on brain function may be mediated by phasic interactions between TMS pulses and endogenous cortical oscillatory dynamics. The mechanisms by which TMS exerts its neuromodulatory effects, however, remain unknown. Here we discuss evidence concerning the functional effects on synaptic plasticity of oscillatory cross-frequency coupling in cortical networks as a potential framework for understanding the neuromodulatory effects of TMS. We first discuss evidence for interactions between endogenous oscillatory brain dynamics and externally induced electromagnetic field activity. Alpha band (8-12 Hz) activities are of special interest here because of the wide application and therapeutic effectiveness of rhythmic TMS (rTMS) using a stimulus repetition frequency at or near 10 Hz. We discuss the large body of literature on alpha oscillations suggesting that alpha oscillatory cycles produce periodic inhibition or excitation of neuronal processing through phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) of low-frequency oscillations with high-frequency broadband (or gamma) bursting. Such alpha-gamma coupling may reflect excitability of neuronal ensembles underlying neuroplasticity effects of TMS. We propose that TMS delivery with simultaneous EEG recording and near-real time estimation of source-resolved alpha-gamma PAC might be used to select the precise timing of TMS pulse deliveries so as to enhance the neuroplastic effects of TMS therapies.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Acute Aerobic Exercise on Cognitive Flexibility Required During Task-Switching Paradigm</title>

	<description>The present study aimed to investigate the effects of acute aerobic exercise on underlying neuronal activities associated with task-switching processes including both mixing and switch costs. A total of 29 healthy young adults (21.4 ±1.2 years) participated in this study. The experiment consisted of an exercise and a rest condition. In the exercise condition, participants completed 30 minutes of walking and/or jogging on a motor driven treadmill sufficient to achieve an intensity of 70% of maximum heartrate (HRmax). In the rest condition, participants rested quietly for 30 minutes. Both conditions were conducted on different days, and the order was counterbalanced across participants. Participants performed the task-switching paradigm (switching between two different tasks), after both exercise and rest conditions respectively. The P3 amplitude was smaller in the non-switch trial than the single trial only in the rest condition, but not in the exercise condition. In other words, more attentional resources were allocated to the non-switch trial requiring greater amounts of working memory following the exercise condition. Mixing and switch effects on the P3 component were influenced by acute aerobic exercise. This result suggests that acute aerobic exercise may serve to facilitate the flexibility of task-set reconfiguration and maintaining the task set in working memory. Furthermore, during the switch trials, the P3 latency was shorter in the exercise condition than in the rest condition. This result is consistent with the findings of previous studies, indicating that cognitive processing speed is increased only during task conditions requiring greater amounts of executive control. Our study clearly indicates that acute aerobic exercise may facilitate cognitive flexibility as well as other executive functions (i.e., inhibitory control and working memory).</description>

	<description>A new approach to understanding the interaction between cortical areas is provided by a mathematical analysis of biased competition, which describes many interactions between cortical areas, including those involved in top-down attention. The analysis helps to elucidate the principles of operation of such cortical systems, and in particular the parameter values within which biased competition operates. The analytic results are supported by simulations that illustrate the operation of the system with parameters selected from the analysis. The findings provide a detailed mathematical analysis of the operation of these neural systems with nodes connected by feedforward (bottom-up) and feedback (top-down) connections. The analysis provides the critical value of the top-down attentional bias that enables biased competition to operate for a range of input values to the network, and derives this as a function of all the parameters in the model. The critical value of the top-down bias depends linearly on the value of the other inputs, but the coefficients in the function reveal non-linear relations between the remaining parameters. The results provide reasons why the backprojections should not be very much weaker than the forward connections between two cortical areas. The major advantage of the analytical approach is that it discloses relations between all the parameters of the model. This task cannot be fulfilled purely by numerical simulations.</description>

	<description>Frataxin deficiency is the pathogenic cause of Friedreich’s Ataxia, an autosomal recessive disease characterized by the increase of oxidative stress and production of free radicals in the cell. Although the onset of the pathology occurs in the second decade of life, cognitive differences and defects in brain structure and functional activation are observed in patients, suggesting developmental defects to take place during fetal neurogenesis. Here we describe impairments in proliferation, stemness potential and differentiation in neural stem cells isolated from the embryonic cortex of the Frataxin Knockin/Knockout mouse, a disease animal model whose slow-evolving phenotype makes it suitable to study pre-symptomatic defects that may manifest before the clinical onset. We demonstrate that enhancing the expression and activity of the antioxidant response master regulator Nrf2 ameliorates the phenotypic defects observed in neural stem cells, re-establishing a proper differentiation program.</description>

	<description>The immune system provides protection in the CNS via resident microglial cells and those that traffic into it in the course of pathological challenges. These populations of cells are key players in modulating immune functions that are involved in disease outcomes. In this review, we briefly summarize and highlight the current state of knowledge of the differential contributions of microglia and monocytes in Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis. The role of innate immunity is frequently seen as a Yin and Yang in both diseases, but this depends on the environment, pre-clinical disease models and the type of cells involved.</description>

	<description>The development of the human cerebral cortex is a complex and dynamic process, in which neural stem cell proliferation, neuronal migration and post-migratory neuronal organization need to occur in a well-organized fashion. Alterations at any of these crucial stages can result in Malformations of Cortical Development (MCDs), a group of genetically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders that present with developmental delay, intellectual disability and epilepsy. Recent progress in genetic technologies, such as next generation sequencing, most often focusing on all protein-coding exons (e.g., Whole Exome Sequencing), allowed the discovery of more than a hundred genes associated with various types of MCDs. Although this has considerably increased the diagnostic yield, most MCD cases still remain unexplained. As Whole Exome Sequencing investigates only a minor part of the human genome (1-2%), it is likely that patients, in which no disease-causing mutation has been identified, could harbor mutations in genomic regions beyond the exome. Even though functional annotation of non-coding regions is still lagging behind that of protein-coding genes, tremendous progress has been made in the field of gene regulation. One group of non-coding regulatory regions are enhancers, which can be distantly located upstream or downstream of genes and which can mediate temporal and tissue-specific transcriptional control via long-distance interactions with promoter regions. Although some examples exist in literature that link alterations of enhancers to genetic disorders, a widespread appreciation of the putative roles of these sequences in MCDs is still lacking. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge on cis-regulatory regions and discuss novel technologies such as massively-parallel reporter assay systems, CRISPR-Cas9-based screens and computational approaches that help to further  elucidate the emerging role of the non-coding genome in disease. Moreover, we discuss existing literature on mutations or copy number alterations of regulatory regions involved in brain development. We foresee that the future implementation of the knowledge obtained through ongoing gene regulation studies will benefit patients and will provide an explanation to part of the missing heritability of MCDs and other genetic disorders.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Functional Dissection of C. elegans bZip-Protein CEBP-1 Reveals Novel Structural Motifs Required for Axon Regeneration and Nuclear Import</title>

	<description>The basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) domain transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) have a variety of roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and stress response. In the nervous system, several isoforms of C/EBP function in learning and memory, neuronal plasticity, neuroinflammation and axon regeneration. We previously reported that the C. elegans C/EBP homolog, CEBP-1, is essential for axon regeneration. CEBP-1 consists of 319 amino acids, with its bZIP domain at the C-terminus and a long N-terminal fragment with no known protein motifs. Here, using forward genetic screening with targeted genome editing, we have identified a unique domain in the N-terminus that is critical for its in vivo function. Additionally, we characterized three nuclear localization signals (NLS) in CEBP-1 that act together to mediate CEBP-1’s nuclear import. Moreover, the Importin-α, IMA-3, can bind to CEBP-1 via one of the NLS. ima-3 is ubiquitously expressed in all somatic cells, and ima-3 null mutants are larval lethal. Using Cre-lox dependent neuron-specific deletion strategy, we show that ima-3 is not critical for axon development, but is required for axon regeneration in adults. Together, these data advance our understanding of CEBP-1’s function, and suggest new regulators that remain to be identified to expand the CEBP-1 protein interactome.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Expression of Oncofetal Antigen 5T4 in Murine Taste Papillae</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00343</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00343</link>
	<description>BACKGROUND: Multicellular taste buds located within taste papillae on the tongue mediate taste sensation. In taste papillae, taste bud cells, such as taste receptor cells and taste precursor cells, and the surrounding lingual epithelium including epithelial progenitors (also called taste stem/progenitor cells) are maintained by continuous cell turnover throughout life. However, it remains unknown how the cells constituting taste buds proliferate and differentiate to maintain taste bud tissue. Based on in situ hybridization screening, we demonstrated that the oncofetal antigen 5T4 (also known as trophoblast glycoprotein: TPBG) gene is expressed in the adult mouse tongue.
RESULTS: In immunohistochemistry of coronal tongue sections, 5T4 protein was detected at a low level exclusively in the basal part of the lingual epithelium in developing and adult mice, and at a high level particularly in foliate papillae and circumvallate papillae (CVPs). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry of the basal part of CVPs indicated that the proliferation marker PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) co-localized with 5T4. 5T4 was strongly expressed in Krt5+ epithelial progenitors and Shh+ taste precursor cells, but weakly in mature taste receptor cells. The number of proliferating cells in the CVP was higher in 5T4-knockout mice than in wild-type mice, while neither cell differentiation nor the size of taste buds differed between these two groups of mice. Notably, X-ray irradiation enhanced cell proliferation more in 5T4-knockout mice than in wild-type mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that 5T4, expressed in epithelial progenitors (taste stem/progenitor cells) and taste precursor cells, may influence the maintenance of taste papillae under both normal and injury conditions.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Using Genetically Encoded Voltage Indicators (GEVIs) to Study the Input-Output Transformation of the Mammalian Olfactory Bulb</title>

	<description>Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) are fluorescent protein reporters of membrane potential. These tools can, in principle, be used to monitor the neural activity of genetically distinct cell types in the brain. Although introduced in 1997, they have been a challenge to use to study intact neural circuits due to a combination of small signal-to-noise ratio, slow kinetics, and poor membrane expression. New strategies have yielded novel GEVIs such as ArcLight, which have improved properties. Here we compare the in vivo properties of ArcLight with Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECIs) in the mouse olfactory bulb. We show how voltage imaging can be combined with organic calcium sensitive dyes to measure the input-output transformation of the olfactory bulb. Finally, we demonstrate that ArcLight can be targeted to olfactory bulb interneurons. The olfactory bulb contributes substantially to the perception of the concentration invariance of odor recognition.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Laminar Pattern of Projections Indicates the Hierarchical Organization of the Anterior Cingulate-Temporal Lobe Emotion System</title>

	<description>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), surrounding the genu of the corpus callosum, plays important roles in emotional processing and is functionally divided into the dorsal, perigenual, and subgenual subregions (dACC, pgACC, and sgACC, respectively). Previous studies have suggested that the pgACC and sgACC are involved in mood disorders in different manners. Anatomically, the ACC has rich connections with other emotion-related areas including the amygdala and the medial temporal and temporal pole (TP) areas. To understand the neuroanatomical basis of the functional differences between the ACC subregions, we injected neuronal tracers into the pgACC, sgACC, and dACC and compared the afferent connections. Previously, we analyzed the afferent projections from the amygdala, and found a distinct pattern for the sgACC. In the present study, the patterns of the afferent projections were analyzed in the temporal pole and medial temporal areas. After injections in the sgACC, many labeled neurons were found in the TP and the subiculum of the hippocampal formation. In the TP, a majority of the labeled cell bodies was found in the superficial layers (“feedforward” type projections). The pgACC received afferent projections from the TP, the entorhinal cortex, and the parahippocampal cortex, but not from the hippocampus. In each area, the labeled cells were mainly found in the deep layers (“feedback” type projection). The pattern for the dACC was similar to that for the pgACC. Within the ACC, the projections from the sgACC to the pgACC originated predominantly in the deep layers (“feedback” type projection). These data suggest that the sgACC ranks higher than the pgACC in the hierarchy of the emotional system.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Dentate Gyrus Peroxiredoxin 6 Levels Discriminate Aged Unimpaired From Impaired Rats in a Spatial Memory Task</title>

	<description>Similar to humans, the normal aged rat population is not homogenous in terms of cognitive function. Two distinct subpopulations of aged Sprague-Dawley rats can be identified on the basis of spatial memory performance in the hole-board paradigm. It was the aim of the study to reveal protein changes relevant to aging and spatial memory performance.
Aged impaired (AI) and unimpaired (AU) male rats, 22-24 months old were selected from a large cohort of 160 animals; young animals served as controls. Enriched synaptosomal fraction from dentate gyrus from behaviourally characterized old animals were used for isobaric tags labelling based quantitative proteomic analysis. As differences in peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) levels were a pronounced finding, PRDX6 levels were also quantified by immunoblotting.
AI showed impaired spatial memory abilities while AU performed comparable to young animals. Our study demonstrates substantial quantitative alteration of proteins involved in energy metabolism, inflammation and synaptic plasticity during aging. Moreover, we identified protein changes specifically coupled to memory performance of aged rats. PRDX6 levels clearly differentiated AI from AU and levels in AU were comparable to those of young animals. In addition, it was observed that stochasticity in protein levels increased with age and discriminate between AI and AU groups. Moreover, there was a significantly higher variability of protein levels in AI.  
PRDX6 is a member of the peroxiredoxin family and well-defined as a cystein-1 PRDX that reduces and detoxifies hydroxyperoxides. It is well-known and documented that the aging brain shows increased active oxygen species but so far no study proposed a potential target with antioxidant activity that would discriminate between impaired and unimpaired memory performers. Current data, representing so far the largest proteomics data set in aging DG, provide first evidence for a probable role of PRDX6 in memory performance.</description>

	<description>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease worldwide and the availability of early biomarkers and novel biotargets represents an urgent medical need. The main pathogenetic hallmark of PD is the specific loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons, in which mitochondrial dysfunction plays a crucial role. Mitochondrial proteases are central to the maintenance of healthy mitochondria and they have recently emerged as drug targets. However, an exhaustive characterization of these enzymes and their targets is still lacking, due to difficulties in analyzing proteolytic fragments by bottom-up proteomics approaches. 
	Here, we propose the “mitochondrial dimethylation-TAILS” strategy, which combines the isolation of mitochondria with the enrichment of N-terminal peptides to analyze the mitochondrial N-terminome. We applied this method in a cellular model of altered dopamine homeostasis in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, which recapitulates early steps of PD pathogenesis. The main aim was to identify candidate mitochondrial proteases aberrantly activated by dopamine dysregulation and their cleaved targets. The proposed degradomics workflow was able to improve the identification of mitochondrial proteins if compared to classical shotgun analysis. In detail, 40% coverage of the mitochondrial proteome was obtained, the sequences of the transit peptides of two mitochondrial proteins was unveiled, and a consensus cleavage sequence for proteases involved in the processing of mitochondrial proteins was depicted. Mass spectrometry proteomics data have been submitted to ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD013900. Moreover, sixty-one N-terminal peptides whose levels were affected by dopamine treatment were identified. By an in-depth analysis of the proteolytic peptides included in this list, eleven mitochondrial proteins showed altered proteolytic processing. One of these proteins (i.e., the 39S ribosomal protein L49 - MRPL49) was cleaved by the neprilysin protease, already exploited in clinics as a biotarget. We eventually demonstrated a mitochondrial subcellular localization of neprilysin in human cells for the first time.
	Collectively, these results shed new light on mitochondrial dysfunction linked to dopamine imbalance in PD and opened up the possibility to explore the mitochondrial targets of neprilysin as candidate biomarkers.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation for Explaining Deep Neural Network Decisions in MRI-Based Alzheimer's Disease Classification</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00194</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00194</link>
	<description>Deep neural networks have led to state-of-the-art results in many medical imaging tasks including Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection based on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. However, the network decisions are often perceived as being highly non-transparent making it difficult to apply these algorithms in clinical routine. In this study, we propose using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to visualize convolutional neural network decisions for AD based on MRI data. Similarly to other visualization methods, LRP produces a heatmap in the input space indicating the importance / relevance of each voxel contributing to the final classification outcome. In contrast to susceptibility maps produced by guided backpropagation (``Which change in voxels would change the outcome most?&quot;), the LRP method is able to directly highlight positive contributions to the network classification in the input space. In particular, we show that (1) the LRP method is very specific for individuals (``Why does this person have AD?&quot;) with high inter-patient variability, (2) there is very little relevance for AD in healthy controls and (3) areas that exhibit a lot of relevance correlate well with what is known from literature. To quantify the latter, we compute size-corrected metrics of the summed relevance per brain area, e.g. relevance density or relevance gain. Although these metrics produce very individual `fingerprints' of relevance patterns for AD patients, a lot of importance is put on areas in the temporal lobe including the hippocampus. After discussing several limitations such as sensitivity towards the underlying model and computation parameters, we conclude that LRP might have a high potential to assist clinicians in explaining neural network decisions for diagnosing AD (and potentially other diseases) based on structural MRI data.</description>

	<description>As the prevalence of Alzheimer disease continues to rise unabated, new models have been put forth to improve our understanding of this devastating condition.  Although individual models may have their merits, integrated models may prove more valuable. Indeed, the reliable failures of monotherapies for Alzheimer disease, and the ensuing surrender of major drug companies, suggests that an integrated perspective may be necessary if we are to invent multifaceted treatments that could ultimately prove more successful. In this review, we discuss the Wnt/GSK3B, a-synuclein, and type 3 diabetes hypotheses of Alzheimer disease and their deep interconnection in order to foster the integrative thinking that may be required to reach a solution for the coming neurological epidemic.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Cortical Structure and Cognition in Infants and Toddlers</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/div&gt;Cortical structure has been consistently related to cognitive abilities in children and adults, yet we know little about how the cortex develops to support emergent cognition in infancy and toddlerhood when cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) are maturing rapidly. In this report, we assessed how regional and global measures of CT and SA in a sample (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 487) of healthy neonates, 1-year-olds, and 2-year-olds related to motor, language, visual reception, and general cognitive ability. We report novel findings that thicker cortices at ages 1 and 2 and larger SA at birth, age 1, and age 2 confer a cognitive advantage in infancy and toddlerhood. While several expected brain–cognition relationships were observed, overlapping cortical regions were also implicated across cognitive domains, suggesting that infancy marks a period of plasticity and refinement in cortical structure to support burgeoning motor, language, and cognitive abilities. CT may be a particularly important morphological indicator of ability, but its impact on cognition is relatively weak when compared with gestational age and maternal education. Findings suggest that prenatal and early postnatal cortical developments are important for cognition in infants and toddlers but should be considered in relation to other child and demographic factors.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Robustness of respiratory rhythm generation across dynamic regimes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan E. Rubin, Jeffrey C. Smith&lt;/p&gt;

A central issue in the study of the neural generation of respiratory rhythms is the role of the intrinsic pacemaking capabilities that some respiratory neurons exhibit. The debate on this issue has occurred in parallel to investigations of interactions among respiratory network neurons and how these contribute to respiratory behavior. In this computational study, we demonstrate how these two issues are inextricably linked. We use simulations and dynamical systems analysis to show that once a conditional respiratory pacemaker, which can be tuned across oscillatory and non-oscillatory dynamic regimes in isolation, is embedded into a respiratory network, its dynamics become masked: the network exhibits similar dynamical properties regardless of the conditional pacemaker node’s tuning, and that node’s outputs are dominated by network influences. Furthermore, the outputs of the respiratory central pattern generator as a whole are invariant to these changes of dynamical properties, which ensures flexible and robust performance over a wide dynamic range.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XyZO8F7-3rc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Amyloid Imaging of Dutch‐type Hereditary Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy Carriers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25560?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25560?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether amyloid imaging with the positron emission tomography (PET) agent Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) can detect vascular ß‐amyloid (Aß) in the essentially pure form of cerebral amyloid angiopathy associated with the Dutch‐type hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy (D‐CAA) mutation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PiB retention in a cortical composite of frontal, lateral, and retrosplenial regions (FLR) was measured by PiB‐PET in 19 D‐CAA mutation carriers (M+; 13 without neurologic symptoms, 6 with prior lobar intracerebral hemorrhage) and 17 mutation non‐carriers (M‐). Progression of PiB retention was analyzed in a subset of 18 serially imaged individuals (10 asymptomatic M+, 8 M‐). We also analyzed associations between PiB retention and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aß concentrations in 17 M+ and 11 M‐ participants who underwent lumbar puncture and compared the findings to PiB‐PET and CSF Aß in 37 autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) mutation carriers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D‐CAA M+ showed greater age‐dependent FLR PiB retention (p&amp;lt;0.001) than M‐, and serially imaged asymptomatic M+ demonstrated greater longitudinal increases (p=0.004). Among M+, greater FLR PiB retention associated with reduced CSF concentrations of Aß40 (r=‐0.55, p=0.021) but not Aß42 (r=0.01, p=0.991). Despite comparably low CSF Aß40 and Aß42, PiB retention was substantially less in D‐CAA than ADAD (p&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased PiB retention in D‐CAA and correlation with reduced CSF Aß40 suggest this compound labels vascular amyloid, though to a lesser degree than amyloid deposits in ADAD. Progression in PiB signal over time suggests amyloid PET as a potential biomarker in trials of candidate agents for this untreatable cause of hemorrhagic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether soluble growth stimulation expressed gene 2 (sST2), a prognostic marker in cardiovascular and inflammatory disorders, is associated with neurological injury after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied SAH patients from 2 independent cohorts. Outcome assessments included functional status at 90 days using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), mortality, and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). The relationships between sST2 plasma level and outcome measures were assessed in both cross‐sectional and longitudinal analysis. Primary blood mononuclear cells from SAH patients and elective aneurysm controls were analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometry.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discovery cohort, sST2 predicted 90‐day mRS 3–6 (C index = 0.724, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and mortality in Kaplan–Meier analysis (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). The association with functional status was independent of age, sex, World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies score, modified Fisher score, treatment modality, and cardiac comorbidities (adjusted odds ratio = 2.28, 95% confidence interval = 1.04–5.00, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.039). Higher sST2 concentration was observed in those patients with DCI (90.8 vs 53.7ng/ml, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003). These associations were confirmed in a replication cohort. In patients with high sST2, flow cytometry identified decreased expression of CD14 (4.27 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; ± 2,950 arbitrary unit (AU) vs 5.64 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; ± 1,290 AU, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and increased expression of CD16 (39,960 ± 272 AU vs 34,869 ± 183 AU, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasma sST2 predicts DCI, functional outcome, and mortality after SAH, independent of clinical and radiographic markers. Elevated sST2 is also associated with changes in CD14&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Can We Use 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium Chloride-Stained Brain Slices for Other Purposes? The Application of Western Blotting</title>

	<description>2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining is a commonly used method to determine the volume of the cerebral infarction in experimental stroke models. The TTC staining protocol is considered to interfere with downstream analyses, and it is unclear whether TTC-stained brain samples can be used for biochemistry analyses. However, there is evidence indicating that, with proper optimization and handling, TTC-stained brains may remain viable for protein analyses. In the present study, we aimed to rigorously assess whether TTC can reliably be used for western blotting of various markers. In this study, brain samples obtained from C57BL/6 male mice were treated with TTC (TTC+) or left untreated (TTC-) at 1 week after photothrombotic occlusion or sham surgery. Brain regions were dissected into infarct, thalamus and hippocampus and proteins were extracted by using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. Protein levels of apoptosis, autophagy, neuronal, glial, vascular and neurodegenerative related markers were analyzed by western blotting. Our results showed that TTC+ brains display similar relative changes in most of the markers compared with TTC- brains. In addition, we validated that these analyses can be performed in the infarct as well as other brain regions such as the thalamus and hippocampus. Our findings demonstrate that TTC+ brains are reliable for protein analyses using western blotting.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Malocclusion Generates Anxiety-Like Behavior Through a Putative Lateral Habenula–Mesencephalic Trigeminal Nucleus Pathway</title>

	<description>Malocclusion is an important risk factor for temporomandibular disorder (TMD), a series of disorders characterized by dysfunction in the orofacial region involving the temporomandibular joint and jaw muscles. We recently showed that experimental unilateral anterior crossbite (UAC) produced masseter hyperactivity through a circuit involving the periodontal proprioception, trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus (Vme), and trigeminal motor nucleus (Vmo). Anxiety is a common complication in patients with TMD. The lateral habenula (LHb) is involved in emotional modulation and has direct projections to the Vme. Therefore, the present research examined whether UAC facilitates excitatory input from the LHb to the Vme and subsequently anxiety-like behaviors in rats. The LHb activation was evaluated by the electrophysiological recording, assessment of vesicular glutamate transporter-2 (VGLUT2) mRNA expression, and measurement of anxiety-like behaviors. The effects of LHb activity on Vme were evaluated by electrophysiological recording from Vme neurons and local changes in VGLUT2 protein density. UAC produced anxiety in modelled rats and increased neuronal activity in the LHb. VGLUT2 mRNA expression was also increased in the LHb. Further, VGLUT2-positive boutons were observed in close apposite upon parvalbumin-labelled Vme neurons. VGLUT2 protein expression was also increased in the Vme. Significantly, injection of VGLUT2-targeted shRNA into the LHb reduced the expression of VGLUT2 protein in the Vme, attenuated UAC-associated anxiety-like behaviors, and attenuated electrophysiological changes in the Vme neurons. In conclusion, we show that UAC activates the LHb neurons as well as the periodontal proprioceptive pathway to provide excitatory input to the Vme and produce anxiety in rats. These findings provide a rationale for suppressing activity of the LHb to attenuate both the physical and psychological effects of TMD.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Taste Responses in the Nucleus of the Solitary Tract of Awake Obese Rats Are Blunted Compared With Those in Lean Rats</title>

	<description>Taste perception changes with obesity but the underlying neural changes remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we recorded taste responses from single cells in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS, the first synapse in the central gustatory circuit) in awake, diet-induced obese [(DIO; ≥ 8wks on a high-energy diet (45%fat, 17% sugar; HED)] and lean rats. Rats were implanted with a bundle of microelectrodes in the NTS and allowed to recover. Water-deprived rats were allowed to freely lick various tastants in an experimental chamber. Taste stimuli included an array of sapid stimuli dissolved in artificial saliva (AS). Each taste trial consisted of five consecutive licks followed by five AS licks presented on a VR5 schedule. Results showed that taste responses in NTS cells in DIO rats (n=49) were smaller in magnitude, shorter in duration and longer in latency that those in lean rats (n=74).  However, there were proportionately more taste-responsive cells in DIO than in lean rats. Lick coherence in DIO rats was significantly lower than in lean rats, both in taste-responsive and lick-related cells (n=172 in lean; n=65 in DIO). Analyses of temporal coding showed that taste cells in DIO rats conveyed less information about taste quality than cells in lean rats. Collectively, results suggest that a HED produces blunted, but more prevalent, responses to taste in the NTS and a weakened association of taste responses with ingestive behavior. These neural adaptations may represent both negative effects and compensatory mechanisms of a HED that may underlie deficits in taste-related behavior associated with obesity.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Olfactory fMRI Activation Pattern Across Different Concentrations Changes in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>The olfactory involvement is an early feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The olfactory functional MRI (fMRI) is an objective method to evaluate the olfactory function, but might be affected by the individual variation and the magnetic susceptibility artifact of basis cranii. To improve the reliability of olfactory fMRI, we explored the response of primary olfactory cortex (POC) across three different concentrations of odors. 44 normal controls, 46 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 44 patients with AD underwent olfactory fMRI using lavender stimuli of three different (0.10%, 0.33%, and 1.00%) concentrations during one fMRI sequence with a 3.0T MRI scanner. The numbers of activated voxels in the POC especially the activation changes during different concentrations were analyzed. The POC activation pattern of controls showed olfactory adaptation at the higher concentration, whereas the AD patients showed not only increased olfactory threshold but also lack of olfactory habituation. Five types of activation patterns across different concentrations were summarized to evaluate the olfactory function. The result showed the activation pattern could effectively found 40/44(90.9%) of the ADs showed impaired habituation, whereas 31/44(70.5%) of the normal controls showed normal olfactory habituation. In MCIs, 29/46(63.0%) of subjects showed impaired habituation. This finding indicates that the POC activation pattern of olfactory fMRI across different concentrations is useful in evaluating the olfactory function, which is important in the detection of early AD among MCI cases.</description>

	<description>Electrical stimulation of the brain through the implantation of electrodes is an effective treatment for certain diseases and the focus of a large body of research investigating new cell mechanisms, neurological phenomena, and treatments. Electrode devices developed for stimulation in rodents vary widely in size, cost, and functionality, with the majority of recent studies presenting complex, multi-functional designs. While some experiments require these added features, others are in greater need of reliable, low cost, and readily available devices that will allow surgeries to be scheduled and completed without delay. In this work, we utilize 3D printing and common electrical hardware to produce an effective 2-channel stimulation device that meets these requirements. Our stimulation electrode has not failed in over 60 consecutive surgeries, costs less than $1 USD, and can be assembled in less than 20 minutes. 3D printing minimizes the amount of material used in manufacturing the device and enables one to match the curvature of the connector’s base with the curvature of the mouse skull, producing an ultra-lightweight, low size device with improved adhesion to the mouse skull. The range of the stimulation parameters used with the proposed device was: pulse amplitude 1-200 μA, pulse duration 50-500 μs and pulse frequency 1-285Hz.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Chemogenetic Modulation of Orexin Neurons Reverses Changes in Anxiety and Locomotor Activity in the A53T Mouse Model of Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. PD symptomology is recognized as heterogeneous and in addition to motor function decline, includes cognitive, mood, sleep and metabolic disorders. Previous studies showed early reductions in anxiety and locomotion in the A53T mice model of PD. Since inflammation and astrogliosis are an integral part of PD pathology and impair proper neuronal function, we were keen to investigate if behavioral changes in A53T mice are accompanied by increased inflammation and astrogliosis in the Hippocampus (Hipp) and motor cortex (mCtx), brain regions involved in the regulation of anxiety and locomotion, respectively. To test this, we used 3, 5, and 7-month old A53T mice to examine anxiety-like behavior, locomotion, and expression of inflammation and astrogliosis markers in the hippocampus (Hipp) and motor cortex (mCtx). Further, we examined the presence of alpha-synuclein accumulation in orexin neurons and orexin neuronal loss. The data show early reductions in anxiety like behavior as well as increased locomotor activity, which was accompanied by inflammation and astrogliosis in the Hipp and mCtx. Due to the persistence of the orexin neuron population in A53T mice and the involvement of orexin in anxiety and locomotor regulation, we hypothesized that chemogenetic modulation of orexin neurons would reverse the observed reductions in anxiety-like behavior and the increases in locomotor activity in these animals. We showed that chemogenetic activation of orexin neurons in A53T mice restores anxiety-like behavior back to control levels without affecting locomotor activity, whereas the inhibition of orexin neurons reverses the elevated locomotor activity without any effects on anxiety-like behavior. This study exemplifies the complex role of orexin neurons in this model of PD and demonstrates the novel finding that changes in locomotor and anxiety-like behavior are accompanied by inflammation and astrogliosis.  Together, these data suggest that the orexin system may play a significant role in early and late stages of PD.</description>

	<description>Analysis of spike and local field potential (LFP) data is an essential part of neuroscientific research. Today there exist many open-source toolboxes for spike and LFP data analysis implementing various functionality. Here we aim to provide a practical guidance for neuroscientists in the choice of an open-source toolbox best satisfying their needs. We overview major open-source toolboxes for spike and LFP data analysis as well as toolboxes with tools for connectivity analysis, dimensionality reduction and generalized linear modeling. We focus on comparing toolboxes functionality, statistical and visualization tools, documentation and support quality. To give a better insight, we compare and illustrate functionality of the toolboxes on open-access dataset or simulated data and make corresponding MATLAB scripts publicly available.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Revealing the Synaptic Hodology of Mammalian Neural Circuits With Multiscale Neurocartography</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00052</guid>

	<description>The functional features of neural circuits are determined by a combination of properties that range in scale from projections systems across the whole brain to molecular interactions at the synapse. The burgeoning field of neurocartography seeks to map these relevant features of brain structure—spanning a volume ~20 orders of magnitude—to determine how neural circuits perform computations supporting cognitive function and complex behavior. Recent technological breakthroughs in tissue sample preparation, high-throughput electron microscopy imaging, and automated image analyses have produced the first visualizations of all synaptic connections between neurons of invertebrate model systems. However, the sheer size of the central nervous system in mammals implies that reconstruction of the first full brain maps at synaptic scale may not be feasible for decades. In this review, we outline existing and emerging technologies for neurocartography that complement electron microscopy-based strategies and are beginning to derive some basic organizing principles of circuit hodology at the mesoscale, microscale, and nanoscale. Specifically, we discuss how a host of light microscopy techniques including array tomography have been utilized to determine both long-range and subcellular organizing principles of synaptic connectivity. In addition, we discuss how new techniques, such as two-photon serial tomography of the entire mouse brain, have become attractive approaches to dissect the potential connectivity of defined cell types. Ultimately, principles derived from these techniques promise to facilitate a conceptual understanding of how connectomes, and neurocartography in general, can be effectively utilized towards reaching a mechanistic understanding of circuit function.

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: P300 Speller Performance Predictor Based on RSVP Multi-feature</title>

	<description>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been developed so that people can control computers or machines through their brain activity without limb movements. The P300 speller is one of the BCI applications most commonly used as it is very simple and reliable and may achieve relatively higher accuracy compared to other types of BCIs. However, like other BCIs, the P300 speller still has performance variation issues in practical use, for example, selecting the best tradeoff between spelling accuracy and information transfer rate (speed). Therefore, seeking correlates of the P300 speller’s performance and predicting their performance is necessary to improve the P300 speller. In this work, we investigated the correlations between rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task features and the P300 speller performance. Fifty-five subjects participated in the RSVP and conventional matrix P300 speller tasks, and RSVP behavioral features and electroencephalography features were compared to the P300 speller performance. We found that several ERP features and behavioral features of the RSVP were correlated with the P300 speller’s offline binary classification accuracy. Using these RSVP features, we proposed a simple multi-feature performance predictor (r = 0.53, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) that outperformed any single feature performance predictor, including the conventional RSVP T1% predictor (r  = 0.32, p &amp;lt; 0.05). This result demonstrates that selective multi-features can predict BCI performance better than only a single feature.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Modulates the Effect of Unreasonable Request in the Context of Peer Punishment</title>

	<description>Making a request is a common occurrence during social interactions. In most social contexts, requesters may impose punishments and many behavioral studies have focused on the differential effects of reasonable and unreasonable requests during such interactions. However, few studies have explored whether reasonable or unreasonable requests involve differential neurocognitive mechanisms. In this study, we used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to investigate the mechanistic effects of request within the context of peer punishment. We used a modified ultimatum game (UG) task as well as a modified dictator game (DG) task. Both unreasonable and reasonable requests induced the proposer to increase their monetary offer for both tasks. Moreover, in the modified UG task, cathodal tDCS over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) significantly decreased the effect of an unreasonable request when compared to sham stimulation. Cathodal stimulation did not impact the effect of a reasonable request on the modified UG task. For the modified DG task, no tDCS effect for either an unreasonable or reasonable request was observed. These findings suggest that rDLPFC was only involved in decision-making processes during unreasonable requests when there was an opportunity for peer punishment. Moreover, our results indicate that reasonable and unreasonable requests involve differential neurocognitive mechanisms in the context of possible peer punishment.</description>

	<description>This study compared the predictive power and robustness of texture, topological, and convolutional neural network (CNN) based image features for measuring tumors in MRI.  These features were used to predict 1p/19q codeletion in the MICCAI BRATS 2017 challenge dataset.  Topological data analysis (TDA) based on persistent homology had predictive performance as good as or better than texture-based features and was also less susceptible to image-based perturbations.  Features from a pre-trained convolutional neural network had similar predictive performances and robustness as TDA, but also performed better using an alternative classification algorithm, k-top scoring pairs.  Feature robustness can be used as a filtering technique without greatly impacting model performance and can also be used to evaluate model stability.</description>

	<description>Propagating waves with complex dynamics have been widely observed in neural population activity. To understand their formation mechanisms, we investigate a type of two-dimensional neural field model by systematically varying its recurrent excitatory and inhibitory inputs. We show that the neural field model exhibits a rich repertoire of dynamical activity states when the relevant strength of excitation and inhibition is increased, ranging from localized rotating and traveling waves to global waves. Particularly, near the transition between stable states of rotating and traveling waves, the model exhibits a bistable state; that is, both the rotating and the travelling waves can exist, and the inclusion of noise can induce spontaneous transitions between them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when there are multiple propagating waves, they exhibit rich collective propagation dynamics with variable propagating speeds and trajectories. We use techniques from time series analysis such detrended fluctuation analysis to characterize the effect of the strength of excitation and inhibition on these collective dynamics, which range from purely random motion to motion with long-range spatiotemporal correlations. These results provide insights into the possible contribution of excitation and inhibition towards a range of previously observed spatiotemporal wave phenomena.</description>

	<description>Histopathological studies revealed that progressive neuropathies including Alzheimer, and Prion diseases among others, include accumulations of misfolded proteins intracellularly, extracellularly, or both. Experimental evidence suggests that among the accumulated misfolded proteins, small soluble oligomeric conformers represent the most neurotoxic species. Concomitant phenomena shared by different protein misfolding diseases includes alterations in phosphorylation-based signaling pathways synaptic dysfunction, and axonal pathology, but mechanisms linking these pathogenic features to aggregated neuropathogenic proteins remain unknown. Relevant to this issue, results from recent work revealed inhibition of fast axonal transport (AT) as a novel toxic effect elicited by oligomeric forms of amyloid beta and cellular prion protein PrPC, signature pathological proteins associated with Alzheimer and Prion diseases, respectively. Interestingly, the toxic effect of these oligomers was fully prevented by pharmacological inhibitors of casein kinase 2 (CK2), a remarkable discovery with major implications for the development of pharmacological target-driven therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer and Prion diseases.</description>

	<description>Some forms of triamcinolone may provide alternate options for local therapy of the inner ear in addition to the steroids currently in use. We compared the perilymph pharmacokinetics of triamcinolone-acetonide, triamcinolone and dexamethasone, each delivered as crystalline suspensions to guinea pigs. Triamcinolone-acetonide is a widely used form of the drug with molecular properties that allow it to readily permeate biological barriers. When applied intratympanically triamcinolone-acetonide entered perilymph rapidly but was also found to be eliminated rapidly from perilymph. The rapid rate of elimination severely limits the apical distribution of the drug when applied locally, making it unsuitable for use in the ear. In contrast, triamcinolone, rather than triamcinolone-acetonide, is a more polar form of the molecule, with higher aqueous solubility but calculated to pass less-readily through biological boundaries. Perilymph concentrations generated with intratympanic applications of triamcinolone were comparable to those with triamcinolone-acetonide but elimination measurements showed that triamcinolone was retained in perilymph longer than triamcinolone-acetonide or dexamethasone. The slower elimination is projected to result in improved distribution of triamcinolone towards the cochlear apex, potentially allowing higher drug levels to reach the speech frequency regions of the human ear. These measurements show that triamcinolone could constitute an attractive additional treatment option for local therapy of auditory disorders.</description>

	<description>Myotonic dystrophy (Dystrophia Myotonica; DM) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy and brain symptoms seriously affect patient’s quality of life. The Muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins are splicing factors regulating posttranscriptional RNA during development. Previously, Mbnl KO mouse lines showed molecular and phenotypic evidences that recapitulating DM brains, however, detail morphological study has not yet been accomplished. In our studies, control (Mbnl1+/+; Mbnl2cond/cond; Nestin-Cre-/-), Mbnl2 conditional knockout (2KO, Mbnl1+/+; Mbnl2cond/cond; Nestin-Cre+/-) and Mbnl1/2 DKO (DKO, Mbnl1ΔE3/ΔE3; Mbnl2cond/cond; Nestin-Cre+/-) mice were generated by crossing three individual lines. Immunohistochemistry for evaluating densities and distributions of cortical neurons; Golgi staining for depicting the dendrites/dendritic spines; and electron microscopy for analyzing postsynaptic ultrastructure were performed. We found migratory defects in cortical neurons, reduction in dendritic complexity, immature dendritic spines and alterations of postsynaptic densities in the mutants. In conclusion, loss of function of Mbnl1/2 caused fundamental defects affecting neuronal positioning during migration, dendritic morphology and postsynaptic architectures that are reminiscent of predominantly immature and fetal phenotypes in DM patients.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Age-Related Functional and Expressional Changes in Efflux Pathways at the Blood-Brain Barrier</title>

	<description>During the last decade several papers reported a relationship between advanced age and changes in the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. These alterations manifested not only in the morphology and structure of the cerebral microvessels but also in the expression and function of the transporter proteins in the apical and basolateral surface of the capillary endothelial cells. Age-associated downregulation of the efflux pumps (ABC transporters) resulted in increased permeability and greater brain exposure to different xenobiotics enhancing the risk of drug-induced toxicity. In age-related neurodegenerative pathologies like Alzheimer’s disease the amyloid beta clearance decreased due to P-glycoprotein dysfunction leading to higher brain exposure. In the contrary, in stroke an enhanced P-glycoprotein function was reported in the cerebral capillaries making even more difficult to perform effective neuroprotective therapy in the infarcted brain area. This article is focusing on the role of efflux transporters at the blood-brain barrier in age-related brain pathologies and also in healthy aging.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Age-Related Reductions in Tactile and Motor Inhibitory Function Start Early but Are Independent</title>

	<description>Aging is associated with declines in motor and somatosensory function. Some of these motor declines have been linked to age-related reductions in inhibitory function. Here we examined whether tactile surround inhibition also changes with age, and whether these changes are associated with those in the motor domain. We tested a group of 56 participants spanning a wide age range (18-76 years old), allowing us to examine when age differences emerge across the lifespan. Participants performed tactile and motor tasks that have previously been linked to inter- and intrahemispheric inhibition in the somatosensory and motor systems. Results showed that aging is associated with reductions in inhibitory function in both the tactile and motor systems starting around 40 years of age; however, age effects in the two systems were not correlated. The independent effects of age on tactile and motor inhibitory function suggest that distinct mechanisms may underlie age-related reductions in inhibition in the somatosensory and motor systems.</description>

	<description>Neurons in the primate cortical area V4 have been recognized as being selective for intermediate-level visual features, including shape, texture, and color. But, there is no a priori reason why V4 neurons should respond to easily describable categories of visual stimuli. In a recent study Bashivan et al. (Science, 2019) used an artificial neural network to synthesize images that acted as ‘super-stimuli’ for recorded neurons in V4, pushing the boundaries of known neural responses in this brain region and raising broader questions about the potential for synergies between biological and artificial neural networks.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A model for the origin and development of visual orientation selectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007254</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Gratia Nguyen, Alan W. Freeman&lt;/p&gt;

Orientation selectivity is a key property of primary visual cortex that contributes, downstream, to object recognition. The origin of orientation selectivity, however, has been debated for decades. It is known that on- and off-centre subcortical pathways converge onto single neurons in primary visual cortex, and that the spatial offset between these pathways gives rise to orientation selectivity. On- and off-centre pathways are intermingled, however, so it is unclear how their inputs to cortex come to be spatially segregated. We here describe a model in which the segregation occurs through Hebbian strengthening and weakening of geniculocortical synapses during the development of the visual system. Our findings include the following. 1. Neighbouring on- and off-inputs to cortex largely cancelled each other at the start of development. At each receptive field location, the Hebbian process increased the strength of one input sign at the expense of the other sign, producing a spatial segregation of on- and off-inputs. 2. The resulting orientation selectivity was precise in that the bandwidths of the orientation tuning functions fell within empirical estimates. 3. The model produced maps of preferred orientation–complete with iso-orientation domains and pinwheels–similar to those found in real cortex. 4. These maps did not originate in cortical processes, but from clustering of off-centre subcortical pathways and the relative location of neighbouring on-centre clusters. We conclude that a model with intermingled on- and off-pathways shaped by Hebbian synaptic plasticity can explain both the origin and development of orientation selectivity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Do_lrXndo3s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The impact of DNA methylation on the cancer proteome</title>

Aberrant DNA methylation disrupts normal gene expression in cancer and broadly contributes to oncogenesis. We previously developed MethylMix, a model-based algorithmic approach to identify epigenetically regulated driver genes. MethylMix identifies genes where methylation likely executes a functional role by using transcriptomic data to select only methylation events that can be linked to changes in gene expression. However, given that proteins more closely link genotype to phenotype recent high-throughput proteomic data provides an opportunity to more accurately identify functionally relevant abnormal methylation events. Here we present a MethylMix analysis that refines nominations for epigenetic driver genes by leveraging quantitative high-throughput proteomic data to select only genes where DNA methylation is predictive of protein abundance. Applying our algorithm across three cancer cohorts we find that using protein abundance data narrows candidate nominations, where the effect of DNA methylation is often buffered at the protein level. Next, we find that MethylMix genes predictive of protein abundance are enriched for biological processes involved in cancer including functions involved in epithelial and mesenchymal transition. Moreover, our results are also enriched for tumor markers which are predictive of clinical features like tumor stage and we find clustering using MethylMix genes predictive of protein abundance captures cancer subtypes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CacuunWYmno&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Early Aβ reduction prevents progression of cerebral amyloid angiopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25562?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25562?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials targeting Aβ for Alzheimer's disease (AD) failed for arguable reasons that include selecting the wrong stages of AD pathophysiology or Aβ being the wrong target at all. Targeting Aβ to prevent cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) has not been rigorously followed although the causal role of Aβ for CAA and related hemorrhages is undisputed. CAA occurs with normal aging and to various degree in AD where its impact and treatment is confounded by the presence of parenchymal Aβ deposition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APPDutch mice develop CAA in the absence of parenchymal amyloid, mimicking hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis ‐ Dutch (HCHWA‐D). Mice were treated with a BACE1 inhibitor. 3D‐ultramicroscopy and immunoassays were used for visualizing CAA and assessing Aβ in CSF and brain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAA onset in mice was at 22‐24 mo of age, first in frontal leptomeningeal and superficial cortical vessels followed by vessels penetrating the cortical layers. CSF Aβ increased with aging followed by a decrease of both, Aβ40 and Aβ42 upon CAA onset supporting that combined reduction of CSF Aβ40 and 42 is a specific biomarker for vascular amyloid. BACE1 inhibitor treatment starting at CAA onset and continued for 4 mo revealed a 90% Aβ reduction in CSF and largely prevented CAA progression and associated pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first study showing that Aβ reduction at early disease time points largely prevents CAA in the absence of parenchymal amyloid. Our observation provides a preclinical basis for Aβ‐reducing treatments in patients at risk of CAA and in presymptomatic HCHWA‐D.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: A Trial of Sertraline or Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Depression in Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25561?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limited evidence is available to guide treatment of depression for persons with epilepsy. We evaluated comparative effectiveness of sertraline and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for depression, quality of life, seizures, and adverse treatment effects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We randomly assigned 140 adult outpatients with epilepsy and current major depressive disorder to sertraline or weekly CBT for 16 weeks. The primary outcome was remission from depression based on the Mini‐International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.). Secondary outcomes included the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE)‐89, seizure rates, the Adverse Events Profile (AEP), the Beck Depression Inventory, and the M.I.N.I. Suicide Risk Module.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the intention to treat analysis, 38 (52.8%; 95% CI±12) of the 72 subjects assigned to sertraline and 41 (60.3%; 95% CI±11.6) of the 68 in the CBT group achieved remission; the lower bound of efficacy for both groups was greater than our historical placebo control group upper bound of 33.7%. Difference in time to remission between groups was 2.8 days (95% CI±0.43; p=0.79). The percent improvement of mean QOLIE‐89 scores was significant for both CBT (25.7%; p&amp;lt;0.001) and sertraline (28.3%; p&amp;lt;0.001). The difference in occurrence of generalized tonic‐clonic seizures between groups was 0.3% (95% CI±8.6; p=0.95). Suicide risk at final assessment was associated with persistent depression (p&amp;lt;0.0001), but not seizures or sertraline.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression remitted in just over one half of subjects following sertraline or CBT. Despite the complex psychosocial disability associated with epilepsy, improving depression benefits quality of life. Serotonin reuptake inhibition does not appear to increase seizures or suicidality in persons with epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Higher plasma total‐tau level is associated with incident dementia, but its relationship with stroke risk is unknown. In this prospective community‐based study, we evaluated plasma total‐tau level as a biomarker of stroke risk in 2,794 Framingham Heart Study participants. Persons with plasma total‐tau levels in the top quintile, versus the bottom 4, had an increased risk of incident stroke over a mean follow‐up of 8.3 years (hazard ratio = 2.01; 95% confidence interval = 1.32–3.08) following adjustments for age, sex, and stroke risk factors. Our findings demonstrate that plasma total‐tau relates to the risk of stroke in a community sample. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Early Results of Nerve Transfers for Restoring Function in Severe Cases of Acute Flaccid Myelitis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25558?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25558?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To describe early functional outcomes of nerve transfer surgery in a relatively large cohort of patients with Acute Flaccid Myelitis (AFM).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retrospective case analysis of patients with AFM treated with nerve transfer surgery between 2007 and 2018. Surgical criteria were persistent motor deficits after 6 months from onset and available donor nerves. Thirty‐two patients with AFM were evaluated, 16 underwent nerve transfer surgeries. Motor function was evaluated by a licensed occupational therapist using the Active Movement Scale (AMS) preoperatively and during follow‐up examinations. Patients with 6 or more months of follow‐up were included in the analysis. Patients with procedures other than nerve transfers were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixteen patients with AFM had nerve transfers, with a male predominance (75%) and median age of 2.5 years (range 4 months‐12 years). Eleven patients had a minimum 6 months follow‐up. Nerve transfers to restore elbow function had 87% excellent recovery for elbow flexion and 67% for elbow extension. Finger and thumb extension were full against gravity in one patient (100%). Shoulder external rotation was excellent in 50% of patients and shoulder abduction in only 20%. Nine out of 10 patients (90%) had resolution of shoulder pseudosubluxation following nerve transfer to the suprascapular nerve.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with AFM with persistent motor deficits after 6 to 9 months after onset benefit from nerve transfer surgery. Restoration of elbow function was more reliable than restoration of shoulder function. We recommend early referral of patients with incomplete recovery to an experienced center in nerve transfers for timely evaluation and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Uncovering a Role for the Dorsal Hippocampal Commissure in Recognition Memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz143</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz143/5540231?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The dorsal hippocampal commissure (DHC) is a white matter tract that provides interhemispheric connections between temporal lobe brain regions. Despite the importance of these regions for learning and memory, there is scant evidence of a role for the DHC in successful memory performance. We used diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and white matter tractography to reconstruct the DHC in both humans (in vivo) and nonhuman primates (ex vivo). Across species, our findings demonstrate a close consistency between the known anatomy and tract reconstructions of the DHC. Anterograde tract-tracer techniques also highlighted the parahippocampal origins of DHC fibers in nonhuman primates. Finally, we derived diffusion tensor MRI metrics from the DHC in a large sample of human subjects to investigate whether interindividual variation in DHC microstructure is predictive of memory performance. The mean diffusivity of the DHC correlated with performance in a standardized recognition memory task, an effect that was not reproduced in a comparison commissure tract—the anterior commissure. These findings highlight a potential role for the DHC in recognition memory, and our tract reconstruction approach has the potential to generate further novel insights into the role of this previously understudied white matter tract in both health and disease.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Deletion of Fmr1 from Forebrain Excitatory Neurons Triggers Abnormal Cellular, EEG, and Behavioral Phenotypes in the Auditory Cortex of a Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz141</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of autism with symptoms that include sensory processing deficits. In both humans with FXS and a mouse model [&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fmr1&lt;/span&gt; knockout (KO) mouse], electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings show enhanced resting state gamma power and reduced sound-evoked gamma synchrony. We previously showed that elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) may contribute to these phenotypes by affecting perineuronal nets (PNNs) around parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the auditory cortex of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fmr1&lt;/span&gt; KO mice. However, how different cell types within local cortical circuits contribute to these deficits is not known. Here, we examined whether &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fmr1&lt;/span&gt; deletion in forebrain excitatory neurons affects neural oscillations, MMP-9 activity, and PV/PNN expression in the auditory cortex. We found that cortical MMP-9 gelatinase activity, mTOR/Akt phosphorylation, and resting EEG gamma power were enhanced in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CreNex1/Fmr1Flox/y&lt;/span&gt; conditional KO (cKO) mice, whereas the density of PV/PNN cells was reduced. The &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CreNex1/Fmr1Flox/y&lt;/span&gt; cKO mice also show increased locomotor activity, but not the anxiety-like behaviors. These results indicate that fragile X mental retardation protein changes in excitatory neurons in the cortex are sufficient to elicit cellular, electrophysiological, and behavioral phenotypes in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fmr1&lt;/span&gt; KO mice. More broadly, these results indicate that local cortical circuit abnormalities contribute to sensory processing deficits in autism spectrum disorders.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Gender Differences in Connectome-based Predictions of Individualized Intelligence Quotient and Sub-domain Scores</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz134</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz134/5540233?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Scores on intelligence tests are strongly predictive of various important life outcomes. However, the gender discrepancy on intelligence quotient (IQ) prediction using brain imaging variables has not been studied. To this aim, we predicted individual IQ scores for males and females separately using whole-brain functional connectivity (FC). Robust predictions of intellectual capabilities were achieved across three independent data sets (680 subjects) and two intelligence measurements (IQ and fluid intelligence) using the same model within each gender. Interestingly, we found that intelligence of males and females were underpinned by different neurobiological correlates, which are consistent with their respective superiority in cognitive domains (visuospatial vs verbal ability). In addition, the identified FC patterns are uniquely predictive on IQ and its sub-domain scores only within the same gender but neither for the opposite gender nor on the IQ-irrelevant measures such as temperament traits. Moreover, females exhibit significantly higher IQ predictability than males in the discovery cohort. This findings facilitate our understanding of the biological basis of intelligence by demonstrating that intelligence is underpinned by a variety of complex neural mechanisms that engage an interacting network of regions—particularly prefrontal–parietal and basal ganglia—whereas the network pattern differs between genders.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Human Intraparietal Sulcus Modulates Task-Evoked Functional Connectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz133</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz133/5538383?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Past studies have demonstrated that flexible interactions between brain regions support a wide range of goal-directed behaviors. However, the neural mechanisms that underlie adaptive communication between brain regions are not well understood. In this study, we combined theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the sources of top-down biasing signals that influence task-evoked functional connectivity. Subjects viewed sequences of images of faces and buildings and were required to detect repetitions (2-back vs. 1-back) of the attended stimuli category (faces or buildings). We found that functional connectivity between ventral temporal cortex and the primary visual cortex (VC) increased during processing of task-relevant stimuli, especially during higher memory loads. Furthermore, the strength of functional connectivity was greater for correct trials. Increases in task-evoked functional connectivity strength were correlated with increases in activity in multiple frontal, parietal, and subcortical (caudate and thalamus) regions. Finally, we found that TMS to superior intraparietal sulcus (IPS), but not to primary somatosensory cortex, decreased task-specific modulation in connectivity patterns between the primary VC and the parahippocampal place area. These findings demonstrate that the human IPS is a source of top-down biasing signals that modulate task-evoked functional connectivity among task-relevant cortical regions.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Accumulating data highlight the contribution of brain mitochondria and bioenergetics to psychiatric disorders and stress-related pathologies. Although anxiety has not received much attention in this booming literature, a bidirectional interplay between anxiety and brain mitochondria and metabolism has recently started to emerge. Substantial observations indicate alterations in mitochondria and metabolism in highly anxious individuals and, conversely, anxiety symptoms in humans suffering from mitochondrial disorders.</description>

	<description>Resting-state networks (RSNs) exhibit spontaneous functional connectivity in the resting state. Previous studies have evaluated RSNs mainly based on spontaneous fluctuations in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, separation between regional increases in cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption is theoretically difficult using BOLD-fMRI. Such separation can be achieved using quantitative 15O-gas and water positron emission tomography (PET). In addition, 18F-FDG PET can be used to investigate functional connectivity based on changes in glucose metabolism, which reflects local brain activity. Previous studies have highlighted the feasibility and clinical usefulness of 18F-FDG-PET for the analysis of RSNs, and recent studies have utilized simultaneous PET/fMRI for such analyses. While PET provides seed information regarding the focus of the abnormalities (e.g., hypometabolism, reduced target binding), fMRI is used for the analysis of functional connectivity. Thus, as PET and fMRI provide different types of information, integrating these modalities may aid in elucidating the pathological mechanisms underlying certain diseases, and in characterizing individual patients.</description>

	<description>Previous studies have found alterations in 40 Hz oscillatory activity in response to auditory stimuli in adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The current study sought to examine the specificity and developmental trajectory of these findings by driving the cortex to oscillate at a range of frequencies in both children and adults with and without ASD. Fifteen participants with ASD (3 female, aged 6-23 years) and 15 age-matched controls (4 female, aged 6-25 years) underwent dense-array EEG as they listened to a carrier tone amplitude-modulated by a sinusoid linearly increasing in frequency from 0-100 Hz over two seconds. EEG data were analyzed for inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) and single-trial power (STP). Older participants with ASD displayed significantly decreased ability to phase-lock to the stimulus in the low gamma frequency range relative to their TD counterparts, while younger ASD and TD did not significantly differ from each other. An interaction between age and diagnosis suggested that TD and ASD also show different developmental trajectories for low gamma power; TD showed a significant decrease in low gamma power with age, while ASD did not. Regardless of age, increased low gamma STP was significantly correlated with increased clinical scores for repetitive behaviors in the ASD group, particularly insistence on sameness. This study contributes to a growing body of evidence supporting alterations in auditory processing in ASD. Older ASD participants showed more pronounced low gamma deficits than younger participants, suggesting an altered developmental trajectory for neural activity contributing to auditory processing deficits that may also be more broadly clinically relevant. Future studies are needed employing a longitudinal approach to confirm findings of this cross-sectional study.</description>

	<description>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is earning a role in the therapeutic arsenal of cocaine use disorder. A widespread and still growing number of studies have reported beneficial use of repeated TMS (rTMS) in reduction of craving, intake and cue-induced craving in cocaine addicts. In spite of these encouraging findings, many issues are still unresolved such as brain area to be stimulated, laterality of the effects, coil geometry and stimulation protocols/parameters. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a more tolerable protocol administered at lower intensities and shorter intervals than conventional repeated TMS (rTMS) protocols. Yet, its effects on cocaine craving and length of abstinence in comparison with standard high frequency (10-15Hz) protocols have never been evaluated so far. In the present paper we describe the effect of the bilateral iTBS of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in a population (n=25) of treatment-seeking cocaine addicts, in an outpatient setting, and compare them with 15 Hz stimulation of the same brain area (n=22). The results indicate that iTBS produces effects on cocaine consumption and cocaine craving virtually superimposable to the 15 Hz rTMS group. Both treatments had low numbers of dropouts and similar side-effects, safety and tolerability profiles. While larger studies are warranted to confirm these observations, iTBS appears to be a valid approach to be considered in treatment-seeking cocaine addicts, especially in light of its brief duration (3 mins) vs 15 Hz stimulation (15 mins). The use of iTBS would allow increasing the number of patients treated per day with current rTMS devices, thus reducing patient discomfort and hopefully reducing drop-out rates without compromising clinical effectiveness.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Assessing Feedback Response With a Wearable Electroencephalography System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00258</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00258</link>
	<description>Background: Event related potential (ERP) components, such as P3, N2, and FRN, are potential metrics for assessing feedback response as a form of performance monitoring. Most research studies investigate these ERP components using clinical or research-grade electroencephalography (EEG) systems. Wearable EEGs, which are an affordable alternative, have the potential to assess feedback response using ERPs but have not been sufficiently evaluated. Feedback-related ERPs also have not been scientifically evaluated in interactive settings that are similar to daily computer use. In this study, a consumer-grade wearable EEG system was assessed for its feasibility to collect feedback-related ERPs through an interactive software module that provided an environment in which users were permitted to navigate freely within the program to make decisions.
Methods: The recording hardware, which costs less than $1500 in total, incorporated the OpenBCI Cyton Board with Daisy chain, a consumer-grade EEG system that costs $949 USD. 17 participants interacted with an oddball paradigm and an interactive module designed to elicit feedback-related ERPs. The features of interests for the oddball paradigm were the P3 and N2 components. The features of interests for the interactive module were the the P3, N2, and FRN components elicited in response to positive, neutral, and two types of negative feedback. The FRN was calculated by subtracting the positive feedback response from the negative feedback responses.
Results: The P3 and N2 components of the oddball paradigm indicated statistically significant differences between infrequent targets and frequent targets which is in line with current literature. The P3 and N2 components elicited in the interactive module indicated statistically significant differences between positive, neutral, and negative feedback responses. There were no significant differences between the FRN types and significant interactions with channel group and FRN type.
Conclusion: The OpenBCI Cyton, after some modifications, shows potential for eliciting and assessing P3, N2, and FRN components, which are important indicators for performance monitoring, in an interactive setting.</description>

	<description>Several studies indicate the functional importance of the motor cortex for higher cognition, language and semantic processing, and place the neural substrate of these processes in sensorimotor action-perception circuits linking motor, sensory and perisylvian language regions. Interestingly, in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), semantic processing of action and emotion words seems to be impaired and is associated with hypoactivity of the motor cortex during semantic processing. In this study, the relationship between semantic processing, fine motor skills and clinical symptoms was investigated in 19 individuals with ASD and in 22 typically-developing matched controls. Participants completed two semantic decision tasks involving words from different semantic categories, a test of alexithymia (the Toronto Alexithymia Scale), and a test of fine motor skills (the Purdue Pegboard Test). A significant Group x Word Category interaction in accuracy (p &amp;lt; .05) demonstrated impaired semantic processing for action words, but not object words in the autistic group. There was no significant group difference when processing abstract emotional words or abstract neutral words.  Moreover, our study revealed deficits in fine motor skills as well as evidence for alexithymia in the ASD group, but not in neurotypical controls. We interpret the data in terms of an underlying dysfunction of the action-perception system in ASD which has a specific impact on semantic language processing.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Analysis of Prefrontal Single-Channel EEG Data for Portable Auditory ERP-Based Brain–Computer Interfaces</title>

	<description>Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain–computer interface (BCI) is a tool to non-invasively
control computers by translating the electrical activity of the brain. This technology has the
potential to provide patients who have severe generalized myopathy, such as those suffering from
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with the ability to communicate. Recently, auditory oddball
paradigms have been developed to implement more practical event-related potential (ERP)-based
BCIs because they can operate without ocular activities. These paradigms generally make use
of clinical (over 16-channel) EEG devices and natural sound stimuli for maintaining the user’s
motivation during the BCI operation; however, most of ALS patients who took part in auditory
ERP-based BCIs tended to complain about the following factors: (i) total device cost and (ii) setup
time. The development of a portable auditory ERP-based BCI would overcome considerable
obstacles that prevent the use of this technology in communication in everyday life. To address this
issue, we analyzed prefrontal single-channel EEG data acquired from a consumer-grade single-
channel EEG device using a natural sound-based auditory oddball paradigm. In our experiments,
EEG data was gathered from nine healthy subjects and one ALS patient. The performance of
auditory ERP-based BCI was quantified under offline condition and two online conditions. The
offline analysis indicated that our paradigm maintained a high level of detection accuracy (%)
and ITR (bits/min) across all subjects through a cross-validation procedure (for five commands:
70.0 ± 16.1 and 1.29 ± 0.93, for four commands: 73.8 ± 14.2 and 1.16 ± 0.78, for three commands:
78.7 ± 11.8 and 0.95 ± 0.61, and for two commands: 85.7 ± 8.6 and 0.63 ± 0.38). Furthermore, the
first online analysis demonstrated that our paradigm also achieved high performance for new
data in an online data acquisition stream (for three commands: 80.0 ± 19.4 and 1.16 ± 0.83). The
second online analysis demonstrated online performances on the different day of offline and first online analyses (for three commands: 62.5 ± 14.3 and 0.43 ± 0.36). These results indicate that prefrontal single-channel EEGs have the potential to contribute to the development of a user-friendly portable auditory ERP-based BCI.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neural Correlates of Public Apology Effectiveness</title>

	<description>Apologizing is an effective interpersonal conflict resolution strategy, but whether organizations should issue public apologies after crises has been less clear. Recently it was shown that public apologies are effective, especially when they provide a comprehensive account of what happened and clear actions taken by the company to address the problems. Intriguingly, public apologies may be most effective when the crisis source resides within the organization itself, suggesting that the company has control over it. In the current study we first attempted to replicate this behavioral finding by presenting participants with multiple crisis scenarios (e.g., ignition failures in a new car model) followed by one of two written apologies: one stating that the crisis source was internal to and controllable by the organization, and the other that it was external and uncontrollable. Replicating the previous study, we found that the internal-controllable public apology was most effective. We then examined the neural basis of this public apology assessment and found that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex appears to mediate the believability of organizational control, and the precuneus uses the information for the apology assessment. Examination of complex social interactions, such as the public’s response to corporate crises, help elucidate high-level brain function.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Specialized Somatosensory–Motor Integration Functions in Musicians</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz154</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Somatosensory signals play roles in the fine control of dexterous movements through a somatosensory–motor integration mechanism. While skilled individuals are typically characterized by fine-tuned somatosensory functions and dexterous motor skills, it remains unknown whether and in what manner their bridging mechanism, the tactile–motor and proprioceptive–motor integration functions, plastically changes through extensive sensorimotor experiences. Here, we addressed this issue by comparing physiological indices of these functions between pianists and nonmusicians. Both tactile and proprioceptive stimuli to the right index finger inhibited corticospinal excitability measured by a transcranial magnetic stimulation method. However, the tactile and proprioceptive stimuli exerted weaker and stronger inhibitory effects, respectively, on corticospinal excitability in pianists than in nonmusicians. The results of the electroencephalogram measurements revealed no significant group difference in the amplitude of cortical responses to the somatosensory stimuli around the motor and somatosensory cortices, suggesting that the group difference in the inhibitory effects reflects neuroplastic adaptation of the somatosensory–motor integration functions in pianists. Penalized regression analyses further revealed an association between these integration functions and motor performance in the pianists, suggesting that extensive piano practice reorganizes somatosensory–motor integration functions so as to enable fine control of dexterous finger movements during piano performances.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Dissociable and Paradoxical Roles of Rat Medial and Lateral Orbitofrontal Cortex in Visual Serial Reversal Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz144</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/div&gt;Much evidence suggests that reversal learning is mediated by cortico-striatal circuitries with the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) playing a prominent role. The OFC is a functionally heterogeneous region, but potential differential roles of lateral (lOFC) and medial (mOFC) portions in visual reversal learning have yet to be determined. We investigated the effects of pharmacological inactivation of mOFC and lOFC on a deterministic serial visual reversal learning task for rats. For reference, we also targeted other areas previously implicated in reversal learning: prelimbic (PrL) and infralimbic (IL) prefrontal cortex, and basolateral amygdala (BLA). Inactivating mOFC and lOFC produced opposite effects; lOFC impairing, and mOFC improving, performance in the early, perseverative phase specifically. Additionally, mOFC inactivation enhanced negative feedback sensitivity, while lOFC inactivation diminished feedback sensitivity in general. mOFC and lOFC inactivation also affected novel visual discrimination learning differently; lOFC inactivation paradoxically improved learning, and mOFC inactivation had no effect. We also observed dissociable roles of the OFC and the IL/PrL. Whereas the OFC inactivation affected only perseveration, IL/PrL inactivation improved learning overall. BLA inactivation did not affect perseveration, but improved the late phase of reversal learning. These results support opponent roles of the rodent mOFC and lOFC in deterministic visual reversal learning.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Refinement of the Primate Corticospinal Pathway During Prenatal Development</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Perturbation of the developmental refinement of the corticospinal (CS) pathway leads to motor disorders. While non-primate developmental refinement is well documented, in primates invasive investigations of the developing CS pathway have been confined to neonatal and postnatal stages when refinement is relatively modest. Here, we investigated the developmental changes in the distribution of CS projection neurons in cynomolgus monkey (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Macaca fascicularis&lt;/span&gt;). Injections of retrograde tracer at cervical levels of the spinal cord at embryonic day (E) 95 and E105 show that: (i) areal distribution of back-labeled neurons is more extensive than in the neonate and dense labeling is found in prefrontal, limbic, temporal, and occipital cortex; (ii) distributions of contralateral and ipsilateral projecting CS neurons are comparable in terms of location and numbers of labeled neurons, in contrast to the adult where the contralateral projection is an order of magnitude higher than the ipsilateral projection. Findings from one largely restricted injection suggest a hitherto unsuspected early innervation of the gray matter. In the fetus there was in addition dense labeling in the central nucleus of the amygdala, the hypothalamus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the adjacent region of the zona incerta, subcortical structures with only minor projections in the adult control.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Bonnefont et al. show that Bcl6 promotes neurogenesis by directly repressing genes belonging to the major signaling pathways promoting cortical progenitor self-renewal. These data indicate that a single cell-intrinsic factor represses multiple extrinsic signaling pathways to ensure irreversible neurogenic commitment.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Role of Top-Down Modulation in Shaping Sensory Processing Across Brain States: Implications for Consciousness</title>

	<description>Top-down, feedback projections account for a large portion of all connections between neurons in the thalamocortical system, yet their precise role remains the subject of much discussion. A large number of studies has focused on investigating how sensory information is transformed across hierarchically-distributed processing stages in a feedforward fashion, and computational models have shown that purely feedforward artificial neural networks can even outperform humans in pattern classification tasks. What is then the functional role of feedback connections? Several key roles have been identified, ranging from attentional modulation to, crucially, conscious perception. Specifically, most of the major theories on consciousness postulate that feedback connections would play an essential role in enabling sensory information to be consciously perceived. Consequently, it follows that their efficacy in modulating target regions should drastically decrease in nonconscious brain states (non-REM sleep, anesthesia) compared to conscious ones (wakefulness), and also in instances when a given sensory stimulus is not perceived compared to when it is. Until recently, however, this prediction could only be tested with correlative experiments, due to the lack of techniques to selectively manipulate and measure the activity of feedback pathways. In this paper we will review the most recent literature on the functions of feedback connections across brain states and based on the presence or absence of perception. We will focus on experiments studying mismatch negativity, a phenomenon which has been hypothesized to rely on top-down modulation but which persists during nonconscious states. While feedback modulation is generally dampened in nonconscious states and enhanced when perception occurs, there are clear deviations from this rule. As we will discuss, this may pose a challenge to most theories of consciousness, and possibly require a change in how the level of consciousness in supposedly nonconscious states is assessed.</description>

	<description>The numbers and strengths of synapses in the brain change throughout development, and even into adulthood, as synaptic inputs are added, eliminated, and refined in response to ongoing neural activity. A number of experimental techniques can assess these changes, including single- cell electrophysiological recording which offers measurements of synaptic inputs with high temporal resolution. Coupled with electrical stimulation, photoactivatable opsins, and caged compounds, to facilitate fine spatiotemporal control over release of neurotransmitters, electrophysiological recordings allow for precise dissection of presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms of action. Here, we discuss the strengths and pitfalls of various techniques commonly used to analyze synapses, including miniature excitatory/inhibitory postsynaptic currents, evoked release, and optogenetic stimulation. Together, these techniques can provide multiple lines of convergent evidence to generate meaningful insight into the emergence of circuit connectivity and maturation. A full understanding of potential caveats and alternative explanations for findings is essential to avoid data misinterpretation.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: DNA Methylation Dynamics During the Differentiation of Retinal Progenitor Cells Into Retinal Neurons Reveal a Role for the DNA Demethylation Pathway</title>

	<description>To evaluate the contribution of the DNA methylation and DNA demethylation pathways in retinal development, we studied DNA methylation in retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) and retinal neurons using a combination of whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data obtained in our study and WGBS data collected from previous studies. The data was analyzed using Hidden Markov Model- and change point-based methods to identify methylome states in different segments of the studied genomes following genome annotation. We found that promoters of rod and cone phototransduction genes and rod photoreceptor genes, but not genes required for the development and function of other retinal phenotypes, were highly methylated in DNA isolated from human and murine fetal retinas (which mostly contain RPCs) and postnatal murine RPCs. While these highly methylated genomic regions were inherited by non-photoreceptor phenotypes during RPC differentiation, the methylation of these promoters was significantly reduced during RPC differentiation into photoreceptors and accompanied by increased expression of these genes. Our analysis of DNA methylation during embryogenesis revealed low methylation levels in genomic regions containing photoreceptor genes at the inner cell mass stage, but a sharp increase in methylation at the epiblast stage, which remained the same later on (except for DNA demethylation in photoreceptors). Thus, our data suggest that the DNA demethylation pathway is required for photoreceptor phenotypes in the developing retina. Meanwhile, the role of the DNA methylation and DNA demethylation pathways during RPC differentiation into non-photoreceptor retinal phenotypes might be less important.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: PKC, AKT and ERK1/2-Mediated Modulations of PARP1, NF-κB and PEA15 Activities Distinctly Regulate Regional Specific Astroglial Responses Following Status Epilepticus</title>

	<description>Status epilepticus (SE, a prolonged seizure activity) leads to reactive astrogliosis and astroglial apoptosis in the regional specific manners, independent of hemodynamics. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) activity is relevant to these distinct astroglial responses. Since various regulatory signaling molecules beyond PARP1 activity may be involved in the distinct astroglial response to SE, it is noteworthy to explore the roles of protein kinases in PARP1-mediated reactive astrogliosis and astroglial apoptosis following SE, albeit at a lesser extent. In the present study, inhibitions of protein kinase C (PKC), AKT and extracellular signal-related kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), but not calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), attenuated CA1 reactive astrogliosis accompanied by reducing PARP1 activity following SE, respectively. However, inhibition of AKT and ERK1/2 deteriorated SE-induced dentate astroglial loss concomitant with the diminished PARP1 activity. Following SE, PKC- and AKT inhibitors diminished phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes of 15 kDa (PEA15)-S104 and -S116 phosphorylations in CA1 astrocytes, but not in dentate astrocytes, respectively. Inhibitors of PKC, AKT and ERK1/2 also abrogated SE-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-S311 and -S468 phosphorylations in CA1 astrocytes. In contrast, both AKT and ERK1/2 inhibitors enhanced NF-κB-S468 phosphorylation in dentate astrocytes. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitor aggravated dentate astroglial loss following SE. AKT inhibition deteriorated dentate astroglial loss and led to CA1 astroglial apoptosis following SE, which were ameliorated by AKT activation. These findings suggest that activities of PARP1, PEA15 and NF-κB may be distinctly regulated by PKC, AKT and ERK1/2, which may be involved in regional specific astroglial responses following SE.</description>

	<description>α5 subunit containing GABA type A receptors (GABAARs) have long been an enigmatic receptor subtype of interest due to their specific brain distribution, unusual surface localization and key role in synaptic plasticity, cognition and memory. These receptors are uniquely positioned to sculpt both the developing and mature hippocampal circuitry due to high overall expression and a distinct peak during the critical synapse formation period during the second postnatal week. Unlike the majority of other GABAARs, they exhibit both receptor clustering at extrasynaptic sites via interactions with the radixin scaffold as well as synaptic sites via gephyrin, thus contributing respectively to tonic currents and synaptic GABAergic neurotransmission. α5 GABAAR signaling can be altered in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and mental retardation and by inflammation in CNS injury and disease. Due to the unique physiology and pharmacology of α5 GABAARs, drugs targeting these receptors are being developed and tested as treatments for neurodevelopmental disorders, depression, schizophrenia, and mild cognitive impairment. This review focuses on advances in understanding how the α5 subunit contributes to GABAAR neurobiology. In particular I discuss both recent insights and remaining knowledge gaps for the functional role of these receptors, pathologies associated with α5 GABAAR dysfunction, and the effects and potential therapeutic uses of α5 receptor subtype targeted drugs.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Systems Biology section | New and Recent Articles: Exploring the Potential Role of Rosmarinic Acid in Neuronal Differentiation of Human Amnion Epithelial Cells by Microarray Gene Expression Profiling</title>

	<description>In the present study, we conducted microarray gene expression profiling to explore the direction of differentiation of human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) treated with rosmarinic acid (RA).  hAECs have several clinical advantages over other types of stem cells, including availability, low immunogenicity, low rejection rate, nontumorigenecity, and less ethical constraint. On the other hand, RA is a phenolic compound having several health benefits, including neuroprotective and antidepressant-like activities. In this study, hAECs were isolated from discarded term placenta and were treated with 20 μM RA for seven days. Microarray gene expression profiling was conducted for three biological replicates of RA-treated and untreated control cells on day 0 and day 7. Gene set enrichment analysis, and gene annotation and pathway analysis were conducted using online data mining tools GSEA and DAVID. Gene expression profiling showed that RA treatment biased hAECs towards ectodermal lineage progression, regulated transcription factors involved in neuronal differentiation, regulated neural specific epigenetic modifiers and several extracellular signaling pathways of neural induction, and significantly inhibited Notch signaling pathway. Gene expression profiling of RA-treated hAECs reveals for the first time a potential role of RA in neural induction and neuronal differentiation of hAECs. Having a naturally occurring compound as differentiation inducer as well as a readily available source of stem cells would have great advantages for the cell-based therapies. Findings from our genome-wide analysis could provide a foundation for further in-depth investigation.</description>

	<description>There is a pressing need to further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the depression symptoms in patients with post-stroke depression (PSD) in order to inform targeted therapeutic approaches. While previous research has demonstrated a reorganization in the functional brain network of PSD, it remains uncertain whether or not it also occurs in the structural brain network. We therefore aim to investigate the structural brain network of patients with PSD as compared to post-stroke non-depression (PSND) patients. In addition, our research considers the relationship between network metrics and functional measurements. Thirty-one PSD patients and twenty-three PSND patients were recruited. All patients underwent MRI and functional assessments, including the Barthel Index, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Diffusion tensor imaging was used to construct the structural brain network and to conduct the subsequent graph theoretical analysis. Network measures were computed and compared between PSD and PSND patients. Associations between functional assessments and network measures were studied as well. We successfully detected increased global and local efficiency in patients with PSD. Regions with disrupted local connections were located primarily in the cognitive and limbic systems. More importantly, PSD patients’ global and regional network measures were associated with depression severity, as measured by HAMD. These findings suggest that disrupted global and local network topologies might contribute to PSD patients’ depression symptoms. Therefore, connectome-based network measures could be potential bio-markers for evaluating stroke patients’ depression levels.</description>

	<description>Recent studies have demonstrated the close relationship between the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and resting state functional connectivity changes in the normal healthy people. However, little is known about the different parameters changes of the most vulnerable regions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we collected resting-state perfusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data including 40 AD patients and 30 healthy controls. By using voxel wise arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion, we firstly identified several regions of the altered rCBF in the AD patients. And then, by using resting state fMRI analysis including amplitude low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and seed based functional connectivity, we explored the changes of the functional activities and connectivities based on the identified rCBF regions. We extracted the cognitive related parameters and search for the sensitive biomarker to differentiate the AD and normal controls. As the results, compared with controls, the AD patients showed distinct disruption of rCBF, which were mainly located in the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), right middle temporal gyrus (MTG), left middle occipital gyrus (MOG), and left precuneus (PCu). ALFF was performed based on the seven regions identified by the ASL method, AD patients showed significantly decreased ALFF in left PCC, left IPL, right MTG, left MOG, and left PCu and increased ALFF in the bilateral DLPFC. We constitute the network based on the seven regions and found the decreased connectivity among the identified regions in the AD patients, predicting to the disruption of the default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN) and visual network (VN). Furthermore, these abnormal parameters are closely correlated with cognitive performances in the AD patients. We combined the rCBF and ALFF value of PCC/PCu as biomarker to differciate the two groups and reached the sensitivity of 85.3% and speciﬁcity of 88.5%. Conclusively, our findings suggested that disrupted regional cerebral blood flow, functional activity and connectivity in specific cognitive related regions in Alzheimer’s disease, which can be used as the valuable imaging biomarker for the diagnosis of AD.</description>

	<description>Abstract
Background and objective: Low Intensity Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation (TUS) is a new form of non-invasive brain modulation with promising data; however, systematic reviews on the brain modulatory effects of TUS on both animals and humans have not been well conducted. We aimed to conduct a systematic review on the studies using the TUS to modulate the brain functions and associated behavioral changes in both animals and humans. 
Methods: A literature search for published studies in the past 10 years was conducted. Two authors independently reviewed the relevant articles. Data were extracted and qualitatively summarized. Quality of studies was assessed by the SYRCLE’s risk of bias tool for preclinical studies or PEDro scale for clinical studies. 
Results: A total of 24 animal studies (506 animals) and 11 human studies (213 subjects) were included. Findings based on most animal studies demonstrated the excitatory or suppressive modulatory effects of ultrasonic stimulations on motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, thalamus, prefrontal cortex, auditory and visual areas. Brain modulatory effects also were found among healthy human subjects in seven studies and two clinical studies suggested TUS may result in potential benefits on patients with disorder of consciousness or chronic pain. The safety concerns of TUS seem to be minor based on the human studies. 
Conclusions: TUS appears to be a viable technique in modulating the brain functions; however, research on TUS is still in its early stages, especially in human studies. Parameters need to be optimized before launching systematic investigations in humans.</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Maternal depression is associated with disrupted neurodevelopment in offspring. This study examined relationships among postnatal maternal depressive symptoms, the functional reward network and behavioral problems in 4.5-year-old boys (57) and girls (65). We employed canonical correlation analysis to evaluate whether the resting-state functional connectivity within a reward network, identified through an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of fMRI studies, was associated with postnatal maternal depressive symptoms and child behaviors. The functional reward network consisted of three subnetworks, that is, the mesolimbic, mesocortical, and amygdala–hippocampus reward subnetworks. Postnatal maternal depressive symptoms were associated with the functional connectivity of the mesocortical subnetwork with the mesolimbic and amygdala–hippocampus complex subnetworks in girls and with the functional connectivity within the mesocortical subnetwork in boys. The functional connectivity of the amygdala–hippocampus subnetwork with the mesocortical and mesolimbic subnetworks was associated with both internalizing and externalizing problems in girls, while in boys, the functional connectivity of the mesocortical subnetwork with the amygdala–hippocampus complex and the mesolimbic subnetworks was associated with the internalizing and externalizing problems, respectively. Our findings suggest that the functional reward network might be a promising neural phenotype for effects of maternal depression and potential intervention to nurture child behavioral development.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Seeing familiar faces prompts the recall of diverse kinds of person-related knowledge. How this information is encoded within the well-characterized face-/person-selective network remains an outstanding question. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, participants rated famous faces in 10 tasks covering 5 domains of person knowledge (social, episodic, semantic, physical, and nominal). Comparing different cognitive domains enabled us to 1) test the relative roles of brain regions in specific cognitive processes and 2) apply a multivariate network-level representational similarity analysis (NetRSA) to gain insight into underlying system-level organization. Comparing across cognitive domains revealed the importance of multiple domains in most regions, the importance of social over nominal knowledge in the anterior temporal lobe, and the functional subdivision of the temporoparietal junction into perceptual superior temporal sulcus and knowledge-related angular gyrus. NetRSA revealed a strong divide between regions implicated in ``default-mode” cognition and the fronto-lateral elements that coordinated more with ``core” perceptual components (fusiform/occipital face areas and posterior superior temporal sulcus). NetRSA also revealed a taxonomy of cognitive processes, with semantic retrieval being more similar to episodic than nominal knowledge. Collectively, these results illustrate the importance of coordinated activity of the person knowledge network in the instantiation of the diverse cognitive capacities of this system.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>The physiological functions of astrocytes within neural circuits remain incompletely understood. There has been progress in this regard from recent work on striatal astrocytes, where detailed studies are emerging. In this review, findings on striatal astrocyte identity, form, and function, are summarized with a focus on how astrocytes regulate striatal neurons, circuits, and behavior. Specific features of striatal astrocytes are highlighted to illustrate how they may be specialized to regulate medium spiny neurons (MSNs) by responding to, and altering, excitation and inhibition.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Scaling of a Large-Scale Simulation of Synchronous Slow-Wave and Asynchronous Awake-Like Activity of a Cortical Model With Long-Range Interconnections</title>

	<description>Cortical synapse organization supports a range of dynamic states on multiple spatial and temporal scales, from synchronous slow wave activity (SWA), characteristic of deep sleep or anesthesia, to fluctuating, asynchronous activity during wakefulness (AW). Such dynamic diversity poses a challenge for producing efficient large-scale simulations that embody realistic metaphors of short- and long-range synaptic connectivity. In fact, during SWA and AW different spatial extents of the cortical tissue are active in a given timespan and at different levels, which implies a wide variety of loads of local computation and communication. A balanced evaluation of simulation performance and robustness should therefore include tests of a variety of cortical dynamic states. Here, we demonstrate performance scaling of our proprietary Distributed and Plastic Spiking Neural Networks (DPSNN) simulation engine in both SWA and AW for bi-dimensional grids of neural populations, which reflects the modular organization of the cortex. We explored networks up to 192x192 modules, each composed of 1250 integrate-and-fire neurons with spike-frequency adaptation, and exponentially decaying inter-modular synaptic connectivity with varying spatial decay constant. For the largest networks the total number of synapses was over 70 billion. The execution platform included up to 64 dual-socket nodes, each socket mounting 8 Intel Xeon Haswell processor cores @ 2.40GHz clock. Network initialization time, memory usage, and execution times showed good scaling performances from 1 to 1024 processes, implemented using the standard Message Passing Interface (MPI) protocol. We achieved simulation speeds of between 2.3x10^9 and 4.1x10^9 synaptic events per second for both cortical states in the explored range of inter-modular interconnections.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Developmental Regulation of KCC2 Phosphorylation Has Long-Term Impacts on Cognitive Function</title>

	<description>GABAA receptor-mediated currents shift from excitatory to inhibitory during postnatal brain development in rodents. A postnatal increase in KCC2 protein expression is considered to be the sole mechanism controlling the developmental onset of hyperpolarizing synaptic transmission, but here we identify a key role for KCC2 phosphorylation in the developmental EGABA shift. Preventing phosphorylation of KCC2 in vivo at either residue serine 940 (S940), or at residues threonine 906 and threonine 1007 (T906/T1007), delayed or accelerated the postnatal onset of KCC2 function, respectively. Several models of neurodevelopmental disorders including Rett syndrome, Fragile X and Down’s syndrome exhibit delayed postnatal onset of hyperpolarizing GABAergic inhibition, but whether the timing of the onset of hyperpolarizing synaptic inhibition during development plays a role in establishing adulthood cognitive function is unknown; we have used the distinct KCC2-S940A and KCC2-T906A/T1007A knock-in mouse models to address this issue. Altering KCC2 function resulted in long-term abnormalities in social behavior and memory retention. Tight regulation of KCC2 phosphorylation is therefore required for the typical timing of the developmental onset of hyperpolarizing synaptic inhibition, and it plays a fundamental role in the regulation of adulthood cognitive function.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Role of Neuronal Oscillations in Visual Active Sensing</title>

	<description>Visual perception is most often studied as a “passive” process in which an observer fixates steadily at point in space so that stimuli can be delivered to the system with spatial precision. Analysis of neuronal signals related to vision is generally keyed to stimulus onset, stimulus movement, etc.; i.e., events external to the observer. In natural “active” vision however, information is systematically acquired by using eye movements including rapid (saccadic) eye movements, as well as smooth ocular pursuit of moving objects and slower drifts. Here we consider the use of alternating saccades and fixations to gather information from a visual scene. In this Perspective we note that active saccadic sampling behavior imposes robust temporal patterning on the activity of neuron ensembles and large-scale neural dynamics throughout the brain’s visual pathways whose mechanistic effects on information processing are not yet fully understood. The spatio-temporal sequence of eye movements elicits a succession of temporally predictable quasi-rhythmic sensory inputs, whose encoding is enhanced by entrainment of low frequency oscillations to the rate of eye movements. Review of the pertinent findings underscores the fact that temporal coordination between motor and visual cortices is critical for understanding neural dynamics of active vision and posits that phase entrainment of neuronal oscillations plays a mechanistic role in this process.</description>

	<description>Paraffin embedding is widely used in microscopic imaging for preparing biological specimens. However, owing to significant fluorescence quenching during the embedding process, it is not compatible with fluorescent-labeling techniques, such as transgenic and viral labeling using green fluorescent protein (GFP). Here we investigated the quenching mechanism and optimized the embedding process to improve the preservation of fluorescence intensity. The results showed that dehydration is the main reason of fluorescence quenching during paraffin embedding, caused by full denaturation of GFP molecules in ethyl alcohol. To evaluate fluorescent and morphological preservation, we modified the embedding process using tertiary butanol (TBA) instead of ethyl alcohol. Fluorescence intensity following TBA dehydration increased 12.08-fold of that observed in the traditional method. We obtained uniform fluorescence maintenance throughout the whole mouse brain, while the continuous apical dendrites, spines, and axon terminals were shown evenly within the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Moreover, we embedded a whole rat brain labeled with AAV in the prelimbic cortex (Prl). With the axon terminals in different areas, such as the caudate putamen, thalamus, and pyramidal tract, the results showed a continuous tract of Prl neurons throughout the whole brain. Meanwhile, this method was suitable to tdTomota labeled samples. These findings indicated this modified embedding method could be compatible with GFP and provides a potential turning point for applications in the fluorescent labeling of samples.</description>

	<description>Objective: To investigate the potential regional homogeneity (ReHo) brain activity changes in patients with corneal ulcer (CU) and their possible relationship with clinical symptoms. 
Materials and methods: 40 patients with CU (26 men and 14 women), and 40 healthy controls (HCs) (26 men and 14 women) closely matched in age, sex and weight underwent resting-state functional MRI scans respectively. The ReHo method was applied to evaluate synchronous neural activity changes. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) was used to show high test-retest stability and high degree of sensitivity and specificity.. We utilized the correlation analysis to calculate the relationship between the average ReHo signal values in different brain areas and the clinical symptoms in CU patients.
Results: Compared with the HCs, CU patients had significantly increased ReHo values in right cerebellum posterior lobe, left cerebellum posterior lobe, left inferior temporal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, left angular gyrus, left cingulate gyrus, right angular gyrus and bilateral superior frontal gyrus，and decreased ReHo values in right anterior cingulate and left precentral gyrus. ROC curve analysis of each brain regions showed the accuracy of AUC was perfect except the right cerebellum posterior lobe. Nevertheless, there was no clear evidence of prominent relevance between the average ReHo values in brain areas and the clinical symptoms. 
Conclusion: CU caused dysfunctional adaption in different brain areas, which including relatively increased values and decreased values. This finding may help us take a further step in exploring the underlying pathologic mechanisms of CU.</description>

	<description>Resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) is a common method for mapping functional brain networks. However, estimation of these networks is affected by the presence of a common global systemic noise, or global signal (GS). Previous studies have shown that the common preprocessing steps of removing the GS may create spurious correlations between brain regions. In this paper, we decompose fMRI signals into 5 spatial and 3 temporal intrinsic mode functions (SIMF and TIMF, respectively) by means of the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which is an adaptive data-driven method widely used to analyze non-linear and non-stationary phenomena. For each SIMF, functional connectivity matrices were computed by means of the Pearson correlation between TIMFs of different brain areas. Thus, instead of a single connectivity matrix, we obtained 5*3 = 15 functional connectivity matrices. Given the high correlation and global efficiency values of the connectivity matrices related to the low spatial maps (SIMF3, SIMF4, and SIMF5), our results suggest that these maps can be considered as spatial global signal masks. Thus, by summing up the first two SIMFs extracted from the fMRI signals, we have automatically excluded the GS  which is now voxel-specific. We compared the performance of our method with the conventional GS regression and to the results when the GS was not removed. While the correlation pattern identified by the other methods suffers from a low level of precision in identifying the correct brain network connectivity, our approach demonstrated expected connectivity patterns for the default mode network and task-positive network.</description>

	<description>Simulations of electrical activity of networks of morphologically detailed neuron models allow for a better understanding of the brain. State-of-the-art simulations describe the dynamics of ionic currents and biochemical processes within branching topological representations of the neurons. Acceleration of such simulation is possible in the weak scaling limit by modelling neurons as indivisible computation units and increasing the computing power. Strong scaling and simulations close to biological time are difficult, yet required for the study of synaptic plasticity and other use cases requiring simulation of neurons for long periods of time. Current methods rely on parallel Gaussian elimination, computing triangulation and substitution of many branches simultaneously.
Existing limitations are: (a) high heterogeneity of compute time per neuron leads to high computational load imbalance; and (b) difficulty in providing a computation model that fully utilises the computing resources on distributed multi-core architectures with Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) capabilities.

To address these issues, we present a strategy that extracts flow-dependencies between parameters of the ODEs and the algebraic solver of individual neurons. Based on the resulting dependencies map, we provide three techniques for memory, communication, and computation reorganization that yield a load-balanced distributed asynchronous execution. The new computation model distributes datasets and balances computational workload across a distributed memory space, exposing a tree-based parallelism of neuron topological structure, an embarrassingly parallel execution model of neuron subtrees, and a SIMD acceleration of subtree state updates.

The capabilities of our methods are demonstrated on a prototype implementation developed on the core compute kernel of the NEURON scientific application, built on the HPX runtime system for the ParalleX execution model. Our implementation yields a fully-asynchronous  distributed and parallel simulation that accelerates single neuron to medium-sized neural networks. Benchmark results display better strong scaling properties, finer-grained parallelism, and lower time to solution compared to the state of the art, on a wide range of distributed multi-core compute architectures.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Wavelet Entropy-Based Inter-subject Associative Cortical Source Localization for Sensorimotor BCI</title>

	<description>We propose event-related cortical sources estimation from subject-independent electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings for motor imagery brain computer interface (BCI). By using wavelet-based maximum entropy on the mean (wMEM), task-specific EEG channels are selected to predict right hand and right foot sensorimotor tasks, employing spatial pattern analysis with and without covariance estimation regularization. EEG from five healthy individuals (Dataset IVa, BCI Competition III) were evaluated by a cross-subject paradigm. Prediction performance was evaluated via a two-layer feed-forward neural network, where the classifier was trained and tested by data from two subjects independently. The highest mean prediction accuracy achieved by using subject-pair (ay-al) specific selected EEG channels was on average (90:36+/-5:59) and outperformed that achieved by using all available channels (83:21+/-12:26). Significant improvements in performance suggest a role of wMEM for channel selection in BCI. Spatially projected cortical sources may be useful for capturing inter-subject associative sensorimotor brain dynamics and pave the way towards subject-independent BCI.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Energy Homeostasis Principle: Neuronal Energy Regulation Drives Local Network Dynamics Generating Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00049</guid>

	<description>Understanding how neurons arrange themselves into neural networks that result in behaviors is a major goal in neuroscience. Most theoretical and experimental efforts have focused on a top-down approach which seeks to identify neuronal correlates of behaviors. This has been accomplished by effectively mapping specific behaviors to distinct neural patterns or by creating computational models that produce a desired behavioral outcome. Nonetheless, these approaches, have only implicitly considered the fact that neural tissue, like any other physical system, is subjected to several restrictions and boundaries of operations. 
	Here, we proposed a new, bottom-up conceptual paradigm: The Energy Homeostasis Principle, where the balance between energy income, expenditure, and availability are the key parameters in determining the dynamics of neuronal phenomena found from molecular to behavioral levels. Neurons display high energy consumption relative to other cells, with metabolic consumption of the brain representing 20% of the whole-body oxygen uptake, which contrasts with this organ representing only 2% of the body weight. Also, neurons have specialized surrounding tissue that provides the necessary energy which in the case of the central nervous system, is provided by astrocytes. Moreover, and unlike other cell types with high energy demands such as muscle cells, neurons have a strict aerobic metabolism. These facts indicate that neurons are highly sensitive to energy limitations with Gibb’s free energy dictating the direction of all cellular metabolic processes. From this activity, the largest energy is by far, expended by action potentials and post-synaptic potentials, therefore, plasticity can be reinterpreted on their energy context. Consequently, neurons, through their synapses, would impose energy demands over post-synaptic neurons in a close loop-manner, modulating the dynamics of local circuits. Therefrom, energy dynamics end up impacting the homeostatic mechanisms of neuronal networks. Furthermore, local energy management emerges also as a neural population property, where most of the energy expenses are triggered by sensory or other modulatory input. Local energy management in neurons may be sufficient to explain the emergence of behavior, enabling the assessment of which and how properties arise in neural circuits. Importantly, the Energy Homeostasis Principle proposal is also readily testable in simple neuronal networks.</description>

Recent work has begun to elucidate the vascular and neural mechanisms underlying the BOLD signal. The dilatory response is distributed throughout the vascular network. Arteries actively dilate within a second following neural activity increases, while venous distensions are passive and have a time course that last tens of seconds. Vasodilation, and thus local blood flow, is controlled by the activity of both neurons and astrocytes via multiple different pathways. The relationship between sensory-driven neural activity and the vascular dynamics in sensory areas are well-captured with a linear convolution model. However, depending on the behavioral state or brain region, the coupling between neural activity and hemodynamic signals can be weak or even inverted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
