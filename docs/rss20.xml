	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: EEG-based Subjects Identification based on Biometrics of Imagined Speech using EMD. (arXiv:1809.06697v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06697</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06697</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When brain activity is translated into commands for real applications, the
potential for human capacities augmentation is promising. In this paper, EMD is
used to decompose EEG signals during Imagined Speech in order to use it as a
biometric marker for creating a Biometric Recognition System. For each EEG
channel, the most relevant Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) are decided based on
the Minkowski distance, and for each IMF 4 features are computed: Instantaneous
and Teager energy distribution and Higuchi and Petrosian Fractal Dimension. To
test the proposed method, a dataset with 20 subjects who imagined 30
repetitions of 5 words in Spanish, is used. Four classifiers are used for this
task - random forest, SVM, naive Bayes, and k-NN - and their performances are
compared. The accuracy obtained (up to 0.92 using Linear SVM) after 10-folds
cross-validation suggest that the proposed method based on EMD can be valuable
for creating EEG-based biometrics of imagined speech for Subjects
identification.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Cross-Domain Influences on Creative Processes and Products. (arXiv:1809.06521v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06521</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06521</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;According to the honing theory of creativity, the iterative process
culminating in a creative work is made possible by the self-organizing nature
of a conceptual network, or worldview, and its innate holistic tendency to
minimize inconsistency. As such, the creative process is not limited to the
problem domain, and influences on creativity from domains other than that of
the final product are predicted to be widespread. We conducted a study in which
participants with varying levels of creative experience listed their creative
outputs, as well as influences (sources of inspiration) on these outputs. Of
the 758 creative influences, 13% were within-domain narrow, 13% within-domain
broad, 67% cross-domain, and 6% unclear. These findings support the hypothesis
that to trace the inspirational sources or 'conceptual parents' of a creative
output, and thus track its cultural lineage, one must look beyond the problem
domain to the creators' self-organizing, inconsistency-minimizing worldview at
large.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The physics of brain network structure, function, and control. (arXiv:1809.06441v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06441</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain is a complex organ characterized by heterogeneous patterns of
structural connections supporting unparalleled feats of cognition and a wide
range of behaviors. New noninvasive imaging techniques now allow these patterns
to be carefully and comprehensively mapped in individual humans and animals.
Yet, it remains a fundamental challenge to understand how the brain's
structural wiring supports cognitive processes, with major implications for the
personalized treatment of mental health disorders. Here, we review recent
efforts to meet this challenge that draw on intuitions, models, and theories
from physics, spanning the domains of statistical mechanics, information
theory, and dynamical systems and control. We begin by considering the
organizing principles of brain network architecture instantiated in structural
wiring under constraints of symmetry, spatial embedding, and energy
minimization. We next consider models of brain network function that stipulate
how neural activity propagates along these structural connections, producing
the long-range interactions and collective dynamics that support a rich
repertoire of system functions. Finally, we consider perturbative experiments
and models for brain network control, which leverage the physics of signal
transmission along structural wires to infer intrinsic control processes that
support goal-directed behavior and to inform stimulation-based therapies for
neurological disease and psychiatric disorders. Throughout, we highlight
several open questions in the physics of brain network structure, function, and
control that will require creative efforts from physicists willing to brave the
complexities of living matter.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: All-atom normal mode dynamics of HIV-1 capsid</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006456</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyuntae Na, Guang Song&lt;/p&gt;

Dynamics of biomolecular assemblies offer invaluable insights into their functional mechanisms. For extremely large biomolecular systems, such as HIV-1 capsid that has nearly 5 millions atoms, obtaining its normal mode dynamics using even coarse-grained models can be a challenging task. In this work, we have successfully carried out a normal mode analysis of an entire HIV-1 capsid in full all-atom details. This is made possible through our newly developed BOSE (Block of Selected Elasticity) model that is founded on the principle of resonance discovered in our recent work. The resonance principle makes it possible to most efficiently compute the vibrations of a whole capsid at any given frequency by projecting the motions of component capsomeres into a narrow subspace. We have conducted also assessments of the quality of the BOSE modes by comparing them with benchmark modes obtained directly from the original Hessian matrix. Our all-atom normal mode dynamics study of the HIV-1 capsid reveals the dynamic role of the pentamers in stabilizing the capsid structure and is in agreement with experimental findings that suggest capsid disassembly and uncoating start when the pentamers become destabilized. Our results on the dynamics of hexamer pores suggest that nucleotide transport should take place mostly at hexamers near pentamers, especially at the larger hemispherical end.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6rrbmtVPD1U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Robust spatial memory maps encoded by networks with transient connections</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006433</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrey Babichev, Dmitriy Morozov, Yuri Dabaghian&lt;/p&gt;

The spiking activity of principal cells in mammalian hippocampus encodes an internalized neuronal representation of the ambient space—a cognitive map. Once learned, such a map enables the animal to navigate a given environment for a long period. However, the neuronal substrate that produces this map is transient: the synaptic connections in the hippocampus and in the downstream neuronal networks never cease to form and to deteriorate at a rapid rate. How can the brain maintain a robust, reliable representation of space using a network that constantly changes its architecture? We address this question using a computational framework that allows evaluating the effect produced by the decaying connections between simulated hippocampal neurons on the properties of the cognitive map. Using novel Algebraic Topology techniques, we demonstrate that emergence of stable cognitive maps produced by networks with transient architectures is a generic phenomenon. The model also points out that deterioration of the cognitive map caused by weakening or lost connections between neurons may be compensated by simulating the neuronal activity. Lastly, the model explicates the importance of the complementary learning systems for processing spatial information at different levels of spatiotemporal granularity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gbbOgT7E6ek&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Advances in calcium imaging have made it possible to record from an increasingly larger number of neurons simultaneously. Neuroscientists can now routinely image hundreds to thousands of individual neurons. An emerging technical challenge that parallels the advancement in imaging a large number of individual neurons is the processing of correspondingly large datasets. One important step is the identification of individual neurons. Traditional methods rely mainly on manual or semimanual inspection, which cannot be scaled for processing large datasets. To address this challenge, we focused on developing an automated segmentation method, which we refer to as automated cell segmentation by adaptive thresholding (ACSAT). ACSAT works with a time-collapsed image and includes an iterative procedure that automatically calculates global and local threshold values during successive iterations based on the distribution of image pixel intensities. Thus, the algorithm is capable of handling variations in morphological details and in fluorescence intensities in different calcium imaging datasets. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of ACSAT by testing it on 500 simulated datasets, two wide-field hippocampus datasets, a wide-field striatum dataset, a wide-field cell culture dataset, and a two-photon hippocampus dataset. For the simulated datasets with truth, ACSAT achieved &amp;gt;80% recall and precision when the signal-to-noise ratio was no less than ~24 dB.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Psychiatric Illnesses as Disorders of Network Dynamics. (arXiv:1809.06303v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This review provides a dynamical systems perspective on psychiatric symptoms
and disease, and discusses its potential implications for diagnosis, prognosis,
and treatment. After a brief introduction into the theory of dynamical systems,
we will focus on the idea that cognitive and emotional functions are
implemented in terms of dynamical systems phenomena in the brain, a common
assumption in theoretical and computational neuroscience. Specific
computational models, anchored in biophysics, for generating different types of
network dynamics, and with a relation to psychiatric symptoms, will be briefly
reviewed, as well as methodological approaches for reconstructing the system
dynamics from observed time series (like fMRI or EEG recordings). We then
attempt to outline how psychiatric phenomena, associated with schizophrenia,
depression, PTSD, ADHD, phantom pain, and others, could be understood in
dynamical systems terms. Most importantly, we will try to convey that the
dynamical systems level may provide a central, hub-like level of convergence
which unifies and links multiple biophysical and behavioral phenomena, in the
sense that diverse biophysical changes can give rise to the same dynamical
phenomena and, vice versa, similar changes in dynamics may yield different
behavioral symptoms depending on the brain area where these changes manifest.
If this assessment is correct, it may have profound implications for the
diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of psychiatric conditions, as it puts the
focus on dynamics. We therefore argue that consideration of dynamics should
play an important role in the choice and target of interventions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: LSTM knowledge transfer for HRV-based sleep staging. (arXiv:1809.06221v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06221</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06221</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Automated sleep stage classification using heart-rate variability is an
active field of research. In this work limitations of the current
state-of-the-art are addressed through the use of deep learning techniques and
their efficacy is demonstrated. First, a temporal model is proposed for the
inference of sleep stages from electrocardiography using a deep long- and
short-term (LSTM) classifier and it is shown that this model outperforms
previous approaches which were often limited to non-temporal or Markovian
classifiers on a comprehensive benchmark data set (292 participants, 541214
samples) comprising a wide range of ages and pathological profiles, achieving a
Cohen's $\kappa$ of $0.61\pm0.16$ and accuracy of $76.30\pm10.17$ annotated
according to the Rechtschaffen &amp;amp; Kales annotation standard.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, it is demonstrated how knowledge learned on this large
benchmark data set can be re-used through transfer learning for the
classification of photoplethysmography (PPG) data. This is done using a smaller
data set (60 participants, 91479 samples) that is annotated with the more
recent American Association of Sleep Medicine annotation standard, achieving a
Cohen's $\kappa$ of $0.63\pm0.13$ and accuracy of $74.65\pm8.63$ for
wrist-mounted PPG-based sleep stage classification, higher than any previously
reported performance using this sensor modality. This demonstrates the
feasibility of knowledge transfer in sleep staging to adapt models for new
sensor modalities as well as different annotation strategies.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Large-scale validation of an automatic EEG arousal detection algorithm using different databases. (arXiv:1809.06216v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06216</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06216</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;$\textbf{Objective}$: To assess the validity of an automatic EEG arousal
detection algorithm using large patient samples and different heterogeneous
databases
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\textbf{Methods}$: Automatic scorings were confronted with results from
human expert scorers on a total of 2768 full-night PSG recordings obtained from
two different databases. 472 recordings were obtained during clinical routine
at our sleep center and were subdivided into two subgroups of 220 (HMC-S) and
252 (HMC-M) recordings each, attending to the procedure followed by the
clinical expert during the visual review (semi-automatic or purely manual,
respectively). In addition, 2296 recordings from the public SHHS-2 database
were evaluated against the respective manual expert scorings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\textbf{Results}$: Event-by-event epoch-based validation resulted in an
overall Cohen kappa agreement K = 0.600 (HMC-S), 0.559 (HMC-M), and 0.573
(SHHS2). Estimated inter-scorer variability on the datasets was, respectively,
K = 0.594, 0.561 and 0.543. Analyses of the corresponding Arousal Index scores
showed associated automatic-human repeatability indices ranging in 0.693-0.771
(HMC-S), 0.646-0.791 (HMC-M), and 0.759-0.791 (SHHS2).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\textbf{Conclusions}$: Large-scale validation of our automatic EEG arousal
detector on different databases has shown robust performance and good
generalization results comparable to the expected levels of human agreement.
Special emphasis has been put on allowing reproducibility of the results and
implementation of our method has been made accessible online as open source
code

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Conventional anesthesia methods such as injective anesthetic agents may cause
various side effects such as injuries, allergies, and infections. We aim to
investigate a noninvasive scheme of an electromagnetic radiator system to block
action potential (AP) in neuron fibers. We achieved a high-gradient and
unipolar tangential electric field by designing circular geometric coils on an
electric rectifier filter layer. An asymmetric sawtooth pulse shape supplied
the coils in order to create an effective blockage. The entire setup was placed
5 cm above 50 motor and sensory neurons of the spinal cord. A validated
time-domain full-wave analysis code Based on cable model of the neurons and the
electric and magnetic potentials is used to simulate and investigate the
proposed scheme. We observed action potential blockage on both motor and
sensory neurons. In addition, the introduced approach shows promising potential
for AP manipulation in the spinal cord.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Simultaneous EEG/fMRI acquisition allows to measure brain activity at high
spatial-temporal resolution. The localisation of EEG sources depends on several
parameters including the position of the electrodes on the scalp. The position
of the MR electrodes during its acquisitions is obtained with the use of the
UTE sequence allowing their visualisation. The retrieval of the electrodes
consists in obtaining the volume where the electrodes are located by applying a
sphere detection algorithm. We detect around 90% of electrodes for each
subject, and our UTE-based electrode detection showed an average position error
of 3.7mm for all subjects.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The impact of developmental and aging processes on brain connectivity and the
connectome has been widely studied. Network theoretical measures and certain
topological principles are computed from the entire brain, however there is a
need to separate and understand the underlying subnetworks which contribute
towards these observed holistic connectomic alterations. One organizational
principle is the rich-club - a core subnetwork of brain regions that are
strongly connected, forming a high-cost, high-capacity backbone that is
critical for effective communication in the network. Investigations primarily
focus on its alterations with disease and age. Here, we present a systematic
analysis of not only the rich-club, but also other subnetworks derived from
this backbone - namely feeder and seeder subnetworks. Our analysis is applied
to structural connectomes in a normal cohort from a large, publicly available
lifespan study. We demonstrate changes in rich-club membership with age
alongside a shift in importance from 'peripheral' seeder to feeder subnetworks.
Our results show a refinement within the rich-club structure (increase in
transitivity and betweenness centrality), as well as increased efficiency in
the feeder subnetwork and decreased measures of network integration and
segregation in the seeder subnetwork. These results demonstrate the different
developmental patterns when analyzing the connectome stratified according to
its rich-club and the potential of utilizing this subnetwork analysis to reveal
the evolution of brain architectural alterations across the life-span.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05743</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inhibition is considered to shape neural activity, and broaden its pattern
repertoire. In the sensory organs, where the anatomy of neural circuits is
highly structured, lateral inhibition sharpens contrast among stimulus
properties. The impact of inhibition on stimulus processing and the involvement
of lateral inhibition is less clear when activity propagates to the
less-structured relay stations. Here we take a synthetic approach to
disentangle the impacts of inhibition from that of specialized anatomy on the
repertoire of evoked activity patterns, and as a result, the network capacity
to uniquely represent different stimuli. To this aim, we blocked inhibition in
randomly rewired networks of cortical neurons in-vitro, and quantified response
variability and stimulus discrimination among stimuli provided at different
spatial loci, before and after the blockade. We show that blocking inhibition
quenches variability of responses evoked by repeated stimuli through any
spatial source; for all tested response features. Despite the sharpening role
of inhibition in the highly structured sensory organs, in these random networks
we find that blocking inhibition enhances stimulus discrimination between
spatial sources of stimulation, when based on response features that emphasize
the relation among spike times recorded through different electrodes. We
further show that under intact inhibition, responses to a given stimulus are a
noisy version of those revealed by blocking inhibition; such that intact
inhibition disrupts an otherwise coherent, wave propagation of activity.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic functional connectivity analysis provides valuable information for
understanding brain functional activity underlying different cognitive
processes. Besides sliding window based approaches, a variety of methods have
been developed to automatically split the entire functional MRI scan into
segments by detecting change points of functional signals to facilitate better
characterization of temporally dynamic functional connectivity patterns.
However, these methods are based on certain assumptions for the functional
signals, such as Gaussian distribution, which are not necessarily suitable for
the fMRI data. In this study, we develop a deep learning based framework for
adaptively detecting temporally dynamic functional state transitions in a
data-driven way without any explicit modeling assumptions, by leveraging recent
advances in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence modeling.
Particularly, we solve this problem in an anomaly detection framework with an
assumption that the functional profile of one single time point could be
reliably predicted based on its preceding profiles within stable functional
state, while large prediction errors would occur around change points of
functional states. We evaluate the proposed method using both task and
resting-state fMRI data obtained from the human connectome project and
experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed change point detection
method could effectively identify change points between different task events
and split the resting-state fMRI into segments with distinct functional
connectivity patterns.

	<description>Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by debilitating heterotopic ossification (HO). The retinoic acid receptor gamma agonist, palovarotene, and antibody-mediated activin A blockade have entered human clinical trials, but how these therapeutic modalities affect the behavior of pathogenic fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) is unclear. Using live-animal luminescence imaging, we show that transplanted pathogenic FAPs undergo rapid initial expansion, with peak number strongly correlating with HO severity. Palovarotene significantly reduced expansion of pathogenic FAPs, but was less effective than activin A inhibition, which restored wild-type population growth dynamics to FAPs. Palovarotene pretreatment did not reduce FAPs’ skeletogenic potential, indicating that efficacy requires chronic administration. Although palovarotene inhibited chondrogenic differentiation in vitro and reduced HO in juvenile FOP mice, daily dosing resulted in aggressive synovial joint overgrowth and long bone growth plate ablation. These results highlight the challenge of inhibiting pathological bone formation prior to skeletal maturation.</description>

	<description>Neuropeptides are evolutionarily ancient peptide hormones of the nervous and neuroendocrine systems, and are thought to have regulated metamorphosis in early animal ancestors. In particular, the deeply conserved Wamide family of neuropeptides—shared across Bilateria (e.g. insects and worms) and its sister group Cnidaria (e.g. jellyfishes and corals)—has been implicated in mediating life-cycle transitions, yet their endogenous roles remain poorly understood. By using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated reverse genetics, we show that cnidarian Wamide—referred to as GLWamide—regulates the timing of life cycle transition in the sea anemone cnidarian &lt;i&gt;Nematostella vectensis&lt;/i&gt;. We find that mutant planula larvae lacking GLWamides transform into morphologically normal polyps at a rate slower than that of the wildtype control larvae. Treatment of GLWamide null mutant larvae with synthetic GLWamide peptides is sufficient to restore a normal rate of metamorphosis. These results demonstrate that GLWamide plays a dispensable, modulatory role in accelerating metamorphosis in a sea anemone.</description>

	<description>Fast directional growth is a necessity for the young seedling; after germination, it needs to quickly penetrate the soil to begin its autotrophic life. In most dicot plants, this rapid escape is due to the anisotropic elongation of the hypocotyl, the columnar organ between the root and the shoot meristems. Anisotropic growth is common in plant organs and is canonically attributed to cell wall anisotropy produced by oriented cellulose fibers. Recently, a mechanism based on asymmetric pectin-based cell wall elasticity has been proposed. Here we present a harmonizing model for anisotropic growth control in the dark-grown &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; hypocotyl: basic anisotropic information is provided by cellulose orientation) and additive anisotropic information is provided by pectin-based elastic asymmetry in the epidermis. We quantitatively show that hypocotyl elongation is anisotropic starting at germination. We present experimental evidence for pectin biochemical differences and wall mechanics providing important growth regulation in the hypocotyl. Lastly, our in silico modelling experiments indicate an additive collaboration between pectin biochemistry and cellulose orientation in promoting anisotropic growth.</description>

	<description>Uterine leiomyomas (ULs) are benign tumors that are a major burden to women's health. A genome-wide association study on 15,453 UL cases and 392,628 controls was performed, followed by replication of the genomic risk in six cohorts. Effects of the risk alleles were evaluated in view of molecular and clinical characteristics. 22 loci displayed a genome-wide significant association. The likely predisposition genes could be grouped to two biological processes. Genes involved in genome stability were represented by &lt;i&gt;TERT, TERC, OBFC1&lt;/i&gt; - highlighting the role of telomere maintenance - &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ATM&lt;/i&gt;. Genes involved in genitourinary development, &lt;i&gt;WNT4, WT1, SALL1, MED12, ESR1, GREB1, FOXO1, DMRT1 &lt;/i&gt;and uterine stem cell marker antigen &lt;i&gt;CD44, &lt;/i&gt;formed another strong subgroup. The combined risk contributed by the 22 loci was associated with &lt;i&gt;MED12&lt;/i&gt; mutation-positive tumors. The findings link genes for uterine development and genetic stability to leiomyomagenesis, and in part explain the more frequent occurrence of UL in women of African origin.</description>

	<description>The factors that govern assembly of the gut microbiota are insufficiently understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that inter-individual microbiota variation can arise solely from differences in the order and timing by which the gut is colonized early in life. Experiments in which mice were inoculated in sequence either with two complex seed communities or a cocktail of four bacterial strains and a seed community revealed that colonization order influenced both the outcome of community assembly and the ecological success of individual colonizers. Historical contingency and priority effects also occurred in &lt;i&gt;Rag1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice, suggesting that the adaptive immune system is not a major contributor to these processes. In conclusion, this study established a measurable effect of colonization history on gut microbiota assembly in a model in which host and environmental factors were strictly controlled, illuminating a potential cause for the high levels of unexplained individuality in host-associated microbial communities.</description>

	<description>Cognitive and social capacities require postnatal experience, yet the pathways by which experience guides development are unknown. Here we show that the normal development of motor and nonmotor capacities requires cerebellar activity. Using chemogenetic perturbation of molecular layer interneurons to attenuate cerebellar output in mice, we found that activity of posterior regions in juvenile life modulates adult expression of eyeblink conditioning (paravermal lobule VI, crus I), reversal learning (lobule VI), persistive behavior and novelty-seeking (lobule VII), and social preference (crus I/II). Perturbation in adult life altered only a subset of phenotypes. Both adult and juvenile disruption left gait metrics largely unaffected. Contributions to phenotypes increased with the amount of lobule inactivated. Using an anterograde transsynaptic tracer, we found that posterior cerebellum made strong connections with prelimbic, orbitofrontal, and anterior cingulate cortex. These findings provide anatomical substrates for the clinical observation that cerebellar injury increases the risk of autism.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Functional characterization of retinal ganglion cells using tailored nonlinear modeling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/421396v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/421396v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>There are 20-50 functionally- and anatomically-distinct ganglion cell types in the mammalian retina; each type encodes a unique feature of the visual world and conveys it via action potentials to the brain. Individual ganglion cells receive input from unique presynaptic retinal circuits, and the characteristic patterns of light-evoked action potentials in each ganglion cell type therefore reflect computations encoded in synaptic input and in postsynaptic signal integration and spike generation. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of tools for characterizing retinal ganglion cell computation. Therefore, we developed a statistical model, the separable Nonlinear Input Model, capable of characterizing the large array of distinct computations reflected in retinal ganglion cell spiking. We recorded ganglion cell responses to a correlated noise (&quot;cloud&quot;) stimulus designed to accentuate the important features of retinal processing in an in vitro preparation of mouse retina and found that this model accurately predicted ganglion cell responses at high spatiotemporal resolution. It identified multiple receptive fields (RFs) reflecting the main excitatory and suppressive components of the response of each neuron. Most significantly, our model succeeds where others fail, accurately identifying ON-OFF cells and segregating their distinct ON and OFF selectivity and demonstrating the presence of different types of suppressive receptive fields. In total, our computational approach offers rich description of ganglion cell computation and sets a foundation for relating retinal computation to retinal circuitry.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Temporal resolution of single photon responses in primate rod photoreceptors and limits imposed by cellular noise</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/421263v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Sensory receptor noise corrupts sensory signals, contributing to imperfect perception and dictating central processing strategies. For example, noise in rod phototransduction limits our ability to detect light and minimizing the impact of this noise requires precisely tuned nonlinear processing by the retina. But detection sensitivity is only one aspect of night vision: prompt and accurate behavior also requires that rods reliably encode the timing of photon arrivals. We show here that the temporal resolution of responses of primate rods is much finer than the duration of the light response and identify the key limiting sources of transduction noise. We also find that the thermal activation rate of rhodopsin is lower than previous estimates, implying that other noise sources are more important than previously appreciated. A model of rod single-photon responses reveals that the limiting noise relevant for behavior depends critically on how rod signals are pooled by downstream neurons.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A GABAergic Maf-expressing interneuron subset regulates the speed of locomotion in Drosophila</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/421057v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/421057v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Interneurons (INs) coordinate motoneurons activity to generate adequate patterns of muscle contractions, providing animals with the ability to adjust their body posture and to move over a range of speeds. In the Drosophila larvae several IN subtypes have been morphologically described and their function well documented. However, the general lack of molecular characterization of those INs prevents the identification of evolutionary counterparts in other model animals, limiting our understanding of widespread principles ruling neuronal circuits organization and functioning. Here we characterize a highly restricted neuronal subset expressing the Maf transcription factor Traffic Jam (TJ). We found that TJ+ neurons are highly diverse and their activation using intersectional genetics disrupted larval body posture and locomotion speed. We also showed that a small subset of TJ+ GABAergic INs, singled out by the unique expression of Per, Fkh, Grain and Hlh3b, a molecular signature reminiscent to V2b INs in vertebrate, impacted the larvae crawling speed.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Surface color and predictability determine contextual modulation of V1 firing and gamma oscillations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/421040v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/421040v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The integration of direct bottom-up inputs with contextual information is a canonical motif in neocortical circuits. In area V1, neurons may reduce their firing rates when the (classical) receptive field input can be predicted by the spatial context. We previously hypothesized that gamma-synchronization (30-80Hz) provides a complementary signal to rates, encoding whether stimuli are predicted from spatial context by preferentially synchronizing neuronal populations receiving predictable inputs. Here we investigated how rates and synchrony are modulated by predictive context. Large uniform surfaces, which have high spatial predictability, strongly suppressed firing yet induced prominent gamma-synchronization, but only when they were colored. Yet, chromatic mismatches between center and surround, breaking predictability, strongly reduced gamma-synchronization while increasing firing rates. Differences between colors, including strong gamma-responses to red, arose because of stimulus adaptation to a full-screen background, with a prominent difference in adaptation between M- and L-cone signaling pathways. Thus, synchrony signals whether RF inputs are predicted from spatial context and may encode relationships across space, while firing rates increase when stimuli are unpredicted from the context.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Signaling incentive and drive in the primate ventral pallidum for motivational control of goal-directed action</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/420851v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/420851v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Processing incentive and drive is essential for control of goal-directed behavior. The limbic part of the basal ganglia has been emphasized in these processes, yet the exact neuronal mechanism has remained elusive. In this study, we examined the neuronal activity of the ventral pallidum (VP) and its upstream area, the rostromedial caudate (rmCD), while two male macaque monkeys performed an instrumental lever-release task, in which a visual cue indicated the forthcoming reward size. We found that the activity of some neurons in VP and rmCD reflected the expected reward-size transiently following the cue. Reward-size coding appeared earlier and stronger in VP than in rmCD. We also found that the activity in these areas was modulated by the satiation level of monkeys, which also occurred more frequently in VP than in rmCD. The information regarding reward-size and satiation-level was independently signaled in the neuronal populations of these areas. The data thus highlighted the neuronal coding of key variables for goal-directed behavior in VP. Furthermore, pharmacological inactivation of VP induced more severe deficit of goal-directed behavior than inactivation of rmCD, which was indicated by abnormal error repetition and diminished satiation effect on the performance. These results suggest that VP encodes incentive value and internal drive, and plays a pivotal role in the control of motivation to promote goal-directed behavior.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Pitch perception is adapted to species-specific cochlear filtering</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/420786v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/420786v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Pitch perception is critical for recognizing speech, music and animal vocalizations, but its neurobiological basis remains unsettled, in part because of divergent results from different species. We used a combination of behavioural measurements and cochlear modelling to investigate whether species-specific differences exist in the cues used to perceive pitch and whether these can be accounted for by differences in the auditory periphery. Ferrets performed a pitch discrimination task well whenever temporal envelope cues were robust, but not when resolved harmonics only were available. By contrast, human listeners exhibited the opposite pattern of results on an analogous task, consistent with previous studies. Simulated cochlear responses in the two species suggest that the relative salience of the two types of pitch cues can be attributed to differences in cochlear filter bandwidths. Cross-species variation in pitch perception may therefore reflect the constraints of estimating a sound's fundamental frequency given species-specific cochlear tuning.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: ASD Diagnosis in Adults: Phenotype and Genotype Findings from a Clinically-derived Cohort</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/420778v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/420778v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: The last decade has seen the development of services for adults presenting with symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the UK. Compared to children, little is known about the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of these patients. Aims: This e-cohort study aimed to examine the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of a clinically-presenting sample of adults diagnosed with ASD by specialist services. Methods: Individuals diagnosed with ASD as adults were recruited by the National Centre for Mental Health and completed self-report questionnaires, interviews and provided DNA. 105 eligible individuals were matched to 76 healthy controls. We investigated the demographics, social history, comorbid psychiatric and physical disorders. Samples were genotyped, copy number variants (CNVs) were called and polygenic risk scores calculated. Results: 89.5% of individuals with ASD had at least one comorbid psychiatric diagnosis with comorbid depression (62.9%) and anxiety (55.2%) the most common. The ASD group experienced more neurological comorbidities than healthy controls, particularly migraine headache. They were less likely to have married or be in work and had more alcohol-related problems. There was a significantly higher load of autism common genetic variants in the adult ASD group compared to controls, but there was no difference in the rate of rare CNVs. Conclusions: This study provides important information about psychiatric comorbidity in adult ASD which may be used to inform clinical practice and patient counselling. It also suggests that the polygenic load of common ASD associated variants may be important in conferring risk within non-intellectually disabled population of adults with ASD.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/420760v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Sensorimotor integration involves feedforward and reentrant processing of sensory input. Grasp-related motor activity precedes and is thought to influence visual object processing. Yet, while the importance of reentrant feedback is well established in perception, the top-down modulations for action and the neural circuits involved in this process have received less attention. Do action-specific intentions influence the processing of visual information in the human cortex? Using a cue-separation fMRI paradigm, we found that action-specific instruction (manual alignment vs. grasp) influences the cortical processing of object orientation several seconds after the object had been viewed. This influence occurred as early as in the primary visual cortex and extended to ventral and dorsal visual stream areas. Importantly, this modulation was unrelated to non-specific action planning. Further, the primary visual cortex showed stronger functional connectivity with frontal-parietal areas and the inferior temporal cortex during the delay following orientation processing for align than grasping movements, strengthening the idea of reentrant feedback from dorsal visual stream areas involved in action. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that intended manual actions have such an early, pervasive, and differential influence on the cortical processing of vision.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/420422v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Parkinson's disease patients (PDP) are evaluated using the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) to follow the longitudinal course of the disease. UPDRS evaluation is performed by a neurologist, and hence its use is limited in the evaluation of short-term (daily) fluctuations. Subjects taking L-DOPA as part of treatment to reduce symptoms exhibit motor fluctuations as a common complication. Objectives: The aim of the study is to assess the use of speech analysis as a proxy to continuously monitor PDP medication state. Methods: We combine acoustic, prosody, and semantic features to characterize three speech tasks (picture description, reverse counting and diadochokinetic rate) of 25 PDP evaluated under different medication states: ON and OFF L-DOPA. Results: Classification of medication states using features extracted from audio recordings results in cross-validated accuracy rates of 0.88, 0.84 and 0.71 for the picture description, reverse counting and diadochokinetic rate tasks, respectively. When adding feature selection and semantic features, the accuracy rates increase to 1.00, 0.96 and 0.83 respectively; thus reaching very high classification accuracy on 3 different tasks. Conclusions: We show that speech-based features are highly predictive</description>

The capacity to learn abstract concepts such as ‘sameness’ and ‘difference’ is considered a higher-order cognitive function, typically thought to be dependent on top-down neocortical processing. It is therefore surprising that honey bees apparantly have this capacity. Here we report a model of the structures of the honey bee brain that can learn sameness and difference, as well as a range of complex and simple associative learning tasks. Our model is constrained by the known connections and properties of the mushroom body, including the protocerebral tract, and provides a good fit to the learning rates and performances of real bees in all tasks, including learning sameness and difference. The model proposes a novel mechanism for learning the abstract concepts of ‘sameness’ and ‘difference’ that is compatible with the insect brain, and is not dependent on top-down or executive control processing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HFdx2Lid-Jk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Variation of an inherited trait across a population cannot be explained by additive contributions of relevant genes, due to epigenetic effects and biochemical interactions (epistasis). Detecting epistasis in genomic data still represents a significant challenge that requires a better understanding of epistasis from the mechanistic point of view. Using a standard Wright-Fisher model of bi-allelic asexual population, we study how compensatory epistasis affects the process of adaptation. The main result is a universal relationship between four haplotype frequencies of a single site pair in a genome, which depends only on the epistasis strength of the pair defined regarding Darwinian fitness. We demonstrate the existence, at any time point, of a quasi-equilibrium between epistasis and disorder (entropy) caused by random genetic drift and mutation. We verify the accuracy of these analytic results by Monte-Carlo simulation over a broad range of parameters, including the topology of the interacting network. Thus, epistasis assists the evolutionary transit through evolutionary hurdles leaving marks at the level of haplotype disequilibrium. The method allows determining selection coefficient for each site and the epistasis strength of each pair from a sequence set. The resulting ability to detect clusters of deleterious mutation close to full compensation is essential for biomedical applications. These findings help to understand the role of epistasis in multiple compensatory mutations in viral resistance to antivirals and immune response.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Uu1bJnHITJI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Every neuron is part of a network, exerting its function by transforming multiple spatiotemporal synaptic input patterns into a single spiking output. This function is specified by the particular shape and passive electrical properties of the neuronal membrane, and the composition and spatial distribution of ion channels across its processes. For a variety of physiological or pathological reasons, the intrinsic input/output function may change during a neuron’s lifetime. This process results in high variability in the peak specific conductance of ion channels in individual neurons. The mechanisms responsible for this variability are not well understood, although there are clear indications from experiment and modeling that degeneracy and correlation among multiple channels may be involved. Here, we studied this issue in biophysical models of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and interneurons. Using a unified data-driven simulation workflow and starting from a set of experimental recordings and morphological reconstructions obtained from rats, we built and analyzed several ensembles of morphologically and biophysically accurate single cell models with intrinsic electrophysiological properties consistent with experimental findings. The results suggest that the set of conductances expressed in any given hippocampal neuron may be considered as belonging to two groups: one subset is responsible for the major characteristics of the firing behavior in each population and the other responsible for a robust degeneracy. Analysis of the model neurons suggests several experimentally testable predictions related to the combination and relative proportion of the different conductances that should be expressed on the membrane of different types of neurons for them to fulfill their role in the hippocampus circuitry.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mPhNfP2JTzg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Filamentous actin (F-actin) and non-muscle myosin II motors drive cell motility and cell shape changes that guide large scale tissue movements during embryonic morphogenesis. To gain a better understanding of the role of actomyosin &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we have developed a two-dimensional (2D) computational model to study emergent phenomena of dynamic unbranched actomyosin arrays in the cell cortex. These phenomena include actomyosin punctuated contractions, or &quot;actin asters&quot; that form within quiescent F-actin networks. Punctuated contractions involve both formation of high intensity aster-like structures and disassembly of those same structures. Our 2D model allows us to explore the kinematics of filament polarity sorting, segregation of motors, and morphology of F-actin arrays that emerge as the model structure and biophysical properties are varied. Our model demonstrates the complex, emergent feedback between filament reorganization and motor transport that generate as well as disassemble actin asters. Since intracellular actomyosin dynamics are thought to be controlled by localization of scaffold proteins that bind F-actin or their myosin motors we also apply our 2D model to recapitulate &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies that have revealed complex patterns of actomyosin that assemble from patterning filaments and motor complexes with microcontact printing. Although we use a minimal representation of filament, motor, and cross-linker biophysics, our model establishes a framework for investigating the role of other actin binding proteins, how they might alter actomyosin dynamics, and makes predictions that can be tested experimentally within live cells as well as within &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dg13yks3NAs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

While the neurobiology of simple and habitual choices is relatively well known, our current understanding of goal-directed choices and planning in the brain is still limited. Theoretical work suggests that goal-directed computations can be productively associated to model-based (reinforcement learning) computations, yet a detailed mapping between computational processes and neuronal circuits remains to be fully established. Here we report a computational analysis that aligns Bayesian nonparametrics and model-based reinforcement learning (MB-RL) to the functioning of the hippocampus (HC) and the ventral striatum (vStr)–a neuronal circuit that increasingly recognized to be an appropriate model system to understand goal-directed (spatial) decisions and planning mechanisms in the brain. We test the MB-RL agent in a contextual conditioning task that depends on intact hippocampus and ventral striatal (shell) function and show that it solves the task while showing key behavioral and neuronal signatures of the HC—vStr circuit. Our simulations also explore the benefits of biological forms of look-ahead prediction (forward sweeps) during both learning and control. This article thus contributes to fill the gap between our current understanding of computational algorithms and biological realizations of (model-based) reinforcement learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/g0hrusts6EA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Electrophysiological Signature Reveals Laminar Structure of the Porcine Hippocampus</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is integral to working and episodic memory, and is a central region of interest in diseases affecting these processes. Pig models are widely used in translational research, and may provide an excellent bridge between rodents and non-human primates for CNS disease models due to their gyrencephalic neuroanatomy and significant white matter composition. However, the laminar structure of the pig hippocampus has not been well characterized. Therefore, we histologically characterized the dorsal hippocampus of Yucatan miniature pigs and quantified the cytoarchitecture of the hippocampal layers. We then utilized stereotaxis combined with single unit electrophysiological mapping to precisely place multichannel laminar silicon probes into the dorsal hippocampus without the need for image guidance. We used &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological recordings of simultaneous laminar field potentials and single unit activity in multiple layers of the dorsal hippocampus to physiologically identify and quantify these layers under anesthesia. Consistent with previous reports, we found the porcine hippocampus to have the expected archicortical laminar structure with some anatomical and histological features comparable to the rodent and others to the primate hippocampus. Importantly, we found these distinct features to be reflected in the laminar electrophysiology. This characterization, as well as our electrophysiology-based methodology targeting the porcine hippocampal lamina combined with high channel count silicon probes will allow for analysis of spike-field interactions during normal and disease states in both anesthetized and future awake behaving neurophysiology in this large animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The hippocampus is central to working and episodic memory and is critically affected by diverse disease processes. In order to investigate hippocampal electrophysiology in translational large animal models, we developed an imaging-free stereotaxis and intraoperative electrophysiology methodology with custom silicon probes to precisely localize probe placement within the hippocampal laminar structure. We report for the first time the profile of single units and local field potentials in the pig dorsal hippocampus and relate them to a histological description. This characterization forms the basis for accessible translational pig models to study diseases of the central nervous system affecting hippocampal circuitry in the large animal gyrencephalic brain, as well as the groundwork for potential awake behaving neurophysiology of the porcine hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dynamic and Sex-Specific Changes in Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Neuron Activity and Excitability in a Mouse Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Reproductive endocrine disorders are prominent co-morbidities of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in both men and women. The neural mechanisms underlying these co-morbidities remain unclear, but hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons may be involved. Here we report the first direct demonstrations of aberrant GnRH neuron function in an animal model of epilepsy. Recordings of GnRH neuron firing and excitability were made in acute mouse brain slices prepared 2 months after intrahippocampal injection of kainate (KA) or control saline, a well-established TLE model in which most females develop co-morbid estrous cycle disruption. GnRH neurons from control females showed elevated firing and excitability on estrus compared with diestrus. By contrast, cells from KA-injected females that developed prolonged, disrupted estrous cycles (KA-long) showed the reverse pattern. Firing rates of cells from KA-injected females that maintained regular cycles (KA-regular) were not different from controls on diestrus, but were reduced on estrus. In KA-injected males, only GnRH neurons in the medial septum displayed elevated firing. In contrast to the diestrus-vs.-estrus and sex-specific changes in firing, GnRH neuron intrinsic excitability was elevated in all KA-injected groups, indicating a role for afferent synaptic and neuromodulatory inputs in shaping overall changes in firing activity. Furthermore, KA-injected females showed cycle-stage-specific changes in circulating sex steroids on diestrus and estrus that also differed between KA-long and KA-regular groups. Together, these findings reveal that the effects of epilepsy on the neural control of reproduction are dynamic across the estrous cycle, distinct in association with co-morbid estrous cycle disruption severity, and sex-specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; People with epilepsy are at higher risk of reproductive endocrine disorders compared with the general population, but the neural mechanisms linking epilepsy and these co-morbidities are unknown. Here we report changes in the function of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, which control fertility, in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. GnRH neurons from epileptic female mice showed changes in activity dependent on estrous cycle stage and associated with severity of cycle disruption. The impacts of epilepsy on GnRH neurons in males were less severe. These findings provide novel evidence for impacts of epilepsy on GnRH neuron function, and will thus be of clinical relevance in developing new strategies to ameliorate reproductive co-morbidities and to treat the underlying seizures and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Connectome of the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus: New evidence of the core-shell relationship</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A brain clock, constituted of ~20,000 peptidergically heterogeneous neurons, is located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). While many peptidergic cell types have been identified, little is known about the connections among these neurons in mice. We first sought to identify contacts among major peptidergic cell types in the SCN using triple-label fluorescent immunocytochemistry. To this end, contacts among vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), and calretinin (CALR) cells of the core, and arginine vasopressin (AVP) and met-enkephalin (ENK) cells of the shell were analyzed. Some core-to-shell and shell-to-core communications are specialized. We found that in wild-type mice, AVP fibers make extremely sparse contacts onto VIP neurons but contacts in the reverse direction are numerous. In contrast, AVP fibers make more contacts onto GRP neurons than conversely. For the other cell types tested, largely reciprocal connections are made. These results point to peptidergic cell type specific communications between core and shell SCN neurons. To further understand the impact of VIP-to-AVP communication, we next explored the SCN in VIP deficient mice (VIP-KO). In these animals, AVP expression is markedly reduced in the SCN, but it is not altered in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. Surprisingly, in VIP-KO mice, the number of AVP appositions onto other peptidergic cell types is not different from controls. Colchicine administration, which blocks AVP transport, restored numbers of AVP neurons to that of wild-type littermates. The results indicate that VIP has an important role in modulating AVP expression levels in the SCN in this mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement:&lt;/b&gt; The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) brain clock bears ~20,000 neurons of many peptidergic types. Numerous studies have focused broadly on the core- (VIP-rich) to shell (AVP-rich) areas, leaving aside questions of interconnections among specific peptidergic neuron types. Here we describe contacts between AVP, GRP, VIP, ENK, and CALR SCN peptidergic phenotypes in wild-type mice, and examine changes to these connections consequent to loss of the key core peptide, VIP. Thus, in the absence of VIP, expression of the shell peptide AVP was reduced. The work delineates interrelationships among specific SCN neurons and highlights a complexity in interpreting the consequences of single gene knockouts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Strategic and dynamic temporal weighting for perceptual decisions in humans and macaques</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Perceptual decision-making is often modeled as the accumulation of sensory evidence over time. Recent studies using psychophysical reverse correlation have shown that even though the sensory evidence is stationary over time, subjects may exhibit a time-varying weighting strategy, weighting some stimulus epochs more heavily than others. While previous work has explained time-varying weighting as a consequence of static decision mechanisms (e.g., decision bound or leak), here we show that time-varying weighting can reflect strategic adaptation to stimulus statistics, and thus can readily take a number of forms. We characterized the temporal weighting strategies of humans and macaques performing a motion discrimination task in which the amount of information carried by motion stimulus was manipulated over time. Both species could adapt their temporal weighting strategy to match the time-varying statistics of the sensory stimulus. When early stimulus epochs had higher mean motion strength than late, subjects adopted a pronounced early weighting strategy, where early information was weighted more heavily in guiding perceptual decisions. When the mean motion strength was greater in later stimulus epochs, in contrast, subjects shifted to a marked late-weighting strategy. These results demonstrate that perceptual decisions involve a temporally flexible weighting process in both humans and monkeys, and introduce a paradigm with which to manipulate sensory stimuli in decision-making tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; During decision-making, the weight assigned by subjects to sensory information over time is not necessarily constant. Such time-varying weighting is often interpreted as a signature of a particular decision-making model (e.g., higher weighting of early stimulus information is consistent with a bounded accumulation process). Temporal weighting may also result, however, from a strategic reweighting of the stimulus evidence itself that takes place before and/or independent of a decision-making mechanism. Here we use a psychophysical reverse correlation paradigm to both measure and manipulate temporal weighting behavior. We demonstrate that both humans and macaques adopt weighting strategies that are flexible, consistent with dynamic reweighing of the sensory stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Characterizing functional brain networks and emotional centers based on Rasa theory of Indian aesthetics. (arXiv:1809.05336v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In Indian history of arts, Rasas are the aesthetics associated with any
auditory, visual, literary or musical piece of art that evokes highly
orchestrated emotional states. In this work, we study the functional response
of the brain to movie clippings meant to evoke the Rasas through network
analysis. We extract functional brain networks using coherence measures on EEG
recordings of film clips from popular Indian Bollywood movies representing nine
Rasas in the Indian Natyasastra. Structural and functional network measures
were computed for these brain networks, averaging over a range of significant
edge weights, in different brainwave frequency bands. We identify segregation
of neuronal wiring in the brain into modules using a community detection
algorithm. Further, using mutual information measure, we compare and contrast
the modular organizations of brain network corresponding to different Rasas.
Hubs identified using centrality measure reveal the network nodes that are
central to information propagation across all Rasas. We also observe that the
functional connectivity is suppressed when high-frequency waves such as beta
and gamma are dominant in the brain. The significant links causing differences
between the Rasa pairs are extracted statistically.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Extended temporal association memory by inhibitory Hebbian learning. (arXiv:1809.05254v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05254</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hebbian learning of excitatory synapses plays a central role in storing
activity patterns in associative memory models. Furthermore, interstimulus
Hebbian learning associates multiple items in the brain by converting temporal
correlation to spatial correlation between attractors. However, growing
experimental evidence suggests that learning of inhibitory synapses creates
&quot;inhibitory engrams&quot;, which presumably balance with the patterns encoded in the
excitatory network. Controlling inhibitory engrams may modify the behavior of
associative memory in neural networks, but the consequence of such control has
not been theoretically understood. Noting that Hebbian learning of inhibitory
synapses yields an anti-Hebbian effect, we show that the combination of Hebbian
and anti-Hebbian learning can increase the span of temporal association between
the correlated attractors. The balance of targetted and global inhibition
regulates this span of association in the network. Our results suggest a
nontrivial role of anti-Hebbian learning and inhibitory engrams in associative
memory.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05196</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;For the Research Topic Data Assimilation and Control: Theory and Applications
in Life Sciences we first review the formulation of statistical data
assimilation (SDA) and discuss algorithms for exploring variational
approximations to the conditional expected values of biophysical aspects of
functional neural circuits. Then we report on the application of SDA to (1) the
exploration of properties of individual neurons in the HVC nucleus of the avian
song system, and (2) characterizing individual neurons formulated as very large
scale integration (VLSI) analog circuits with a goal of building functional,
biophysically realistic, VLSI representations of functional nervous systems.
Networks of neurons pose a substantially greater challenge, and we comment on
formulating experiments to probe the properties, especially the functional
connectivity, in song command circuits within HVC.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The microtubule polymerase Stu2 promotes oligomerization of the γ-TuSC for cytoplasmic microtubule nucleation</title>

	<description>Stu2/XMAP215/ZYG-9/Dis1/Alp14/Msps/ch-TOG family members nucleate microtubules together with γ-tubulin complexes. However, we know little about the interplay of these nucleation factors. Here, we show that the budding yeast Stu2 in complex with the γ-tubulin receptor Spc72 nucleates microtubules &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; without the small γ-tubulin complex (γ-TuSC). Upon γ-TuSC addition, Stu2 facilitates Spc72-γ-TuSC interaction by binding to Spc72 and γ-TuSC. Stu2 together with Spc72-γ-TuSC increases microtubule nucleation depended on the TOG domains of Stu2. Importantly, these activities are also important for microtubule nucleation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Stu2 stabilizes Spc72-γ-TuSC at the minus end of cytoplasmic microtubules (cMTs) and an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; assay indicates that cMT nucleation requires the TOG domains of Stu2. Upon γ-tubulin depletion, we observed efficient cMT nucleation away from the SPB, which was dependent on Stu2. Thus, γ-TuSC restricts cMT assembly to the SPB while Stu2 nucleates cMTs together with γ-TuSC and stabilizes γ-TuSC at the cMT minus end.</description>

	<description>Changes in the efficacies of synapses are thought to be the neurobiological basis of learning and memory. The efficacy of a synapse depends on its current number of neurotransmitter receptors. Recent experiments have shown that these receptors are highly dynamic, moving back and forth between synapses on time scales of seconds and minutes. This suggests spontaneous fluctuations in synaptic efficacies and a competition of nearby synapses for available receptors. Here we propose a mathematical model of this competition of synapses for neurotransmitter receptors from a local dendritic pool. Using minimal assumptions, the model produces a fast multiplicative scaling behavior of synapses. Furthermore, the model explains a transient form of heterosynaptic plasticity and predicts that its amount is inversely related to the size of the local receptor pool. Overall, our model reveals logistical tradeoffs during the induction of synaptic plasticity due to the rapid exchange of neurotransmitter receptors between synapses.</description>

	<description>Reward is often employed as reinforcement in behavioral paradigms but it is unclear how the visuospatial aspect of a stimulus-reward association affects the cortical representation of visual space. Using a head-fixed paradigm, we conditioned mice to associate the same visual pattern in adjacent retinotopic regions with availability and absence of reward. Time-lapse intrinsic optical signal imaging under anesthesia showed that conditioning increased the spatial separation of mesoscale cortical representations of reward predicting- and non-reward predicting stimuli. Subsequent in vivo two-photon calcium imaging revealed that this improved separation correlated with enhanced population coding for retinotopic location, specifically for the trained orientation and spatially confined to the V1 region where rewarded and non-rewarded stimulus representations bordered. These results are corroborated by conditioning-induced differences in the correlation structure of population activity. Thus, the cortical representation of visual space is sharpened as consequence of associative stimulus-reward learning while the overall retinotopic map remains unaltered.</description>

	<description>Human gut &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/i&gt; use surface-exposed lipoproteins to bind and metabolize complex polysaccharides. Although vitamins and other nutrients are also essential for commensal fitness, much less is known about how commensal bacteria compete with each other or the host for these critical resources. Unlike in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, transport loci for vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (cobalamin) and other corrinoids in human gut &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/i&gt; are replete with conserved genes encoding proteins whose functions are unknown. Here we report that one of these proteins, BtuG, is a surface-exposed lipoprotein that is essential for efficient B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; transport in &lt;i&gt;B. thetaiotaomicron.&lt;/i&gt; BtuG binds B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; with femtomolar affinity and can remove B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; from intrinsic factor, a critical B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; transport protein in humans. Our studies suggest that &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/i&gt; use surface-exposed lipoproteins not only for capturing polysaccharides, but also to acquire key vitamins in the gut.</description>

	<description>Misregulation of the signaling axis formed by the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) EphA2 and its ligand, ephrinA1, causes aberrant cell-cell contacts that contribute to metastasis. Solid tumors are characterized by an acidic extracellular medium. We intend to take advantage of this tumor feature to design new molecules that specifically target tumors. We created a novel pH-dependent transmembrane peptide, TYPE7, by altering the sequence of the transmembrane domain of EphA2. TYPE7 is highly soluble and interacts with the surface of lipid membranes at neutral pH, while acidity triggers transmembrane insertion. TYPE7 binds to endogenous EphA2 and reduces Akt phosphorylation and cell migration as effectively as ephrinA1. Interestingly, we found large differences in juxtamembrane tyrosine phosphorylation and the extent of EphA2 clustering when compared TYPE7 with activation by ephrinA1. This work shows that it is possible to design new pH-triggered membrane peptides to activate RTK and gain insights on its activation mechanism.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Non-rhythmic head-direction cells in the parahippocampal region are not constrained by attractor network dynamics</title>

	<description>Computational models postulate that head-direction (HD) cells are part of an attractor network integrating head turns. This network requires inputs from visual landmarks to anchor the HD signal to the external world. We investigated whether information about HD and visual landmarks is integrated in the medial entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum, resulting in neurons expressing a conjunctive code for HD and visual landmarks. We found that parahippocampal HD cells could be divided into two classes based on their theta-rhythmic activity: non-rhythmic and theta-rhythmic HD cells. Manipulations of the visual landmarks caused tuning curve alterations in most HD cells, with the largest visually driven changes observed in non-rhythmic HD cells. Importantly, the tuning modifications of non-rhythmic HD cells were often non-coherent across cells, refuting the notion that attractor-like dynamics control non-rhythmic HD cells. These findings reveal a new population of non-rhythmic HD cells whose malleable organization is controlled by visual landmarks.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33617</link>
	<description>One challenge in biology is to make sense of the complexity of biological networks. A good system to approach this is signaling pathways, whose well-characterized molecular details allow us to relate the internal processes of each pathway to their input-output behavior. In this study, we analyzed mathematical models of three metazoan signaling pathways: the canonical Wnt, ERK, and Tgfβ pathways. We find an unexpected convergence: the three pathways behave in some physiological contexts as linear signal transmitters. Testing the results experimentally, we present direct measurements of linear input-output behavior in the Wnt and ERK pathways. Analytics from each model further reveal that linearity arises through different means in each pathway, which we tested experimentally in the Wnt and ERK pathways. Linearity is a desired property in engineering where it facilitates fidelity and superposition in signal transmission. Our findings illustrate how cells tune different complex networks to converge on the same behavior.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/30325</link>
	<description>Following CNS demyelination, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are able to differentiate into either remyelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) or remyelinating Schwann cells (SCs). However, the signals that determine which type of remyelinating cell is generated and the underlying mechanisms involved have not been identified. Here, we show that distinctive microenvironments created in discrete niches within demyelinated white matter determine fate decisions of adult OPCs. By comparative transcriptome profiling we demonstrate that an ectopic, injury-induced perivascular niche is enriched with secreted ligands of the BMP and Wnt signalling pathways, produced by activated OPCs and endothelium, whereas reactive astrocyte within non-vascular area express the dual BMP/Wnt antagonist Sostdc1. The balance of BMP/Wnt signalling network is instructive for OPCs to undertake fate decision shortly after their activation: disruption of the OPCs homeostasis during demyelination results in BMP4 upregulation, which, in the absence of Socstdc1, favours SCs differentiation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The speed-accuracy tradeoff reveals flexible access to accumulating sensory evidence during human decision making</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/420430v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/420430v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Decisions made about identical perceptual stimuli can be radically different under changing task demands. For example, the need to make a fast decision undermines the accuracy of that decision, a well-documented effect termed the speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT). Models of the SAT are generally based on theories of decision making in which responses are triggered only after sensory evidence accumulation terminates at a set threshold. Within this accumulate-to-bound framework, speed pressure operates by lowering the response threshold, allowing for faster responses at the expense of accumulated sensory evidence. To empirically examine the mechanisms necessary for adaptively adjusting the speed and accuracy of decisions, we used an event-related potential that indexes sensory evidence accumulation in the human brain. Instead of lowering response thresholds, we found that speed pressure adaptively shifts responses to occur close to where the rate of evidence accumulation peaks. Moreover, responses are not triggered automatically by the termination of the accumulation process, as sensory evidence continues to build after speeded decisions. Together these results suggest that response processes adaptively access accumulating sensory evidence depending on task demands and support parallel over serial models of decision making.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A TauP301L mouse model of dementia; development of pathology, synaptic transmission, microglial response and cognition throughout life</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/420398v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/420398v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Late stage Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are associated with neurofibrillary tangles and neurodegeneration. Here we describe a mouse (TauD35) carrying human Tau with the P301L mutation that results in Tau hyperphosphorylation and tangles. Previously we have compared gene expression in TauD35 mice to mice which develop plaques but no tangles. A similar comparison of other pathological features throughout disease progression is made here between amyloid{beta} and Tau mice. Methods: In vitro CA1 patch clamp and field recordings were used to investigate synaptic transmission and plasticity. Plaque load and microglia were investigated with immunohistochemistry. Cognition, locomotor activity and anxiety-related behaviours were assessed with a forced-alternation T-maze, open field and light/dark box. Results: Transgene copy number in TauD35 mice fell into two groups (HighTAU and LowTAU), allowing assessment of dose-dependent effects of overexpression and resulting in tangle load increasing 100-fold for a 2-fold change in protein levels. Tangles were first detected at 8 (HighTAU) or 13 months (LowTAU) but the effects on synaptic transmission and plasticity and behaviour were subtle. However severe neurodegeneration occurred in HighTAU mice at around 17 months preceded by considerable proliferation but little additional activation of microglia. Proliferation only started as neurodegeneration began at 13 months. Similarly to HighTau mice at 13 months of age, LowTAU mice at 24 months of age showed a comparable tangle load and microglial proliferation. However, LowTAU mice showed no neurodegeneration at this stage and considerable microglial activation, stressing the dependence of these effects on overexpression and/or age. Conclusions: Comparison of the effects of amyloid{beta} and plaques without tangles in a model of preclinical Alzheimer's disease to the effects of tangles without amyloid{beta} plaques in the late stage model described here may clarify the progressive stages of Alzheimer's disease. While Tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangles are eventually sufficient to cause severe neurodegeneration, initial effects on synaptic transmission and the immune response are subtle. In contrast while even with a heavy plaque load little if any neurodegeneration occurs, considerable effects on synaptic transmission and the immune system result, even before plaques are detectable.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Effects of rising amyloid{beta} on hippocampal synaptic transmission, microglial response and cognition in APPSwe/PSEN1M146V transgenic mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/420349v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/420349v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Progression of Alzheimer's disease is thought initially to depend on rising amyloid{beta} and its synaptic interactions. Transgenic mice (TASTPM; APPSwe/PSEN1M146V) show altered synaptic transmission, compatible with increased physiological function of amyloid{beta}, before plaques are detected. Recently, the importance of microglia has become apparent in the human disease. Similarly, TASTPM show a close association of plaque load with upregulated microglial genes. Methods: CA1 Synaptic transmission and plasticity were investigated using in vitro electrophysiology. Migroglial relationship to plaques was examined with immunohistochemistry. Behaviour was assessed with a forced-alternation T-maze, open field, light/dark box and elevated plus maze. Findings: The most striking finding is the early proliferation of microglia in TASTPM, which, like synaptic changes, begins before plaques are detected. Further proliferation and activation of microglia occur later, concurrent with development of larger plaques. Long-term potentiation is initially enhanced at pre-plaque stages but decrements with the initial appearance of plaques. Finally, despite altered plasticity, TASTPM have little cognitive deficit, even with a heavy plaque load, although they show altered non-cognitive behaviours. Interpretation: The pre-plaque synaptic changes and microglial proliferation are presumably related to low, non-toxic amyloid{beta} levels in the general neuropil and not directly associated with plaques. However, as plaques grow, microglia proliferate further, clustering around plaques and activating. Like in humans, when plaque load is heavy, before development of neurofibrillary tangles and neurodegeneration, these alterations do not result in cognitive deficits. Behaviours are seen that could be consistent with pre-diagnosis changes in the human condition.</description>

	<description>Math and reading involve distributed brain networks and learning disabilities associated with these skills have a high rate of co-occurrence. However, it is unknown what are shared vs. dissociated white matter substrates of math and reading networks. Here we address this question using an innovative, multimodal approach applying functional MRI, diffusion MRI, and quantitative MRI to define these networks and evaluate structural properties of their fascicles. Results reveal that the superior longitudinal (SLF) and arcuate (AF) fascicles are shared between math and reading networks. Strikingly, within these fascicles, reading- and math-related tracts are segregated into parallel sub-bundles and show structural differences related to myelination. These novel findings: (i) open a new avenue of research enabling linkage of sub-bundles within fascicles to behavior and (ii) may explain both isolated and comorbid cases of math and reading disabilities, which may be associated with white matter abnormalities within sub-bundles or entire fascicles, respectively.</description>

	<description>When we think of our family and friends, we probably know someone who is good at finding their way and someone else that easily get lost. We still know little about the biological and envi-ronmental factors that influence our navigational ability. Here, we investigated the frequency and sociodemographic determinants of wayfinding and their association with vestibular function in a representative cross-sectional sample (N = 783) of the adult German-speaking population. Way-finding was assessed using the Wayfinding Strategy Scale, a self-report scale that produces two scores for each participant representing to what degree they rely on route-based or orientation (map-based) strategies. We were interested in the following research questions: (1) the frequen-cy and determinants of wayfinding strategies in a population-based representative sample, (2) the relationship between vestibular function and strategy choice and (3) how sociodemographic factors influence general wayfinding ability as measured using a combined score from both strategy scores. Our linear regression models showed that being male, having a higher education, higher age and lower regional urbanization increased orientation strategy scores. Verti-go/dizziness reduced the scores of both the orientation and the route strategies. Using a novel approach, we grouped participants by their combined strategy scores in a multinomial regression model, to see whether individuals prefer one strategy over the other. The majority of individuals reported using either both or no strategy, instead of preferring one strategy over the other. Young age and reduced vestibular function were indicative of using no strategy. In summary, wayfinding ability depends on both biological and environmental factors; all sociodemographic factors except income. Over a third of the population, predominantly under the age of 35, does not successfully use either strategy. This represents a change in our wayfinding skills, which may result from the technological advances in navigational aids over the last few decades.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/419978v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We describe construction and phenotypic analysis of a human embryonic stem cell model of progressive A?-dependent neurodegeneration (ND) with potential relevance to Alzheimers disease (AD). We modified one allele of the normal APP locus to directly express a secretory form of A?40 or A?42, eliminating the need for amyloidogenic APP proteolysis. Following neuronal differentiation edited cell lines specifically accumulate aggregated/oligomeric A?, exhibit a synaptic deficit and have an abnormal accumulation of endolysosomal vesicles. Edited cultures progress to a stage of overt ND. All phenotypes appear at earlier culture times for A?42 relative to A?40. Whole transcriptome RNA-Seq analysis identified 23 up and 70 down regulated genes (DEGs) with similar directional fold change but larger absolute values in the A?42 samples suggesting common underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Pathway/annotation analysis suggested that down regulation of extracellular matrix and cilia functions are significantly overrepresented. This cellular model could be useful for uncovering mechanisms directly linking A? to neuronal death and as a tool to screen for new therapeutic agents that slow or prevent human ND.</description>

	<description>While previous studies have revealed an extended network of cortical regions associated with motor sequence production, the specific role of each of these areas is still elusive. To address this issue, we designed a novel behavioural paradigm that allowed us to experimentally manipulate the structure of motor sequences representations in individual participants. We then conducted fMRI while participants executed 8 trained sequences to examine how this structure is reflected in the associated activity patterns. Both model-based and model-free approaches revealed a clear distinction between primary and non-primary motor cortices in their representational contents, with M1 specifically representing individual finger movements, and premotor and parietal cortices showing a mixture of chunk, sequence and finger transition representations. Using model-free representational parcellation, we could divide these non-primary motor cortices into separate clusters, each with a unique representation along the stimulus-to-action gradient. These results provide new insights into how human neocortex organizes movement sequences.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Age-differences in functional asymmetry during memory retrieval revisited: no evidence for contralateral over-activation or compensation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/419739v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Brain asymmetry is inherent to cognitive processing and seems to reflect processing efficiency. Lower frontal asymmetry is often observed in older adults during memory retrieval, yet it is unclear whether lower asymmetry implies an age-related increase in contralateral recruitment, whether less asymmetry reflects compensation, is limited to frontal regions, or predicts neurocognitive stability or decline. We assessed age-differences in asymmetry across the entire cerebral cortex, using fMRI data from 89 young and 76 older adults during associative retrieval, and surface-based methods that allowed direct homotopic comparison of activity between hemispheres. An extensive left-asymmetric network facilitated retrieval in both young and older adults, whereas diverse frontal and parietal regions exhibited lower asymmetry in older adults. However, lower asymmetry was not associated with age-related increases in contralateral recruitment, but primarily reflected either less deactivation in contralateral regions reliably signalling retrieval failure in the young, or lower recruitment of the dominant hemisphere. Lower asymmetry neither predicted current memory performance, nor the extent of memory change across the preceding ~8 years in older adults. Together, these findings are inconsistent with a compensation account for lower asymmetry during retrieval and aging, suggesting that patterns indicative of decline may drive lower asymmetry in older brains.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Bayesian Inference of Other Minds Explains Human Decisions in a Group Decision Making Task</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/419515v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/419515v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>To make decisions in a social context, humans try to predict the behavior of others, an ability that is thought to rely on having a model of other minds. Having such a model, known as a &quot;theory of mind,&quot; allows one to infer the intentions of others, simulate their beliefs, and predict their possible actions, taking into account the fact that others too have a similar theory of mind. Here we show that Bayesian inference of other minds explains human decisions in a group decision making task known as the Volunteer's Dilemma. Our Bayesian model incorporates the effect of one's own actions on future rewards that could accrue to the social group one belongs to. Quantitative results from our normative model of human social decision making suggest that humans maintain a model of other minds and use this model to infer the future actions of others when deciding on their current action. We show that our model explains human data significantly better than model-free reinforcement learning and other previous models.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Deciphering defective subventricular adult neurogenesis in cyclin D2-deficient mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/419382v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Adult neurogenesis occurring in the brain of adult mammals is considered to have potential therapeutical applications. New neurons are produced constitutively from postnatal neural stem cells/precursors residing in two neurogenic regions: the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular layer in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Newly-generated neuroblasts from the SVZ migrate long distance towards the olfactory bulb and repopulate different subtypes of inhibitory interneurons modulating the olfactory processing. It was reported that cyclin D2 knockout mice (cD2-KO) present reduced generation of new hippocampal neurons, however proliferation deficiency and mechanisms responsible for dysregulation of subventricular precursors, derived progenitors, and olfactory interneurons need to be detaily investigated. In this report, proliferative activity of different subpopulations of SVZ neural precursors, cell migration, and differentiation in cD2-KO mice was characterized. For that goal, EdU, a thymidine analogue, proliferation mapping combined with multi-epitope immunohisto-chemical detection of endogenous stage-specific cell markers was carried out. Severely reduced number of newly-generated cells in the subventricular niche was demonstrated that was not accompanied by increased level of apoptotic death. Surprisingly, the number of B1 quiescent precursor subpopulation was not affected, whereas the number of B1 type active primary precursors, intermediate/transien-tly-amplifying progenitors (C type cells), and neuroblasts (A type cells) were reduced. The analyses suggest that cycline D2 might be critical for transition of B1 precursor quiescent cells into B1 active cells. We also demonstrate that the subpopulation of calbindin interneurons is reduced in the olfactory bulb. Deciphering processes underlying a potential modulation of intensity of adult neurogenesis at the cellular levels could lead to replacement therapies after injury, stroke, or neurodegenerative disease in the central nervous system.</description>

Risk of cardiovascular associated death in dialysis patients is the highest among all other co-morbidities. Improving the identification of patients with the highest cardiovascular risk to design an adequate treatment is, therefore, of utmost importance. There are several non-invasive cardiovascular state biomarkers based on the pulse (pressure) wave propagation properties, but their major determinants are not fully understood. In the current study we aimed to provide a framework to precisely dissect the information available in non-invasively recorded pulse wave in hemodialysis patients. Radial pressure wave profiles were recorded before, during and after two independent hemodialysis sessions in 35 anuric prevalent hemodialysis patients and once in a group of 32 healthy volunteers. Each recording was used to estimate six subject-specific parameters of pulse wave propagation model. Pressure profiles were also analyzed using SphygmoCor software (AtCor Medical, Australia) to derive values of already established biomarkers, i.e. augmentation index and sub-endocardial viability ratio (SEVR). Data preprocessing using propensity score matching allowed to compare hemodialysis and healthy groups. Augmentation index remained on average stable at 142 ± 28% during dialysis and had similar values in both considered groups. SEVR, whose pre-dialytic value was on average lower by 12% compared to healthy participants, was improved by hemodialysis, with post-dialytic values indistinguishable from those in healthy population (p-value &amp;gt; 0.2). The model, however, identified that the patients on hemodialysis had significantly increased stiffness of both large and small arteries compared to healthy counterparts (&amp;gt; 60% before dialysis with p-value &amp;lt; 0.05 or borderline) and that it was only transiently decreased during hemodialysis session. Additionally, correlation-based clustering revealed that augmentation index reflects the shape of heart ejection profile and SEVR is associated with stiffness of larger arteries. Patient-specific pulse wave propagation modeling coupled with radial pressure profile recording correctly identified increased arterial stiffness in hemodialysis patients, while regular pulse wave analysis based biomarkers failed to show significant differences. Further model testing in larger populations and investigating other biomarkers are needed to confirm these findings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VcZwPiWd-zE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Computational models predicting symptomatic progression at the individual level can be highly beneficial for early intervention and treatment planning for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Individual prognosis is complicated by many factors including the definition of the prediction objective itself. In this work, we present a computational framework comprising machine-learning techniques for 1) modeling symptom trajectories and 2) prediction of symptom trajectories using multimodal and longitudinal data. We perform primary analyses on three cohorts from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and a replication analysis using subjects from Australian Imaging, Biomarker &amp;amp; Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL). We model the prototypical symptom trajectory classes using clinical assessment scores from mini-mental state exam (MMSE) and Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-13) at nine timepoints spanned over six years based on a hierarchical clustering approach. Subsequently we predict these trajectory classes for a given subject using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, genetic, and clinical variables from two timepoints (baseline + follow-up). For prediction, we present a longitudinal Siamese neural-network (LSN) with novel architectural modules for combining multimodal data from two timepoints. The trajectory modeling yields two (stable and decline) and three (stable, slow-decline, fast-decline) trajectory classes for MMSE and ADAS-13 assessments, respectively. For the predictive tasks, LSN offers highly accurate performance with 0.900 accuracy and 0.968 AUC for binary MMSE task and 0.760 accuracy for 3-way ADAS-13 task on ADNI datasets, as well as, 0.724 accuracy and 0.883 AUC for binary MMSE task on replication AIBL dataset.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RcadvnqgjYY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Small GTP converting enzymes, GTPases, are essential for the efficient completion of many physiological and developmental processes. They are regulated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39&lt;/i&gt;, also known as preoptic regulatory factor-2 (Porf-2) or Vilse, a member of the Rho GAP group, was first identified in 1990 in the rat CNS. It has since been shown to regulate apoptosis, cell migration, neurogenesis and cerebral and hippocampal dendritic spine morphology. It plays a pivotal role in neurodevelopment and learning and memory. Homologous or orthologous genes are found in over 280 vertebrate and invertebrate species suggesting preservation through evolution. Not surprisingly, loss of the &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; gene in mice manifests as an embryonic lethal condition. Although &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; is highly expressed in the brain, it is also widely distributed throughout the body, with potential additional roles in oncogenesis and morphogenesis. This review summarizes, for the first time, the known information about this gene under its various names, in addition to considering its transcripts and proteins. The majority of findings described have been made in rats, mice, humans and fruit flies. This work surveys the known functions, functional mediators, variables modifying expression and upstream regulators of expression, and potential physiological and pathological roles of &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This review comprehensively includes what is currently known about &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; under its multiple names. Arhgap39 is a critically required molecule for neurodevelopment, learning and memory that is expressed throughout the lifespan. It also has definitive roles in stem cell fate and cell migration, apoptosis and proliferation, in both neural and non-neural sites. Homologous or orthologous genes have been conserved for millennia through evolution with a wide phylogenetic distribution from invertebrates to mammals. Its expression is exquisitely regulated by age, sex, location and hormones. The consequences of dysregulation of &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39&lt;/i&gt; are currently under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Promoter-based genetic recombination (via, e.g., Cre-lox) is most useful when all cells of interest express a particular gene. The discovery that the actin-binding protein advillin is expressed in all somatic sensory neurons has been exploited repeatedly to drive DNA recombination therein, yet specificity of expression has not been well demonstrated. Here, we characterize advillin expression amongst sensory neurons and in several other neural and non-neural tissues. We first validate an advillin antibody against advillin knock-out tissue, advillin promoter-driven EGFP, and advillin mRNA expression. In the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), advillin is enriched in non-peptidergic nociceptors. We also show that advillin expression, and advillin promotor-driven EGFP and Cre-recombinase expression, occurs in multiple tissues including the dorsal habenula of the epithalamus, endocrine cells of the gut, Merkel cells in the skin, and most strikingly, throughout the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric neurons) in mice, rats, and non-human primates. In the mouse pelvic ganglion, advillin immunoreactivity is most intense in pairs of small neurons, and concentrated in spine-like structures on the axon initial segment contacted by sympathetic preganglionic axons. In autonomic targets (iris and blood vessels), advillin is distributed along cholinergic parasympathetic axons and in sympathetic varicosities. Developmentally, advillin expression is absent from sympathetics at postnatal day 4 but begins to emerge by day 7, accounting for previous reports (based on embryonic expression) of advillin’s specificity to sensory neurons. These results indicate that caution is warranted in interpreting previous studies in which advillin-driven genomic editing is either constitutive or performed after postnatal day 4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Pharmacoresistant epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in which increased neuronal intrinsic excitability and synaptic excitation lead to pathologically synchronous behavior in the brain. In the majority of experimental and theoretical epilepsy models, epilepsy is associated with reduced inhibition in the pathological neural circuits, yet effects of intrinsic excitability are usually not explicitly analyzed. Here we present a novel neural mass model that includes intrinsic excitability in the form of spike-frequency adaptation in the excitatory population. We validated our model using local field potential data recorded from human hippocampal/subicular slices. We found that synaptic conductances and slow adaptation in the excitatory population both play essential roles for generating seizures and pre-ictal oscillations. Using bifurcation analysis, we found that transitions towards seizure and back to the resting state take place via Andronov-Hopf bifurcations. These simulations therefore suggest that single neuron adaptation as well as synaptic inhibition are responsible for orchestrating seizure dynamics and transition towards the epileptic state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Epileptic seizures are commonly thought to arise from a pathology of inhibition in the brain circuits. Theoretical models aiming to explain epileptic oscillations usually describe the neural activity solely in terms of inhibition and excitation. Single neuron adaptation properties are usually assumed to have only a limited contribution to seizure dynamics. To explore this issue, we developed a novel neural mass model with adaption in the excitatory population. By including adaptation together with inhibition in this model, we were able to account for several experimentally observed properties of seizures, resting state dynamics, and pre-ictal oscillations, leading to improved understanding of epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Foraging as an evidence accumulation process. (arXiv:1809.05023v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05023</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05023</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A canonical foraging task is the patch-leaving problem, in which a forager
must decide to leave a current resource in search for another. Theoretical work
has derived optimal strategies for when to leave a patch, and experiments have
tested for conditions where animals do or do not follow an optimal strategy.
Nevertheless, models of patch-leaving decisions do not consider the imperfect
and noisy sampling process through which an animal gathers information, and how
this process is constrained by neurobiological mechanisms. In this theoretical
study, we formulate an evidence accumulation model of patch-leaving decisions
where the animal averages over noisy measurements to estimate the state of the
current patch and the overall environment. Evidence accumulation models belong
to the class of drift diffusion processes and have been used to model decision
making in different contexts. We solve the model for conditions where foraging
decisions are optimal and equivalent to the marginal value theorem, and perform
simulations to analyze deviations from optimal when these conditions are not
met. By adjusting the drift rate and decision threshold, the model can
represent different strategies, for example an increment-decrement or counting
strategy. These strategies yield identical decisions in the limiting case but
differ in how patch residence times adapt when the foraging environment is
uncertain. To account for sub-optimal decisions, we introduce an
energy-dependent utility function that predicts longer than optimal patch
residence times when food is plentiful. Our model provides a quantitative
connection between ecological models of foraging behavior and evidence
accumulation models of decision making. Moreover, it provides a theoretical
framework for potential experiments which seek to identify neural circuits
underlying patch leaving decisions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Cluster Burst Synchronization in A Scale-Free Network of Inhibitory Bursting Neurons. (arXiv:1809.04953v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04953</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04953</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider a scale-free network of inhibitory Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) bursting
neurons, and investigate coupling-induced burst synchronization by varying the
average coupling strength $J_0$. When passing a lower threshold $J^*_l$, a
transition from desynchronization to 3-cluster burst synchronization occurs due
to a constructive role of inhibition to favor the cluster burst
synchronization. For this case, the whole population is segregated into 3
clusters, and HR neurons in each cluster exhibit burst synchronization.
However, as $J_0$ is increased and passes an intermediate threshold $J^*_m$, HR
neurons begin to make intermittent hoppings between the 3 clusters. Due to the
intermittent intercluster hoppings, the 3 clusters are integrated into a single
one. In spite of break-up of the 3 clusters, burst synchronization persists in
the whole population, which is well visualized in the raster plot of burst
onset times where bursting stripes (composed of burst onset times and
indicating burst synchronization) appear successively. With further increase in
$J_0$, intercluster hoppings are intensified, and bursting stripes also become
smeared more and more due to a destructive role of inhibition to spoil the
burst synchronization. Eventually, when passing a higher threshold $J^*_h$ a
transition to desynchronization occurs via complete overlap between the
bursting stripes. Finally, we also investigate the effects of stochastic noise
on both 3-cluster burst synchronization and intercluster hoppings.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Bifurcation analysis of the dynamics of interacting populations of spiking networks. (arXiv:1809.04877v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04877</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04877</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We analyze the collective dynamics of hierarchically structured networks of
densely connected spiking neurons. These networks of sub-networks may represent
interactions between cell assemblies or different nuclei in the brain. The
dynamical activity pattern that results from these interactions depends on the
strength of synaptic coupling between them. Importantly, the overall dynamics
of a brain region in the absence of external input, so called ongoing brain
activity, has been attributed to the dynamics of such interactions. In our
study, two different network scenarios are considered: a system with one
inhibitory and two excitatory sub-networks, and a network representation with
three inhibitory sub-networks. To study the effect of synaptic strength on the
global dynamics of the network, two parameters for relative couplings between
these sub-networks are considered. For each case, a co-dimension two
bifurcation analysis is performed and the results have been compared to
large-scale network simulations. Our analysis shows that Generalized
Lotka-Volterra (GLV) equations, well-known in predator-prey studies, yield a
meaningful population-level description for the collective behavior of spiking
neuronal interaction, which have a hierarchical structure. In particular, we
observed a striking equivalence between the bifurcation diagrams of spiking
neuronal networks and their corresponding GLV equations. This study gives new
insight on the behavior of neuronal assemblies, and can potentially suggest new
mechanisms for altering the dynamical patterns of spiking networks based on
changing the synaptic strength between some groups of neurons.

In Bangladesh, the poultry industry is an economically and socially important sector, but it is persistently threatened by the effects of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza. Thus, identifying the optimal control policy in response to an emerging disease outbreak is a key challenge for policy-makers. To inform this aim, a common approach is to carry out simulation studies comparing plausible strategies, while accounting for known capacity restrictions. In this study we perform simulations of a previously developed H5N1 influenza transmission model framework, fitted to two separate historical outbreaks, to assess specific control objectives related to the burden or duration of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry farms in the Dhaka division of Bangladesh. In particular, we explore the optimal implementation of ring culling, ring vaccination and active surveillance measures when presuming disease transmission predominately occurs from premises-to-premises, versus a setting requiring the inclusion of external factors. Additionally, we determine the sensitivity of the management actions under consideration to differing levels of capacity constraints and outbreaks with disparate transmission dynamics. While we find that reactive culling and vaccination policies should pay close attention to these factors to ensure intervention targeting is optimised, across multiple settings the top performing control action amongst those under consideration were targeted proactive surveillance schemes. Our findings may advise the type of control measure, plus its intensity, that could potentially be applied in the event of a developing outbreak of H5N1 amongst originally H5N1 virus-free commercially-reared poultry in the Dhaka division of Bangladesh.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZiihqPruFqU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Integrated Information Theory (IIT) has become nowadays the most sensible general theory of consciousness. In addition to very important statements, it opens the door for an abstract (mathematical) formulation of the theory. Given a mechanism in a particular state, IIT identifies a conscious experience with a conceptual structure, an informational object which exists, is composed of identified parts, is informative, integrated and maximally irreducible. This paper introduces a space-time continuous version of the concept of integrated information. To this aim, a graph and a dynamical systems treatment is used to define, for a given mechanism in a state for which a dynamics is settled, an &lt;i&gt;Informational Structure&lt;/i&gt;, which is associated to the global attractor at each time of the system. By definition, the informational structure determines all the past and future behavior of the system, possesses an informational nature and, moreover, enriches all the points of the phase space with cause-effect power by means of its associated Informational Field. A detailed description of its inner structure by invariants and connections between them allows to associate a transition probability matrix to each informational structure and to develop a measure for the level of integrated information of the system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dzzK7PEMzuo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Cell cryopreservation improves reproducibility and enables flexibility in experimental design. Although conventional freezing methodologies have been used to preserve primary neurons, poor cell viability and reduced survival severely limited their utility. We screened several high-performance freezing media, and found that CryoStor®10 (CS10) provided superior cryoprotection to primary mouse embryonic cortical neurons compared to other commercially-available or traditional reagents, permitting the recovery of 68.8% of cells relative to a fresh dissection. We characterized developmental, morphometric and functional indicators of neuron maturation, and found that, without exception, neurons recovered from cryostorage in CS10 media faithfully recapitulate &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; neurodevelopment in-step with neurons obtained by fresh dissection. Our method establishes cryopreserved neurons as a reliable, efficient, and equivalent model to fresh neuron cultures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement:&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we have optimized and validated a methodology for the efficient cryopreservation of primary embryonic rodent neurons, yielding cells which are developmentally and functionally similar to fresh neurons. This approach serves as an effective alternative to regularly obtaining neurons by fresh dissection, and thus frees researchers from substantial labor and animal husbandry costs, enables flexibility in experimental timelines, and conserves animals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes have prominent roles in central nervous system (CNS) function and disease, with subpopulations defined primarily by morphologies and molecular markers often determined in cell culture. Here, we identify an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; astrocyte subpopulation termed &quot;&lt;i&gt;ieAstrocytes&lt;/i&gt; (immediate-early astrocytes)&quot; that is defined by &lt;i&gt;functional&lt;/i&gt; c-Fos activation during CNS disease development. An unbiased screen for CNS cells showing c-Fos activation during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), was developed by using inducible, TetTag c-Fos reporter mice that label activated cells with a temporally stable, nuclear green fluorescent protein (GFP). Four-dimensional (3-D over time) c-Fos activation maps in the spinal cord were produced by combining tissue clearing (iDISCO) and confocal microscopy that identified onset and expansion of GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell populations during EAE. Over 95% of the GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells showed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity – in contrast to absent or rare labeling of neurons, microglia, and infiltrating immune cells – which constituted &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocytes&lt;/i&gt; that linearly increased in number with progression of EAE. &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocyte&lt;/i&gt; formation was reduced by either astrocyte-specific genetic removal of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) or pharmacological inhibition by fingolimod (FTY720), an FDA-approved MS medicine that can functionally antagonize S1P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocyte&lt;/i&gt;s thus represent a &lt;i&gt;functionally&lt;/i&gt; defined subset of disease-linked astrocytes that are the first and predominant CNS cell population activated during EAE, and that track with disease severity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Their reduction by a disease-modifying agent supports their therapeutic relevance to MS and potentially other neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significant Statement&lt;/b&gt; A new, &lt;i&gt;functionally&lt;/i&gt; defined &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; subpopulation of astrocytes termed &quot;&lt;i&gt;ieAstrocyte&lt;/i&gt;s (immediate-early astrocytes)&quot; was identified as the first and predominant CNS cell type showing c-Fos activation, in an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocyte&lt;/i&gt;s track with disease severity. The approved MS drug, fingolimod (FTY720, an S1P receptor modulator) reduced &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocyte&lt;/i&gt; formation as well as clinical disease. Agents that prevent or reduce &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocytes&lt;/i&gt; could represent a new strategic target for treating MS and other neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Adaptation and inhibition control pathological synchronizawtion in a model of focal epileptic seizure</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Pharmacoresistant epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in which increased neuronal intrinsic excitability and synaptic excitation lead to pathologically synchronous behavior in the brain. In the majority of experimental and theoretical epilepsy models, epilepsy is associated with reduced inhibition in the pathological neural circuits, yet effects of intrinsic excitability are usually not explicitly analyzed. Here we present a novel neural mass model that includes intrinsic excitability in the form of spike-frequency adaptation in the excitatory population. We validated our model using local field potential data recorded from human hippocampal/subicular slices. We found that synaptic conductances and slow adaptation in the excitatory population both play essential roles for generating seizures and pre-ictal oscillations. Using bifurcation analysis, we found that transitions towards seizure and back to the resting state take place via Andronov-Hopf bifurcations. These simulations therefore suggest that single neuron adaptation as well as synaptic inhibition are responsible for orchestrating seizure dynamics and transition towards the epileptic state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Epileptic seizures are commonly thought to arise from a pathology of inhibition in the brain circuits. Theoretical models aiming to explain epileptic oscillations usually describe the neural activity solely in terms of inhibition and excitation. Single neuron adaptation properties are usually assumed to have only a limited contribution to seizure dynamics. To explore this issue, we developed a novel neural mass model with adaption in the excitatory population. By including adaptation together with inhibition in this model, we were able to account for several experimentally observed properties of seizures, resting state dynamics, and pre-ictal oscillations, leading to improved understanding of epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Gradient-based Representational Similarity Analysis with Searchlight for Analyzing fMRI Data. (arXiv:1809.04429v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04429</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04429</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) aims to explore similarities
between neural activities of different stimuli. Classical RSA techniques employ
the inverse of the covariance matrix to explore a linear model between the
neural activities and task events. However, calculating the inverse of a
large-scale covariance matrix is time-consuming and can reduce the stability
and robustness of the final analysis. Notably, it becomes severe when the
number of samples is too large. For facing this shortcoming, this paper
proposes a novel RSA method called gradient-based RSA (GRSA). Moreover, the
proposed method is not restricted to a linear model. In fact, there is a
growing interest in finding more effective ways of using multi-subject and
whole-brain fMRI data. Searchlight technique can extend RSA from the localized
brain regions to the whole-brain regions with smaller memory footprint in each
process. Based on Searchlight, we propose a new method called Spatiotemporal
Searchlight GRSA (SSL-GRSA) that generalizes our ROI-based GRSA algorithm to
the whole-brain data. Further, our approach can handle some computational
challenges while dealing with large-scale, multi-subject fMRI data.
Experimental studies on multi-subject datasets confirm that both proposed
approaches achieve superior performance to other state-of-the-art RSA
algorithms.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Moon Illusion explained by the Projective Consciousness Model. (arXiv:1809.04414v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04414</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Moon often appears larger near the perceptual horizon and smaller high in
the sky though the visual angle subtended is invariant. We show how this
illusion results from the optimization of a projective geometrical frame for
conscious perception through free energy minimization, as articulated in the
Projective Consciousness Model. The model accounts for all documented
modulations of the illusion without anomalies (e.g., the size-distance
paradox), surpasses other theories in explanatory power, makes sense of inter-
and intra-subjective variability vis-a-vis the illusion, and yields new
quantitative and qualitative predictions.

	<description>Microbial community structure and function rely on complex interactions whose underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. To investigate these interactions in a simple microbiome, we introduced &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; into an experimental community based on a cheese rind and identified the differences in &lt;i&gt;E. coli's&lt;/i&gt; genetic requirements for growth in interactive and non-interactive contexts using Random Barcode Transposon Sequencing (RB-TnSeq) and RNASeq. &lt;i&gt;E. coli's &lt;/i&gt;genetic requirements varied among pairwise growth conditions and between pairwise and community conditions. Our analysis points to mechanisms by which growth conditions change as a result of increasing community complexity and suggests that growth within a community relies on a combination of pairwise and higher order interactions. Our work provides a framework for using the model organism &lt;i&gt;E. coli &lt;/i&gt;as a readout to investigate microbial interactions regardless of the genetic tractability of members of the studied ecosystem.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Selective ion permeation involves complexation with carboxylates and lysine in a model human sodium channel</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006398</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Emelie Flood, Céline Boiteux, Toby W. Allen&lt;/p&gt;

Bacterial and human voltage-gated sodium channels (Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;s) exhibit similar cation selectivity, despite their distinct EEEE and DEKA selectivity filter signature sequences. Recent high-resolution structures for bacterial Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;s have allowed us to learn about ion conduction mechanisms in these simpler homo-tetrameric channels, but our understanding of the function of their mammalian counterparts remains limited. To probe these conduction mechanisms, a model of the human Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 channel has been constructed by grafting residues of its selectivity filter and external vestibular region onto the bacterial Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;Rh channel with atomic-resolution structure. Multi-μs fully atomistic simulations capture long time-scale ion and protein movements associated with the permeation of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, and their differences. We observe a Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion knock-on conduction mechanism facilitated by low energy multi-carboxylate/multi-Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes, akin to the bacterial channels. These complexes involve both the DEKA and vestibular EEDD rings, acting to draw multiple Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into the selectivity filter and promote permeation. When the DEKA ring lysine is protonated, we observe that its ammonium group is actively participating in Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; permeation, presuming the role of another ion. It participates in the formation of a stable complex involving carboxylates that collectively bind both Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and the Lys ammonium group in a high-field strength site, permitting pass-by translocation of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. In contrast, multiple K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion complexes with the DEKA and EEDD rings are disfavored by up to 8.3 kcal/mol, with the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-lysine-carboxylate complex non-existent. As a result, lysine acts as an electrostatic plug that partially blocks the flow of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, which must instead wait for isomerization of lysine downward to clear the path for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; passage. These distinct mechanisms give us insight into the nature of ion conduction and selectivity in human Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; channels, while uncovering high field strength carboxylate binding complexes that define the more general phenomenon of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-selective ion transport in nature.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/67OG9qpOaY0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dynamic and Sex-Specific Changes in Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Neuron Activity and Excitability in a Mouse Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Reproductive endocrine disorders are prominent co-morbidities of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in both men and women. The neural mechanisms underlying these co-morbidities remain unclear, but hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons may be involved. Here we report the first direct demonstrations of aberrant GnRH neuron function in an animal model of epilepsy. Recordings of GnRH neuron firing and excitability were made in acute mouse brain slices prepared 2 months after intrahippocampal injection of kainate (KA) or control saline, a well-established TLE model in which most females develop co-morbid estrous cycle disruption. GnRH neurons from control females showed elevated firing and excitability on estrus compared with diestrus. By contrast, cells from KA-injected females that developed prolonged, disrupted estrous cycles (KA-long) showed the reverse pattern. Firing rates of cells from KA-injected females that maintained regular cycles (KA-regular) were not different from controls on diestrus, but were reduced on estrus. In KA-injected males, only GnRH neurons in the medial septum displayed elevated firing. In contrast to the diestrus-vs.-estrus and sex-specific changes in firing, GnRH neuron intrinsic excitability was elevated in all KA-injected groups, indicating a role for afferent synaptic and neuromodulatory inputs in shaping overall changes in firing activity. Furthermore, KA-injected females showed cycle-stage-specific changes in circulating sex steroids on diestrus and estrus that also differed between KA-long and KA-regular groups. Together, these findings reveal that the effects of epilepsy on the neural control of reproduction are dynamic across the estrous cycle, distinct in association with co-morbid estrous cycle disruption severity, and sex-specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; People with epilepsy are at higher risk of reproductive endocrine disorders compared with the general population, but the neural mechanisms linking epilepsy and these co-morbidities are unknown. Here we report changes in the function of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, which control fertility, in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. GnRH neurons from epileptic female mice showed changes in activity dependent on estrous cycle stage and associated with severity of cycle disruption. The impacts of epilepsy on GnRH neurons in males were less severe. These findings provide novel evidence for impacts of epilepsy on GnRH neuron function, and will thus be of clinical relevance in developing new strategies to ameliorate reproductive co-morbidities and to treat the underlying seizures and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Strategic and dynamic temporal weighting for perceptual decisions in humans and macaques</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Perceptual decision-making is often modeled as the accumulation of sensory evidence over time. Recent studies using psychophysical reverse correlation have shown that even though the sensory evidence is stationary over time, subjects may exhibit a time-varying weighting strategy, weighting some stimulus epochs more heavily than others. While previous work has explained time-varying weighting as a consequence of static decision mechanisms (e.g., decision bound or leak), here we show that time-varying weighting can reflect strategic adaptation to stimulus statistics, and thus can readily take a number of forms. We characterized the temporal weighting strategies of humans and macaques performing a motion discrimination task in which the amount of information carried by motion stimulus was manipulated over time. Both species could adapt their temporal weighting strategy to match the time-varying statistics of the sensory stimulus. When early stimulus epochs had higher mean motion strength than late, subjects adopted a pronounced early weighting strategy, where early information was weighted more heavily in guiding perceptual decisions. When the mean motion strength was greater in later stimulus epochs, in contrast, subjects shifted to a marked late-weighting strategy. These results demonstrate that perceptual decisions involve a temporally flexible weighting process in both humans and monkeys, and introduce a paradigm with which to manipulate sensory stimuli in decision-making tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; During decision-making, the weight assigned by subjects to sensory information over time is not necessarily constant. Such time-varying weighting is often interpreted as a signature of a particular decision-making model (e.g., higher weighting of early stimulus information is consistent with a bounded accumulation process). Temporal weighting may also result, however, from a strategic reweighting of the stimulus evidence itself that takes place before and/or independent of a decision-making mechanism. Here we use a psychophysical reverse correlation paradigm to both measure and manipulate temporal weighting behavior. We demonstrate that both humans and macaques adopt weighting strategies that are flexible, consistent with dynamic reweighing of the sensory stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Repeated spike firing can transmit information at synapses and modulate spike timing, shape, and conduction velocity. These latter effects have been found to result from voltage-induced changes in ion currents and could alter the signals carried by axons. Here, we test whether Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) regulates spike propagation in adult rat optic nerve. We find that small-, medium-, and large-diameter axons bind anti-Thr286-phosphorylated CaMKII (pT286) antibodies and that, in isolated optic nerves, electrical stimulation reduces pT286 levels, spike propagation is hastened by CaMKII autophosphorylation and slowed by CaMKII dephosphorylation, single and multiple spikes slow propagation of subsequently activated spikes, and more frequent stimulation produces greater slowing. Likewise, exposing freely moving animals to flickering illumination reduces pT286 levels in optic nerves and electrically eliciting spikes &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in either the optic nerve or optic chiasm slows subsequent spike propagation in the optic nerve. By increasing the time that elapses between successive spikes as they propagate, pT286 dephosphorylation and activity-induced spike slowing reduce the frequency of propagated spikes below the frequency at which they were elicited and would thus limit the frequency at which axons synaptically drive target neurons. Consistent with this, the ability of retinal ganglion cells to drive at least some lateral geniculate neurons has been found to increase when presented with light flashes at low and moderate temporal frequencies but less so at high frequencies. Activity-induced decreases in spike frequency may also reduce the energy required to maintain normal intracellular Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; By propagating along axons at constant velocities, spikes could drive synapses as frequently as they are initiated. However, the onset of spiking has been found to alter the conduction velocity of subsequent (&quot;follower&quot;) spikes in various preparations. Here, we find that spikes reduce spike frequency in rat optic nerve by slowing follower spike propagation and that electrically stimulated spiking &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; and spike-generating flickering illumination &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; produce net decreases in axonal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) autophosphorylation. Consistent with these effects, propagation speed increases and decreases, respectively, with CaMKII autophosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Lowering spike frequency by CaMKII dephosphorylation is a novel consequence of axonal spiking and light adaptation that could decrease synaptic gain as stimulus frequency increases and may also reduce energy use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Drosophila Exo70 Is Essential for Neurite Extension and Survival under Thermal Stress</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The octomeric exocyst complex governs the final step of exocytosis in both plants and animals. Its roles, however, extend beyond exocytosis and include organelle biogenesis, ciliogenesis, cell migration, and cell growth. Exo70 is a conserved component of the exocyst whose function in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; is unclear. In this study, we characterized two mutant alleles of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila exo70. exo70&lt;/i&gt; mutants exhibit reduced synaptic growth, locomotor activity, glutamate receptor density, and mEPSP amplitude. We found that presynaptic Exo70 is necessary for normal synaptic growth at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). At the neuromuscular junction, &lt;i&gt;exo70&lt;/i&gt; genetically interacts with the small GTPase &lt;i&gt;ralA&lt;/i&gt; to regulate synaptic growth. Loss of Exo70 leads to the blockage of JNK signaling-, activity-, and temperature-induced synaptic outgrowths. We showed that this phenotype is associated with an impairment of integral membrane protein transport to the cell surface at synaptic terminals. In octopaminergic motor neurons, Exo70 is detected in synaptic varicosities, as well as the regions of membrane extensions in response to activity stimulation. Strikingly, mild thermal stress causes severe neurite outgrowth defects and pharate adult lethality in &lt;i&gt;exo70&lt;/i&gt; mutants. &lt;i&gt;exo70&lt;/i&gt; mutants also display defective locomotor activity in response to starvation stress. These results demonstrated that Exo70 is an important regulator of induced synaptic growth and is crucial for an organism's adaptation to environmental changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The exocyst complex is a conserved protein complex directing secretory vesicles to the site of membrane fusion during exocytosis, which is essential for transporting proteins and membranes to the cell surface. Exo70 is a subunit of the exocyst complex whose roles in neurons remain elusive, and its function in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; is unclear. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, Exo70 is expressed in both glutamatergic and octopaminergic neurons, and presynaptic Exo70 regulates synaptic outgrowth. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;exo70&lt;/i&gt; mutants have impaired integral membrane transport to the cell surface at synaptic terminals and block several kinds of induced synaptic growth. Remarkably, elevated temperature causes severe arborization defects and lethality in &lt;i&gt;exo70&lt;/i&gt; mutants, thus underpinning the importance of Exo70 functions in development and adaptation to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Loss of Synaptic Tagging in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex after Tail Amputation in Adult Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/37/8060?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is known to play important roles in key brain functions such as pain perception, cognition, and emotion. Different forms of homosynaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression have been studied in ACC synapses. However, heterosynaptic plasticity such as synaptic tagging has not been reported. Here, we demonstrate synaptic tagging in the ACC of adult male mice by using a 64-channel multielectrode array recording system. Weak theta burst stimulation (TBS), normally inducing early-phase LTP or No-LTP in most of the activated channels, produced late phase-LTP (L-LTP) in a majority of channels when a strong TBS was applied earlier to a separate input within a certain time window. Similar to hippocampus, synaptic tagging in the ACC depends on the synthesis of new proteins. Tail amputation-induced peripheral injury caused a loss of this heterosynaptic L-LTP and occluded strong TBS-evoked L-LTP as well. Together, we provide the first report of the synaptic tagging-like phenomenon in the ACC of adult mice, and the loss of synaptic tagging to amputation may contribute to injury-related cognitive changes and phantom limb sensation and pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; ACC is an important cortical region involved in many brain functions. Previous studies have dissected the molecular mechanism of multiple types of homosynaptic plasticity of ACC synapses. Here, we report a novel form of heterosynaptic plasticity occurring in the ACC. This newly identified, protein synthesis-dependent neocortical synaptic tagging is sensitive to peripheral tail amputation injury and may provide basic mechanisms for synaptic pathophysiology of phantom pain and related cognitive changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mast Cells in the Developing Brain Determine Adult Sexual Behavior</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many sex differences in brain and behavior are programmed during development by gonadal hormones, but the cellular mechanisms are incompletely understood. We found that immune-system-derived mast cells are a primary target for the masculinizing hormone estradiol and that mast cells are in turn primary mediators of brain sexual differentiation. Newborn male rats had greater numbers and more activated mast cells in the preoptic area (POA), a brain region essential for male copulatory behavior, than female littermates during the critical period for sexual differentiation. Inhibiting mast cells with a stabilizing agent blunted the masculinization of both POA neuronal and microglial morphology and adult sex behavior, whereas activating mast cells in females, even though fewer in number, induced masculinization. Treatment of newborn females with a masculinizing dose of estradiol increased mast cell number and induced mast cells to release histamine, which then stimulated microglia to release prostaglandins and thereby induced male-typical synaptic patterning. These findings identify a novel non-neuronal origin of brain sex differences and resulting motivated behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Estrogen Regulation of GRK2 Inactivates Kappa Opioid Receptor Signaling Mediating Analgesia, But Not Aversion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Activation of  opioid receptors (KORs) produces analgesia and aversion via distinct intracellular signaling pathways, but whether G protein-biased KOR agonists can be designed to have clinical utility will depend on a better understanding of the signaling mechanisms involved. We found that KOR activation produced conditioned place aversion and potentiated CPP for cocaine in male and female C57BL/6N mice. Consistent with this, males and females both showed arrestin-mediated increases in phospho-p38 MAPK following KOR activation. Unlike in males, however, KOR activation had inconsistent analgesic effects in females and KOR increased Gβ-mediated ERK phosphorylation in males, but not females. KOR desensitization was not responsible for the lack of response in females because neither &lt;i&gt;Grk3&lt;/i&gt; nor &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt; gene knock-out enhanced analgesia. Instead, responsiveness was estrous cycle dependent because KOR analgesia was evident during low estrogen phases of the cycle and in ovariectomized (OVX) females. Estradiol treatment of OVX females suppressed KOR-mediated analgesia, demonstrating that estradiol was sufficient to blunt Gβ-mediated KOR signals. G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is known to regulate ERK activation, and we found that the inhibitory, phosphorylated form of GRK2 was significantly higher in intact females. GRK2/3 inhibition by CMPD101 increased KOR stimulation of phospho-ERK in females, decreased sex differences in KOR-mediated inhibition of dopamine release, and enhanced mu opioid receptor and KOR-mediated analgesia in females. In OVX females, estradiol increased the association between GRK2 and Gβ. These studies suggest that estradiol, through increased phosphorylation of GRK2 and possible sequestration of Gβ by GRK2, blunts G protein-mediated signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Chronic pain disorders are more prevalent in females than males, but opioid receptor agonists show inconsistent analgesic efficacy in females.  opioid receptor (KOR) agonists have been tested in clinical trials for treating pain disorders based on their analgesic properties and low addictive potential. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying sex differences in KOR actions were previously unknown. Our studies identify an intracellular mechanism involving estradiol regulation of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 that is responsible for sexually dimorphic analgesic responses following opioid receptor activation. Understanding this mechanism will be critical for developing effective nonaddictive opioid analgesics for use in women and characterizing sexually dimorphic effects in other inhibitory G protein-coupled receptor signaling responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Adult Ube3a Gene Reinstatement Restores the Electrophysiological Deficits of Prefrontal Cortex Layer 5 Neurons in a Mouse Model of Angelman Syndrome</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;E3 ubiquitin ligase (UBE3A) levels in the brain need to be tightly regulated, as loss of functional UBE3A protein is responsible for the severe neurodevelopmental disorder Angelman syndrome (AS), whereas increased activity of UBE3A is associated with nonsyndromic autism. Given the role of mPFC in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism, we aimed to identify the functional changes resulting from loss of UBE3A in infralimbic and prelimbic mPFC areas in a mouse model of AS. Whole-cell recordings from layer 5 mPFC pyramidal neurons obtained in brain slices from adult mice of both sexes revealed that loss of UBE3A results in a strong decrease of spontaneous inhibitory transmission and increase of spontaneous excitatory transmission potentially leading to a marked excitation/inhibition imbalance. Additionally, we found that loss of UBE3A led to decreased excitability and increased threshold for action potential of layer 5 fast spiking interneurons without significantly affecting the excitability of pyramidal neurons. Because we previously showed that AS mouse behavioral phenotypes are reversible upon &lt;i&gt;Ube3a&lt;/i&gt; gene reactivation during a restricted period of early postnatal development, we investigated whether &lt;i&gt;Ube3a&lt;/i&gt; gene reactivation in a fully mature brain could reverse any of the identified physiological deficits. In contrast to our previously reported behavioral findings, restoring UBE3A levels in adult animals fully rescued all the identified physiological deficits of mPFC neurons. Moreover, the kinetics of reversing these synaptic deficits closely followed the reinstatement of UBE3A protein level. Together, these findings show a striking dissociation between the rescue of behavioral and physiological deficits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we describe significant physiological deficits in the mPFC of an Angelman syndrome mouse model. We found a marked change in excitatory/inhibitory balance, as well as decreased excitability of fast spiking interneurons. A promising treatment strategy for Angelman syndrome is aimed at restoring UBE3A expression by activating the paternal &lt;i&gt;UBE3A&lt;/i&gt; gene. Here we find that the physiological changes in the mPFC are fully reversible upon gene reactivation, even when the brain is fully mature. This indicates that there is no critical developmental window for reversing the identified physiological deficits in mPFC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Influence of vmPFC on dmPFC Predicts Valence-Guided Belief Formation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/37/7996?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;When updating beliefs about their future prospects, people tend to disregard bad news. By combining fMRI with computational and dynamic causal modeling, we identified neurocircuitry mechanisms underlying this optimism bias to test for valence-guided belief formation. In each trial of the fMRI task, participants (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 24, 10 male) estimated the base rate (eBR) and their risks of experiencing negative future events, were confronted with the actual BR, and finally had the opportunity to update their initial self-related risk estimate. We demonstrated an optimism bias by revealing greater belief updates in response to good over bad news (i.e., learning that the actual BR is lower or higher than expected) while controlling for confounds (estimation error and personal relevance of the new information). Updating was favorable when the final belief about risks improved (or at least did not worsen) relative to the initial risk estimate. This valence of updating was encoded by the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) associated with the valuation of rewards. Within the updating circuit, the vmPFC filtered the incoming signal in a valence-dependent manner and influenced the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Both the valence-encoding activity in the vmPFC and its influence on the dmPFC predicted individual magnitudes of the optimism bias. Our results indicate that updating was biased by the motivation to maximize desirable beliefs, mediated by the influence of the valuation system on further cognitive processing. Therefore, although it provides the very basis for human reasoning, belief formation is essentially distorted to promote desired conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The question of whether human reasoning is biased by desires and goals is crucial for everyday social, professional, and economic decisions. How much our belief formation is influenced by what we want to believe is, however, still debated. Our study confirms that belief updates are indeed optimistically biased. Critically, the bias depends on the recruitment of the brain valuation system and the influence of this system on neural regions involved in reasoning. These neurocircuit interactions support the notion that the motivation to maximize pleasant beliefs reinforces those cognitive processes that are most likely to yield the desired conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: SCN VIP Neurons Are Essential for Normal Light-Mediated Resetting of the Circadian System</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) synchronizes circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology to the external light cycle, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are unclear. As the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is important for circadian light responses, we tested the hypothesis that rhythmic VIP-producing SCN neurons mediate circadian light responses in male and female mice. Using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; fiber photometry over multiple days, we found daily rhythms in spontaneous calcium events of SCN VIP neurons that peaked during the subjective day and were disrupted by constant light. The light-evoked calcium responses peaked around subjective dusk and were greater during the subjective night. Using novel VIP sensor cells, we found that the activity patterns in SCN VIP neurons correlated tightly with spontaneous and NMDA-evoked VIP release. Finally, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; hyperpolarization of VIP neurons attenuated light-induced shifts of daily rhythms in locomotion. We conclude that SCN VIP neurons exhibit circadian rhythms in spontaneous and light-responsive activity and are essential for the normal resetting of daily rhythms by environmental light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Daily rhythms in behavior and physiology, including sleep/wake and hormone release, are synchronized to local time by the master circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The advent of artificial lighting and, consequently, light exposure at night, is associated with an increased risk of disease due to disrupted circadian rhythms. However, the mechanisms by which the SCN encodes normal and pathological light information are unclear. Here, we find that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-producing SCN neurons exhibit daily rhythms in neuronal activity and VIP release, and that blocking the activity of these neurons attenuates light-induced phase shifts. We conclude that rhythmic VIP neurons are an essential component of the circadian light transduction pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Robustness of Spike Deconvolution for Neuronal Calcium Imaging</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Calcium imaging is a powerful method to record the activity of neural populations in many species, but inferring spike times from calcium signals is a challenging problem. We compared multiple approaches using multiple datasets with ground truth electrophysiology and found that simple non-negative deconvolution (NND) outperformed all other algorithms on out-of-sample test data. We introduce a novel benchmark applicable to recordings without electrophysiological ground truth, based on the correlation of responses to two stimulus repeats, and used this to show that unconstrained NND also outperformed the other algorithms when run on &quot;zoomed out&quot; datasets of ~10,000 cell recordings from the visual cortex of mice of either sex. Finally, we show that NND-based methods match the performance of a supervised method based on convolutional neural networks while avoiding some of the biases of such methods, and at much faster running times. We therefore recommend that spikes be inferred from calcium traces using simple NND because of its simplicity, efficiency, and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The experimental method that currently allows for recordings of the largest numbers of cells simultaneously is two-photon calcium imaging. However, use of this powerful method requires that neuronal firing times be inferred correctly from the large resulting datasets. Previous studies have claimed that complex supervised learning algorithms outperform simple deconvolution methods at this task. Unfortunately, these studies suffered from several problems and biases. When we repeated the analysis, using the same data and correcting these problems, we found that simpler spike inference methods perform better. Even more importantly, we found that supervised learning methods can introduce artifactual structure into spike trains, which can in turn lead to erroneous scientific conclusions. Of the algorithms we evaluated, we found that an extremely simple method performed best in all circumstances tested, was much faster to run, and was insensitive to parameter choices, making incorrect scientific conclusions much less likely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Behavioral Effect of Chemogenetic Inhibition Is Directly Related to Receptor Transduction Levels in Rhesus Monkeys</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We used inhibitory DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) to reversibly disrupt dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) function in male rhesus monkeys. Monkeys were tested on a spatial delayed response task to assess working memory function after intramuscular injection of either clozapine-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxide (CNO) or vehicle. CNO injections given before DREADD transduction were without effect on behavior. rAAV5/hSyn-hM4Di-mCherry was injected bilaterally into the dlPFC of five male rhesus monkeys, to produce neuronal expression of the inhibitory (Gi-coupled) DREADD receptor. We quantified the percentage of DREADD-transduced cells using stereological analysis of mCherry-immunolabeled neurons. We found a greater number of immunolabeled neurons in monkeys that displayed CNO-induced behavioral impairment after DREADD transduction compared with monkeys that showed no behavioral effect after CNO. Even in monkeys that showed reliable effects of CNO on behavior after DREADD transduction, the number of prefrontal neurons transduced with DREADD receptor was on the order of 3% of total prefrontal neurons counted. This level of histological analysis facilitates our understanding of behavioral effects, or lack thereof, after DREADD vector injection in monkeys. It also implies that a functional silencing of a relatively small fraction of dlPFC neurons, albeit in a widely distributed area, is sufficient to disrupt spatial working memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cognitive domains such as working memory and executive function are mediated by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Impairments in these domains are common in neurodegenerative diseases as well as normal aging. The present study sought to measure deficits in a spatial delayed response task following activation of viral-vector transduced inhibitory DREADD (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug) receptors in rhesus macaques and compare this to the level of transduction in dlPFC using stereology. We found a significant relationship between the extent of DREADD transduction and the magnitude of behavioral deficit following administration of the DREADD actuator compound clozapine-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxide (CNO). These results demonstrate it will be critical to validate transduction to ensure DREADDs remain a powerful tool for neuronal disruption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Accounting for Taste: A Multi-Attribute Neurocomputational Model Explains the Neural Dynamics of Choices for Self and Others</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/37/7952?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;How do we make choices for others with different preferences from our own? Although neuroimaging studies implicate similar circuits in representing preferences for oneself and others, some models propose that additional corrective mechanisms come online when choices for others diverge from one's own preferences. Here we used event-related potentials (ERPs) in humans, in combination with computational modeling, to examine how social information is integrated in the time leading up to choices for oneself and others. Hungry male and female participants with unrestricted diets selected foods for themselves, a similar unrestricted eater, and a dissimilar, self-identified healthy eater. Across choices for both oneself and others, ERP value signals emerged within the same time window but differentially reflected taste and health attributes based on the recipient's preferences. Choices for the dissimilar recipient were associated with earlier activity localized to brain regions implicated in social cognition, including temporoparietal junction. Finally, response-locked analysis revealed a late ERP component specific to choices for the similar recipient, localized to the parietal lobe, that appeared to reflect differences in the response threshold based on uncertainty. A multi-attribute computational model supported the link between specific ERP components and distinct model parameters, and was not significantly improved by adding time-dependent dual processes. Model simulations suggested that longer response times previously associated with effortful correction may alternatively arise from higher choice uncertainty. Together, these results provide a parsimonious neurocomputational mechanism for social decision-making, additionally explaining divergent patterns of choice and response time data in decisions for oneself and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; How do we choose for others, particularly when they have different preferences? Whereas some studies suggest that similar neural circuits underlie decision-making for oneself and others, others argue for additional, slower perspective-taking mechanisms. Combining event-related potentials with computational modeling, we found that integration of others' preferences occurs over the same timescale as for oneself while differentially tracking recipient-relevant attributes. Although choosing for others took longer and produced differences in late-emerging neural responses, computational modeling attributed these patterns to greater response caution rather than egocentric bias correction. Computational simulations also correctly predicted when and why choosing differently for others takes longer, suggesting that a model incorporating value integration and evidence accumulation can parsimoniously account for complex patterns in social decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Memory-Related Synaptic Plasticity Is Sexually Dimorphic in Rodent Hippocampus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Men are generally superior to women in remembering spatial relationships, whereas the reverse holds for semantic information, but the neurobiological bases for these differences are not understood. Here we describe striking sexual dimorphism in synaptic mechanisms of memory encoding in hippocampal field CA1, a region critical for spatial learning. Studies of acute hippocampal slices from adult rats and mice show that for excitatory Schaffer–commissural projections, the memory-related long-term potentiation (LTP) effect depends upon endogenous estrogen and membrane estrogen receptor α (ERα) in females but not in males; there was no evident involvement of nuclear ERα in females, or of ERβ or GPER1 (G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1) in either sex. Quantitative immunofluorescence showed that stimulation-induced activation of two LTP-related kinases (Src, ERK1/2), and of postsynaptic TrkB, required ERα in females only, and that postsynaptic ERα levels are higher in females than in males. Several downstream signaling events involved in LTP were comparable between the sexes. In contrast to endogenous estrogen effects, infused estradiol facilitated LTP and synaptic signaling in females via both ERα and ERβ. The estrogen dependence of LTP in females was associated with a higher threshold for both inducing potentiation and acquiring spatial information. These results indicate that the observed sexual dimorphism in hippocampal LTP reflects differences in synaptic kinase activation, including both a weaker association with NMDA receptors and a greater ERα-mediated kinase activation in response to locally produced estrogen in females. We propose that male/female differences in mechanisms and threshold for field CA1 LTP contribute to differences in encoding specific types of memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; There is good evidence for male/female differences in memory-related cognitive function, but the neurobiological basis for this sexual dimorphism is not understood. Here we describe sex differences in synaptic function in a brain area that is critical for learning spatial cues. Our results show that female rodents have higher synaptic levels of estrogen receptor α (ERα) and, in contrast to males, require membrane ERα for the activation of signaling kinases that support long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity thought to underlie learning. The additional requirement of estrogen signaling in females resulted in a higher threshold for both LTP and hippocampal field CA1-dependent spatial learning. These results describe a synaptic basis for sexual dimorphism in encoding spatial information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Retrogradely-transported neurotrophin signaling plays an important role in regulating neural circuit specificity. Here we investigated whether targeted delivery of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) to lumbar motoneurons (MNs) caudal to a thoracic (T10) contusive spinal cord injury (SCI) could modulate dendritic patterning and synapse formation of the lumbar MNs. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, Adeno-associated virus serotype 2 overexpressing NT-3 (AAV-NT-3) induced NT-3 expression and neurite outgrowth in cultured spinal cord neurons. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, targeted delivery of AAV-NT-3 into transiently demyelinated adult mouse sciatic nerves led to the retrograde transportation of NT-3 to the lumbar MNs, significantly attenuating SCI-induced lumbar MN dendritic atrophy. NT-3 enhanced sprouting and synaptic formation of descending serotonergic, dopaminergic, and propriospinal axons on lumbar MNs, parallel to improved behavioral recovery. Thus, retrogradely transported NT-3 stimulated remodeling of lumbar neural circuitry and synaptic connectivity remote to a thoracic SCI, supporting a role for retrograde transport of NT-3 as a potential therapeutic strategy for SCI.</description>

	<description>The domestication of transposable elements has repeatedly occurred during evolution and domesticated transposases have often been implicated in programmed genome rearrangements, as remarkably illustrated in ciliates. In &lt;i&gt;Paramecium&lt;/i&gt;, PiggyMac (Pgm), a domesticated PiggyBac transposase, carries out developmentally programmed DNA elimination, including the precise excision of tens of thousands of gene-interrupting germline Internal Eliminated Sequences (IESs). Here, we report the discovery of five groups of distant Pgm-like proteins (PgmLs), all able to interact with Pgm and essential for its nuclear localization and IES excision genome-wide. Unlike Pgm, PgmLs lack a conserved catalytic site, suggesting that they rather have an architectural function within a multi-component excision complex embedding Pgm. PgmL depletion can increase erroneous targeting of residual Pgm-mediated DNA cleavage, indicating that PgmLs contribute to accurately position the complex on IES ends. DNA rearrangements in &lt;i&gt;Paramecium&lt;/i&gt; constitute a rare example of a biological process jointly managed by six distinct domesticated transposases.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36664</link>
	<description>Layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) contains two principal cell types: pyramidal cells and stellate cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that these two cell types have distinct molecular profiles, physiological properties, and connectivity. The observations hint at a fundamental functional difference between the two cell populations but conclusions have been mixed. Here, we used a tTA-based transgenic mouse line to drive expression of ArchT, an optogenetic silencer, specifically in stellate cells. We were able to optogenetically identify stellate cells and characterize their firing properties in freely moving mice. The stellate cell population included cells from a range of functional cell classes. Roughly one in four of the tagged cells were grid cells, suggesting that stellate cells contribute not only to path-integration-based representation of self-location but also have other functions. The data support observations suggesting that grid cells are not the sole determinant of place cell firing.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Inhibitory Neuron Activity Contributions to Hemodynamic Responses and Metabolic Load Examined Using an Inhibitory Optogenetic Mouse Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy225</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy225/5095373?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Hemodynamic signals are routinely used to noninvasively assess brain function in humans and animals. This work examined the contribution of inhibitory neuron activity on hemodynamic responses captured by changes in blood flow, volume and oxygenation in the cortex of lightly anesthetized mice. Because cortical activity is not commonly initiated by inhibitory neurons, experiments were conducted to examine the neuronal activity properties elicited by photo-stimulation. We observed comparable increases in neuronal activity evoked by forelimb and photo-stimulation; however, significantly larger increases in blood flow and volume were produced by photo-stimulation of inhibitory neurons compared with forelimb stimulation. Following blockade of glutamate and GABA-A receptors to reduce postsynaptic activity contributions, neuronal activity was reliably modulated and hemodynamic changes persisted, though slightly reduced. More importantly, photo-stimulation-evoked changes in blood flow and volume were suppressed by 75–80% with the administration of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, suggesting that inhibitory neurons regulate blood flow mostly via nitric oxide. Lastly, forelimb and photo-stimulation of excitatory neurons produced local decreases in blood oxygenation, while large increases were generated by photo-stimulation of inhibitory neurons. Estimates of oxygen metabolism suggest that inhibitory neuron activity has a small impact on tissue metabolic load, indicating a mismatch between the metabolic demand and blood flow regulation properties of inhibitory and excitatory neurons.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Dentate Granule Neurons Generated During Perinatal Life Display Distinct Morphological Features Compared With Later-Born Neurons in the Mouse Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy224</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In nonhuman mammals and in particular in rodents, most granule neurons of the dentate gyrus (DG) are generated during development and yet little is known about their properties compared with adult-born neurons. Although it is generally admitted that these populations are morphologically indistinguishable once mature, a detailed analysis of developmentally born neurons is lacking. Here, we used in vivo electroporation to label dentate granule cells (DGCs) generated in mouse embryos (E14.5) or in neonates (P0) and followed their morphological development up to 6 months after birth. By comparison with mature retrovirus-labeled DGCs born at weaning (P21) or young adult (P84) stages, we provide the evidence that perinatally born neurons, especially embryonically born cells, are morphologically distinct from later-born neurons and are thus easily distinguishable. In addition, our data indicate that semilunar and hilar GCs, 2 populations in ectopic location, are generated during the embryonic and the neonatal periods, respectively. Thus, our findings provide new insights into the development of the different populations of GCs in the DG and open new questions regarding their function in the brain.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Priority Switches in Visual Working Memory are Supported by Frontal Delta and Posterior Alpha Interactions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy223</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Visual working memory (VWM) distinguishes between representations relevant for imminent versus future perceptual goals. We investigated how the brain sequentially prioritizes visual working memory representations that serve consecutive tasks. Observers remembered two targets for a sequence of two visual search tasks, thus making one target currently relevant, and the other prospectively relevant. We show that during the retention interval prior to the first search, lateralized parieto-occipital EEG alpha (8–14 Hz) suppression is stronger for current compared with prospective search targets. Crucially, between the first and second search task, this difference in posterior alpha lateralization reverses, reflecting the change in priority states of the two target representations. Connectivity analyses indicate that this switch in posterior alpha lateralization is driven by frontal delta/low-theta (2–6 Hz) activity. Moreover, this frontal low-frequency signal also predicts task performance after the switch. We thus obtained evidence for large-scale network interactions underlying the flexible shifting between the priority states of multiple memory representations in VWM.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Alpha oscillations are known to play a central role in the functional inhibition of visual cortices, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. One noninvasive method for modulating alpha activity experimentally is through the use of flickering visual stimuli that “entrain” visual cortices. Such alpha entrainment has been found to compromise visual perception and affect widespread cortical regions, but it remains unclear how the interference occurs and whether the widespread activity induced by alpha entrainment reflects a compensatory mechanism to mitigate the entrainment, or alternatively, a propagated interference signal that translates to impaired visual processing. Herein, we attempt to address these questions by integrating alpha entrainment into a modified Posner cueing paradigm, while measuring the underlying dynamics using magnetoencephalography. Our findings indicated that alpha entrainment is negatively related to task performance, such that as neural entrainment increases on the attended side (relative to the unattended side) accuracy decreases. Further, this attentional biasing is found to covary robustly with activity in the frontoparietal attention network. Critically, the observed negative entrainment effect on task accuracy was also fully mediated by activity in frontoparietal regions, signifying a propagation of the interfering alpha entrainment signal from bottom-up sensory to top-down regulatory networks.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;People who score higher on intelligence tests tend to have larger brains. Twin studies suggest the same genetic factors influence both brain size and intelligence. This has led to the hypothesis that genetics influence intelligence partly by contributing to the development of larger brains. We tested this hypothesis using four large imaging genetics studies (combined &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 7965) with polygenic scores derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of educational attainment, a correlate of intelligence. We conducted meta-analysis to test associations among participants’ genetics, total brain volume (i.e., brain size), and cognitive test performance. Consistent with previous findings, participants with higher polygenic scores achieved higher scores on cognitive tests, as did participants with larger brains. Participants with higher polygenic scores also had larger brains. We found some evidence that brain size partly mediated associations between participants’ education polygenic scores and their cognitive test performance. Effect sizes were larger in the population-based samples than in the convenience-based samples. Recruitment and retention of population-representative samples should be a priority for neuroscience research. Findings suggest promise for studies integrating GWAS discoveries with brain imaging to understand neurobiology linking genetics with cognitive performance.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Sergi Elizalde, Ashley M. Laughney, Samuel F. Bakhoum&lt;/p&gt;

Cancer cells frequently undergo chromosome missegregation events during mitosis, whereby the copies of a given chromosome are not distributed evenly among the two daughter cells, thus creating cells with heterogeneous karyotypes. A stochastic model tracing cellular karyotypes derived from clonal populations over hundreds of generations was recently developed and experimentally validated, and it was capable of predicting favorable karyotypes frequently observed in cancer. Here, we construct and study a Markov chain that precisely describes karyotypic evolution during clonally expanding cancer cell populations. The Markov chain allows us to directly predict the distribution of karyotypes and the expected size of the tumor after many cell divisions without resorting to computationally expensive simulations. We determine the limiting karyotype distribution of an evolving tumor population, and quantify its dependency on several key parameters including the initial karyotype of the founder cell, the rate of whole chromosome missegregation, and chromosome-specific cell viability. Using this model, we confirm the existence of an optimal rate of chromosome missegregation probabilities that maximizes karyotypic heterogeneity, while minimizing the occurrence of nullisomy. Interestingly, karyotypic heterogeneity is significantly more dependent on chromosome missegregation probabilities rather than the number of cell divisions, so that maximal heterogeneity can be reached rapidly (within a few hundred generations of cell division) at chromosome missegregation rates commonly observed in cancer cell lines. Conversely, at low missegregation rates, heterogeneity is constrained even after thousands of cell division events. This leads us to conclude that chromosome copy number heterogeneity is primarily constrained by chromosome missegregation rates and the risk for nullisomy and less so by the age of the tumor. This model enables direct integration of karyotype information into existing models of tumor evolution based on somatic mutations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Wd2yu28uKWQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dynamic and Sex-Specific Changes in Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Neuron Activity and Excitability in a Mouse Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0273-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Reproductive endocrine disorders are prominent co-morbidities of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in both men and women. The neural mechanisms underlying these co-morbidities remain unclear, but hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons may be involved. Here we report the first direct demonstrations of aberrant GnRH neuron function in an animal model of epilepsy. Recordings of GnRH neuron firing and excitability were made in acute mouse brain slices prepared 2 months after intrahippocampal injection of kainate (KA) or control saline, a well-established TLE model in which most females develop co-morbid estrous cycle disruption. GnRH neurons from control females showed elevated firing and excitability on estrus compared with diestrus. By contrast, cells from KA-injected females that developed prolonged, disrupted estrous cycles (KA-long) showed the reverse pattern. Firing rates of cells from KA-injected females that maintained regular cycles (KA-regular) were not different from controls on diestrus, but were reduced on estrus. In KA-injected males, only GnRH neurons in the medial septum displayed elevated firing. In contrast to the diestrus-vs.-estrus and sex-specific changes in firing, GnRH neuron intrinsic excitability was elevated in all KA-injected groups, indicating a role for afferent synaptic and neuromodulatory inputs in shaping overall changes in firing activity. Furthermore, KA-injected females showed cycle-stage-specific changes in circulating sex steroids on diestrus and estrus that also differed between KA-long and KA-regular groups. Together, these findings reveal that the effects of epilepsy on the neural control of reproduction are dynamic across the estrous cycle, distinct in association with co-morbid estrous cycle disruption severity, and sex-specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; People with epilepsy are at higher risk of reproductive endocrine disorders compared with the general population, but the neural mechanisms linking epilepsy and these co-morbidities are unknown. Here we report changes in the function of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, which control fertility, in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. GnRH neurons from epileptic female mice showed changes in activity dependent on estrous cycle stage and associated with severity of cycle disruption. The impacts of epilepsy on GnRH neurons in males were less severe. These findings provide novel evidence for impacts of epilepsy on GnRH neuron function, and will thus be of clinical relevance in developing new strategies to ameliorate reproductive co-morbidities and to treat the underlying seizures and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Strategic and dynamic temporal weighting for perceptual decisions in humans and macaques</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Perceptual decision-making is often modeled as the accumulation of sensory evidence over time. Recent studies using psychophysical reverse correlation have shown that even though the sensory evidence is stationary over time, subjects may exhibit a time-varying weighting strategy, weighting some stimulus epochs more heavily than others. While previous work has explained time-varying weighting as a consequence of static decision mechanisms (e.g., decision bound or leak), here we show that time-varying weighting can reflect strategic adaptation to stimulus statistics, and thus can readily take a number of forms. We characterized the temporal weighting strategies of humans and macaques performing a motion discrimination task in which the amount of information carried by motion stimulus was manipulated over time. Both species could adapt their temporal weighting strategy to match the time-varying statistics of the sensory stimulus. When early stimulus epochs had higher mean motion strength than late, subjects adopted a pronounced early weighting strategy, where early information was weighted more heavily in guiding perceptual decisions. When the mean motion strength was greater in later stimulus epochs, in contrast, subjects shifted to a marked late-weighting strategy. These results demonstrate that perceptual decisions involve a temporally flexible weighting process in both humans and monkeys, and introduce a paradigm with which to manipulate sensory stimuli in decision-making tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; During decision-making, the weight assigned by subjects to sensory information over time is not necessarily constant. Such time-varying weighting is often interpreted as a signature of a particular decision-making model (e.g., higher weighting of early stimulus information is consistent with a bounded accumulation process). Temporal weighting may also result, however, from a strategic reweighting of the stimulus evidence itself that takes place before and/or independent of a decision-making mechanism. Here we use a psychophysical reverse correlation paradigm to both measure and manipulate temporal weighting behavior. We demonstrate that both humans and macaques adopt weighting strategies that are flexible, consistent with dynamic reweighing of the sensory stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Loss of Mecp2 causes atypical synaptic and molecular plasticity of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons reflecting rett syndrome-like sensorimotor defects</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Rett syndrome (RTT) is caused in most cases by loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (&lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt;). Understanding the pathological processes impacting sensory-motor control represents a major challenge for clinical management of individuals affected by RTT, but the underlying molecular and neuronal modifications remain unclear. We find that symptomatic male &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; knockout (KO) mice show atypically elevated parvalbumin (PV) expression in both somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices together with excessive excitatory inputs converging onto PV-expressing interneurons (INs). In accordance, high-speed voltage-sensitive dye imaging shows reduced amplitude and spatial spread of synaptically induced neuronal depolarizations in S1 of &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Moreover, motor learning-dependent changes of PV expression and structural synaptic plasticity typically occurring on PV+ INs in M1 are impaired in symptomatic &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Finally, we find similar abnormalities of PV networks plasticity in symptomatic female &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice. These results indicate that in &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice the configuration of PV+ INs network is shifted toward an atypical plasticity state in relevant cortical areas compatible with the sensory-motor dysfunctions characteristics of RTT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the pathological processes impacting somatosensory processing and motor control represents a major challenge for clinical management of individuals affected by Rett syndrome. We found that &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; is important, starting from young age, for the correct molecular and synaptic organization of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in cortical areas responsible for sensory-motor skills. Intriguingly, even partial &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; loss produces an atypical upregulation of parvalbumin expression in these cells that correlates with the severity of motor behavioral impairments and is associated with defective cortical activity in KO mice. Because in behaviorally impaired &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; KO mice excessive activity-dependent excitatory connectivity is established with these interneurons, our study suggests that partial inhibition of parvalbumin-positive cells would be beneficial for motor impairments in Rett syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Assessment of mutation probabilities of KRAS G12 missense mutants and their long-timescale dynamics by atomistic molecular simulations and Markov state modeling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006458</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Tatu Pantsar, Sami Rissanen, Daniel Dauch, Tuomo Laitinen, Ilpo Vattulainen, Antti Poso&lt;/p&gt;

A mutated KRAS protein is frequently observed in human cancers. Traditionally, the oncogenic properties of KRAS missense mutants at position 12 (G12X) have been considered as equal. Here, by assessing the probabilities of occurrence of all &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; G12X mutations and KRAS dynamics we show that this assumption does not hold true. Instead, our findings revealed an outstanding mutational bias. We conducted a thorough mutational analysis of &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; G12X mutations and assessed to what extent the observed mutation frequencies follow a random distribution. Unique tissue-specific frequencies are displayed with specific mutations, especially with G12R, which cannot be explained by random probabilities. To clarify the underlying causes for the nonrandom probabilities, we conducted extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations (170 μs) to study the differences of G12X mutations on a molecular level. The simulations revealed an allosteric hydrophobic signaling network in KRAS, and that protein dynamics is altered among the G12X mutants and as such differs from the wild-type and is mutation-specific. The shift in long-timescale conformational dynamics was confirmed with Markov state modeling. A G12X mutation was found to modify KRAS dynamics in an allosteric way, which is especially manifested in the switch regions that are responsible for the effector protein binding. The findings provide a basis to understand better the oncogenic properties of KRAS G12X mutants and the consequences of the observed nonrandom frequencies of specific G12X mutations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wdtS34DOZ6k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Implications of alternative routes to APC/C inhibition by the mitotic checkpoint complex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006449</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Fridolin Gross, Paolo Bonaiuti, Silke Hauf, Andrea Ciliberto&lt;/p&gt;

The mitotic checkpoint (also called spindle assembly checkpoint) is a signaling pathway that ensures faithful chromosome segregation. Mitotic checkpoint proteins inhibit the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) and its activator Cdc20 to prevent precocious anaphase. Checkpoint signaling leads to a complex of APC/C, Cdc20, and checkpoint proteins, in which the APC/C is inactive. In principle, this final product of the mitotic checkpoint can be obtained via different pathways, whose relevance still needs to be fully ascertained experimentally. Here, we use mathematical models to compare the implications on checkpoint response of the possible pathways leading to APC/C inhibition. We identify a previously unrecognized funneling effect for Cdc20, which favors Cdc20 incorporation into the inhibitory complex and therefore promotes checkpoint activity. Furthermore, we find that the presence or absence of one specific assembly reaction determines whether the checkpoint remains functional at elevated levels of Cdc20, which can occur in cancer cells. Our results reveal the inhibitory logics behind checkpoint activity, predict checkpoint efficiency in perturbed situations, and could inform molecular strategies to treat malignancies that exhibit Cdc20 overexpression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/u46AEAiwxjk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Advillin is expressed in all adult neural crest-derived neurons</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Promoter-based genetic recombination (&lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; e.g. Cre-lox) is most useful when all cells of interest express a particular gene. The discovery that the actin-binding protein advillin is expressed in all somatic sensory neurons has been exploited repeatedly to drive DNA recombination therein, yet specificity of expression has not been well-demonstrated. Here we characterize advillin expression amongst sensory neurons, and in several other neural and non-neural tissues. We first validate an advillin antibody against advillin knockout tissue, advillin promoter-driven EGFP and advillin mRNA expression. In the dorsal root ganglion, advillin is enriched in non-peptidergic nociceptors. We also show that advillin expression, and advillin promotor-driven EGFP and Cre-recombinase expression, occurs in multiple tissues including the dorsal habenula of the epithalamus, endocrine cells of the gut, Merkel cells in the skin, and most strikingly, throughout the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric neurons) in mice, rats, and non-human primates. In the mouse pelvic ganglion, advillin immunoreactivity is most intense in pairs of small neurons, and concentrated in spine-like structures on the axon initial segment contacted by sympathetic preganglionic axons. In autonomic targets (iris and blood vessels), advillin is distributed along cholinergic parasympathetic axons and in sympathetic varicosities. Developmentally, advillin expression is absent from sympathetics at post-natal day 4, but begins to emerge by day 7, accounting for previous reports (based on embryonic expression) of advillin’s specificity to sensory neurons. These results indicate that caution is warranted in interpreting previous studies in which advillin-driven genomic editing is either constitutive or performed after post-natal day 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Cell-specific promoters are useful for effecting DNA recombination (e.g. via Cre-lox) for studies of lineage and gene function. Accordingly, advillin, an actin-binding protein expressed in all somatic sensory neurons, has proven valuable in manipulating gene expression therein. Whether advillin expression is &lt;i&gt;restricted&lt;/i&gt; to sensory neurons, which is crucial to ascribing primary afferent-specific roles of particular genes, has not been established. Here we show that advillin is also expressed throughout the adult autonomic and enteric nervous systems, the habenula, and endocrine cells of the skin and gut. Thus, while advillin promoter activity remains useful in achieving recombination in sensory neurons (and some other cells), caution is warranted in interpreting results of experiments in which outcomes depend on multiple advillin-expressing tissues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Comparing two classes of biological distribution systems using network analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006428</guid>

Distribution networks—from vasculature to urban transportation pathways—are spatially embedded networks that must route resources efficiently in the face of pressures induced by the costs of building and maintaining network infrastructure. Such requirements are thought to constrain the topological and spatial organization of these systems, but at the same time, different kinds of distribution networks may exhibit variable architectural features within those general constraints. In this study, we use methods from network science to compare and contrast two classes of biological transport networks: mycelial fungi and vasculature from the surface of rodent brains. These systems differ in terms of their growth and transport mechanisms, as well as the environments in which they typically exist. Though both types of networks have been studied independently, the goal of this study is to quantify similarities and differences in their network designs. We begin by characterizing the structural backbone of these systems with a collection of measures that assess various kinds of network organization across topological and spatial scales, ranging from measures of loop density, to those that quantify connected pathways between different network regions, and hierarchical organization. Most importantly, we next carry out a network analysis that directly considers the spatial embedding and properties especially relevant to the function of distribution systems. We find that although both the vasculature and mycelia are highly constrained planar networks, there are clear distinctions in how they balance tradeoffs in network measures of wiring length, efficiency, and robustness. While the vasculature appears well organized for low cost, but relatively high efficiency, the mycelia tend to form more expensive but in turn more robust networks. As a whole, this work demonstrates the utility of network-based methods to identify both common features and variations in the network structure of different classes of biological transport systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7ImdF3ExyLk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Co-evolution networks of HIV/HCV are modular with direct association to structure and function</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Ahmed Abdul Quadeer, David Morales-Jimenez, Matthew R. McKay&lt;/p&gt;

Mutational correlation patterns found in population-level sequence data for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) have been demonstrated to be informative of viral fitness. Such patterns can be seen as footprints of the intrinsic functional constraints placed on viral evolution under diverse selective pressures. Here, considering multiple HIV and HCV proteins, we demonstrate that these mutational correlations encode a modular co-evolutionary structure that is tightly linked to the structural and functional properties of the respective proteins. Specifically, by introducing a robust statistical method based on sparse principal component analysis, we identify near-disjoint sets of collectively-correlated residues (sectors) having mostly a one-to-one association to largely distinct structural or functional domains. This suggests that the distinct phenotypic properties of HIV/HCV proteins often give rise to quasi-independent modes of evolution, with each mode involving a sparse and localized network of mutational interactions. Moreover, individual inferred sectors of HIV are shown to carry immunological significance, providing insight for guiding targeted vaccine strategies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kynmmf_mza0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Why Is It so Hard to Do Good Science?</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Good science&quot; means answering important questions convincingly, a challenging endeavor under the best of circumstances. Our inability to replicate many biomedical studies has been the subject of numerous commentaries both in the scientific and lay press. In response, statistics has re-emerged as a necessary tool to improve the objectivity of study conclusions. However, psychological aspects of decision making introduce preconceived preferences into scientific judgment that cannot be eliminated by any statistical method. The psychology of decision making, expounded by Kahneman, Tversky, and Thayer, is well known in the field of economics, but the underlying concepts of cognitive psychology are also relevant to scientific judgments. I repeated experiments carried out on undergraduates by Kahneman and colleagues four to five decades ago, but with scientists, and obtained essentially the same results. The experiments were in the form of written reactions to scenarios, and participants were scientists at all career stages. The findings reinforce the roles that two inherent intuitions play in scientific decision making: our drive to create a coherent narrative from new data regardless of its quality or relevance and our inclination to seek patterns in data whether they exist or not. Moreover, we do not always consider how likely a result is regardless of its &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; value. Low statistical power and inattention to principles underpinning Bayesian statistics reduce experimental rigor, but mitigating skills can be learned. Overcoming our natural human tendency to make quick decisions and jump to conclusions is a deeper obstacle to doing good science; this too can be learned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Precisely wired neuronal circuits process sensory information in a learning- and context-dependent manner in order to govern behavior. Simple sensory decision-making tasks in rodents are now beginning to reveal the contributions of distinct cell types and brain regions participating in the conversion of sensory information into learned goal-directed motor output. Task learning is accompanied by target-specific routing of sensory information to specific downstream cortical regions, with higher-order cortical regions such as the posterior parietal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus appearing to play important roles in learning- and context-dependent processing of sensory input.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Network mechanisms underlying the role of oscillations in cognitive tasks</title>

Oscillatory activity robustly correlates with task demands during many cognitive tasks. However, not only are the network mechanisms underlying the generation of these rhythms poorly understood, but it is also still unknown to what extent they may play a functional role, as opposed to being a mere epiphenomenon. Here we study the mechanisms underlying the influence of oscillatory drive on network dynamics related to cognitive processing in simple working memory (WM), and memory recall tasks. Specifically, we investigate how the frequency of oscillatory input interacts with the intrinsic dynamics in networks of recurrently coupled spiking neurons to cause changes of state: the neuronal correlates of the corresponding cognitive process. We find that slow oscillations, in the delta and theta band, are effective in activating network states associated with memory recall. On the other hand, faster oscillations, in the beta range, can serve to clear memory states by resonantly driving transient bouts of spike synchrony which destabilize the activity. We leverage a recently derived set of exact mean-field equations for networks of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons to systematically study the bifurcation structure in the periodically forced spiking network. Interestingly, we find that the oscillatory signals which are most effective in allowing flexible switching between network states are not smooth, pure sinusoids, but rather burst-like, with a sharp onset. We show that such periodic bursts themselves readily arise spontaneously in networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and that the burst frequency can be tuned via changes in tonic drive. Finally, we show that oscillations in the gamma range can actually stabilize WM states which otherwise would not persist.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Bbt9ElVGJQM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Inter-nucleosomal communication between histone modifications for nucleosome phasing</title>

Combinatorial effects of epigenetic modifications on transcription activity have been proposed as “histone codes”. However, it is unclear whether there also exist inter-nucleosomal communications among epigenetic modifications at single nucleosome level, and if so, what functional roles they play. Meanwhile, how clear nucleosome patterns, such as nucleosome phasing and depletion, are formed at functional regions remains an intriguing enigma. To address these questions, we developed a Bayesian network model for interactions among different histone modifications across neighboring nucleosomes, based on the framework of dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). From this model, we found that robust inter-nucleosomal interactions exist around transcription start site (TSS), transcription termination sites (TTS) or around CTCF binding sites; and these inter-nucleosomal interactions are often involved in transcription regulation. In addition to these general principles, DBN also uncovered a novel specific epigenetic interaction between H2A.Z and H4K20me1 on neighboring nucleosomes, involved in nucleosome free region (NFR) and nucleosome phasing establishment or maintenance. The level of negative correlation between neighboring H2A.Z and H4K20me1 strongly correlate with the size of NFR and the strength of nucleosome phasing around TSS. Our study revealed inter-nucleosomal communications as important players in signal propagation, chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dbMl2WeMTC0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: GSK3β Inhibition Restores Impaired Neurogenesis in Preterm Neonates With Intraventricular Hemorrhage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy217</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy217/5091396?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a common complication of prematurity in infants born at 23–28 weeks of gestation. Survivors exhibit impaired growth of the cerebral cortex and neurodevelopmental sequeale, but the underlying mechanism(s) are obscure. Previously, we have shown that neocortical neurogenesis continues until at least 28 gestational weeks. This renders the prematurely born infants vulnerable to impaired neurogenesis. Here, we hypothesized that neurogenesis is impaired by IVH, and that signaling through GSK3β, a critical intracellular kinase regulated by Wnt and other pathways, mediates this effect. These hypotheses were tested observationally in autopsy specimens from premature infants, and experimentally in a premature rabbit IVH model. Significantly, in premature infants with IVH, the number of neurogenic cortical progenitor cells was reduced compared with infants without IVH, indicating acutely decreased neurogenesis. This finding was corroborated in the rabbit IVH model, which further demonstrated reduction of upper layer cortical neurons after longer survival. Both the acute reduction of neurogenic progenitors, and the subsequent decrease of upper layer neurons, were rescued by treatment with AR-A014418, a specific inhibitor of GSK3β. Together, these results indicate that IVH impairs late stages of cortical neurogenesis, and suggest that treatment with GSK3β inhibitors may enhance neurodevelopment in premature infants with IVH.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Cooperation Makes a Group be More Creative</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy215</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy215/5091390?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;This study investigated how cooperative and competitive interaction modes affect the group creative performance. The participants were recruited as dyads to solve 2 problems either demanding divergent thinking (alternative uses task, AUT) or not (object characteristic task, OCT). The dyads solved 1 of the 2 problems in the cooperative mode and the other in the competitive mode. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based hyperscanning was used to record their neural activities in the prefrontal and right temporal–parietal junction (r-TPJ) regions. Results revealed the dyads showed higher AUT fluency, AUT originality, OCT fluency, and cooperation level in the cooperative mode than in the competitive mode. The fNIRS data revealed increased (task-baseline) interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (r-DLPFC) and r-TPJ, only for dyads in the AUT/cooperation condition. In both r-DLPFC and r-TPJ, the IBS of dyads in the AUT/cooperation condition was stronger than in the AUT/competition and OCT/cooperation. Moreover, a stronger IBS was evoked between the regions in prefrontal and posterior temporal regions in the AUT/cooperation condition, as compared with the competition mode. These findings suggest that enhanced IBS may underlie the positive effects of cooperation as compared with the competition in terms of group creativity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Anticholinergic Amnesia is Mediated by Alterations in Human Network Connectivity Architecture</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Disrupted cholinergic neurotransmission plays a central role in Alzheimer’s disease, medication-induced memory impairment, and delirium. At the systems level, this suggests anticholinergic drugs may alter the activity and interplay of anatomically distributed neural networks critical for memory function. Using a network-sensitive imaging technique (functional connectivity MRI) and a double-blind, crossover design, we examined the consequences of anticholinergic drug administration on episodic memory and functional network architecture in a group of clinically normal elderly. We observed that low-dose scopolamine (0.2 mg IV) decreased episodic memory performance and selectively decreased connectivity strength in 3 of 7 cortical networks. Both memory and connectivity effects were independent of β-amyloid burden. Drug-induced connectivity changes within the Default and Salience networks, as well as reductions in the strength of anticorrelation between these 2 networks, were sufficient to fully statistically mediate the effects of scopolamine on memory performance. These results provide experimental support for the importance of the Default and Salience networks to memory performance and suggest scopolamine-induced amnesia is underpinned by disrupted connectivity within and between these 2 networks. More broadly, these results support the potential utility of fcMRI as tool examine the systems-level pharmacology of psychoactive drugs.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: It’s All in the Details: Relations Between Young Children’s Developing Pattern Separation Abilities and Hippocampal Subfield Volumes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy211</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy211/5091386?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The ability to keep similar experiences separate in memory is critical for forming unique and lasting memories, as many events share overlapping features (e.g., birthday parties, holidays). Research on memory in young children suggests their memories often lack high-resolution details, i.e., show impoverished pattern separation (PS). Recently developed assessments of PS suitable for children allow us to relate the formation of distinct, detailed memories for the development of the hippocampus, a neural structure critical for this ability in adults. The hippocampus displays a protracted developmental profile and underlies the ability to form detailed memories. This study examined age-related differences in hippocampal subfield volumes in 4- to 8-year-old children and relations with performance on a mnemonic similarity task (MST) designed to index memory specificity. Results revealed age-moderated associations between MST performance and cornu ammonis 2-4/dentate gyrus subfields. Specifically, age-related differences in the ability to form detailed memories tracked with normative patterns of volume increases followed by reductions over this age range. That is, greater volume correlated with better performance in younger children, whereas smaller volume correlated with better performance in older children. These findings support the hypothesis that developmental differences in hippocampal circuitry contribute to age-related improvements in detailed memory formation during this period.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: In Vivo Femtosecond Laser Subsurface Cortical Microtransections Attenuate Acute Rat Focal Seizures</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Recent evidence shows that seizures propagate primarily through supragranular cortical layers. To selectively modify these circuits, we developed a new technique using tightly focused, femtosecond infrared laser pulses to make as small as ~100 µm-wide subsurface cortical incisions surrounding an epileptic focus. We use this “laser scalpel” to produce subsurface cortical incisions selectively to supragranular layers surrounding an epileptic focus in an acute rodent seizure model. Compared with sham animals, these microtransections completely blocked seizure initiation and propagation in 1/3 of all animals. In the remaining animals, seizure frequency was reduced by 2/3 and seizure propagation reduced by 1/3. In those seizures that still propagated, it was delayed and reduced in amplitude. When the recording electrode was inside the partially isolated cube and the seizure focus was on the outside, the results were even more striking. In spite of these microtransections, somatosensory responses to tail stimulation were maintained but with reduced amplitude. Our data show that just a single enclosing wall of laser cuts limited to supragranular layers led to a significant reduction in seizure initiation and propagation with preserved cortical function. Modification of this concept may be a useful treatment for human epilepsy.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Transient Developmental Window of Fast-Spiking Interneuron Dysfunction in a Mouse Model of Dravet Syndrome</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dravet syndrome is a severe, childhood-onset epilepsy largely due to heterozygous loss-of-function mutation of the gene &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes the type 1 neuronal voltage-gated sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) channel α subunit Nav1.1. Prior studies in mouse models of Dravet syndrome (&lt;i&gt;Scn1a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice) indicate that, in cerebral cortex, Nav1.1 is predominantly expressed in GABAergic interneurons, in particular in parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking basket cell interneurons (PVINs). This has led to a model of Dravet syndrome pathogenesis in which Nav1.1 mutation leads to preferential dysfunction of interneurons, decreased synaptic inhibition, hyperexcitability, and epilepsy. However, such studies have been implemented at early developmental time points. Here, we performed electrophysiological recordings in acute brain slices prepared from male and female &lt;i&gt;Scn1a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice as well as age-matched wild-type littermate controls and found that, later in development, the excitability of PVINs had normalized. Analysis of action potential waveforms indirectly suggests a reorganization of axonal Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels in PVINs from &lt;i&gt;Scn1a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, a finding supported by immunohistochemical data showing elongation of the axon initial segment. Our results imply that transient impairment of action potential generation by PVINs may contribute to the initial appearance of epilepsy, but is not the mechanism of ongoing, chronic epilepsy in Dravet syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dravet syndrome is characterized by normal early development, temperature-sensitive seizures in infancy, progression to treatment-resistant epilepsy, developmental delay, autism, and sudden unexplained death due to mutation in &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; encoding the Na+ channel subunit Nav1.1. Prior work has revealed a preferential impact of Nav1.1 loss on the function of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. However, such data derive exclusively from recordings of neurons in young &lt;i&gt;Scn1a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Here, we show that impaired action potential generation observed in parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneurons (PVINs) in &lt;i&gt;Scn1a&lt;/i&gt;+/– mice during early development has normalized by postnatal day 35. This work suggests that a transient impairment of PVINs contributes to epilepsy onset, but is not the mechanism of ongoing, chronic epilepsy in Dravet syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Updating Beliefs under Perceived Threat</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/36/7901?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/36/7901?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans are better at integrating desirable information into their beliefs than undesirable information. This asymmetry poses an evolutionary puzzle, as it can lead to an underestimation of risk and thus failure to take precautionary action. Here, we suggest a mechanism that can speak to this conundrum. In particular, we show that the bias vanishes in response to perceived threat in the environment. We report that an improvement in participants' tendency to incorporate bad news into their beliefs is associated with physiological arousal in response to threat indexed by galvanic skin response and self-reported anxiety. This pattern of results was observed in a controlled laboratory setting (Experiment I), where perceived threat was manipulated, and in firefighters on duty (Experiment II), where it naturally varied. Such flexibility in how individuals integrate information may enhance the likelihood of responding to warnings with caution in environments rife with threat, while maintaining a positivity bias otherwise, a strategy that can increase well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The human tendency to be overly optimistic has mystified scholars and lay people for decades: How could biased beliefs have been selected over unbiased beliefs? Scholars have suggested that although the optimism bias can lead to negative outcomes, including financial collapse and war, it can also facilitate health and productivity. Here, we demonstrate that a mechanism generating the optimism bias, namely asymmetric information integration, evaporates under threat. Such flexibility could result in enhanced caution in dangerous environments while supporting an optimism bias otherwise, potentially increasing well-being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Activity and Connectivity Differences Underlying Inhibitory Control Across the Adult Life Span</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/36/7887?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/36/7887?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory control requires precise regulation of activity and connectivity within multiple brain networks. Previous studies have typically evaluated age-related changes in regional activity or changes in interregional interactions. Instead, we test the hypothesis that activity and connectivity make distinct, complementary contributions to performance across the life span and the maintenance of successful inhibitory control systems. A representative sample of healthy human adults in a large, population-based life span cohort performed an integrated Stop-Signal (SS)/No-Go task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 119; age range, 18–88 years). Individual differences in inhibitory control were measured in terms of the SS reaction time (SSRT), using the blocked integration method. Linear models and independent components analysis revealed that individual differences in SSRT correlated with both activity and connectivity in a distributed inhibition network, comprising prefrontal, premotor, and motor regions. Importantly, this pattern was moderated by age, such that the association between inhibitory control and connectivity, but not activity, differed with age. Multivariate statistics and out-of-sample validation tests of multifactorial functional organization identified differential roles of activity and connectivity in determining an individual's SSRT across the life span. We propose that age-related differences in adaptive cognitive control are best characterized by the joint consideration of multifocal activity and connectivity within distributed brain networks. These insights may facilitate the development of new strategies to support cognitive ability in old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The preservation of cognitive and motor control is crucial for maintaining well being across the life span. We show that such control is determined by both activity and connectivity within distributed brain networks. In a large, population-based cohort, we used a novel whole-brain multivariate approach to estimate the functional components of inhibitory control, in terms of their activity and connectivity. Both activity and connectivity in the inhibition network changed with age. But only the association between performance and connectivity, not activity, differed with age. The results suggest that adaptive control is best characterized by the joint consideration of multifocal activity and connectivity. These insights may facilitate the development of new strategies to maintain cognitive ability across the life span in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Wilfrid (Wil) Rall was an outstanding scientist and a unique person—warm and modest, despite being a scientific renaissance man. He is the founding father of the field of dendritic modeling and the developer of both cable theory and the compartmental modeling approach for studying dendrites and synaptic integration. He was the first to draw attention to the computational role of dendrites, to dendritic nonlinearities, and to plastic processes in dendritic spines. It is thanks to Rall’s 40 years of pioneering theoretical studies, dendrites have become the focus of worldwide research interest, culminating in the recent evidence that local dendritic processing may play a key role in behavior.</description>

	<description>Channelopathies are disorders that affect the function of ion channels, typically resulting in epilepsy. Smith et al. (2018) discover an unusual association between SCN3A, neuronal migration, and cortical folding, outlining sodium channels as important regulators of brain development.</description>

	<description>Active intracellular transport of organelles relies on the coordinated activities of cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin, ATP-dependent microtubule motor proteins. While axonemal dynein was discovered during the mid-1960s, it was not until the mid-1980s that kinesin was discovered by Ron Vale and colleagues, as reported in 1985. Their research demonstrated that the newly identified protein, isolated from both squid axoplasm and bovine brain, was independently capable of driving microtubule gliding or organelle movement.</description>

	<description>Using new methods to functionally dissect circuits, two papers from 2015 found enhanced synaptic properties of the inputs and outputs of hippocampal adult-born neurons specifically during a critical period of their development. These studies provided a circuit-level view of unique roles for new neurons and how they cope with the ever-changing environment.</description>

	<description>The ability of central synapses to undergo long-term potentiation (LTP) still captures the imagination of scientists and has become one of the most fascinating and deeply studied questions in modern neuroscience. By the mid-1990s, however, the field was deeply ensnarled in trying to answer a passionately dichotomous question: is LTP expressed by a pre- or a postsynaptic mechanism? Experimental results that could only be seen by many as being incontrovertibly contradictory presented a perplexing conundrum.</description>

	<description>Is an amygdala necessary to experience and perceive fear? Intriguing evidence comes from patient S.M. who lost her left and right amygdalae to disease. Initial testing suggested that S.M.’s most defining symptom was an inability to recognize fear in other people’s facial expressions. A fascinating paper by Adolphs and colleagues in 2005 examined one potential mechanism for this impairment: a failure to spontaneously attend to widened eyes, the most distinctive physical feature portrayed in symbolic fear expressions.</description>

Here we analyze what properties of fat in the mouth are sensed, by analyzing the responses of neurons in the macaque insular taste cortex, and two areas to which it projects the orbitofrontal cortex where the pleasantness of fat is represented, and the amygdala. We discovered that the firing rate responses of these fat-responsive neurons are correlated with the coefficient of sliding friction (CSF) and not with viscosity which reflects food thickness. Other, not fat-sensitive, neurons encoded viscosity and not the CSF. Neuronal population analyses confirmed that fat-responsive neurons conveyed information about the CSF but not about viscosity. Conversely the viscosity-sensitive neuronal population conveyed information about viscosity but not about the CSF. This new understanding of the representation of oral fat in the cerebral cortex and amygdala opens the way for the systematic development of foods with the pleasant mouthfeel of fat, together with ideal nutritional content and has great potential to contribute to healthy eating and a healthy body weight.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Beatboxers and Guitarists Engage Sensorimotor Regions Selectively When Listening to the Instruments They can Play</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Studies of classical musicians have demonstrated that expertise modulates neural responses during auditory perception. However, it remains unclear whether such expertise-dependent plasticity is modulated by the instrument that a musician plays. To examine whether the recruitment of sensorimotor regions during music perception is modulated by instrument-specific experience, we studied nonclassical musicians—beatboxers, who predominantly use their vocal apparatus to produce sound, and guitarists, who use their hands. We contrast fMRI activity in 20 beatboxers, 20 guitarists, and 20 nonmusicians as they listen to novel beatboxing and guitar pieces. All musicians show enhanced activity in sensorimotor regions (IFG, IPC, and SMA), but only when listening to the musical instrument they can play. Using independent component analysis, we find expertise-selective enhancement in sensorimotor networks, which are distinct from changes in attentional networks. These findings suggest that long-term sensorimotor experience facilitates access to the posterodorsal “how” pathway during auditory processing.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: KCC2 Regulates Dendritic Spine Formation in a Brain-Region Specific and BDNF Dependent Manner</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy198</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy198/5088308?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;KCC2 is the major chloride extruder in neurons. The spatiotemporal regulation of KCC2 expression orchestrates the developmental shift towards inhibitory GABAergic drive and the formation of glutamatergic synapses. Whether KCC2’s role in synapse formation is similar in different brain regions is unknown. First, we found that KCC2 subcellular localization, but not overall KCC2 expression levels, differed between cortex and hippocampus during the first postnatal week. We performed site-specific in utero electroporation of KCC2 cDNA to target either hippocampal CA1 or somatosensory cortical pyramidal neurons. We found that a premature expression of KCC2 significantly decreased spine density in CA1 neurons, while it had the opposite effect in cortical neurons. These effects were cell autonomous, because single-cell biolistic overexpression of KCC2 in hippocampal and cortical organotypic cultures also induced a reduction and an increase of dendritic spine density, respectively. In addition, we found that the effects of its premature expression on spine density were dependent on BDNF levels. Finally, we showed that the effects of KCC2 on dendritic spine were dependent on its chloride transporter function in the hippocampus, contrary to what was observed in cortex. Altogether, these results demonstrate that KCC2 regulation of dendritic spine development, and its underlying mechanisms, are brain-region specific.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Ca2+ Signals in Astrocytes Facilitate Spread of Epileptiform Activity</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Epileptic seizures are associated with increased astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling, but the fine spatiotemporal kinetics of the ictal astrocyte–neuron interplay remains elusive. By using 2-photon imaging of awake head-fixed mice with chronic hippocampal windows we demonstrate that astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals precede neuronal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations during the initial bout of kainate-induced seizures. On average, astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations preceded neuronal activity in CA1 by about 8 s. In subsequent bouts of epileptic seizures, astrocytes and neurons were activated simultaneously. The initial astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevation was abolished in mice lacking the type 2 inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-receptor (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Itpr2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;−/−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, we found that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Itpr2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;−/−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited 60% less epileptiform activity compared with wild-type mice when assessed by telemetric EEG monitoring. In both genotypes we also demonstrate that spreading depression waves may play a part in seizure termination. Our findings imply a role for astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals in ictogenesis.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Adenosine Receptor-Mediated Developmental Loss of Spike Timing-Dependent Depression in the Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy194</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy194/5088307?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Critical periods of synaptic plasticity facilitate the reordering and refining of neural connections during development, allowing the definitive synaptic circuits responsible for correct adult physiology to be established. Presynaptic spike timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) exists in the hippocampus, which depends on the activation of NMDARs and that probably fulfills a role in synaptic refinement. This t-LTD is present until the third postnatal week in mice, disappearing in the fourth week of postnatal development. We were interested in the mechanisms underlying this maturation related loss of t-LTD and we found that at CA3–CA1 synapses, presynaptic NMDA receptors (pre-NMDARs) are tonically active between P13 and P21, mediating an increase in glutamate release during this critical period of plasticity. Conversely, at the end of this critical period (P22–P30) and coinciding with the loss of t-LTD, these pre-NMDARs are no longer tonically active. Using immunogold electron microscopy, we demonstrated the existence of pre-NMDARs at Schaffer collateral synaptic boutons, where a decrease in the number of pre-NMDARs during development coincides with the loss of both tonic pre-NMDAR activation and t-LTD. Interestingly, this t-LTD can be completely recovered by antagonizing adenosine type 1 receptors (A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R), which also recovers the tonic activation of pre-NMDARs at P22–P30. By contrast, the induction of t-LTD was prevented at P13–P21 by an agonist of A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R, as was tonic pre-NMDAR activation. Furthermore, we found that the adenosine that mediated the loss of t-LTD during the fourth week of development is supplied by astrocytes. These results provide direct evidence for the mechanism that closes the window of plasticity associated with t-LTD, revealing novel events probably involved in synaptic remodeling during development.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Large-Scale Organization of the Hand Action Observation Network in Individuals Born Without Hands</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy212</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy212/5085442?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The human high-level visual cortex comprises regions specialized for the processing of distinct types of stimuli, such as objects, animals, and human actions. How does this specialization emerge? Here, we investigated the role of effector-specific visuomotor coupling experience in shaping the organization of the action observation network (AON) as a window on this question. Observed body movements are frequently coupled with corresponding motor codes, e.g., during monitoring one’s own movements and imitation, resulting in bidirectionally connected circuits between areas involved in body movements observation (e.g., of the hand) and the motor codes involved in their execution. If the organization of the AON is shaped by this effector-specific visuomotor coupling, then, it should not form for body movements that do not belong to individuals’ motor repertoire. To test this prediction, we used fMRI to investigate the spatial arrangement and functional properties of the hand and foot action observation circuits in individuals born without upper limbs. Multivoxel pattern decoding, pattern similarity, and univariate analyses revealed an intact hand AON in the individuals born without upper limbs. This suggests that the organization of the AON does not require effector-specific visuomotor coupling.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Mechanisms of Spontaneous Electrical Activity in the Developing Cerebral Cortex—Mouse Subplate Zone</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy205</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy205/5085438?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Subplate (SP) neurons exhibit spontaneous plateau depolarizations mediated by connexin hemichannels. Postnatal (P1–P6) mice show identical voltage pattern and drug-sensitivity as observed in slices from human fetal cortex; indicating that the mouse is a useful model for studying the cellular physiology of the developing neocortex. In mouse SP neurons, spontaneous plateau depolarizations were insensitive to blockers of: synaptic transmission (glutamatergic, GABAergic, or glycinergic), pannexins (probenecid), or calcium channels (mibefradil, verapamil, diltiazem); while highly sensitive to blockers of gap junctions (octanol), hemichannels (La&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, lindane, Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;), or glial metabolism (DLFC). Application of La&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (100 μM) does not exert its effect on electrical activity by blocking calcium channels. Intracellular application of Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; determined that Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive pores (putative connexin hemichannels) reside on the membrane of SP neurons. Immunostaining of cortical sections (P1–P6) detected connexins 26, and 45 in neurons, but not connexins 32 and 36. Vimentin-positive glial cells were detected in the SP zone suggesting a potential physiological interaction between SP neurons and radial glia. SP spontaneous activity was reduced by blocking glial metabolism with DFLC or by blocking purinergic receptors by PPADS. Connexin hemichannels and ATP release from vimentin-positive glial cells may underlie spontaneous plateau depolarizations in the developing mammalian cortex.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Maturation of the Human Cerebral Cortex During Adolescence: Myelin or Dendritic Arbor?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy204</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy204/5085433?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Previous in vivo studies revealed robust age-related variations in structural properties of the human cerebral cortex during adolescence. Neurobiology underlying these maturational phenomena is largely unknown. Here we employ a virtual-histology approach to gain insights into processes associated with inter-regional variations in cortical microstructure and its maturation, as indexed by magnetization transfer ratio (MTR). Inter-regional variations in MTR correlate with inter-regional variations in expression of genes specific to pyramidal cells (CA1) and ependymal cells; enrichment analyses indicate involvement of these genes in dendritic growth. On the other hand, inter-regional variations in the change of MTR during adolescence correlate with inter-regional profiles of oligodendrocyte-specific gene expression. Complemented by a quantitative hypothetical model of the contribution of surfaces associated with dendritic arbor (1631 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and myelin (48 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), these findings suggest that MTR signals are driven mainly by macromolecules associated with dendritic arbor while maturational changes in the MTR signal are associated with myelination.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Domain-Specific Diaschisis: Lesions to Parietal Action Areas Modulate Neural Responses to Tools in the Ventral Stream</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy183</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy183/5085437?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neural responses to small manipulable objects (“tools”) in high-level visual areas in ventral temporal cortex (VTC) provide an opportunity to test how anatomically remote regions modulate ventral stream processing in a domain-specific manner. Prior patient studies indicate that grasp-relevant information can be computed about objects by dorsal stream structures independently of processing in VTC. Prior functional neuroimaging studies indicate privileged functional connectivity between regions of VTC exhibiting tool preferences and regions of parietal cortex supporting object-directed action. Here we test whether lesions to parietal cortex modulate tool preferences within ventral and lateral temporal cortex. We found that lesions to the left anterior intraparietal sulcus, a region that supports hand-shaping during object grasping and manipulation, modulate tool preferences in left VTC and in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus. Control analyses demonstrated that neural responses to “place” stimuli in left VTC were unaffected by lesions to parietal cortex, indicating domain-specific consequences for ventral stream neural responses in the setting of parietal lesions. These findings provide causal evidence that neural specificity for “tools” in ventral and lateral temporal lobe areas may arise, in part, from online inputs to VTC from parietal areas that receive inputs via the dorsal visual pathway.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Drug-Induced Glucocorticoids and Memory for Substance Use</title>

	<description>The biological stress response of the body forms one of the foundations of adaptive behavior, including promoting (and impairing) different forms of memory. This response transcends stressful experiences and underlies reactions to challenges and even reinforcers such as addictive substances. Nevertheless, drug-induced stress responses are rarely incorporated into models of addiction. We propose here that drug-induced stress responses (particularly glucocorticoids) play a crucial role in addictive behavior by modulating the formation of memories for substance-use experiences.</description>
