	<title>The Cerebellum: Spinocerebellar Ataxia-Like Presentation of the M233V PSEN1 Mutation</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; gene is considered to be the most common gene, which is responsible for the development of an autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease with early onset and sometimes broad phenotype. We present a patient with a spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-like phenotype who was found to carry an M233V mutation. General and neurological exam was carried out. Brain MRI as well as genetic testing for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 17 were performed. The patient was then referred for a next-generation sequencing-based gene panel test with 723 genes included. A 26-year-old man of an Azerbaijani origin presented with a progressive impairment of coordination followed by memory impairment. Family history was positive for a similar disorder suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance. Brain MRI showed bilateral hippocampal atrophy (more pronounced in the left), as well as mild atrophy of the left temporoparietal cortex. Tests for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 17 came negative. Gene panel test showed c.697A &amp;gt; G heterozygous variant in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; gene leading to a M233V amino acid change, which was validated by a Sanger sequencing. So far, M233V mutation has not been associated with a combination of cerebellar and cognitive features at onset. Our case contributes to a better characterization of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; mutations and expands the phenotype of the M233V carriers. We propose to consider &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; mutations in patients presenting with an SCA-like phenotype but negative for common types of SCA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    &lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A prompt diagnosis and treatment of patients with autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (CA) with antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-Abs) may lead to a better prognosis. Herein, we report prodromal transient neurological symptoms that should raise clinical suspicion of CA with GAD-Abs. We initially identified a 70-year-old man who presented a first acute episode of vertigo, diplopia, and ataxia lasting 2 weeks. Two months later, he experienced a similar episode along with new-onset gaze-evoked nystagmus. After 4 months, downbeat nystagmus, left limb dysmetria, and gait ataxia progressively appeared, and an autoimmune CA was diagnosed based on the positivity of GAD-Abs in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We searched retrospectively for similar presentations in a cohort of 31 patients diagnosed with CA and GAD-Abs. We found 11 (35.4%) patients (all women, median age 62 years; 8/11 [72.7%] with autoimmune comorbidities) with transient neurological symptoms antedating CA onset by a median of 3 months, including vertigo in 9 (81.8%; described as paroxysmal in 8) and fluctuating diplopia in 3 (27.3%) patients. The identification of transient neurological symptoms of unknown etiology, such as paroxysmal vertigo and fluctuating diplopia, should lead to GAD-Abs testing in serum and CSF, especially in patients with autoimmune comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by storage of unesterified glycolipids and cholesterol in lysosome. NPC’s clinical presentation is highly heterogeneous, depending on the time of onset. It encompasses visceral, neurological, and/or psychiatric manifestations. As the motor findings are so important and devastating in this disease, there is a lack of description about non-motor symptoms, even though they play important role in quality of life of NPC patients. We described the most common non-motor findings in NPC like cognitive dysfunction, neuroimaging, psychiatric symptoms, sleep disorders, seizures, hearing problems, respiratory and other systemic features, bladder and fecal dysfunction, hypersalivation, and malnutrition. In this review, we highlighted the importance of these undervalued symptoms and their management. Specific measures of all aforementioned clinical features may work as relevant biomarkers in order to evaluate successful therapies in future clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Upward Gaze Palsy: a Valuable Sign to Distinguish Spinocerebellar Ataxias</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01154-2</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01154-2</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) represent a large group of heredodegenerative diseases, with great phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity. However, in the clinical neurological practice, some symptoms and signs might help differentiate the SCAs. This study’s aims were to evaluate the frequency of upward gaze palsy (UGP) and investigate its role in assisting in the clinical differentiation of SCAs. We included 419 patients with SCAs (248 with SCA3, 95 with SCA10, 38 with SCA2, 22 with SCA1, 12 with SCA7, and 4 with SCA6). This study compared UGP with other known markers of disease severity—age of onset, disease duration, SARA score, and size of CAG expansion, and also other semiologic features, as bulging eyes. This sign was significantly more prevalent in SCA3 (64.11%), compared with SCA10 (3.16%; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and other SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA7–11.84%; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). UGP showed very high sensibility ins SCA3 (92.9), although lacking of specificity (64.1%). The odds ratio (OR) of UGP were also very high, 23.52 (95% CI 12.38–44.69), and was significantly correlated with larger CAG expansions, age, and disease duration in SCA3 patients, but not with age of onset or severity of the ataxic syndrome. This study showed that UGP is highly suggestive of SCA3 and has high sensitivity for the differential diagnosis among SCAs, and it could be of great value for bedside semiologic tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Feasibility and Acceptability of Lee Silverman Voice Treatment in Progressive Ataxias</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01153-3</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Communication difficulties have considerable impact on people with progressive ataxia, yet there are currently no evidence-based treatments. LSVT LOUD® focuses on the production of healthy vocal loudness whilst also improving breath support, vocal quality, loudness and articulation in participating patients. This study aimed to investigate whether Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD®) can improve communication effectiveness in these patients. We performed a rater-blinded, single-arm study investigating LSVT LOUD® treatment in a population of patients with progressive ataxia including Friedreich’s ataxia (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 18), spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1), idiopathic cerebellar ataxia (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1), and spastic paraplegia 7 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1). Twenty-one patients were recruited to the study, with 19 completing treatment. Sessions were administered via Skype in the LSVT-X format, meaning two sessions per week over a period of 8 weeks. Assessments included two baseline and two post-treatment measures and focused on outcome measures covering aspects ranging from physiological function to impact and participation. Results indicate improvements in patient-perceived outcomes for 14 of the 19 participants, in both speech and psychosocial domains. Speech data furthermore demonstrate significant improvements in prolonged vowel duration, and voice quality measures. Intelligibility and naturalness evaluations showed no change post-treatment. Patients reported high acceptability of the treatment itself, as well as administration by Skype. This is the largest treatment study for people with progressive ataxia published to date. It provides an indication that LSVT LOUD® can have a positive impact on communication in this patient group and could form the basis for larger-scale trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Treatment of Primary Autoimmune Cerebellar Ataxia with Mycophenolate</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01152-4</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01152-4</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Immune-mediated ataxias account for a substantial number of sporadic otherwise idiopathic ataxias. Despite some well-characterised entities such as paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration where diagnostic markers exist, the majority of immune ataxias remained undiagnosed and untreated. We present here our experience in the treatment of suspected primary autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (PACA) using mycophenolate. All patients reported attend the Sheffield Ataxia Centre on a regular basis and had undergone extensive investigations, including genetic testing using next-generation sequencing, with other causes of ataxia excluded. The diagnosis of PACA was strongly suspected based on investigations, pattern of disease progression, and cerebellar involvement. Patients were treated with mycophenolate and monitored using MR spectroscopy of the cerebellar vermis. Thirty patients with PACA are reported here. Of these, 22 received mycophenolate (group 1). The remaining 8 were not on treatment (group 2-control group). Out of the 22 treated patients, 4 underwent serial MR spectroscopy prior to starting treatment and thus were used as controls making the total number of patients in the control group 12. The mean change of the MRS within the vermis (NAA/Cr area ratio) in the treatment group was + 0.144 ± 0.09 (improved) and in the untreated group − 0.155 ± 0.06 (deteriorated). The difference was significant. We also demonstrated a strong correlation between the spectroscopy and the SARA score. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of mycophenolate in the treatment of PACA. The results suggest that immune-mediated ataxias are potentially treatable, and that there is a need for early diagnosis to prevent permanent neurological deficit. The recently published diagnostic criteria for PACA would hopefully aid the diagnosis and treatment of this entity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Acoustic Speech Analytics Are Predictive of Cerebellar Dysfunction in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01151-5</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Speech production relies on motor control and cognitive processing and is linked to cerebellar function. In diseases where the cerebellum is impaired, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), speech abnormalities are common and can be detected by instrumental assessments. However, the potential of speech assessments to be used to monitor cerebellar impairment in MS remains unexplored. The aim of this study is to build an objectively measured speech score that reflects cerebellar function, pathology and quality of life in MS. Eighty-five people with MS and 21 controls participated in the study. Speech was independently assessed through objective acoustic analysis and blind expert listener ratings. Cerebellar function and overall disease disability were measured through validated clinical scores; cerebellar pathology was assessed via magnetic resonance imaging, and validated questionnaires informed quality of life. Selected speech variables were entered in a regression model to predict cerebellar function. The resulting model was condensed into one composite speech score and tested for prediction of abnormal 9-hole peg test (9HPT), and for correlations with the remaining cerebellar scores, imaging measurements and self-assessed quality of life. Slow rate of syllable repetition and increased free speech pause percentage were the strongest predictors of cerebellar impairment, complemented by phonatory instability. Those variables formed the acoustic composite score that accounted for 54% of variation in cerebellar function, correlated with cerebellar white matter volume (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.3, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p =&lt;/em&gt; 0.017), quality of life (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.5, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and predicted an abnormal 9HPT with 85% accuracy. An objective multi-feature speech metric was highly representative of motor cerebellar impairment in MS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Trehalose in Machado-Joseph Disease: Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01150-6</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01150-6</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is relatively prevalent among the Yemenite Jewish subpopulation living in Israel. Currently, there is no treatment able to modify the disease progression. Trehalose is a disaccharide with protein-stabilizing and autophagy-enhancing properties. In animal models of MJD, trehalose showed reduction of cerebellar lesion size and improved motor function. This study was designed to be a proof-of-concept, phase 2 study lasting 6 to 12 months, to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of weekly IV administration of 15 g or 30 g 10% trehalose solution in 14 MJD patients. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, which were assessed by various clinical and laboratory tests. Secondary endpoints were changes in the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score, Neurological Examination Score for Spinocerebellar Ataxia (NESSCA), time to do 9-hole peg test (9HPT), time to do 8-meter walk (8MW), and quality of life assessed by the World Health Organization Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-BREF (WHOQoL-BREF). Trehalose was well tolerated, and no serious drug-related adverse events were noted. The average SARA score, NESSCA, and time to do 9HPT and 8MW and the WHOQoL-BREF for all patients remained stable at 6 months. Six patients received treatment for as long as 12 months and continued to remain stable on all the above tests. IV trehalose seems to be safe in humans and probably effective to stabilize neurological impairment in MJD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: EMG Rectification Is Detrimental for Identifying Abnormalities in Corticomuscular and Intermuscular Coherence in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2</title>

	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01149-z</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Corticomuscular and intermuscular coherence (CMC, IMC) reflect connectivity between neuronal activity in the motor cortex measured by electroencephalography (EEG) and muscular activity measured by electromyography (EMG), or between activity in different muscles, respectively. There is an ongoing debate on the appropriateness of EMG rectification prior to coherence estimation. This work examines the effects of EMG rectification in CMC and IMC estimation in 20 spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) patients, 16 prodromal SCA2 gene mutation carriers, and 26 healthy controls during a repetitive upper or lower limb motor task. Coherence estimations were performed using the non-rectified raw EMG signal vs. the rectified EMG signal. EMG rectification decreases the level of significance of lower beta-frequency band CMC and IMC values in SCA2 patients and prodromal SCA2 mutation carriers vs. healthy controls, and also results in overall lower coherence values. EMG rectification is detrimental for beta-frequency band CMC and IMC estimation. One likely reason for this effect is distortion of coherence estimation in high-frequency signals, where the level of amplitude cancelation is high.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Intermittent Cerebellar Theta Burst Stimulation Improves Visuo-motor Learning in Stroke Patients: a Pilot Study</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The cerebellum plays a critical role in promoting learning of new motor tasks, which is an essential function for motor recovery. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the cerebellum can be used to enhance learning. In this study, we investigated the effects of cerebellar intermittent theta burst stimulation (c-iTBS), a high-frequency rTMS protocol, on visuo-motor learning in a sample of hemiparetic patients due to recent stroke in the territory of the contralateral middle cerebral artery. Eight stroke patients were enrolled for the purposes of the study in the chronic stage of recovery (i.e., at least 6 months after stroke). In two sessions, Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with real or sham c-iTBS applied over the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the affected body side. c-iTBS was applied immediately before the learning phase of a visuo-motor adaptation task. Real, but not sham, c-iTBS improved visuo-motor learning as revealed by an increased performance in of the learning phase of the visuo-moto adaptation task. Moreover, we also found that real but not sham c-iTBS induced a sustained improvement in the re-adaptation of the recently learned skill (i.e., when patients were re-tested after 30 min). Taken together, these data point to c-iTBS as a potential novel strategy to promote motor learning in patients with stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Chromosomal microarray analysis is commonly used as screening test for children with neurodevelopmental issues, also in case of complex neurological phenotypes. Developmental delay/intellectual disability is a common presentation sign in pediatric ataxias, diseases with high clinical and genetic heterogeneity. In order to determine the diagnostic yield of Array-CGH in such conditions, all the tests performed in the last 10-year activity of a single referral center in children who present, besides the neurodevelopmental impairment, cerebellar abnormalities have been systematically gathered. The study demonstrates that, except for Dandy-Walker malformation or poly-malformative phenotypes, chromosomal microarray analysis should be discouraged as first-line diagnostic test in pediatric ataxias with neurodevelopmental disability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We sought to assess structural and functional patterns of cerebellum in multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type), and investigate the associations of structural and functional cerebellar gray matter abnormalities. We collected magnetic resonance imaging data of 18 patients with multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type) and 18 health control subjects. The gray matter loss across the motor and cognitive cerebellar territories in patients was assessed using voxel-based morphometry. And change in the connectivity between the cerebellum and large-scale cortical networks was assessed using resting-state functional MRI analysis. Furthermore, we assessed the relationship between the extent of cerebellar atrophy and reduced-activation in the cerebellar-cortical and subthalamo-cerebellar functional connectivities. We confirmed the gray matter loss across the motor and cognitive cerebellar territories in patients and found that the extent of cerebellar atrophy was correlated with decreased connectivity between the cerebellum and large-scale cortical networks, including the default, frontal parietal, and sensorimotor networks. The volume reduction in the motor cerebellum was closely associated with the clinical motor severity. A post hoc analysis showed reduced-activation in the subthalamo-cerebellar functional connectivity without the subthalamic nucleus atrophy. These results emphasized significant atrophy in the cerebellar subsystem and its association with the large-scale cortical networks in multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type), which may improve our understanding of the neural pathophysiology mechanisms of disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar volume, in particular vermal lobule areas VI–VII, have been extensively researched in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), although findings are often unclear. The aim of the present study is to consolidate all existing cerebellar and age data of individuals with ASD, and compare this data to typically developing (TD) controls. Raw data, or the means and standard deviations of cerebellar volume and age, were obtained from 17 studies (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellum&lt;/sub&gt;: 421 ASD and 370 TD participants; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VI–VII&lt;/sub&gt;: 506 ASD and 290 TD participants). Total cerebellar volume, or VI–VII area, was plotted against age and lines of fit of ASD and TD data were compared. Mean differences in cerebellar volume and VI–VII area between participants with ASD and TD participants were then compared via ANCOVA analyses. Findings revealed multiple differences in VI–VII area between participants with ASD and TD participants below 18 years of age. Additionally, cerebellar volume was greater in males with ASD than TD males between 2 and 4 years. In the present study, cerebellar volume and VI–VII area show different rates of change across age for those with autism compared with those without. These morphological differences provide a neurobiological justification to investigate related behavioural correlates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Shh-Mediated Increase in β-Catenin Levels Maintains Cerebellar Granule Neuron Progenitors in Proliferation</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) give rise to the cerebellar granule neurons in the developing cerebellum. Generation of large number of these neurons is made possible by the high proliferation rate of CGNPs in the external granule layer (EGL) in the dorsal cerebellum. Here, we show that upregulation of β-catenin can maintain murine CGNPs in a state of proliferation. Further, we show that β-catenin mRNA and protein levels can be regulated by the mitogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Shh signaling led to an increase in the level of the transcription factor N-myc. N-myc was found to bind the β-catenin promoter, and the increase in β-catenin mRNA and protein levels could be prevented by blocking N-myc upregulation downstream of Shh signaling. Furthermore, blocking Wingless-type MMTV integration site (Wnt) signaling by Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor Dickkopf 1 (Dkk-1) in the presence of Shh did not prevent the upregulation of β-catenin. We propose that in culture, Shh signaling regulates β-catenin expression through N-myc and results in increased CGNP proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Efficacy of inhibitory control depends on procrastination and deceleration in saccade planning</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A goal-directed flexible behavior warrants our ability to timely inhibit impending movements deemed inappropriate due to an abrupt change in the context. Race model of countermanding rapid saccadic eye movement posits a competition between a preparatory GO process and an inhibitory STOP process rising to reach a fixed threshold. Stop-signal response time (SSRT), which is the average time STOP takes to rise to the threshold, is widely used as a metric to assess the ability to revoke a movement. A reliable estimation of SSRT critically depends on the assumption of independence between GO and STOP process, which has been violated in many studies. In addition, the physiological correlate of stochastic rise of STOP process to a threshold remains unsubstantiated thus far. Here, we introduce a method to estimate the efficacy of inhibitory control on the premise of an alternative model that assumes deceleration of GO process following the stop-signal onset. The average reaction time increased exponentially with the increase in the maximum duration available to attenuate GO process by the stop-signal. Our method estimates saccade procrastination in anticipation of the stop-signal, and the rate of increase in attenuation on GO process. Unlike SSRT, these new metrics are independent of how the stopping performance varies with the delay between go- and stop-signal onsets. We reckon that these metrics together qualify to be considered as an efficient alternative to SSRT for the estimation of individuals’ ability to countermand saccades, especially in cases when the assumptions of race model are no longer valid.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Participation of ipsilateral cortical descending influences in bimanual wrist movements in humans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-020-05899-4</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;There are contralateral and less studied ipsilateral (i), indirect cortical descending projections to motoneurons (MNs). We compared ipsilateral cortical descending influences on MNs of wrist flexors by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the right primary motor cortex at actively maintained flexion and extension wrist positions in uni- and bimanual tasks in right-handed participants (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 23). The iTMS response includes a short latency (~ 25 ms) motor evoked potential (iMEP), a silent period (iSP) and a long latency (~ 60 ms) facilitation called rebound (iRB). We also investigated whether the interaction between the two hands while holding an object in a bimanual task involves ipsilateral cortical descending influences. In the unimanual task, iTMS responses in the right wrist flexors were unaffected by changes in wrist position. In the bimanual task with an object, iMEPs in the right wrist flexors were larger when the ipsilateral wrist was in flexion compared to extension. Without the object, only iRB were larger when the ipsilateral wrist was extended. Thus, ipsilateral cortical descending influences on MNs were modulated only in bimanual tasks and depended on how the two hands interacted. It is concluded that the left and right cortices cooperate in bimanual tasks involving holding an object with both hands, with possible involvement of oligo- and poly-synaptic, as well as transcallosal projections to MNs. The possible involvement of spinal and transcortical stretch and cutaneous reflexes in bimanual tasks when holding an object is discussed in the context of the well-established notion that indirect, referent control underlies motor actions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Performance of discrete, reciprocal, and cyclic movements of the ipsilesional upper limb in individuals after stroke</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Aiming movements of the upper limbs can be classified either as discrete, or reciprocal, or cyclic. The control of these movements after a stroke can be affected. The aim of this experimental, cross-sectional study was to characterize the performance of these movements after the right and left hemisphere chronic stroke. Thirty-six individuals aged between 40 and 70 years, right-handed, were allocated into three groups (control, right stroke, and left stroke). Participants were asked to perform aiming movements on a tablet. Individuals after stroke performed the tasks only with their ipsilesional limb, while the control group performed movements with both limbs. The reaction and movement times, peak velocity, and the variability and error of the endpoint were analyzed. Individuals after stroke presented a worse performance in all movement classes as expected, but differently depending on the damaged hemisphere. Participants with right hemisphere damage showed larger endpoint errors, while those with left hemisphere damage had longer reaction and movement times. Both differences were seen consistently in discrete and reciprocal, but not in cyclic movements. Cyclic movements presented shorter latencies, were faster, and showed greater endpoint errors when compared to discrete and reciprocal movements. These results suggest that stroke affects differently the performance of discrete and reciprocal movements according to the hemisphere lesion side, but not in cyclic movements. Different levels of motor control among the three classes of movements by the nervous system may justify these results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Intracerebroventricular streptozotocin administration impairs mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and bioenergetics in memory-sensitive rat brain regions</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with cardinal manifestation of cognitive dysfunction. The limitation to avail a successful drug candidate encourages researchers to establish an appropriate animal model in the novel anti-AD drug discovery process. In this context, the mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction in cognitive deficit animals is yet to be established for intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (ICV-STZ). Experimental dementia was induced in male rats by ICV-STZ on day-1 (D-1) of the experimental protocol at a sub-diabetogenic dose (3 mg/kg) twice at an interval of 48 h into both rat lateral ventricles. ICV-STZ caused cognitive decline in terms of increase in the escape latency on D-14 to D-17 and, decrease in the time spent and percentage of distance travelled in the target quadrant during Morris water maze and decrease in the spontaneous alteration behavior during Y-maze tests in rats. Further, ICV-STZ decreased the level of acetylcholine and activity of choline acetyltransferase and increased the activity of acetylcholinesterase in rat hippocampus, pre-frontal cortex and amygdala. Interestingly, ICV-STZ increased the mitochondrial calcium in addition to decrease in the mitochondrial function, integrity and bioenergetics in all rat brain regions. Further, ICV-STZ enhanced the levels of expression of NR1 subunit of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;-methyl-&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis type-small-caps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-aspartate receptor, mitochondrial calcium uniporter and sodium-calcium exchanger in these rat brain regions. Thus, NR1-dependent mitochondrial calcium accumulation could be considered as a major attribute to the animal model of ICV-STZ-induced AD-like manifestations. Further, drugs targeting to manage mitochondrial calcium homeostasis could best be studied in this animal model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Combining the intersubject correlation analysis and the multivariate distance matrix regression to evaluate associations between fNIRS signals and behavioral data from ecological experiments</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The development of methods to analyze data acquired using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in experiments similar to real-life situations is of great value in modern applied neuroscience. One of the most used methods to analyze fNIRS signals consists of the application of the general linear model on the observed hemodynamic signals. However, it implies limitations on the experimental design that must be constrained by triggers related to the stimuli protocols (such as block design or event related). In this work, a novel methodology is proposed to overcome such restrictions and allow more flexible protocols. The method combines the intersubject correlation analysis and the multivariate distance matrix regression to evaluate the brain–behavior relationship of subjects submitted to experiments with no trigger-based protocols. Its applicability is demonstrated throughout a naturalistic experiment about emotions conveyed by music. Thirty-two participants freely listened to instrumental excerpts from the operatic repertoire and reported the valences of the emotions conveyed by the musical segments. The method was able to find a statistically significant correlation between the subjects’ fNIRS signals and valences of their emotional responses, for the excerpt that evoked the most negative valence. This result illustrates the potential of this approach as an alternative method to analyze fNIRS signals from experiments in which block design or task-related paradigms might not be suitable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Several tests of mental rotation ability have been used to investigate its development and the origins of sex differences. One of the most used tests is the mental rotation test (MRT) by Vandenberg and Kuse. A limitation of the MRT is that it is a pen-and-paper test with 2D images of 3D objects. This is a challenge to the ecological validity of the MRT because mental rotation typically involves physical 3D objects that are also physically manipulated. The purpose of the present study was to compare mental rotation ability as evaluated by the MRT to three new tasks with physical objects (toy bricks) that were physically manipulated. The different tasks allowed us to vary the processing demands on mental rotation while standardizing other aspects of the tasks. Fifty-nine females and twenty-eight males completed the LMR and HMR conditions (low- and high-mental rotation demands, respectively) of the brick building task (BBT), a visual search task, and the MRT. As demands on mental rotation for the BBT increased, performance decreased and a sex difference, with males outperforming females, increased. There were correlations between all tasks, but they were larger between the versions of the BBT with the MRT. The results suggest that spatial skill is an assembly of interrelated subskills and that the sex difference is sensitive to the demands on mental rotation and dimensionality crossing. The benefits of the BBT are that it is ecologically valid, avoids dimensionality crossing, and the demands on mental rotation can be manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Perceived pleasantness of gentle touch in healthy individuals is related to salivary oxytocin response and EEG markers of arousal</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Affective touch plays an important role in human social bonding, affiliative behavior, and in general emotional well-being. A system of unmyelinated low-threshold mechanosensitive C-type afferents innervating hairy skin (C-tactile or CT system) is postulated to provide the neurophysiological background of affective touch perception. C-tactile afferents respond optimally to soft and slow strokes, and this response correlates positively with pleasure ratings of tactile stimuli. As gentle touch is consistently associated with oxytocin release further promoting prosocial behavior, it has been suggested that this effect is mediated by the response of C-tactile afferents. This study assesses a possible link between CT-optimal touch, its subjective pleasantness, EEG indices of cortical arousal, and peripheral oxytocin response. EEG was recorded in 28 healthy volunteers during resting state and tactile stimulation[gentle slow brush strokes on forearm (CT-targeted touch) and palm (non-CT-targeted touch)]. Saliva samples were collected before and after the touch stimulation. Oxytocin concentration increase was significantly associated with greater subjective ratings of CT-targeted touch but not of non-CT-targeted touch, and with lower peak alpha frequency values indicating decreased cortical arousal. The findings suggest that CT-targeted stimulation triggers oxytocin release but only when the touch is perceived at an individual level as having clearly positive affective salience. This corresponds to previous studies reporting that oxytocin response to touch can be related to different personality factors, and bears important implications for planning touch-based interventions in social and medical care.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Embodying melody through a conducting baton: a pilot comparison between musicians and non-musicians</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Finger-tapping tasks have been widely adopted to investigate auditory-motor synchronization, i.e., the coupling of movement with an external auditory rhythm. However, the discrete nature of these movements usually limits their application to the study of beat perception in the context of isochronous rhythms. The purpose of the present pilot study was to test an innovative task that allows investigating bodily responses to complex, non-isochronous rhythms. A conductor’s baton was provided to 16 healthy subjects, divided into 2 different groups depending on the years of musical training they had received (musicians or non-musicians). Ad hoc-created melodies, including notes of different durations, were played to the subjects. Each subject was asked to move the baton up and down according to the changes in pitch contour. Software for video analysis and modelling (Tracker&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;) was used to track the movement of the baton tip. The main parameters used for the analysis were the velocity peaks in the vertical axis. In the musician group, the number of velocity peaks exactly matched the number of notes, while in the non-musician group, the number of velocity peaks exceeded the number of notes. An exploratory data analysis using Poincaré plots suggested a greater degree of coupling between hand–arm movements and melody in musicians both with isochronous and non-isochronous rhythms. The calculated root mean square error (RMSE) between the note onset times and the velocity peaks, and the analysis of the distribution of velocity peaks in relationship to note onset times confirmed the effect of musical training. Notwithstanding the small number of participants, these results suggest that this novel behavioural task could be used to investigate auditory-motor coupling in the context of music in an ecologically valid setting. Furthermore, the task may be used for rhythm training and rehabilitation in neurological patients with movement disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Neuromorphometric changes associated with photostimulated migratory phenotype in the Palaearctic–Indian male redheaded bunting</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Neural substrates, including brain areas, differential gene expression and neuroendocrine basis, of migration are known. However, very little is known about structural changes in the brain that underlie the development and cessation of migration in long-distance avian migrants. Towards this, we investigated neuromorphological changes in the higher-order associative areas in male redheaded bunting (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Emberiza bruniceps&lt;/em&gt;), which is a Palaearctic–Indian night migrant with wintering grounds in India. Photosensitive birds (8L:16D; SD) were exposed to stimulatory long days (16L:8D; LD), with controls retained on non-stimulatory short days. LD birds depicted shifts to, and sustained night-time activity as recorded by actograms. LD birds demonstrated increased body mass, fat deposition and testicular volume in keeping with the migratory phenotype. When LD birds had exhibited 10.0 ± 2.4 cycles of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Zugunruhe&lt;/em&gt; (intense nighttime activity in captives, akin to night migratory flight in the wild), bird brains were fixed by transcardial perfusion, and changes in the neuronal morphometry of pallial, sub-pallial and hypothalamic brain regions studied using rapid Golgi technique with modifications, as used and validated in our laboratory. There were significant differences in both area and perimeter of soma in the visual hyperpallium apicale implicated in migratory orientation and the neuroendocrine control region for timing of migration, the mediobasal hypothalamus. We attribute these neuromorphometric changes in the soma area and perimeter to the photostimulated changes associated with the development of migration and reproductive phenotypes in redheaded buntings. It is suggested that changes in the neuronal plasticity in brain control regions parallel photoperiod-induced physiological responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: A single bout of moderate intensity exercise improves cognitive flexibility: evidence from task-switching</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Executive function entails the core components of response  inhibition, working memory and cognitive flexibility. An accumulating literature has shown that a single bout of exercise improves the response inhibition  and working memory components of executive function; however, limited work has examined a putative exercise-related improvement to cognitive flexibility. To address this limitation, Experiment 1 entailed a 20-min session of moderate intensity aerobic exercise (via cycle ergometer), and pre- and post-exercise cognitive flexibility was examined via a task-switching paradigm involving alternating pro- and antisaccades (AABB: A = prosaccade, B = antisaccade). In Experiment 2, participants sat on the cycle ergometer without exercising (i.e., rest break) and the same AABB paradigm was examined pre- and post-break. We used an AABB pro- and antisaccade paradigm because previous work has shown that a prosaccade preceded by an antisaccade exhibits a reliable—and large magnitude—increase in reaction time, whereas the converse switch does not (i.e., &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;the unidirectional prosaccade switch&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;cost&lt;/em&gt;). Experiment 1 showed a unidirectional prosaccade switch-cost pre-exercise (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = .012)—but not post-exercise (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = .30), and a two one-sided &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; test indicated that the latter comparison was within an equivalence boundary (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .01). In contrast, Experiment 2 revealed a unidirectional prosaccade switch-cost at pre- and post-break assessments (ps &amp;lt; .01). Accordingly, our results indicate that a single bout of exercise improves cognitive flexibility and provides convergent evidence that exercise improves global components of executive function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Balance maintenance in response to a perturbation could be affected by the predictability of the magnitude of the body disturbance. We investigated anticipatory (APAs) and compensatory (CPAs) postural adjustments in response to perturbations of predictable and unpredictable magnitudes. Twenty young adults received series of perturbations of small or large magnitudes the order of which was varied. Electromyographic activity of six leg and trunk muscles and displacements of the center-of-pressure (COP) were recorded. The muscle onset time, integrals of muscle activity, and COP displacements in the anterior–posterior direction were analyzed during the APA and CPA phases. The results indicated that when the participants were exposed to the repeated perturbation magnitude, it became predictable and they generated APAs more precisely according to the magnitudes of the perturbation. Moreover, when the magnitude of perturbation changed unpredictably, the participants overestimated or underestimated the magnitudes of the perturbation, as they generated APAs based on their prior experience of dealing with the perturbation. The optimal adjustment of APAs occurred after five trials of repeated perturbations. The findings imply that the process of APAs and CPAs generation depends on the accuracy of the predictability of perturbation magnitudes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Starting position effects in the measurement of the postural vertical for pusher behavior</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pusher behavior (PB) is a severe lateral postural disorder that involves a disturbed subjective postural vertical (SPV) in the frontal plane. SPV is measured by determining the mean value and standard deviation of several trials beginning on both the contralesional- and ipsilesional-tilted positions. However, the postural representation, when passively tilted to the contralesional versus ipsilesional position, is different between patients with and without PB. Therefore, we hypothesized that SPV dependence on the starting position will be influenced by PB. For 53 patients with hemispheric stroke enrolled, SPV was measured using a non-motorized vertical board with eyes closed. The mean value (tilt direction) and standard deviation (variability) were calculated in four trials, each from two positions, with the patient tilted to the contralesional position (SPV-CL condition) and then to the ipsilesional position (SPV-IL condition). Patients were categorized into the non-pusher (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 29) and pusher (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 24) groups. In the SPV-CL trials, the tilt direction was significantly tilted contralesionally for the pusher group (− 6.3° ± 1.6°) compared with that for the non-pusher group (− 2.2° ± 1.8°; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), with no significant difference in variability between the groups. In the SPV-IL trials, the tilt direction was not significantly different between the groups, but the variability was significantly higher in the pusher group (4.8° ± 2.0°) than in the non-pusher group (2.2° ± 1.3°; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). The dependence of tilt direction and variability of SPV on the starting position in patients with PB differed from those noted in patients without PB. These results may help explain this abnormal posture and optimize neurological rehabilitation strategies for PB.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: The limited contribution of early visual cortex in visual working memory for surface roughness</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Are visual representations in the human early visual cortex necessary for visual working memory (VWM)? Previous studies suggest that VWM is underpinned by distributed representations across several brain regions, including the early visual cortex. Notably, in these studies, participants had to memorize images under consistent visual conditions. However, in our daily lives, we must retain the essential visual properties of objects despite changes in illumination or viewpoint. The role of brain regions—particularly the early visual cortices—in these situations remains unclear. The present study investigated whether the early visual cortex was essential for achieving stable VWM. Focusing on VWM for object surface properties, we conducted fMRI experiments, while male and female participants performed a delayed roughness discrimination task in which sample and probe spheres were presented under varying illumination. By applying multi-voxel pattern analysis to brain activity in regions of interest, we found that the ventral visual cortex and intraparietal sulcus were involved in roughness VWM under changing illumination conditions. In contrast, VWM was not supported as robustly by the early visual cortex. These findings show that visual representations in the early visual cortex alone are insufficient for the robust roughness VWM representation required during changes in illumination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Activation Relaxation: A Local Dynamical Approximation to Backpropagation in the Brain. (arXiv:2009.05359v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Can the powerful backpropagation of error (backprop) reinforcement learning
algorithm be formulated in a manner suitable for implementation in neural
circuitry? The primary challenge is to ensure that any candidate formulation
uses only local information, rather than relying on global (error) signals, as
in orthodox backprop. Recently several algorithms for approximating backprop
using only local signals, such as predictive coding and equilibrium-prop, have
been proposed. However, these algorithms typically impose other requirements
which challenge biological plausibility: for example, requiring complex and
precise connectivity schemes (predictive coding), or multiple sequential
backwards phases with information being stored across phases
(equilibrium-prop). Here, we propose a novel local algorithm, Activation
Relaxation (AR), which is motivated by constructing the backpropagation
gradient as the equilibrium point of a dynamical system. Our algorithm
converges robustly and exactly to the correct backpropagation gradients,
requires only a single type of neuron, utilises only a single backwards phase,
and can perform credit assignment on arbitrary computation graphs. We
illustrate these properties by training deep neural networks on visual
classification tasks, and we describe simplifications to the algorithm which
remove further obstacles to neurobiological implementation (for example, the
weight-transport problem, and the use of nonlinear derivatives), while
preserving performance.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Integration of Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire-Neurons in Deep Learning Architectures. (arXiv:2004.13532v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13532</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13532</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Up to now, modern Machine Learning is mainly based on fitting high
dimensional functions to enormous data sets, taking advantage of huge hardware
resources. We show that biologically inspired neuron models such as the
Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons provide novel and efficient ways of
information encoding. They can be integrated in Machine Learning models, and
are a potential target to improve Machine Learning performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, we derived simple update-rules for the LIF units from the differential
equations, which are easy to numerically integrate. We apply a novel approach
to train the LIF units supervisedly via backpropagation, by assigning a
constant value to the derivative of the neuron activation function exclusively
for the backpropagation step. This simple mathematical trick helps to
distribute the error between the neurons of the pre-connected layer. We apply
our method to the IRIS blossoms image data set and show that the training
technique can be used to train LIF neurons on image classification tasks.
Furthermore, we show how to integrate our method in the KERAS (tensorflow)
framework and efficiently run it on GPUs. To generate a deeper understanding of
the mechanisms during training we developed interactive illustrations, which we
provide online.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this study we want to contribute to the current efforts to enhance
Machine Intelligence by integrating principles from biology.

	<description>The brain can rapidly process and transfer information between cortical brain networks by dynamically transitioning between brain states. Here we study the switching activity between functional brain networks that have been estimated at various spatial scales from n = 100 to n = 1000 using resting-state fMRI data. We also generate timeseries at different temporal scales from milliseconds to seconds using whole-brain modelling. We calculate the entropy of switching activity between functional brain networks which represents the richness of the dynamical repertoire. We provide evidence that the entropy of functional network occurrence follows an inverted U-shaped curve with a maximum at a spatial scale between 200 and 300 regions and at a temporal scale of 200 milliseconds.</description>

	<description>Naturalistic stimuli, such as movies, activate a substantial portion of the human brain, invoking a response shared across individuals. Encoding models that predict the neural response to a given stimulus can be very useful for studying brain function. However, existing neural encoding models focus on limited aspects of naturalistic stimuli, ignoring the complex and dynamic interactions of modalities in this inherently context-rich paradigm. Using movie watching data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP, N=158) database, we build group-level models of neural activity that incorporate several inductive biases about information processing in the brain, including hierarchical processing, assimilation over longer timescales and multi-sensory auditory-visual interactions. We demonstrate how incorporating this joint information leads to remarkable prediction performance across large areas of the cortex, well beyond the visual and auditory cortices into multi-sensory sites and frontal cortex. Furthermore, we illustrate that encoding models learn high-level concepts that generalize remarkably well to alternate task-bound paradigms. Taken together, our findings underscore the potential of neural encoding models as a powerful tool for studying brain function in ecologically valid conditions.</description>

	<description>Multichannel electrophysiological sensors and stimulators, especially those used for studying the nervous system, are most commonly based on monolithic microelectrode arrays. Such architecture limits the spatial flexibility of individual electrode placement, posing constraints for scaling to a large number of nodes, particularly across non-contiguous locations. We describe the design and fabrication of sub-millimeter size electronic microchips (Neurograins) which autonomously perform neural sensing or electrical microstimulation, with emphasis on their wireless networking and powering. An ~1 GHz electromagnetic transcutaneous link to an external telecom hub enables bidirectional communication and control at the individual neurograin level. The link operates on a customized time division multiple access (TDMA) protocol designed to scale up to 1000 neurograins. The system is demonstrated as a cortical implant in a small animal (rat) model with anatomical limitations restricting the implant to 48 neurograins. We suggest that the neurograin approach can be generalized to overcome many scalability issues for wireless sensors and actuators as implantable microsystems</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Topographic gradients define the projection patterns of the claustrum core and shell in mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.293381v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The claustrum is densely connected to the cortex and participates in brain functions such as attention and sleep. Although some studies have reported the widely divergent organization of claustrum projections, others describe parallel claustrocortical connections to different cortical regions. Therefore, the details underlying how claustrum neurons broadcast information to cortical networks remain incompletely understood. Using multicolor retrograde tracing we determined the density, topography, and co-projection pattern of fourteen claustrocortical pathways, in mice. We spatially registered these pathways to a common coordinate space and found that the claustrocortical system is topographically organized as a series of overlapping spatial modules, continuously distributed across the dorsoventral claustrum axis. The claustrum core projects predominantly to frontal-midline cortical regions, whereas the dorsal and ventral shell project to the cortical motor system and temporal lobe, respectively. Anatomically connected cortical regions receive common input from a subset of claustrum neurons shared by neighboring modules, whereas spatially separated regions of cortex are innervated by different claustrum modules. Therefore, each output module exhibits a unique position within the claustrum and overlaps substantially with other modules projecting to functionally related cortical regions. Claustrum inhibitory cells containing parvalbumin, somatostatin, and neuropeptide Y also show unique topographical distributions, suggesting different output modules are controlled by distinct inhibitory circuit motifs. The topographic organization of excitatory and inhibitory cell types may enable parallel claustrum outputs to independently coordinate distinct cortical networks.</description>

	<description>Purpose To propose an efficient retrospective image-based method for motion correction of multi-contrast acquisitions with a low number of available images (MC-MoCo) and evaluate its use in 3D inhomogeneous Magnetization Transfer (ihMT) experiments in the human brain. Methods A framework for motion correction, including image pre-processing enhancement and rigid registration to an iteratively improved target image, was developed. The proposed method was compared to Motion Correction with FMRIB's Linear Image Registration Tool (MCFLIRT) function in FSL over 13 subjects. Native (pre-correction) and residual (post-correction) motions were evaluated by means of markers positioned at well-defined anatomical regions over each image. Results Both motion correction strategies significantly reduced inter-image misalignment, and the MC-MoCo method yielded significantly better results than MCFLIRT. Conclusion MC-MoCo is a high-performance method for motion correction of multi-contrast volumes as in 3D ihMT imaging.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Location and size of preterm cerebellar hemorrhage and childhood development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25899?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25899?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine the association between cerebellar hemorrhage (CBH) &lt;i&gt;size&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;location&lt;/i&gt; and preschool‐age neurodevelopment in very preterm neonates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preterm MRIs of 221 very preterm neonates (median GA 27.9) were manually segmented for CBH quantification and location. Neurodevelopmental assessments at chronological age 4.5 years included motor (MABC‐2), visuomotor integration (Beery VMI‐6), cognitive (WPPSI‐III), and behavioral (CBCL) outcomes. Multivariable linear regression models examined the association between CBH size and 4.5‐year outcomes accounting for sex, gestational age, and supratentorial injury. Probabilistic maps assessed CBH location and likelihood of a lesion to predict adverse outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐six neonates had CBH: 14 (6%) with only punctate CBH and 22 (10%) with ≥1 larger CBH. CBH occurred mostly in the inferior aspect of the posterior lobes. CBH total volume was independently associated with MABC‐2 motor scores at 4.5 years (β=‐0.095, 95% CI [‐0.184, ‐0.005]) with a standardized β coefficient (‐0.16) that was similar to that of white matter injury volume (standardized β=‐0.22). CBH size was similarly associated with visuomotor integration and externalizing behavior but not cognition. Voxel‐wise odds ratio and lesion‐symptom maps demonstrated that CBH extending more deeply into the cerebellum predicted adverse motor, visuomotor, and behavioral outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBH size and location on preterm MRI were associated with reduced preschool motor and visuomotor function and more externalizing behavior independent of supratentorial brain injury in a dose‐dependent fashion. The volumetric quantification and localisation of CBH, even when punctate, may allow opportunity to improve motor and behavioral outcomes by providing targeted intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Sensitivity–Specificity of Tau and Amyloid β Positron Emission Tomography in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine associations between tau and amyloid β (Aβ) molecular positron emission tomography (PET) and both Alzheimer‐related pathology and 4‐repeat tau pathology in autopsy‐confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty‐four patients had [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]‐flortaucipir–PET and died with FTLD (progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP], n = 10; corticobasal degeneration [CBD], n = 10; FTLD‐TDP, n = 3; and Pick disease, n = 1). All but 1 had Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)‐PET. Braak staging, Aβ plaque and neurofibrillary tangle counts, and semiquantitative tau lesion scores were performed. Flortaucipir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated in a temporal meta region of interest (meta‐ROI), entorhinal cortex and cortical/subcortical regions selected to match the tau lesion analysis. Global PiB SUVR was calculated. Autoradiography was performed in 1 PSP patient, with digital pathology used to quantify tau burden.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine cases (37.5%) had Aβ plaques. Global PiB SUVR correlated with Aβ plaque count, with 100% specificity and 50% sensitivity for diffuse plaques. Twenty‐one (87.5%) had Braak stages I to IV. Flortaucipir correlated with neurofibrillary tangle counts in entorhinal cortex, but entorhinal and meta‐ROI SUVRs were not elevated in Braak IV or primary age‐related tauopathy. Flortaucipir uptake patterns differed across FTLD pathologies and could separate PSP and CBD. Flortaucipir correlated with tau lesion score in red nucleus and midbrain tegmentum across patients, but not in cortical or basal ganglia regions. Autoradiography demonstrated minimal uptake of flortaucipir, although flortaucipir correlated with quantitative tau burden across regions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular PET shows expected correlations with Alzheimer‐related pathology but lacks sensitivity to detect mild Alzheimer pathology in FTLD. Regional flortaucipir uptake was able to separate CBD and PSP. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Age‐related alterations in functional connectivity along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus and its subfields</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23259?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23259?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal circuit alterations that differentially affect hippocampal subfields are associated with age‐related memory decline. Additionally, functional organization along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus has revealed distinctions between anterior and posterior (A‐P) connectivity. Here, we examined the functional connectivity (FC) differences between young and older adults at high‐resolution within the medial temporal lobe network (entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices), allowing us to explore how hippocampal subfield connectivity across the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus changes with age. Overall, we found reliably greater connectivity for younger adults than older adults between the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and perirhinal cortex (PRC). This drop in functional connectivity was more pronounced in the anterior regions of the hippocampus than the posterior ones, consistent for each of the hippocampal subfields. Further, intra‐hippocampal connectivity also reflected an age‐related decrease in functional connectivity within the anterior hippocampus in older adults that was offset by an increase in posterior hippocampal functional connectivity. Interestingly, the anterior–posterior dysfunction in older adults between hippocampus and PHC was predictive of lure discrimination performance on the Mnemonic similarity task (MST), suggesting a role in memory performance. While age‐related dysfunction within the hippocampal subfields has been well‐documented, these results suggest that the age‐related dysfunction in hippocampal connectivity across the longitudinal axis may also contribute significantly to memory decline in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Novel circular RNA 2960 contributes to secondary damage of spinal cord injury by sponging miRNA‐124&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e71e9998-4709-4967-a7ee-161601289945/cne25030-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sequencing analysis for the lesion site of the rat SCI model revealed that the injury significantly stimulated the expression of circRNA‐2960, which acted as a miRNA‐124 sponge to regulate the downstream pathways. Increased circRNA‐2960 expression in SCI decreased the activity of miRNA‐124, which further promoted neuroinflammation and apoptosis

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in many human diseases, but their roles in secondary damage after spinal cord injury (SCI) remain unclear. In the current study circRNA sequencing was performed in the damaged tissues of SCI rats on the seventh day after injury, and related molecular mechanisms were investigated. Quantitative PCR validations of molecules that exhibited significantly altered expression in SCI mice were performed. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were conducted to assess differentially expressed circRNAs. A novel circRNA‐2960 was the most significantly upregulated in the SCI group. It could downregulate its target molecule miRNA‐124, then exacerbate the inflammatory response and induce apoptosis at the lesion site. Disrupting circRNA‐2960 expression promoted recovery of tissues affected by secondary SCI damage. The results of the present study may provide new insight into the mechanisms of secondary injury in SCI, and a new molecular marker for the diagnosis and treatment of SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Abl2:cortactin interactions regulate dendritic spine stability via control of a stable filamentous actin pool.</title>

	<description>Dendritic spines are enriched with stable and dynamic actin filaments, which determine their structure and shape. Disruption of the Abl2/Arg nonreceptor tyrosine kinase in mice compromises spine stability and size. We provide evidence that binding to cortactin tethers Abl2 in spines, where Abl2 and cortactin maintain the small pool of stable actin required for dendritic spine stability. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of GFP-actin, we find that disruption of Abl2:cortactin interactions eliminates stable actin filaments in dendritic spines, significantly reducing spine density. A subset of spines remaining after Abl2 depletion retain their stable actin pool and undergo activity-dependent spine enlargement associated with increased cortactin levels. Finally, tonic increases in synaptic activity rescue spine loss upon Abl2 depletion by promoting cortactin enrichment in vulnerable spines. Together, our findings strongly suggest Abl2:cortactin interactions promote spine stability by maintaining pools of stable actin filaments in spines.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Regulation of Hippocampal Excitatory Synapses by the Zdhhc5 Palmitoyl Acyl Transferase</title>

	<description>Palmitoylation is the most common post-translational lipid modification in the brain. However, the role of palmitoylation and palmitoylating enzymes in the nervous system remains elusive. One of these enzymes, Zdhhc5, has previously been shown to regulate synapse plasticity. Here, we report that Zdhhc5 is also essential for the formation of excitatory, but not inhibitory synapses both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate in vitro that this is dependent on Zdhhc5s enzymatic activity, its localization at the plasma membrane, and its C-terminal domain which has been shown to be truncated in a patient with schizophrenia. Loss of Zdhhc5 in mice results in a decrease in the density of excitatory hippocampal synapses accompanied by alterations in membrane capacitance and synaptic currents, consistent with an overall decrease in spine number and silent synapses. These findings reveal an important role for Zdhhc5 in the formation and/or maintenance of excitatory synapses.</description>

	<description>In group foraging organisms, optimizing the conflicting demands of competitive food loss and safety is critical. We demonstrate that humans select competition avoidant and risk diluting strategies during foraging depending on socially adjusted value. We formulate a mathematically grounded quantification of socially adjusted value in foraging environments and show using multivariate fMRI analyses that socially adjusted value is encoded by mid-cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, regions that integrate value and action signals.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The KCNQ4-mediated M-current regulates the circadian rhythm in mesopontine cholinergic neurons</title>

	<description>The M-current is a voltage gated potassium current inhibited by muscarinic activation and affected by several other G-protein coupled receptors. Its channels are formed by KCNQ subunits, from which KCNQ4 is restricted to certain brainstem structures. We sought evidence for the function of the M-current in the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) and the contribution of KCNQ4 subunits to the M-current and aimed to find its functional significance in the PPN. We found that cholinergic inputs of the PPN can effectively inhibit M-current. This current is capable of synchronizing neighboring neurons and inhibition of the M-current decreases neuronal synchronization. We showed that only a subpopulation of cholinergic neurons has KCNQ4-dependent M-current. The KCNQ4 subunit expression potentially regulates the presence of other KCNQ subunits. Deletion of KCNQ4 leads to alterations in adaptation of activity to light-darkness cycles, thus representing the potential role of KCNQ4 in regulation of sleep-wakefulness cycles. The presence of this protein restricted to certain brainstem nuclei raises the possibility that it might be a potential target for selective therapeutic interventions affecting the reticular activating system.</description>

	<description>Tissue clearing methods allow every cell in the mouse brain to be imaged without physical sectioning. However, the computational tools currently available for cell quantification in cleared tissue images have been limited to counting sparse cell populations in stereotypical mice. Here we introduce NuMorph, a group of image analysis tools to quantify all nuclei and nuclear markers within the mouse cortex after tissue clearing and imaging by a conventional light-sheet microscope. We applied NuMorph to investigate a Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) conditional knockout mouse model with severe brain structure deficits and identified differential effects of Top1 deletion on cortical cell-types and structures that were associated with spatial patterns of long gene expression. These tools are applicable for the study of 3D cellular level structural deficits in brains from other animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Reorganization of the neurobiology of language after sentence overlearning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.293167v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>There is a widespread assumption that there are a static set of 'language regions' in the brain. Yet, people still regularly produce familiar 'formulaic' expressions when those regions are severely damaged. This suggests that the neurobiology of language varies with the extent of word sequence learning and might not be fixed. We test the hypothesis that perceiving sentences is mostly supported by sensorimotor regions involved in speech production and not 'language regions' after overlearning. Twelve participants underwent two sessions of behavioural testing and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), separated by 15 days. During this period, they repeated two sentences 30 times each, twice a day. In both fMRI sessions, participants 'passively' listened to those two sentences and novel sentences. Lastly, they spoke novel sentences. Behavioural results confirm that participants overlearned sentences. Correspondingly, there was an increase or recruitment of sensorimotor regions involved in sentence production and a reduction in activity or inactivity for overlearned sentences in regions involved in listening to novel sentences. The global network organization of the brain changed by ~45%, mostly through lost connectivity. Thus, there was a profound reorganization of the neurobiology of speech perception after overlearning towards sensorimotor regions not considered in most contemporary models and away from the 'language regions' posited by those models. These same sensorimotor regions are generally preserved in aphasia and Alzheimer's disease, perhaps explaining residual abilities with formulaic language. These and other results warrant reconsidering static neurobiological models of language.</description>

	<description>The ability to correctly identify emotions in social stimuli such as faces is proposed to affect ones level of cognitive empathy. The Fusiform Face Area shows a heightened neural response during the perception of faces relative to objects. We tested whether neural responses to social stimuli were associated with performance in a measure of cognitive empathy, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task. To quantify face perception, participants were presented with images during a fast serial presentation task which elicited a steady state visual evoked potential, measured using electroencephalography. A Sequential Bayesian Analysis was used to assess if face specific neural responses were associated with either cognitive empathy or age. Data were collected from a participant group of both neurotypical individuals and individuals on the autistic spectrum. We found no significant relationship between the face-specific neural signature, cognitive empathy or age. This study highlights the efficiency of the Sequential Bayesian Analysis as an effective method of participant recruitment.</description>

	<description>Trk receptors and gene fusions of NTRK are targets in precision oncology. Classical Trk signalling concepts fail to explain ligand-independent signalling of intracellular TrkB or NTRK fusion proteins. Here, we show that abundance of the intracellular domain of TrkB is sufficient for ligand-independent autophosphorylation. This constitutive TrkB signalling reduced actin filopodia dynamics, could phosphorylate FAK, and changed cell morphology. Mutating Y705 in the kinase domain of TrkB alone specifically blocked these pathways. Engineered intracellular kinase domain proteins and a cancer-related intracellular NTRK2-fusion protein (SQSTM1-NTRK2) also underwent constitutive activation. In migrating glioblastoma-like U87MG cells, self-active TrkB kinase reduced cell migration. Moreover, we found evidences for constitutively active, intracellular TrkB in tissue of human grade IV glioblastoma. Structural modelling of the kinase domain let us postulate that 'release from cis-autoinhibition by abundance' is sufficient for TrkB/FAK/Actin signalling via Y705. These constitutive signalling pathways could be fully blocked within minutes by clinically approved, anti-tumorigenic Trk inhibitors. In conclusion, our data provide an explanation and biological function for TrkB kinase domain signalling in the absence of a ligand.</description>

	<description>Variants of the CACNA1C voltage-gated calcium channel gene have been associated with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and ADHD. The Timothy syndrome mutation is a rare de novo gain-of-function variant in CACNA1C that causes autism with high penetrance, providing a powerful avenue into investigating the role of CACNA1C variants in neurodevelopmental disorders. In our previous work, we demonstrated that an egl-19(gof) mutation, that is equivalent to the Timothy syndrome mutation in the human homolog CACNA1C, can disrupt termination of the PLM axon in C. elegans. Here, we find that the egl-19(gof) mutation disrupts the polarity of process outgrowth in the ALM neuron of C. elegans. We also find that the egl-19(gof) mutation can disrupt termination of the ALM axon. These results suggest that the Timothy syndrome mutation can disrupt multiple steps of axon development. Further work exploring the molecular mechanisms that underlie these perturbations in neuronal polarity and axon termination will give us better understanding to how variants in CACNA1C contribute to the axonal defects that underlie autism.</description>

	<description>Schizophrenia risk is associated with increased gene copy number and brain expression of complement component 4 (C4). Because the complement system facilitates synaptic pruning, the C4 association has renewed interest in a hypothesis that excessive pruning contributes to schizophrenia pathogenesis. However, little is known about complement regulation in neural tissues or whether such regulation could be relevant to psychiatric illness. Intriguingly, common variation within CSMD1, which encodes a putative complement inhibitor, has consistently associated with schizophrenia at genome-wide significance. We found that Csmd1 is predominantly expressed in the brain by neurons, and is enriched at synapses; that human stem cell-derived neurons lacking CSMD1 are more vulnerable to complement deposition; and that mice lacking Csmd1 have increased brain complement activity, fewer synapses, aberrant complement-dependent development of a neural circuit, and synaptic elements that are preferentially engulfed by cultured microglia. These data suggest that CSMD1 opposes the complement cascade in neural tissues.</description>

	<description>In the context of a generative model, such as predictive coding, pain perception can be construed as the integration of expectation and nociceptive input with their difference denoted as a prediction error. In a previous neuroimaging study (Geuter et al., 2017) we observed an important role of the insula in such a model, but could not establish its temporal aspects. Here we employed electroencephalography to investigate neural representations of predictions and prediction errors in heat pain processing. Our data show that alpha-to-beta activity was associated with pain expectation, followed by gamma band activity associated with absolute prediction errors. Source reconstruction revealed the insula as a common region for both effects. This temporal sequence of expectation related alpha-to-beta activity, followed by prediction error associated gamma activity in the insula, provides a possible mechanisms for the temporal integrating of pain predictions and prediction errors in the context of a generative model.</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Sex‐specific peripheral and central responses to stress‐induced depression and treatment in a mouse model&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/256f68e9-1d23-442d-a1c7-3ee96b9a2e76/jnr24724-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social defeat stress induces sex‐specific inflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses in the periphery and sex‐specific transcriptional regulation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Treatment with dihydrocaffeic acid/malvidin‐glucoside modulates periphery inflammation and gene expression in the prefrontal cortex and alleviates depression‐like phenotype. CSDS, chronic social defeat stress; DHCA, dihydrocaffeic acid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major depressive disorder affects ~20% of the world population and is characterized by strong sexual dimorphism with females being two to three times more likely to develop this disorder. Previously, we demonstrated that a combination therapy with dihydrocaffeic acid and malvidin‐glucoside to synergistically target peripheral inflammation and stress‐induced synaptic maladaptation in the brain was effective in alleviating chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)‐induced depression‐like phenotype in male mice. Here, we test the combination therapy in a female CSDS model for depression and compared sex‐specific responses to stress in the periphery and the central nervous system. Similar to male mice, the combination treatment is also effective in promoting resilience against the CSDS‐induced depression‐like behavior in female mice. However, there are sex‐specific differences in peripheral immune responses and differential gene regulation in the prefrontal cortex to chronic stress and to the treatment. These data indicate that while therapeutic approaches to combat stress‐related disorders may be effective in both sexes, the mechanisms underlying these effects differ, emphasizing the need for inclusion of both sexes in preclinical studies using animal models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Deep Brain Stimulation for Chronic Cluster Headache: Meta‐Analysis of Individual Patient Data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25887?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a treatment option for refractory chronic cluster headache (CCH). Despite several recent prospective case series reporting a good outcome, the effectiveness and the optimal stimulation target of DBS for CCH remain unclear. We aimed to obtain precise estimates and predictors of long‐term pain relief in an individual patient data meta‐analysis. Furthermore, we aimed to construct a probabilistic stimulation map of effective DBS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invited investigators of published cohorts of patients undergoing DBS for CCH, identified by a systematic review of MEDLINE from inception to Febuary 15, 2019, to provide individual patient data on baseline covariates, pre‐ and postoperative headache scores at median (12‐month) and long‐term follow‐up, in addition to individual imaging data to obtain individual electrode positions. We calculated a stimulation map using voxel‐wise statistical analysis. We used multiple regression analysis to estimate predictors of pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 40 patients from four different cohorts representing ~50% of all previously published cases, we found a significant 77% mean reduction in headache attack frequency over a mean follow‐up of 44 months, with an overall response rate of 75%. Positive outcome was not associated with baseline covariates. We identified 2 hotspots of stimulation covering the midbrain ventral and retrorubral tegmentum.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study supports the hypothesis that DBS provides long‐term pain relief for the majority of CCH patients. Our stimulation map of the region of influence of therapeutic DBS identified an optimal anatomical target site that can help surgeons to guide their surgical planning in the future.

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Development and migration of the zebrafish rhombencephalic octavolateral efferent neurons&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/49422eee-17be-4e2d-92b7-dca59ead60ba/cne25021-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we provide an overview of rhombencephalic octavolateral efferent neuron (OEN) development in the zebrafish. OENs are born in two groups: the rostral (REN) group is born in r4 with the facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs), while the caudal (CEN) group is born in r5. From there, the OENs migrate alongside the FBMNs to r6 and r7, where they cluster into bilateral nuclei. However, we identify several key differences between the mechanisms OENs and FBMNs use to migrate.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vertebrate animals, motor and sensory efferent neurons carry information from the central nervous system (CNS) to peripheral targets. These two types of efferent systems sometimes bear a close resemblance, sharing common segmental organization, axon pathways, and chemical messengers. Here, we focus on the development of the octavolateral efferent neurons (OENs) and their interactions with the closely‐related facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs) in zebrafish. Using live‐imaging approaches, we investigate the birth, migration, and projection patterns of OENs. We find that OENs are born in two distinct groups: a group of rostral efferent neurons (RENs) that arises in the fourth segment, or rhombomere (r4), of the hindbrain and a group of caudal efferent neurons (CENs) that arises in r5. Both RENs and CENs then migrate posteriorly through the hindbrain between 18 and 48 hrs postfertilization, alongside the r4‐derived FBMNs. Like the FBMNs, migration of the r4‐derived RENs depends on function of the segmental identity gene &lt;i&gt;hoxb1a&lt;/i&gt;; unlike the FBMNs, however, both OEN populations move independently of &lt;i&gt;prickle1b&lt;/i&gt;. Further, we investigate whether the previously described “pioneer” neuron that leads FBMN migration through the hindbrain is an r4‐derived FBMN/REN or an r5‐derived CEN. Our experiments verify that the pioneer is an r4‐derived neuron and reaffirm its role in leading FBMN migration across the r4/5 border. In contrast, the r5‐derived CENs migrate independently of the pioneer. Together, these results indicate that the mechanisms OENs use to navigate the hindbrain differ significantly from those employed by FBMNs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Photoreceptor morphology and anatomy, including their density distribution and orientation were studied in the skate &lt;i&gt;Leucoraja erinacea&lt;/i&gt;. In addition to a dorsal visual streak, which is typical in elasmobranchs, photoreceptors were noticeably tilted, a finding that has to date not received much attention. Skate &lt;i&gt;L. erinacea&lt;/i&gt; (left), and image of a whole‐mounted retina showing retinal photoreceptors (right).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying retinal specializations offers insights into eye functionality and visual ecology. Using light microscopic techniques, including retinal whole‐mounts, we investigated photoreceptor densities in the retina of the skate &lt;i&gt;Leucoraja erinacea.&lt;/i&gt; We show that photoreceptors are not sized or oriented in the same way, and that they are not evenly distributed across the retina. There was a dorsally located horizontal visual streak with increased photoreceptor density, with additional local maxima in which densities were highest. Photoreceptors were longest and thinnest inside this visual streak, becoming shorter and thicker toward the periphery and toward the ventral retina. Furthermore, in the peripheral retinal parts, photoreceptors (particularly the outer segments) were noticeably tilted with respect to the retinal long axis. In order to understand how photoreceptors are tilted inside the eye, we used computerized tomography (CT) and micro‐CT, to obtain geometrical dimensions of the whole skate eye. These CT/micro‐CT data provided us with the outlines of the skate eye and the location of the retina and this enabled us to reconstruct how photoreceptors tilt in an intact eye. Findings were analyzed relative to previously published ganglion cell distributions in this species, showing a posteriorly located retinal area with photoreceptor: ganglion cell convergence as low as 39:1. Some peripheral areas showed ratios as high as 391:1. We frame our findings in terms of the animal's anatomy: body and eye shape, specifically the location of the tapetum, as well as the visual demands associated with lifestyle and habitat type. A speculative function in polarization sensitivity is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep neural networks excel at finding hierarchical representations that solve
complex tasks over large data sets. How can we humans understand these learned
representations? In this work, we present network dissection, an analytic
framework to systematically identify the semantics of individual hidden units
within image classification and image generation networks. First, we analyze a
convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on scene classification and discover
units that match a diverse set of object concepts. We find evidence that the
network has learned many object classes that play crucial roles in classifying
scene classes. Second, we use a similar analytic method to analyze a generative
adversarial network (GAN) model trained to generate scenes. By analyzing
changes made when small sets of units are activated or deactivated, we find
that objects can be added and removed from the output scenes while adapting to
the context. Finally, we apply our analytic framework to understanding
adversarial attacks and to semantic image editing.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Currently, many studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are investigating the
neurobiological factors behind the acquisition of beta-amyloid (A), pathologic
tau (T), and neurodegeneration ([N]) biomarkers from neuroimages. However, a
system-level mechanism of how these neuropathological burdens promote
neurodegeneration and why AD exhibits characteristic progression is largely
elusive. In this study, we combined the power of systems biology and network
neuroscience to understand the dynamic interaction and diffusion process of
AT[N] biomarkers from an unprecedented amount of longitudinal Amyloid PET scan,
MRI imaging, and DTI data. Specifically, we developed a network-guided
biochemical model to jointly (1) model the interaction of AT[N] biomarkers at
each brain region and (2) characterize their propagation pattern across the
fiber pathways in the structural brain network, where the brain resilience is
also considered as a moderator of cognitive decline. Our biochemical model
offers a greater mathematical insight to understand the physiopathological
mechanism of AD progression by studying the system dynamics and stability.
Thus, an in-depth system-level analysis allows us to gain a new understanding
of how AT[N] biomarkers spread throughout the brain, capture the early sign of
cognitive decline, and predict the AD progression from the preclinical stage.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sketch drawings are an intuitive visual domain that generally preserves
semantics. Previous work has shown that recurrent neural networks are capable
of producing sketch drawings of a single or few classes at a time. In this work
we focus on the representations developed by training a generative model to
produce sketches from pixel images across many classes in a sketch domain. We
find that the embeddings learned by this sketching model are extremely
informative for visual tasks and infer compositional information. We then use
them to exceed state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised few-shot
classification on the Omniglot and mini-ImageNet benchmarks. We also leverage
the generative capacity of our model to produce high quality sketches of novel
classes based on just a single example.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain decoding, understood as the process of mapping brain activities to the
stimuli that generated them, has been an active research area in the last
years. In the case of language stimuli, recent studies have shown that it is
possible to decode fMRI scans into an embedding of the word a subject is
reading. However, such word embeddings are designed for natural language
processing tasks rather than for brain decoding. Therefore, they limit our
ability to recover the precise stimulus. In this work, we propose to directly
classify an fMRI scan, mapping it to the corresponding word within a fixed
vocabulary. Unlike existing work, we evaluate on scans from previously unseen
subjects. We argue that this is a more realistic setup and we present a model
that can decode fMRI data from unseen subjects. Our model achieves 5.22% Top-1
and 13.59% Top-5 accuracy in this challenging task, significantly outperforming
all the considered competitive baselines. Furthermore, we use the decoded words
to guide language generation with the GPT-2 model. This way, we advance the
quest for a system that translates brain activities into coherent text.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In living systems, we often see the emergence of the ingredients necessary
for computation -- the capacity for information transmission, storage, and
modification -- begging the question of how we may exploit or imitate such
biological systems in unconventional computing applications. What can we gain
from artificial life in the advancement of computing technology? Artificial
life provides us with powerful tools for understanding the dynamic behavior of
biological systems and capturing this behavior in manmade substrates. With this
approach, we can move towards a new computing paradigm concerned with
harnessing emergent computation in physical substrates not governed by the
constraints of Moore's law and ultimately realize massively parallel and
distributed computing technology. In this paper, we argue that the lens of
artificial life offers valuable perspectives for the advancement of
high-performance computing technology. We first present a brief foundational
background on artificial life and some relevant tools that may be applicable to
unconventional computing. Two specific substrates are then discussed in detail:
biological neurons and ensembles of nanomagnets. These substrates are the focus
of the authors' ongoing work, and they are illustrative of the two sides of the
approach outlined here -- the close study of living systems and the
construction of artificial systems to produce life-like behaviors. We conclude
with a philosophical discussion on what we can learn from approaching
computation with the curiosity inherent to the study of artificial life. The
main contribution of this paper is to present the great potential of using
artificial life methodologies to uncover and harness the inherent computational
power of physical substrates toward applications in unconventional
high-performance computing.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13376</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We provide two characterizations, one axiomatic and the other
neuro-computational, of the dependence of choice probabilities on deadlines,
within the widely used softmax representation \[ p_{t}\left( a,A\right)
=\dfrac{e^{\frac{u\left( a\right) }{\lambda \left( t\right) }+\alpha \left(
a\right) }}{\sum_{b\in A}e^{\frac{u\left( b\right) }{\lambda \left( t\right)
}+\alpha \left( b\right) }}% \] where $p_{t}\left( a,A\right) $ is the
probability that alternative $a$ is selected from the set $A$ of feasible
alternatives if $t$ is the time available to decide, $\lambda$ is a time
dependent noise parameter measuring the unit cost of information, $u$ is a time
independent utility function, and $\alpha$ is an alternative-specific bias that
determines the initial choice probabilities and possibly reflects prior
information.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our axiomatic analysis provides a behavioral foundation of softmax (also
known as Multinomial Logit Model when $\alpha$ is constant). Our
neuro-computational derivation provides a biologically inspired algorithm that
may explain the emergence of softmax in choice behavior. Jointly, the two
approaches provide a thorough understanding of soft-maximization in terms of
internal causes (neurophysiological mechanisms) and external effects (testable
implications).

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04559</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We study the question of how concepts that have structure get represented in
the brain. Specifically, we introduce a model for hierarchically structured
concepts and we show how a biologically plausible neural network can recognize
these concepts, and how it can learn them in the first place. Our main goal is
to introduce a general framework for these tasks and prove formally how both
(recognition and learning) can be achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that both tasks can be accomplished even in presence of noise. For
learning, we analyze Oja's rule formally, a well-known biologically-plausible
rule for adjusting the weights of synapses. We complement the learning results
with lower bounds asserting that, in order to recognize concepts of a certain
hierarchical depth, neural networks must have a corresponding number of layers.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human learning is a complex process in which future behavior is altered via
the reorganization of brain activity and connectivity. It remains unknown
whether activity and connectivity differentially reorganize during learning,
and, if so, how that differential reorganization tracks stages of learning
across distinct brain areas. Here, we address this gap in knowledge by
measuring brain activity and functional connectivity in a longitudinal fMRI
experiment in which healthy adult human participants learn the values of novel
objects over the course of four days. An increasing similarity in activity or
functional connectivity across subjects during learning reflects reorganization
toward a common functional architecture. We assessed the presence of
reorganization in activity and connectivity both during value learning and
during the resting-state, allowing us to differentiate common elicited
processes from intrinsic processes. We found a complex and dynamic
reorganization of brain connectivity and activity--as a function of time,
space, and performance--that occurs while subjects learn. Spatially localized
brain activity reorganizes across the brain to a common functional architecture
early in learning, and this reorganization tracks early learning performance.
In contrast, spatially distributed connectivity reorganizes across the brain to
a common functional architecture as training progresses, and this
reorganization tracks later learning performance. Particularly good performance
is associated with a sticky connectivity, that persists into the resting state.
Broadly, our work uncovers distinct principles of reorganization in activity
and connectivity at different phases of value learning, which inform the
ongoing study of learning processes more generally.

Here, using live imaging of endogenous YAP and target-gene transcription, the authors show that YAP-dependent signalling is encoded through rapid and concerted changes in the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of YAP.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/q0PzMytBQwI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Histone Deacetylase 6 and the Disease Mechanisms of α-Synucleinopathies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.586453</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The abnormal accumulation of α-Synuclein (α-Syn) is a prominent pathological feature in a group of diseases called α-Synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). The formation of Lewy bodies (LBs) and glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in neurons and oligodendrocytes, respectively, is highly investigated. However, the molecular mechanisms behind α-Syn improper folding and aggregation remain unclear. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a Class II deacetylase, containing two active catalytic domains and a ubiquitin-binding domain. The properties of HDAC6 and its exclusive cytoplasmic localization allow HDAC6 to modulate the microtubule dynamics, acting as a specific α-tubulin deacetylase. Also, HDAC6 can bind ubiquitinated proteins, facilitating the formation of the aggresome, a cellular defense mechanism to cope with higher levels of misfolded proteins. Several studies report that the aggresome shares similarities in size and composition with LBs and GCIs. HDAC6 is found to co-localize with α-Syn in neurons and in oligodendrocytes, together with other aggresome-related proteins. The involvement of HDAC6 in several neurodegenerative diseases is already under discussion, however, the results obtained by modulating HDAC6 activity are not entirely conclusive. The main goal of this review is to summarize and critically discuss previous in vitro and in vivo data regarding the specific role of HDAC6 in the context of α-Syn accumulation and protein aggregation in α-Synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Food Anticipatory Activity on Circadian Time Scales Is Not Dependent on Central Serotonin: Evidence From Tryptophan Hydroxylase-2 and Serotonin Transporter Knockout Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.534238</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.534238</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A number of studies implicate biogenic amines in regulating circadian rhythms. In particular, dopamine and serotonin influence the entrainment of circadian rhythms to daily food availability. To study circadian entrainment to feeding, food availability is typically restricted to a short period within the light cycle daily. This results in a notable increase in pre-meal activity, termed “food anticipatory activity” (FAA), which typically develops within about 1 week of scheduled feeding. Several studies have implicated serotonin as a negative regulator of FAA: (1) aged rats treated with serotonin 5-HT2 and 3 receptor antagonists showed enhanced FAA, (2) mice lacking for the 2C serotonin receptor demonstrate enhanced FAA, and (3) pharmacologically increased serotonin levels suppressed FAA while decreased serotonin levels enhanced FAA in mice. We sought to confirm and extend these findings using genetic models with impairments in central serotonin production or re-uptake, but were surprised to find that both serotonin transporter (Slc6a4) and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 knockout mice demonstrated a normal behavioral response to timed, calorie restricted feeding. Our data suggest that FAA is largely independent of central serotonin and/or serotonin reuptake and that serotonin may not be a robust negative regulator of FAA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: NWB Query Engines: Tools to Search Data Stored in Neurodata Without Borders Format</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00027</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Neurodata Without Borders (abbreviation NWB) format is a current technology for storing neurophysiology data along with the associated metadata. Data stored in the format is organized into separate HDF5 files, each file usually storing the data associated with a single recording session. While the NWB format provides a structured method for storing data, so far there have not been tools which enable searching a collection of NWB files in order to find data of interest for a particular purpose. We describe here three tools to enable searching NWB files. The tools have different features making each of them most useful for a particular task. The first tool, called the NWB Query Engine, is written in Java. It allows searching the complete content of NWB files. It was designed for the first version of NWB (NWB 1) and supports most (but not all) features of the most recent version (NWB 2). For some searches, it is the fastest tool. The second tool, called “search_nwb” is written in Python and also allow searching the complete contents of NWB files. It works with both NWB 1 and NWB 2, as does the third tool. The third tool, called “nwbindexer” enables searching a collection of NWB files using a two-step process. In the first step, a utility is run which creates an SQLite database containing the metadata in a collection of NWB files. This database is then searched in the second step, using another utility. Once the index is built, this two-step processes allows faster searches than are done by the other tools, but does not enable as complete of searches. All three tools use a simple query language which was developed for this project. Software integrating the three tools into a web-interface is provided which enables searching NWB files by submitting a web form.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Motor and Predictive Processes in Auditory Beat and Rhythm Perception</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.578546</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.578546</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we review recent advances in research on rhythm and musical beat perception, focusing on the role of predictive processes in auditory motor interactions. We suggest that experimental evidence of the motor system’s role in beat perception, including in passive listening, may be explained by the generation and maintenance of internal predictive models, concordant with the Active Inference framework of sensory processing. We highlight two complementary hypotheses for the neural underpinnings of rhythm perception: The Action Simulation for Auditory Prediction hypothesis (Patel and Iversen, 2014) and the Gradual Audiomotor Evolution hypothesis (Merchant and Honing, 2014) and review recent experimental progress supporting each of these hypotheses. While initial formulations of ASAP and GAE explain different aspects of beat-based timing–the involvement of motor structures in the absence of movement, and physical entrainment to an auditory beat respectively–we suggest that work under both hypotheses provide converging evidence toward understanding the predictive role of the motor system in the perception of rhythm, and the specific neural mechanisms involved. We discuss future experimental work necessary to further evaluate the causal neural mechanisms underlying beat and rhythm perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Enhancement of Facilitation Training for Aphasia by Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.573459</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.573459</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We aimed to enhance the performance of naming and sentence production in chronic post-stroke aphasia by tablet-based language training combined with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) conducted on non-consecutive days. We applied a deblocking method involved in stimulation–facilitation therapy to six participants with chronic aphasia who performed naming and sentence production tasks for impaired modalities, immediately after a spoken-word picture-matching task for an intact modality. The participants took part in two conditional sessions: a tDCS condition in which they performed a spoken word-picture matching task while we delivered an anodal tDCS over the left inferior frontal cortex; and a sham condition in which sham stimulation was delivered. We hypothesized that, compared with the sham stimulation, the application of anodal tDCS over the left inferior frontal cortex during the performance of tasks requiring access to semantic representations would enhance the deblocking effect, thereby improving the performances for subsequent naming and sentence production. Our results showed greater improvements 2 weeks after training with tDCS than those after training with sham stimulation. The accuracy rate of naming was significantly higher in the tDCS condition than in the sham condition, regardless of whether the words were trained or not. Also, we found a significant improvement in the production of related words and sentences for the untrained words in the tDCS condition, compared with that found pre-training, while in the sham condition we found no significant improvement compared with that found pre-training. These results support our hypothesis and suggest the effectiveness of the use of tDCS during language training on non-consecutive days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Sex Differences in Neural Responses to the Perception of Social Interactions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social interaction is critical to emotional well-being. Previous studies have suggested sex differences in the perception of social interaction. However, the findings depend on the nature of interactions and whether it involves facial emotions. Here, we explored sex differences in neural responses to the perception of social interaction using the Human Connectome Project data. Participants (n = 969, 505 women) were engaged in a social cognition task with geometric objects moving and colliding to simulate social interaction. Behaviorally, men relative to women demonstrated higher accuracy in perceiving social vs. random interactions. Men vs. women showed higher activation in the right superior temporal gyrus, bilateral occipital and posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, and women vs. men showed higher activation in the right inferior frontal cortex, during exposure to social vs. random interactions. In whole-brain regressions, the differences in accuracy rate in identifying social vs. random interactions (AR&lt;sub&gt;SOC&lt;/sub&gt; – AR&lt;sub&gt;RAN&lt;/sub&gt;) were associated with higher activation in the paracentral lobule (PCL) and lower activation in bilateral anterior insula (AI), pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in men and women combined, lower activation in bilateral AI, preSMA and left MFG in men alone, and higher activation in the PCL and the medial orbitofrontal cortex in women alone. The latter sex differences were confirmed by slope tests. Further, the PCL activity mediated the correlation between an internalizing syndromal score, as assessed by the Achenbach Self-Report, and (AR&lt;sub&gt;SOC&lt;/sub&gt; – AR&lt;sub&gt;RAN&lt;/sub&gt;) across all subjects. These findings highlighted sex differences in the behavioral and neural processes underlying the perception of social interaction, as well as the influence of internalizing traits on these processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Theoretical Framework for How We Learn Aesthetic Values</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00345</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;How do we come to like the things that we do? Each one of us starts from a relatively similar state at birth, yet we end up with vastly different sets of aesthetic preferences. These preferences go on to define us both as individuals and as members of our cultures. Therefore, it is important to understand how aesthetic preferences form over our lifetimes. This poses a challenging problem: to understand this process, one must account for the many factors at play in the formation of aesthetic values and how these factors influence each other over time. A general framework based on basic neuroscientific principles that can also account for this process is needed. Here, we present such a framework and illustrate it through a model that accounts for the trajectories of aesthetic values over time. Our framework is inspired by meta-analytic data of neuroimaging studies of aesthetic appraisal. This framework incorporates effects of sensory inputs, rewards, and motivational states. Crucially, each one of these effects is probabilistic. We model their interactions under a reinforcement-learning circuitry. Simulations of this model and mathematical analysis of the framework lead to three main findings. First, different people may develop distinct weighing of aesthetic variables because of individual variability in motivation. Second, individuals from different cultures and environments may develop different aesthetic values because of unique sensory inputs and social rewards. Third, because learning is stochastic, stemming from probabilistic sensory inputs, motivations, and rewards, aesthetic values vary in time. These three theoretical findings account for different lines of empirical research. Through our study, we hope to provide a general and unifying framework for understanding the various aspects involved in the formation of aesthetic values over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Retrospective Evaluation of Sequential Events and the Influence of Preference-Dependent Working Memory: A Computational Examination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00065</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans organize sequences of events into a single overall experience, and evaluate the aggregated experience as a whole, such as a generally pleasant dinner, movie, or trip. However, such evaluations are potentially computationally taxing, and so our brains must employ heuristics (i.e., approximations). For example, the peak-end rule hypothesis suggests that we average the peaks and end of a sequential event vs. integrating every moment. However, there is no general model to test viable hypotheses quantitatively. Here, we propose a general model and test among multiple specific ones, while also examining the role of working memory. The models were tested with a novel picture-rating task. We first compared averaging across entire sequences vs. the peak-end heuristic. Correlation tests indicated that averaging prevailed, with peak and end both still having significant prediction power. Given this, we developed generalized order-dependent and relative-preference-dependent models to subsume averaging, peak and end. The combined model improved the prediction power. However, based on limitations of relative-preference—including imposing a potentially arbitrary ranking among preferences—we introduced an absolute-preference-dependent model, which successfully explained the remembered utilities. Yet, because using all experiences in a sequence requires too much memory as real-world settings scale, we then tested “windowed” models, i.e., evaluation within a specified window. The windowed (absolute) preference-dependent (WP) model explained the empirical data with long sequences better than without windowing. However, because fixed-windowed models harbor their own limitations—including an inability to capture peak-event influences beyond a fixed window—we then developed discounting models. With (absolute) preference-dependence added to the discounting rate, the results showed that the discounting model reflected the actual working memory of the participants, and that the preference-dependent discounting (PD) model described different features from the WP model. Taken together, we propose a combined WP-PD model as a means by which people evaluate experiences, suggesting preference-dependent working-memory as a significant factor underlying our evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response: A Hinge Between Healthy and Pathological Aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.581849</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging is the time-dependent functional decline that increases the vulnerability to different forms of stress, constituting the major risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Dysfunctional mitochondria significantly contribute to aging phenotypes, accumulating particularly in post-mitotic cells, including neurons. To cope with deleterious effects, mitochondria feature different mechanisms for quality control. One such mechanism is the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt;), which corresponds to the transcriptional activation of mitochondrial chaperones, proteases, and antioxidant enzymes to repair defective mitochondria. Transcription of target UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt; genes is epigenetically regulated by Histone 3-specific methylation. Age-dependency of this regulation could explain a differential UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt; activity in early developmental stages or aged organisms. At the same time, precise tuning of mitochondrial stress responses is crucial for maintaining neuronal homeostasis. However, compared to other mitochondrial and stress response programs, the role of UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt; in neurodegenerative disease is barely understood and studies in this topic are just emerging. In this review, we document the reported evidence characterizing the evolutionarily conserved regulation of the UPR&lt;sup&gt;MT&lt;/sup&gt; and summarize the recent advances in understanding the role of the pathway in neurodegenerative diseases and aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Effects of Embryonic Inflammation and Adolescent Psychosocial Environment on Cognition and Hippocampal Staufen in Middle-Aged Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.578719</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.578719</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidence has indicated that embryonic inflammation could accelerate age-associated cognitive impairment, which can be attributed to dysregulation of synaptic plasticity-associated proteins, such as RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Staufen is a double-stranded RBP that plays a critical role in the modulation of synaptic plasticity and memory. However, relatively few studies have investigated how embryonic inflammation affects cognition and neurobiology during aging, or how the adolescent psychosocial environment affects inflammation-induced remote cognitive impairment. Consequently, the aim of this study was to investigate whether these adverse factors can induce changes in Staufen expression, and whether these changes are correlated with cognitive impairment. In our study, CD-1 mice were administered lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 50 μg/kg) or an equal amount of saline (control) intraperitoneally during days 15–17 of gestation. At 2 months of age, male offspring were randomly exposed to stress (S), an enriched environment (E), or not treated (CON) and then assigned to five groups: LPS, LPS+S, LPS+E, CON, and CON+S. Mice were evaluated at 3-month-old (young) and 15-month-old (middle-aged). Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze test, while Staufen expression was examined at both the protein and mRNA level using immunohistochemistry/western blotting and RNAscope technology, respectively. The results showed that the middle-aged mice had worse cognitive performance and higher Staufen expression than young mice. Embryonic inflammation induced cognitive impairment and increased Staufen expression in the middle-aged mice, whereas adolescent stress/an enriched environment would accelerated/mitigated these effects. Meanwhile, Staufen expression was closely correlated with cognitive performance. Our findings suggested embryonic inflammation can accelerate age-associated learning and memory impairments, and these effects may be related to the Staufen expression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Afferent and Efferent Visual Markers of Alzheimer’s Disease: A Review and Update in Early Stage Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.572337</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vision, which requires extensive neural involvement, is often impaired in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Over the last few decades, accumulating evidence has shown that various visual functions and structures are compromised in Alzheimer’s dementia and when measured can detect those with dementia from those with normal aging. These visual changes involve both the afferent and efferent parts of the visual system, which correspond to the sensory and eye movement aspects of vision, respectively. There are fewer, but a growing number of studies, that focus on the detection of predementia stages. Visual biomarkers that detect these stages are paramount in the development of successful disease-modifying therapies by identifying appropriate research participants and in identifying those who would receive future therapies. This review provides a summary and update on common afferent and efferent visual markers of AD with a focus on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and preclinical disease detection. We further propose future directions in this area. Given the ease of performing visual tests, the accessibility of the eye, and advances in ocular technology, visual measures have the potential to be effective, practical, and non-invasive biomarkers of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cerebral Fructose Metabolism as a Potential Mechanism Driving Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.560865</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.560865</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The loss of cognitive function in Alzheimer’s disease is pathologically linked with neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid deposition, and loss of neuronal communication. Cerebral insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction have emerged as important contributors to pathogenesis supporting our hypothesis that cerebral fructose metabolism is a key initiating pathway for Alzheimer’s disease. Fructose is unique among nutrients because it activates a survival pathway to protect animals from starvation by lowering energy in cells in association with adenosine monophosphate degradation to uric acid. The fall in energy from fructose metabolism stimulates foraging and food intake while reducing energy and oxygen needs by decreasing mitochondrial function, stimulating glycolysis, and inducing insulin resistance. When fructose metabolism is overactivated systemically, such as from excessive fructose intake, this can lead to obesity and diabetes. Herein, we present evidence that Alzheimer’s disease may be driven by overactivation of cerebral fructose metabolism, in which the source of fructose is largely from endogenous production in the brain. Thus, the reduction in mitochondrial energy production is hampered by neuronal glycolysis that is inadequate, resulting in progressive loss of cerebral energy levels required for neurons to remain functional and viable. In essence, we propose that Alzheimer’s disease is a modern disease driven by changes in dietary lifestyle in which fructose can disrupt cerebral metabolism and neuronal function. Inhibition of intracerebral fructose metabolism could provide a novel way to prevent and treat this disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Non-linear Relationship Between Plasma Amyloid-β 40 Level and Cognitive Decline in a Cognitively Normal Population</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.557005</guid>

	<description>Objectives&lt;p&gt;Recent studies regarding the relationships between plasma amyloid-β (Aβ) levels and cognitive performance had inconsistent results. In this study, we aimed to characterize the relationship between cognitive decline and plasma Aβ levels in a large-sample cognitively normal population.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This population-based, prospective cohort study included 1,240 participants with normal cognition. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to assess cognitive function at baseline and 2 years later. Restricted cubic splines, multivariate logistic regression, and multivariate linear regression models were used to evaluate the type of relationship between cognitive decline during the 2-year follow-up period and plasma Aβ levels (Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;, Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;, and Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;/&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Participants with moderate Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; levels had the highest risk of cognitive decline during a 2-year follow-up relative to individuals with low Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; [odds ratio (OR): 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.45–0.81, p &amp;lt; 0.001] or high Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; (OR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.49–0.87, p = 0.004) levels. The association between Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and cognitive decline did not depend on sex, education level, or APOE ε4 status. There was an interaction found between age (≤ 65 and &amp;gt; 65 years) and Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; (p for interaction = 0.021). In individuals older than 65 years, there was a positive linear relationship between plasma Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and cognitive decline (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00–1.04, p = 0.027). For participants ≤ 65 years old, the lower Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and higher Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; groups had a lower risk of cognitive decline than the medium Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; group (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.50–0.94, p = 0.02; OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.45–0.86, p = 0.004). None of relationship between plasma Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;, Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;/&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and cognitive decline was found during a 2-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The relationship between plasma Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and cognitive decline was not linear, but an inverted-U shape in a cognitively normal population. The underlying mechanism requires further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Weaker Braking Force, A New Marker of Worse Gait Stability in Alzheimer Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.554168</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.554168</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Braking force is a gait marker associated with gait stability. This study aimed to determine the alteration of braking force and its correlation with gait stability in Alzheimer disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 32 AD patients and 32 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. Gait parameters (braking force, gait variability, and fall risk) in the walking tests of Free walk, Barrier, and Count backward were measured by JiBuEn&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; gait analysis system. Gait variability was calculated by the coefficient of variation (COV) of stride time, stance time, and swing time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The braking force of AD was significantly weaker than HCs in three walking tests (P &amp;lt; 0.001, P &amp;lt; 0.001, P = 0.007). Gait variability of AD showed significant elevation than HCs in the walking of Count backward (COV&lt;sub&gt;stride&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.013; COV&lt;sub&gt;swing&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.006). Fall risk of AD was significantly higher than HCs in three walking tests (P = 0.001, P = 0.001, P = 0.001). Braking force was negatively associated with fall risks in three walking tests (P &amp;lt; 0.001, P &amp;lt; 0.001, P &amp;lt; 0.001). There were significant negative correlations between braking force and gait variability in the walking of Free walk (COV&lt;sub&gt;stride&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.018; COV&lt;sub&gt;swing&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.013) and Barrier (COV&lt;sub&gt;stride&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.002; COV&lt;sub&gt;swing&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.001), but not Count backward (COV&lt;sub&gt;stride&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.888; COV&lt;sub&gt;swing&lt;/sub&gt;: P = 0.555).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Braking force was weaker in AD compared to HCs, reflecting the worse gait stability of AD. Our study suggests that weakening of braking force may be a new gait marker to indicate cognitive and motor impairment and predict fall risk in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Association Between Peripheral Adiponectin and Lipids Levels and the Therapeutic Response to Donepezil Treatment in Han Chinese Patients With Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.532386</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.532386</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) including donepezil (DNP) are considered to be the most promising therapeutic possibilities of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The response to DNP in AD patients varies and it is valuable to identify the potential markers that can predict the efficacy. Moreover, DNP has been found to affect bone function, but the exact mechanism is still unclear. Lipids and adipokine may link to AD and DNP directly or indirectly and might be potential biomarkers or therapeutic drug targets. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationships among adiponectin (APN), lipids levels, and the response to DNP, and to identify whether the effect of DNP in AD treatment is related to its effect on the level of APN in systemic circulation. The study recruited 85 AD patients with DNP treatment, of whom 47 were DNP responders and 38 were DNP nonresponders. The Mini-Mental State Examination was performed to evaluate the memory impairment. Plasma APN was measured with ELISA. The genotypes of single nucleotide polymorphisms rs1501299 and rs22417661 in APN for each patient were identified. Plasma lipids were quantified with gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Correlations among APN, lipid metabolomics, and DNP responded were evaluated. APN was significantly decreased in DNP responders. Methyl stearate and glycerol-3-phosphate, used for characterizing adipogenic differentiation, were significantly decreased in DNP responders compared to DNP nonresponders. APN and small-molecule lipids can be used as potential biomarkers to evaluate the efficacy of DNP. The results of metabolomics indicated that there was no change in the metabolic pathway of fatty acid metabolism and glucose metabolism in DNP responders, suggesting that APN-related biological function did not decrease in DNP responders. Our result suggests that more attention should be pay to the sources and biological functions of APN in AD with DNP treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on Balance Control in Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00275</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00275</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Recently, considerable research has been conducted to study the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on balance control in older adults. We completed a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of tDCS on balance control in this population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A search strategy based on the PICOS principle was used to find the literatures in the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO, Web of Science. The quality and risk of bias in the studies were independently assessed by two researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Ten studies were included in the systematic review. A meta-analysis was completed on six of these ten, with a total of 280 participants. As compared to sham (i.e., control), tDCS induced significant improvement with low heterogeneity in balance control in older adults. Specifically, tDCS induced large effects on the performance of the timed-up-and-go test, the Berg balance scale, and standing postural sway (e.g., sway area) and gait (e.g., walking speed) in dual task conditions (standardized mean differences (SMDs) = −0.99~3.41 95% confidence limits (CL): −1.52~4.50, p &amp;lt; 0.006, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;lt; 52%). Moderate-to-large effects of tDCS were also observed in the standing posture on a static or movable platform (SMDs = 0.37~1.12 95%CL: −0.09~1.62, p &amp;lt; 0.03, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;lt; 62%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our analysis indicates that tDCS holds promise to promote balance in older adults. These results warrant future studies of larger sample size and rigorous study design and results report, as well as specific research to establish the relationship between the parameter of tDCS and the extent of tDCS-induced improvement in balance control in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Catecholamines in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00184</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00184</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background and Purpose: Previous studies found inconsistent results regarding the relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and catecholamines, such as dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine (EPI). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the results of previous studies on this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Literature retrieval of eligible studies was performed in four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and PsycARTICLES). Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated to assess differences in catecholamine concentrations between the AD groups and controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Thirteen studies met the eligibility criteria. Compared with the controls, significant lower concentrations of NE (SMD = −1.10, 95% CI: −2.01 to −0.18, p = 0.019) and DA (SMD = −1.12, 95% CI: −1.88 to −0.37, p = 0.003) were observed in patients with AD. No difference was found in the concentrations of EPI between the two groups (SMD = −0.74, 95% CI: −1.85 to 0.37, p = 0.189).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Overall, these findings are in line with the hypothesis that reduced NE and DA may be an important indicator for AD (Registration number CRD42018112816).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Structural basis of αE-catenin-F-actin catch bond behavior</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60878</link>
	<description>Cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions transmit mechanical forces during tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis. α-Catenin links cell-cell adhesion complexes to the actin cytoskeleton, and mechanical load strengthens its binding to F-actin in a direction-sensitive manner. Specifically, optical trap experiments revealed that force promotes a transition between weak and strong actin-bound states. Here, we describe the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the F-actin-bound αE-catenin actin-binding domain, which in solution forms a 5-helix bundle. In the actin-bound structure, the first helix of the bundle dissociates and the remaining four helices and connecting loops rearrange to form the interface with actin. Deletion of the first helix produces strong actin binding in the absence of force, suggesting that the actin-bound structure corresponds to the strong state. Our analysis explains how mechanical force applied to αE-catenin or its homolog vinculin favors the strongly bound state, and the dependence of catch bond strength on the direction of applied force.</description>

	<title>eLife: Dichotomous role of the human mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+/Li+ exchanger NCLX in colorectal cancer growth and metastasis</title>

	<description>Despite the established role of mitochondria in cancer, the mechanisms by which mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (mtCa&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) regulates tumorigenesis remain incompletely understood. The crucial role of mtCa&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in tumorigenesis is highlighted by altered expression of proteins mediating mtCa&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake and extrusion in cancer. Here, we demonstrate decreased expression of the mitochondrial Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li&lt;sup&gt;+ &lt;/sup&gt;exchanger NCLX (&lt;i&gt;SLC8B1&lt;/i&gt;) in human colorectal tumors and its association with advanced-stage disease in patients. Downregulation of NCLX causes mtCa&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload, mitochondrial depolarization, decreased expression of cell-cycle genes and reduced tumor size in xenograft and spontaneous colorectal cancer mouse models. Concomitantly, NCLX downregulation drives metastatic spread, chemoresistance, and expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal, hypoxia, and stem cell pathways. Mechanistically, mtCa&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload leads to increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which activate HIF1α signaling supporting metastasis of NCLX-null tumor cells. Thus, loss of NCLX is a novel driver of metastasis, indicating that regulation of mtCa&lt;sup&gt;2+ &lt;/sup&gt;is a novel therapeutic approach in metastatic colorectal cancer.</description>

	<title>eLife: A single-cell atlas of the mouse and human prostate reveals heterogeneity and conservation of epithelial progenitors</title>

	<description>Understanding the cellular constituents of the prostate is essential for identifying the cell of origin for prostate adenocarcinoma. Here we describe a comprehensive single-cell atlas of the adult mouse prostate epithelium, which displays extensive heterogeneity. We observe distal lobe-specific luminal epithelial populations (LumA, LumD, LumL, and LumV), a proximally-enriched luminal population (LumP) that is not lobe-specific, and a periurethral population (PrU) that shares both basal and luminal features. Functional analyses suggest that LumP and PrU cells have multipotent progenitor activity in organoid formation and tissue reconstitution assays. Furthermore, we show that mouse distal and proximal luminal cells are most similar to human acinar and ductal populations, that a PrU-like population is conserved between species, and that the mouse lateral prostate is most similar to the human peripheral zone. Our findings elucidate new prostate epithelial progenitors, and help resolve long-standing questions about anatomical relationships between the mouse and human prostate.</description>

	<title>eLife: Alternative splicing at neuroligin site A regulates glycan interaction and synaptogenic activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58668</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58668</link>
	<description>Post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating cell surface synaptic organizing complexes that control the properties of connections in brain circuits are poorly understood. Alternative splicing regulates the prototypical synaptic organizing complex, neuroligin-neurexin. In contrast to the well-studied neuroligin splice site B, little is known about splice site A. We discovered that inclusion of the positively charged A1 insert in mouse neuroligin-1 increases its binding to heparan sulphate, a modification on neurexin. The A1 insert increases neurexin recruitment, presynaptic differentiation, and synaptic transmission mediated by neuroligin-1. We propose that the A1 insert could be a target for alleviating the consequences of deleterious &lt;i&gt;NLGN1/3&lt;/i&gt; mutations, supported by assays with the autism-linked neuroligin-1-P89L mutant. An enrichment of neuroligin-1 A1 in GABAergic neuron types suggests a role in synchrony of cortical circuits. Altogether, these data reveal an unusual mode by which neuroligin splicing controls synapse development through protein-glycan interaction and identify it as a potential therapeutic target.</description>

	<title>eLife: Stress-activated MAPK signalling controls fission yeast actomyosin ring integrity by modulating formin For3 levels</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57951</link>
	<description>Cytokinesis, which enables the physical separation of daughter cells once mitosis has been completed, is executed in fungal and animal cells by a contractile actin- and myosin-based ring (CAR). In the fission yeast &lt;i&gt;Schizosaccharomyces pombe &lt;/i&gt;the formin For3 nucleates actin cables and also co-operates for CAR assembly during cytokinesis. Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) regulate essential adaptive responses in eukaryotic organisms to environmental changes. We show that the Stress Activated Protein Kinase pathway (SAPK) and its effector, MAPK Sty1, downregulates CAR assembly in &lt;i&gt;S. pombe&lt;/i&gt; when its integrity becomes compromised during cytoskeletal damage and stress by reducing For3 levels. Accurate control of For3 levels by the SAPK pathway may thus represent a novel regulatory mechanism of cytokinesis outcome in response to environmental cues. Conversely, SAPK signalling favours CAR assembly and integrity in its close relative &lt;i&gt;S. japonicus, &lt;/i&gt;revealing a remarkable evolutionary divergence of this response within the fission yeast clade.</description>

	<title>eLife: Nutrient levels and trade-offs control diversity in a serial dilution ecosystem</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57790</link>
	<description>Microbial communities feature an immense diversity of species and this diversity is linked to outcomes ranging from ecosystem stability to medical prognoses. Yet the mechanisms underlying microbial diversity are under debate. While simple resource-competition models don't allow for coexistence of a large number of species, it was recently shown that metabolic trade-offs can allow unlimited diversity. Does this diversity persist with more realistic, intermittent nutrient supply? Here, we demonstrate theoretically that in serial dilution culture, metabolic trade-offs allow for high diversity. When a small amount of nutrient is supplied to each batch, the serial dilution dynamics mimic a chemostat-like steady state. If more nutrient is supplied, community diversity shifts due to an 'early-bird' effect. The interplay of this effect with different environmental factors and diversity-supporting mechanisms leads to a variety of relationships between nutrient supply and diversity, suggesting that real ecosystems may not obey a universal nutrient-diversity relationship.</description>

	<title>eLife: Neural variability determines coding strategies for natural self-motion in macaque monkeys</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57484</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57484</link>
	<description>We have previously reported that central neurons mediating vestibulo-spinal reflexes and self-motion perception optimally encode natural self-motion (Mitchell et al., 2018). Importantly however, the vestibular nuclei also comprise other neuronal classes that mediate essential functions such as the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and its adaptation. Here we show that heterogeneities in resting discharge variability mediate a trade-off between faithful encoding and optimal coding via temporal whitening. Specifically, neurons displaying lower variability did not whiten naturalistic self-motion but instead faithfully represented the stimulus' detailed time course, while neurons displaying higher variability displayed temporal whitening. Using a well-established model of VOR pathways, we demonstrate that faithful stimulus encoding is necessary to generate the compensatory eye movements found experimentally during naturalistic self-motion. Our findings suggest a novel functional role for variability towards establishing different coding strategies: 1) faithful stimulus encoding for generating the VOR; 2) optimized coding via temporal whitening for other vestibular functions.</description>

	<title>eLife: Large domains of heterochromatin direct the formation of short mitotic chromosome loops</title>

	<description>During mitosis chromosomes reorganise into highly compact, rod-shaped forms, thought to consist of consecutive chromatin loops around a central protein scaffold. Condensin complexes are involved in chromatin compaction, but the contribution of other chromatin proteins, DNA sequence and histone modifications is less understood. A large region of fission yeast DNA inserted into a mouse chromosome was previously observed to adopt a mitotic organisation distinct from that of surrounding mouse DNA. Here we show that a similar distinct structure is common to a large subset of insertion events in both mouse and human cells and is coincident with the presence of high levels of heterochromatic H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3). Hi-C and microscopy indicate that the heterochromatinised fission yeast DNA is organised into smaller chromatin loops than flanking euchromatic mouse chromatin. We conclude that heterochromatin alters chromatin loop size, thus contributing to the distinct appearance of heterochromatin on mitotic chromosomes.</description>

	<title>eLife: Structural Insights into Human Acid-sensing Ion Channel 1a Inhibition by Snake Toxin Mambalgin1</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57096</link>
	<description>Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are proton-gated cation channels that are involved in diverse neuronal processes including pain sensing. Peptide toxin Mambalgin1 (Mamba1) from black mamba snake venom can reversibly inhibit the conductance of ASICs, showing an analgesic effect. However, the detailed inhibitory mechanism of Mamba1 on ASIC1s, especially how Mamba1 binding to extracellular domain affects the conformational changes of the transmembrane domain of ASICs remains elusive. Here, we present single-particle cryo-EM structures of human ASIC1a (hASIC1a) and hASIC1a-Mamba1 complex at resolutions of 3.56 and 3.90 Å, respectively. The structures revealed the inhibited conformation of hASIC1a upon Mamba1 binding. The combination of the structural and physiological data indicates that Mamba1 prefers to bind hASIC1a in a closed state and reduces the proton sensitivity of the channel, representing a closed-state trapping mechanism.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Co-targeting myelin inhibitors and CSPGs enhances sensory axon regeneration within, but not into, the spinal cord</title>

	<description>A major barrier to intraspinal regeneration after dorsal root (DR) injury is the DR entry zone (DREZ), the CNS/PNS interface. DR axons stop regenerating at the DREZ, even if regenerative capacity is increased by a conditioning lesion. This potent blockade has long been attributed to myelin-associated inhibitors and CSPGs, but incomplete lesions and conflicting reports have hampered conclusive agreement. Here we evaluated DR regeneration in adult mice, using novel strategies to facilitate complete lesions and comprehensive analyses, selective tracing of proprio-/mechanoreceptive axons with AAV2, and genetic or viral targeting of Nogo, MAG, OMgp, CSPGs and GDNF. Simultaneously eliminating Nogo/MAG/OMgp elicited little intraspinal penetration of DR axons, even with additional removal of CSPGs and a conditioning lesion. Their absence, however, synergistically enhanced GDNF-elicited intraspinal regeneration. We conclude that myelin inhibitors and CSPGs constrain intraspinal regrowth of DR axons, but that they are not the primary mechanism(s) stopping axons at the DREZ.</description>

	<description>Across animal species, meals are terminated after ingestion of large food volumes, yet underlying mechanosensory receptors have so far remained elusive. Here, we identify an essential role for Drosophila Piezo in volume-based control of meal size. We discover a rare population of fly neurons that express Piezo, innervate the anterior gut and crop (a food reservoir organ), and respond to tissue distension in a Piezo-dependent manner. Activating Piezo neurons decreases appetite, while Piezo knockout and Piezo neuron silencing cause gut bloating and increase both food consumption and body weight. These studies reveal that disrupting gut distension receptors changes feeding patterns, and identify a key role for Drosophila Piezo in internal organ mechanosensation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Proximity-dependent proteomics reveals extensive interactions of Protocadherin-19 with regulators of Rho GTPases and the microtubule cytoskeleton</title>

	<description>Protocadherin-19 belongs to the cadherin family of cell surface receptors and has been shown to play essential roles in the development of the vertebrate nervous system. Mutations in human Protocadherin-19 (PCDH19) lead to PCDH19 Female-limited epilepsy (PCDH19 FLE) in humans, characterized by the early onset of epileptic seizures in children and a range of cognitive and behavioral problems in adults. Despite being considered the second most prevalent gene in epilepsy, very little is known about the intercellular pathways in which it participates. In order to characterize the protein complexes within which Pcdh19 functions, we generated Pcdh19-BioID fusion proteins and utilized proximity-dependent biotinylation to identify neighboring proteins. Proteomic identification and analysis revealed that the Pcdh19 interactome is enriched in proteins that regulate Rho family GTPases, microtubule binding proteins and proteins that regulate cell divisions. We cloned the centrosomal protein Nedd1 and the RacGEF Dock7 and verified their interactions with Pcdh19 in vitro. Our findings provide the first comprehensive insights into the interactome of Pcdh19, and provide a platform for future investigations into the cellular and molecular biology of this protein critical to the proper development of the nervous system.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Canonical goal-selective representations are absent from prefrontal cortex in a spatial working memory task requiring behavioral flexibility</title>

	<description>The prefrontal cortex (PFC)s functions are thought to include working memory, as its activity can reflect information that must be temporarily maintained to realize the current goal. We designed a flexible spatial working memory task that required rats to navigate - after distractions and a delay - to multiple possible goal locations from different starting points and via multiple routes. This made the current goal location the key variable to remember, instead of a particular direction or route to the goal. However, across a broad population of PFC neurons, we found no evidence of current-goal-specific memory in any previously reported form - i.e. differences in the rate, sequence, phase or covariance of firing. This suggests such patterns do not hold working memory in the PFC when information must be employed flexibly. Instead, the PFC grouped locations representing behaviorally equivalent task features together, consistent with a role in encoding long-term knowledge of task structure.</description>

	<description>Action selection is biased by the valence of anticipated outcomes. To assess the mechanisms by which these motivational biases are expressed and controlled, we measured simultaneous EEG-fMRI during a motivational Go/NoGo learning task (N=36), leveraging the temporal resolution of EEG and subcortical access of fMRI. VmPFC BOLD encoded cue valence, importantly predicting trial-by-trial valence-driven response speed differences and EEG theta power around cue onset. In contrast, striatal BOLD encoded selection of active Go responses and correlated with theta power around response time. Within trials, theta power ramped in the fashion of an evidence accumulation signal for the value of making a  Go response, capturing the faster responding to reward cues. Our findings reveal a dual nature of midfrontal theta power, with early components reflecting the vmPFC contribution to motivational biases, and late components reflecting their striatal translation into behavior, in line with influential recent &quot;value of work&quot; theories of striatal processing.</description>

	<description>Memories are thought to undergo an episodic-to-semantic transformation in the course of their consolidation. We here tested if repeated recall induces a similar semanticization, and if the resulting qualitative changes in memories can be measured using simple feature-specific reaction time probes. Participants studied associations between verbs and object images, and then repeatedly recalled the objects when cued with the verb, immediately and after a two-day delay. Reaction times during immediate recall demonstrated that conceptual features were accessed faster than perceptual features. Consistent with a semanticization process, this perceptual-conceptual gap significantly increased across the delay. A significantly smaller perceptual-conceptual gap was found in the delayed recall data of a control group who repeatedly studied the verb-object pairings on the first day, instead of actively recalling them. Our findings suggest that wake recall and offline consolidation interact to transform memories over time, strengthening meaningful semantic information over perceptual detail.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The Sez6 family inhibits complement at the level of the C3 convertase.</title>

	<description>The Sez6 family consists of Sez6, Sez6L, and Sez6L2. Its members are expressed throughout the brain and have been shown to influence synapse numbers and dendritic morphology. They are also linked to various neurological and psychiatric disorders. All Sez6 family members contain 2-3 CUB domains and 5 complement control protein (CCP) domains, suggesting that they may be involved in complement regulation. We show that all Sez6 family members inhibit C3 deposition by the classical and alterative pathways with varying degrees of efficacy. For the classical pathway, Sez6 is a strong inhibitor, Sez6L2 is a moderate inhibitor, and Sez6L is a weak inhibitor. Using Sez6L2 as the representative family member, we show that it specifically deactivates C3 convertases by accelerating the decay or dissociation of the C3 convertase components. Sez6L2 also deactivates C3 convertases of the alternative pathway by serving as a cofactor for Factor I to facilitate the cleavage of C3b. However, Sez6L2 has no cofactor activity toward C4b. In summary, the Sez6 family are novel complement regulators that inhibit C3 convertases.</description>

Memorizing time of an event may employ two different processes (i) encoding of the absolute time of an event within an episode, (ii) encoding of its relative order compared to other events. Here we study interaction between these two processes. We performed experiments in which one or two items (either words or images) were presented within a certain time interval, after which participants were asked to report the time of occurrence of presented items. The results show that when a single item is presented, the distribution of reported times is quite wide, with the overall bias towards the middle of the interval. When two items are presented, the relative order among them strongly affected the reported time of each of them. Moreover, a Bayesian theory taking into account the memory for the events order is broadly compatible with the experimental data, in particular in terms of the effect of order on absolute time reports. Our results suggest that people do not deduce order from memorized time, instead peoples memory for absolute time of events relies critically on memorized order of the events.</description>

	<description>BackgroundFunctional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a suitable tool for recording brain function in pediatric or challenging populations. As with other neuroimaging techniques, the scientific community is engaged in an evolving debate regarding the most adequate methods for performing fNIRS data analyses.

New methodWe introduce LIONirs, a neuroinformatics toolbox for fNIRS data analysis, designed to follow two main goals: (1) flexibility, to explore several methods in parallel and verify results using 3D visualization; (2) simplicity, to apply a defined processing pipeline to a large dataset of subjects by using the MATLAB Batch System.

ResultsWithin the graphical user interfaces (DisplayGUI), the user can reject noisy intervals and correct artifacts, while visualizing the topographical projection of the data onto the 3D head representation. Data decomposition methods are available for the identification of relevant signatures, such as brain responses or artifacts. Multimodal data recorded simultaneously to fNIRS, such as physiology, electroencephalography or audio-video, can be visualized using the DisplayGUI. The toolbox includes several functions that allow one to read, preprocess, and analyze fNIRS data, including task-based and functional connectivity measures.

Comparison with existing methodsSeveral good neuroinformatics tools for fNIRS data analysis are currently available. None of them emphasize multimodal visualization of the data throughout the preprocessing steps and multidimensional decomposition, which are essential for understanding challenging data. Furthermore, LIONirs provides compatibility and complementarity with other existing tools by supporting common data format.

ConclusionsLIONirs offers a flexible platform for basic and advanced fNIRS data analysis, shown through real experimental examples.

HighlightsO_LIThe LIONirs toolbox is designed for fNIRS data inspection and visualization.
C_LIO_LIMethods are integrated for isolation of relevant activity and correction of artifacts.
C_LIO_LIMultimodal auxiliary, EEG or audio-video are visualized alongside the fNIRS data.
C_LIO_LITask-based and functional connectivity measure analysis tools are available.

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A reduction in voluntary physical activity during pregnancy in mice is mediated by prolactin</title>

	<description>As part of the maternal adaptations to pregnancy, mice show a rapid, profound reduction in voluntary running wheel activity (RWA) as soon as pregnancy is achieved. Here, we evaluate the hypothesis that prolactin, one of the first hormones to change secretion pattern following mating, is involved in driving this suppression of physical activity levels during pregnancy. We show that prolactin can acutely suppress RWA in virgin female mice, and that conditional deletion of prolactin receptors (Prlr) from either all forebrain neurons or from GABA neurons prevented the early pregnancy-induced suppression of RWA. Deletion of Prlr specifically from the medial preoptic area, a brain region associated with multiple homeostatic and behavioural roles including parental behaviour, completely abolished the early pregnancy-induced suppression of RWA. Our data demonstrate a key role for prolactin in suppressing voluntary physical activity during early pregnancy, highlighting a novel biological basis for reduced physical activity in pregnancy.</description>

	<description>We compared trial-by-trial dynamics of place cells in CA1 and CA3 in new contexts across days. We found that CA1 place fields form early but shift backwards with experience and partially remap across days. In contrast, CA3 place fields develop gradually but remain stable with experience and across days. This suggests distinct plasticity mechanisms drive the formation and dynamics of place fields in CA1 and CA3 to encode distinct features of experience.</description>

	<description>Many insects use patterns of polarized light in the sky to orient and navigate. Here we functionally characterize neural circuitry in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, that conveys polarized light signals from the eye to the central complex, a brain region essential for the flys sense of direction. Neurons tuned to the angle of polarization of ultraviolet light are found throughout the anterior visual pathway, connecting the optic lobes with the central complex via the anterior optic tubercle and bulb, in a homologous organization to the  sky compass pathways described in other insects. We detail how a consistent, map-like organization of neural tunings in the peripheral visual system is transformed into a reduced representation suited to flexible processing in the central brain. This study identifies computational motifs of the transformation, enabling mechanistic comparisons of multisensory integration and central processing for navigation in the brains of insects.</description>

	<description>Visual perceptual learning (VPL) is an improvement in visual function following training. Although the practical utility of VPL was once thought to be limited by its specificity to the precise stimuli used during training, more recent work has shown that such specificity can be overcome with appropriate training protocols. In contrast, relatively little is known about the extent to which VPL exhibits motor specificity. Indeed, previous studies have shown that training paradigms that require one type of response (e.g., a button press) do not necessarily transfer to those that require a different response (e.g., a mouse movement). In this work, we have examined the effector specificity of VPL by training observers on tasks that maintain the same visual stimuli and task structure, but that require different effectors to indicate the response. We find that, in these conditions, VPL transfers fully between manual and oculomotor responses. These results are consistent with the idea that VPL entails the learning of a decision rule that can generalize across effectors.</description>

	<description>The brain functional network extracted from the BOLD signals reveals the correlated activity of the different brain regions, which is hypothesized to underlie the integration of the information across functionally specialized areas. Functional networks are not static and change over time and in different brain states, enabling the nervous system to engage and disengage different local areas in specific tasks on demand. Due to the low temporal resolution, however, BOLD signals do not allow the exploration of spectral properties of the brain dynamics over different frequency bands which are known to be important in cognitive processes. Recent studies using imaging tools with a high temporal resolution has made it possible to explore the correlation between the regions at multiple frequency bands. These studies introduce the frequency as a new dimension over which the functional networks change, enabling brain networks to transmit multiplex of information at any time. In this computational study, we explore the functional connectivity at different frequency ranges and highlight the role of the distance between the nodes in their correlation. We run the generalized Kuramoto model with delayed interactions on top of the brains connectome and show that how the transmission delay and the strength of the connections, affect the correlation between the pair of nodes over different frequency bands.</description>

Biological systems are composed of countless interlocking feedback loops. Reactor control systems—such as Chi-Bio (https://chi.bio/), recently published in &lt;i&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/i&gt;—enable biologists to drive multiple processes within living biological samples, using a single experimental framework. Consequently, the dynamic relationships between many biological variables can be explored simultaneously in situ. Similar multivariable experimental reactors are employed beyond biology in the study of active matter and non-equilibrium chemical reactions, in which physical systems are maintained far from equilibrium through the continuous introduction of energy or matter. Inexpensive state-of-the-art components enable open-source implementation of such multiparameter architectures, which represent a move away from expensive systems optimised for single measurements, towards affordable and reconfigurable multi-measurement systems. The transfer of well-understood engineering knowledge into the hands of biological and chemical specialists via open-source channels allows rapid cycles of experimental development and heralds a change in experimental capability that is driving increased theoretical and practical understanding of out-of-equilibrium systems across a wide range of scientific fields.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/uhGeh_uSlwI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Autoantibodies Blocking M3 Muscarinic Receptors Cause Postganglionic Cholinergic Dysautonomia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A 10‐year‐old girl presented with ileus, urinary retention, dry mouth, lack of tears, fixed dilated pupils, and diffuse anhidrosis 7 days after a febrile illness. We hypothesized that her syndrome was due to autoimmunity against muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, blocking their activation. Using an indirect enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay for all 5 muscarinic receptors (M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;–M&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), we identified in the patient's serum antibodies that selectively bound to M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. In vitro functional studies confirmed that these autoantibodies selectively blocked M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation. Thus, autoantibodies against M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; acetylcholine receptors cause acute postganglionic cholinergic dysautonomia. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Surgical Outcomes Can Be Inferred Based on Structural Connectome Hubs: A Machine Learning Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25888?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25888?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of medication‐resistant focal epilepsy in adults. Despite removal of medial temporal structures, more than one‐third of patients continue to have disabling seizures postoperatively. Seizure refractoriness implies that extramedial regions are capable of influencing the brain network and generating seizures. We tested whether abnormalities of structural network integration could be associated with surgical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presurgical magnetic resonance images from 121 patients with drug‐resistant TLE across 3 independent epilepsy centers were used to train feed‐forward neural network models based on tissue volume or graph‐theory measures from whole‐brain diffusion tensor imaging structural connectomes. An independent dataset of 47 patients with TLE from 3 other epilepsy centers was used to assess the predictive values of each model and regional anatomical contributions toward surgical treatment results.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve based on regional betweenness centrality was 0.88, significantly higher than a random model or models based on gray matter volumes, degree, strength, and clustering coefficient. Nodes most strongly contributing to the predictive models involved the bilateral parahippocampal gyri, as well as the superior temporal gyri.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network integration in the medial and lateral temporal regions was related to surgical outcomes. Patients with abnormally integrated structural network nodes were less likely to achieve seizure freedom. These findings are in line with previous observations related to network abnormalities in TLE and expand on the notion of underlying aberrant plasticity. Our findings provide additional information on the mechanisms of surgical refractoriness. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neurochemical phenotype of growth hormone‐responsive cells in the mouse paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c728ff9a-6713-40fb-8f47-5a94aec5172f/cne25017-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Graphical Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the capacity of a systemic growth hormone (GH) injection to induce STAT5 phosphorylation in the mouse brain, we identified several neurochemically distinct neuronal populations in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus that are directly responsive to GH, including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)‐, somatostatin (SST)‐, thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH)‐ and corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH)‐producing neurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple neuroendocrine, autonomic and behavioral responses are regulated by the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH). Previous studies have shown that PVH neurons express the growth hormone (GH) receptor (GHR), although the role of GH signaling on PVH neurons is still unknown. Given the great heterogeneity of cell types located in the PVH, we performed a detailed analysis of the neurochemical identity of GH‐responsive cells to understand the possible physiological importance of GH action on PVH neurons. GH‐responsive cells were detected via the phosphorylated form of the signal transducer and activator of transcription‐5 (pSTAT5) in adult male mice that received an intraperitoneal GH injection. Approximately 51% of GH‐responsive cells in the PVH co‐localized with the vesicular glutamate transporter 2. Rare co‐localizations between pSTAT5 and vesicular GABA transporter or vasopressin were observed, whereas approximately 20% and 38% of oxytocin and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) cells, respectively, were responsive to GH in the PVH. Approximately 55%, 35% and 63% of somatostatin, thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH) and corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH) neurons expressed GH‐induced pSTAT5, respectively. Additionally, 8%, 49% and 75% of neuroendocrine TH, TRH and CRH neurons, and 67%, 32% and 74% of nonneuroendocrine TH, TRH and CRH neurons were responsive to GH in the PVH of Fluoro‐Gold‐injected mice. Our findings suggest that GH action on PVH neurons is involved in the regulation of the thyroid, somatotropic and adrenal endocrine axes, possibly influencing homeostatic and stress responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Whole‐brain efferent and afferent connectivity of mouse ventral tegmental area melanocortin‐3 receptor neurons&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c61725ba-b94d-4e62-b687-ee4708049ca8/cne25013-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
VTA MC3R neurons are a likely site of interaction between homeostatic and hedonic feeding circuits.
VTA MC3R neurons send efferent projections to, and receive afferent input from, multiple brain regions involved in feeding, reward, and aversion.
Very few POMC and AgRP neurons were labeled by monosynaptic rabies from multiple VTA neuron subtypes.



&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system is involved in the regulation of multiple behaviors, including feeding, and evidence demonstrates that the melanocortin system can act on the mesolimbic DA system to control feeding and other behaviors. The melanocortin‐3 receptor (MC3R) is an important component of the melanocortin system, but its overall role is poorly understood. Because MC3Rs are highly expressed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and are likely to be the key interaction point between the melanocortin and mesolimbic DA systems, we set out to identify both the efferent projection patterns of VTA MC3R neurons and the location of the neurons providing afferent input to them. VTA MC3R neurons were broadly connected to neurons across the brain but were strongly connected to a discrete set of brain regions involved in the regulation of feeding, reward, and aversion. Surprisingly, experiments using monosynaptic rabies virus showed that proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti‐related protein (AgRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus made few direct synapses onto VTA MC3R neurons or any of the other major neuronal subtypes in the VTA, despite being extensively labeled by general retrograde tracers injected into the VTA. These results greatly contribute to our understanding of the anatomical interactions between the melanocortin and mesolimbic systems and provide a foundation for future studies of VTA MC3R neurons and the circuits containing them in the control of feeding and other behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Retina‐specific targeting of pericytes reveals structural diversity and enables control of capillary blood flow&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/70a367bb-d1a6-4cc2-a5f4-c918eb5953e6/cne25011-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivanova et al., use sparse labeling of mural cells in the retina to identify pericyte diversity and to selectively manipulate capillary blood flow.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pericytes are a unique class of mural cells essential for angiogenesis, maintenance of the vasculature and are key players in microvascular pathology. However, their diversity and specific roles are poorly understood, limiting our insight into vascular physiology and the ability to develop effective therapies. Here, in the mouse retina, a tractable model of the CNS, we evaluated distinct classes of mural cells along the vascular tree for both structural characterization and physiological manipulation of blood flow. To accomplish this, we first tested three inducible mural cell‐specific mouse lines using a sensitive Ai14 reporter and tamoxifen application either by a systemic injection, or by local administration in the form of eye drops. The specificity and pattern of cre activation varied significantly across the three lines, under either the PDGFRβ or NG2 promoter (Pdgfrβ‐CreRha, Pdgfrβ‐CreCsln, and Cspg4‐Cre). In particular, a mouse line with Cre under the NG2 promoter resulted in sparse TdTomato labeling of mural cells, allowing for an unambiguous characterization of anatomical features of individual sphincter cells and capillary pericytes. Furthermore, in one PDGFRβ line, we found that focal eye drop application of tamoxifen led to an exclusive Cre‐activation in pericytes, without affecting arterial mural cells. We then used this approach to boost capillary blood flow by selective expression of Halorhodopsin, a highly precise hyperpolarizing optogenetic actuator. The ability to exclusively target capillary pericytes may prove a precise and potentially powerful tool to treat microcirculation deficits, a common pathology in numerous diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Emotions are a central key for understanding human beings and of fun-damental
importance regarding their impact in human and animal behaviors.They have been
for a long time a subject of study for various scholars includ-ing in
particular philosophers and mystics [29, 5, 7, 36, 35, 22, 27, 31]. Inmodern
science, the emotional phenomenon has attracted for a few decadesan increasing
number of studies, notably in the fields of Psychology, Psy-chiatry,
Neuroscience and Biochemistry [1, 3, 2, 9, 11, 17, 16, 19, 20, 23,24, 25, 26,
32, 34]. However, since our perception of emotions is not, sofar, directly
detectable nor recordable by our measure instruments, Physicsand Mathematics
have not been so far used academically to provide a pre-cise description of the
phenomenon of feeling an emotion. Relying upon theworks of O. Elahi [10, 14]
and on the hypothesis that the human soul and itspsyche may manifest in
ourselves (in both conscious and unconscious man-ner) in an analog way as
electromagnetic waves [13], we propose here a fewmathematical descriptions
consistent with the human personal experience,of the feeling and cognition of
emotions. As far as we know, such a mathe-matical description has never been
provided before. It allows a quantitative(intensity) and qualitative (nature of
feelings/frequency) of the emotionalphenomenon which provides a novel
scientific approach of the nature of the mind, complementary to the on going
research of physiological manifesta-tion of emotions. We anticipate such an
approach and the associated math-ematical modeling to become an important tool
to describe emotions andtheir subsequent behavior. In complement of the
modeling of oscillationsand brain dynamics[4, 8, 28], it provides a fruitful
direction of research withpotentially broad and deep impacts in both applied
mathematics, physics,cognitive and behavioral sciences.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Generalizing Complex/Hyper-complex Convolutions to Vector Map Convolutions. (arXiv:2009.04083v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We show that the core reasons that complex and hypercomplex valued neural
networks offer improvements over their real-valued counterparts is the weight
sharing mechanism and treating multidimensional data as a single entity. Their
algebra linearly combines the dimensions, making each dimension related to the
others. However, both are constrained to a set number of dimensions, two for
complex and four for quaternions. Here we introduce novel vector map
convolutions which capture both of these properties provided by
complex/hypercomplex convolutions, while dropping the unnatural dimensionality
constraints they impose. This is achieved by introducing a system that mimics
the unique linear combination of input dimensions, such as the Hamilton product
for quaternions. We perform three experiments to show that these novel vector
map convolutions seem to capture all the benefits of complex and hyper-complex
networks, such as their ability to capture internal latent relations, while
avoiding the dimensionality restriction.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;When presented with information of any type, from music to language to
mathematics, the human mind subconsciously arranges it into a network. A
network puts pieces of information like musical notes, syllables or
mathematical concepts into context by linking them together. These networks
help our minds organize information and anticipate what is coming. Here we
present two questions about network building. 1) Can humans more easily learn
some types of networks than others? 2) Do humans find some links between ideas
more surprising than others? The answer to both questions is &quot;Yes,&quot; and we
explain why. The findings provide much-needed insight into the ways that humans
learn about the networked world around them. Moreover, the study paves the way
for future efforts seeking to optimize how information is presented to
accelerate human learning.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: On the thermodynamics of prediction under dissipative adaptation. (arXiv:2009.04006v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, the dissipated heat of a thermodynamic work extraction
process upper bounds the non-predictive information, which the associated
system encodes about its environment. Thus, emergent information processing
capabilities can be understood from the perspective of a pressure towards high
thermodynamic efficiency. On the other hand, the second law of thermodynamics
plays a crucial role in the emergence of complex, self-organising dissipative
structures. Such structures are thermodynamically favoured, because they can
dissipate free energy reservoirs, which would not be accessible otherwise.
Thereby, they allow a closed system to move from one meta-stable state to
another meta-stable state of higher entropy. This paper will argue, that these
two views are not contradictory, but that their combination allows to
understand the transition from simple self-organising dissipative structures to
complex information processing systems. If the efficiency required by a
dissipative structure to harvest enough work from the channeled flow of free
energy to maintain its own structure is high, there is a drive for this system
to be predictive. Still, the existence of this dissipative system is
thermodynamically favoured, compared to a situation without any dissipative
structure. Due to the emergence of a hierarchy of dissipative systems, which by
themselves are non-equilibrium structures that can be dissipated, such a drive
develops naturally, as one ascends in this hierarchy further and further away
from the initial driving disequilibrium.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;By positing a relationship between naturalistic reading times and
information-theoretic surprisal, surprisal theory (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008)
provides a natural interface between language models and psycholinguistic
models. This paper re-evaluates a claim due to Goodkind and Bicknell (2018)
that a language model's ability to model reading times is a linear function of
its perplexity. By extending Goodkind and Bicknell's analysis to modern neural
architectures, we show that the proposed relation does not always hold for Long
Short-Term Memory networks, Transformers, and pre-trained models. We introduce
an alternate measure of language modeling performance called predictability
norm correlation based on Cloze probabilities measured from human subjects. Our
new metric yields a more robust relationship between language model quality and
psycholinguistic modeling performance that allows for comparison between models
with different training configurations.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Lightweight or mobile neural networks used for real-time computer vision
tasks contain fewer parameters than normal networks, which lead to a
constrained performance. In this work, we proposed a novel activation function
named Tanh Exponential Activation Function (TanhExp) which can improve the
performance for these networks on image classification task significantly. The
definition of TanhExp is f(x) = xtanh(e^x). We demonstrate the simplicity,
efficiency, and robustness of TanhExp on various datasets and network models
and TanhExp outperforms its counterparts in both convergence speed and
accuracy. Its behaviour also remains stable even with noise added and dataset
altered. We show that without increasing the size of the network, the capacity
of lightweight neural networks can be enhanced by TanhExp with only a few
training epochs and no extra parameters added.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Grid cells are believed to play an important role in both spatial and
non-spatial cognition tasks. A recent study observed the emergence of grid
cells in an LSTM for path integration. The connection between biological and
artificial neural networks underlying the seemingly similarity, as well as the
application domain of grid cells in deep neural networks (DNNs), expect further
exploration. This work demonstrated that grid cells could be replicated in
either pure vision based or vision guided path integration DNNs for navigation
under a proper setting of training parameters. We also show that grid-like
behaviors arise in feedforward DNNs for non-spatial tasks. Our findings support
that the grid coding is an effective representation for both biological and
artificial networks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;How an individual's unique brain connectivity determines that individual's
cognition, behavior, and risk for pathology is a fundamental question in basic
and clinical neuroscience. In seeking answers, many have turned to machine
learning, with some noting the particular promise of deep neural networks in
modelling complex non-linear functions. However, it is not clear that complex
functions actually exist between brain connectivity and behavior, and thus if
deep neural networks necessarily outperform simpler linear models, or if their
results would be interpretable. Here we show that, across 52 subject measures
of cognition and behavior, deep neural networks fit to each brain region's
connectivity outperform linear regression, particularly for the brain's
connector hubs--regions with diverse brain connectivity--whereas the two
approaches perform similarly when fit to brain systems. Critically, averaging
deep neural network predictions across brain regions results in the most
accurate predictions, demonstrating the ability of deep neural networks to
easily model the various functions that exists between regional brain
connectivity and behavior, carving the brain at its joints. Finally, we shine
light into the black box of deep neural networks using multislice network
models. We determined that the relationship between connector hubs and behavior
is best captured by modular deep neural networks. Our results demonstrate that
both simple and complex relationships exist between brain connectivity and
behavior, and that deep neural networks can fit both. Moreover, deep neural
networks are particularly powerful when they are first fit to the various
functions of a system independently and then combined. Finally, deep neural
networks are interpretable when their architectures are structurally
characterized using multislice network models.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Episodic Memories: How do the Hippocampus and the Entorhinal Ring Attractors Cooperate to Create Them?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.559186</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.559186</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain is capable of registering a constellation of events, encountered only once, as an episodic memory that can last for a lifetime. As evidenced by the clinical case of the patient HM, memories preserving their episodic nature still depend on the hippocampal formation, several years after being created, while semantic memories are thought to reside in neocortical areas. The neurobiological substrate of one-time learning and life-long storing in the brain, that must exist at the cellular and circuit level, is still undiscovered. The breakthrough is delayed by the fact that studies jointly investigating the rodent hippocampus and entorhinal cortex are mostly targeted at understanding the spatial aspect of learning. Here, we present the concept of an entorhinal cortical module, termed EPISODE module, that could explain how the representations of different elements constituting episodic memories can be linked together at the stage of encoding. The new model that we propose here reconciles the structural and functional observations made in the entorhinal cortex and explains how the downstream hippocampal processing organizes the representations into meaningful sequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Early-Occurring Dendritic Spines Alterations in Mouse Models of Alzheimer’s Disease Inform on Primary Causes of Neurodegeneration</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The consensus that synaptic failure is the earliest cause of cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has initially led to investigate structural (dendritic spines) and physiological (LTP) synaptic dysfunctions in mouse models of AD with established cognitive alterations. The challenge is now to track down ultra-early alterations in spines to uncover causes rather than disease’s symptoms. This review article pinpoints dysregulations of the postsynaptic density (PSD) protein network which alter the morphology and function of spines in pre- and early- symptomatic hAPP mouse models of AD, and, hence, inform on primary causes of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Role of Copper in Tau-Related Pathology in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.572308</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;All tauopathies, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are characterized by the intracellular accumulation of abnormal forms of tau protein in neurons and glial cells, which negatively affect microtubule stability. Under physiological conditions, tubulin-associated unit (Tau) protein is intrinsically disordered, almost without secondary structure, and is not prone to aggregation. In AD, it assembles, and forms paired helical filaments (PHFs) that further build-up neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Aggregates are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein that is more prone to aggregation. The pathology of AD is also linked to disturbed copper homeostasis, which promotes oxidative stress (OS). Copper imbalance is widely observed in AD patients. Deregulated copper ions may initiate and exacerbate tau hyperphosphorylation and formation of β-sheet-rich tau fibrils that ultimately contribute to synaptic failure, neuronal death, and cognitive decline observed in AD patients. The present review summarizes factors affecting the process of tau aggregation, conformational changes of small peptide sequences in the microtubule-binding domain required for these motifs to act as seeding sites in aggregation, and the role of copper in OS induction, tau hyperphosphorylation and tau assembly. A better understanding of the various factors that affect tau aggregation under OS conditions may reveal new targets and novel pharmacological approaches for the therapy of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Overexpression of GSK-3β in Adult Tet-OFF GSK-3β Transgenic Mice, and Not During Embryonic or Postnatal Development, Induces Tau Phosphorylation, Neurodegeneration and Learning Deficits</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.561470</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;GSK-3β or tau-kinase I is particularly abundant in the central nervous system (CNS), playing a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Accordingly, transgenic mouse models overexpressing this kinase recapitulate some aspects of this disease, such as tau hyperphosphorylation, neuronal death, and microgliosis. These alterations have been studied in mouse models showing GSK-3β overexpression from birth. In this case, some of these alterations may be due to adaptations that occur during development. Here we explored the potential of the Tet-OFF conditional system in the murine CamKIIα-tTA/GSK-3β model to increase the activity of GSK-3β only during adulthood. To this end, the overexpression of GSK-3β remained OFF during embryonic and postnatal development by administration of doxycycline in drinking water for 6 months, while it was turned ON in adult animals by removal of the treatment for 6 months. In these conditions, the CamKIIα-tTA/GSK-3β mouse is characterized by an increase in phosphorylated tau, cell death, and microgliosis. Furthermore, the increase in GSK-3β expression in the adult animals triggered a cognitive deficit, as determined through the hippocampus-dependent object recognition test (OR). These results demonstrate that the GSK-3β plays a key role in AD and that previously published data with other transgenic models are neither caused by or a consequence of adaptations to high levels of the enzyme during development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein Regulates Striatal Medium Spiny Neuron Synapse Density and Dendritic Spine Morphology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00161</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00161</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein that mediates the transport, stability, and translation of hundreds of brain RNAs, is critically involved in regulating synaptic function. Loss of FMRP, as in fragile X syndrome (FXS), is a leading monogenic cause of autism and results in altered structural and functional synaptic plasticity, widely described in the hippocampus and cortex. Though FXS is associated with hyperactivity, impaired social interaction, and the development of repetitive or stereotyped behaviors, all of which are influenced by striatal activity, few studies have investigated the function of FMRP here. Utilizing a cortical-striatal co-culture model, we find that striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) lacking FMRP fail to make normal increases in PSD95 expression over a short time period and have significant deficits in dendritic spine density and colocalized synaptic puncta at the later measured time point compared to wildtype (WT) MSNs. Acute expression of wtFMRP plasmid in Fmr1 KO co-cultures results in contrasting outcomes for these measures on MSNs at the more mature time point, reducing spine density across multiple spine types but making no significant changes in colocalized puncta. FMRP’s KH2 and RGG RNA-binding domains are required for normal elimination of PSD95, and interruption of these domains slightly favors elimination of immature spine types. Further, KH2 is required for normal levels of colocalized puncta. Our data are largely consistent with a basal role for FMRP and its RNA-binding domains in striatal synapse stabilization on developing MSNs, and in light of previous findings, suggest distinct regional and/or cell type-specific roles for FMRP in regulating synapse structure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: miRNA Alterations Elicit Pathways Involved in Memory Decline and Synaptic Function in the Hippocampus of Aged Tg4-42 Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.580524</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The transcriptome of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) species is increasingly focused in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research. NcRNAs comprise, among others, transfer RNAs, long non-coding RNAs and microRNAs (miRs), each with their own specific biological function. We used smallRNASeq to assess miR expression in the hippocampus of young (3 month old) and aged (8 month old) Tg4-42 mice, a model system for sporadic AD, as well as age-matched wildtype controls. Tg4-42 mice express N-truncated Aβ&lt;sub&gt;4–42&lt;/sub&gt;, develop age-related neuron loss, reduced neurogenesis and behavioral deficits. Our results do not only confirm known miR-AD associations in Tg4-42 mice, but more importantly pinpoint 22 additional miRs associated to the disease. Twenty-five miRs were differentially expressed in both aged Tg4-42 and aged wildtype mice while eight miRs were differentially expressed only in aged wildtype mice, and 33 only in aged Tg4-42 mice. No significant alteration in the miRNome was detected in young mice, which indicates that the changes observed in aged mice are down-stream effects of Aβ-induced pathology in the Tg4-42 mouse model for AD. Targets of those miRs were predicted using miRWalk. For miRs that were differentially expressed only in the Tg4-42 model, 128 targets could be identified, whereas 18 genes were targeted by miRs only differentially expressed in wildtype mice and 85 genes were targeted by miRs differentially expressed in both mouse models. Genes targeted by differentially expressed miRs in the Tg4-42 model were enriched for negative regulation of long-term synaptic potentiation, learning or memory, regulation of trans-synaptic signaling and modulation of chemical synaptic transmission obtained. This untargeted miR sequencing approach supports previous reports on the Tg4-42 mice as a valuable model for AD. Furthermore, it revealed miRs involved in AD, which can serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: From Coarse to Fine-Grained Parcellation of the Cortical Surface Using a Fiber-Bundle Atlas</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00032</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00032</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we present a hybrid method to create fine-grained parcellations of the cortical surface, from a coarse-grained parcellation according to an anatomical atlas, based on cortico-cortical connectivity. The connectivity information is obtained from segmented superficial and deep white matter bundles, according to bundle atlases, instead of the whole tractography. Thus, a direct matching between the fiber bundles and the cortical regions is obtained, avoiding the problem of finding the correspondence of the cortical parcels among subjects. Generating parcels from segmented fiber bundles can provide a good representation of the human brain connectome since they are based on bundle atlases that contain the most reproducible short and long connections found on a population of subjects. The method first processes the tractography of each subject and extracts the bundles of the atlas, based on a segmentation algorithm. Next, the intersection between the fiber bundles and the cortical mesh is calculated, to define the initial and final intersection points of each fiber. A fiber filtering is then applied to eliminate misclassified fibers, based on the anatomical definition of each bundle and the labels of Desikan-Killiany anatomical parcellation. A parcellation algorithm is then performed to create a subdivision of the anatomical regions of the cortex, which is reproducible across subjects. This step resolves the overlapping of the fiber bundle extremities over the cortical mesh within each anatomical region. For the analysis, the density of the connections and the degree of overlapping, is considered and represented with a graph. One of our parcellations, an atlas composed of 160 parcels, achieves a reproducibility across subjects of ≈0.74, based on the average Dice's coefficient between subject's connectivity matrices, rather than ≈0.73 obtained for a macro anatomical parcellation of 150 parcels. Moreover, we compared two of our parcellations with state-of-the-art atlases, finding a degree of similarity with dMRI, functional, anatomical, and multi-modal atlases. The higher similarity was found for our parcellation composed of 185 sub-parcels with another parcellation based on dMRI data from the same database, but created with a different approach, leading to 130 parcels in common based on a Dice's coefficient ≥0.5.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Tracking Changes in Frontal Lobe Hemodynamic Response in Individual Adults With Developmental Language Disorder Following HD tDCS Enhanced Phonological Working Memory Training: An fNIRS Feasibility Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00362</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Current research suggests a neurobiological marker of developmental language disorder (DLD) in adolescents and young adults may be an atypical neural profile coupled with behavioral performance that overlaps with that of normal controls. Although many imaging techniques are not suitable for the study of speech and language processing in DLD populations, fNIRS may be a viable option. In this study we asked if fNIRS can be used to identify atypical cortical activation patterns in individual adults with DLD and track potential changes in cortical activation patterns following a phonological working memory training protocol enhanced with anodal HD tDCS stimulation to the presupplementary motor area (preSMA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) to determine if fNIRS can be used to identify atypical hemodynamic responses in individual young adults with DLD during active spoken word processing and, (2) to determine if fNIRS can detect changes in hemodynamic response in these same adults with DLD following anodal HD tDCS enhanced phonological working memory training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Two adult subjects with DLD (female, age 25) completed a total of two sessions of fNIRs working memory task prior to and following one session of a non-word repetition task paired with anodal HD tDCS (1.0 mA tDCS; 20 min) to the preSMA. Standardized z-scores of behavioral measures (accuracy and reaction time) and changes in hemodynamic response during an n-back working memory task for the two participants with DLD was compared to that of a normative sample of 21 age- and gender- matched normal controls (ages 18 to 25) prior to and following phonological working memory training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Individual standardized z-scores for each participant with DLD indicated that prior to training, hemoglobin response in the prefrontal lobe for both participants was markedly different from each other and normal controls. Following training, standard scores showed that the hemodynamic response for both participants moved within normal limits for ROIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These findings highlight the feasibility of fNIRS to establish individual differences in the link between behavior and neural patterns in single subjects with DLD, as well as track individual differences in changes in brain activity following working memory training.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain Vital Signs Detect Cognitive Improvements During Combined Physical Therapy and Neuromodulation in Rehabilitation From Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: A Case Report</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Using a longitudinal case study design, we have tracked the recovery of motor function following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) through a multimodal neuroimaging approach. In 2006, Canadian Soldier Captain (retired) Trevor Greene (TG) was attacked with an axe to the head while on tour in Afghanistan. TG continues intensive daily rehabilitation, which recently included the integration of physical therapy (PT) with neuromodulation using translingual neurostimulation (TLNS) to facilitate neuroplasticity. Recent findings with PT + TLNS demonstrated that recovery of motor function occurred beyond conventional time limits, currently extending past 14-years post-injury. To investigate whether PT + TLNS similarly resulted in associated cognitive function improvements, we examined event-related potentials (ERPs) with the brain vital signs framework. In parallel with motor function improvements, brain vital signs detected significant increases in basic attention (as measured by P300 response amplitude) and cognitive processing (as measured by contextual N400 response amplitude). These objective cognitive improvements corresponded with TG’s self-reported improvements, including a noteworthy and consistent reduction in ongoing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The findings provide valuable insight into the potential importance of non-invasive neuromodulation in cognitive rehabilitation, in addition to initial indications for physical rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Degeneracy and Complexity in Neuro-Behavioral Correlates of Team Coordination</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Team coordination—members of a group acting together rather than performing specific actions individually—is essential for success in many real-world tasks such as military missions, sports, workplace, or school interactions. However, team coordination is highly variable, which is one reason why its underlying neural processes are largely unknown. Here we used dual electroencephalography (EEG) in dyads to study the neurobehavioral dynamics of team coordination in an ecologically valid task that places intensive demands on joint performance. We present a novel conceptual framework to interpret neurobehavioral variability in terms of degeneracy, a fundamental property of complex biological systems said to enhance flexibility and robustness. We characterize degeneracy conceptually in terms of a manifold representing the geometric locus of the dynamics in the high dimensional state-space of neurobehavioral signals. The geometry and dimensionality of the manifold are determined by task constraints and team coordination requirements which restrict the manifold to trajectories that are conducive to successful task performance. Our results indicate that team coordination is associated with dimensionality reduction of the manifold as evident in increased inter-brain phase coherence of beta and gamma rhythms during critical phases of task performance where subjects exchange information. Team coordination was also found to affect the shape of the manifold manifested as a symmetry breaking of centro-parietal wavelet power patterns across subjects in trials with high team coordination. These results open a conceptual and empirical path to identifying the mechanisms underlying team performance in complex tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Assessing the Impact of Ih Conductance on Cross-Frequency Coupling in Model Pyramidal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00081</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Large cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons are elements of neuronal circuitry that have been implicated in cross-frequency coupling (CFC) during cognitive tasks. We investigate potential mechanisms for CFC within these neurons by examining the role that the hyperpolarization-activated mixed cation current (I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) plays in modulating CFC characteristics in multicompartment neuronal models. We quantify CFC along the soma-apical dendrite axis and tuft of three models configured to have different spatial distributions of I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance density: (1) exponential gradient along the soma-apical dendrite axis, (2) uniform distribution, and (3) no I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance. We simulated two current injection scenarios: distal apical 4 Hz modulation and perisomatic 4 Hz modulation, each with perisomatic, mid-apical, and distal apical 40 Hz injections. We used two metrics to quantify CFC strength—modulation index and height ratio—and we analyzed CFC phase properties. For all models, CFC was strongest in distal apical regions when the 40 Hz injection occurred near the soma and the 4 Hz modulation occurred in distal apical dendrite. The strongest CFC values were observed in the model with uniformly distributed I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance density, but when the exponential gradient in I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance density was added, CFC strength decreased by almost 50%. When I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; was in the model, regions with much larger membrane potential fluctuations at 4 Hz than at 40 Hz had stronger CFC. Excluding the I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance from the model resulted in CFC either reduced or comparable in strength relative to the model with the exponential gradient in I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance. The I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance also imposed order on the phase characteristics of CFC such that minimum (maximum) amplitude 40 Hz membrane potential oscillations occurred during I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance deactivation (activation). On the other hand, when there was no I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance, phase relationships between minimum and maximum 40 Hz oscillation often inverted and occurred much closer together. This analysis can help experimentalists discriminate between CFC that originates from different underlying physiological mechanisms and can help illuminate the reasons why there are differences between CFC strength observed in different regions of the brain and between different populations of neurons based on the configuration of the I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; conductance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Kinematic Changes in a Mouse Model of Penetrating Hippocampal Injury and Their Recovery After Intranasal Administration of Endometrial Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Locomotion speed changes appear following hippocampal injury. We used a hippocampal penetrating brain injury mouse model to analyze other kinematic changes. We found a significant decrease in locomotion speed in both open-field and tunnel walk tests. We described a new quantitative method that allows us to analyze and compare the displacement curves between mice steps. In the tunnel walk, we marked mice with indelible ink on the knee, ankle, and metatarsus of the left and right hindlimbs to evaluate both in every step. Animals with hippocampal damage exhibit slower locomotion speed in both hindlimbs. In contrast, in the cortical injured group, we observed significant speed decrease only in the right hindlimb. We found changes in the displacement patterns after hippocampal injury. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles had been used for the treatment of several diseases in animal models. Here, we evaluated the effects of intranasal administration of endometrial mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles on the outcome after the hippocampal injury. We report the presence of vascular endothelial growth factor, granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin 6 in these vesicles. We observed locomotion speed and displacement pattern preservation in mice after vesicle treatment. These mice had lower pyknotic cells percentage and a smaller damaged area in comparison with the nontreated group, probably due to angiogenesis, wound repair, and inflammation decrease. Our results build up on the evidence of the hippocampal role in walk control and suggest that the extracellular vesicles could confer neuroprotection to the damaged hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Comparison of CRISPR/Cas Endonucleases for in vivo Retinal Gene Editing</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;CRISPR/Cas has opened the prospect of direct gene correction therapy for some inherited retinal diseases. Previous work has demonstrated the utility of adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated delivery to retinal cells in vivo; however, with the expanding repertoire of CRISPR/Cas endonucleases, it is not clear which of these are most efficacious for retinal editing in vivo. We sought to compare CRISPR/Cas endonuclease activity using both single and dual AAV delivery strategies for gene editing in retinal cells. Plasmids of a dual vector system with SpCas9, SaCas9, Cas12a, CjCas9 and a sgRNA targeting YFP, as well as a single vector system with SaCas9/YFP sgRNA were generated and validated in YFP-expressing HEK293A cell by flow cytometry and the T7E1 assay. Paired CRISPR/Cas endonuclease and its best performing sgRNA was then packaged into an AAV2 capsid derivative, AAV7m8, and injected intravitreally into CMV-Cre:Rosa26-YFP mice. SpCas9 and Cas12a achieved better knockout efficiency than SaCas9 and CjCas9. Moreover, no significant difference in YFP gene editing was found between single and dual CRISPR/SaCas9 vector systems. With a marked reduction of YFP-positive retinal cells, AAV7m8 delivered SpCas9 was found to have the highest knockout efficacy among all investigated endonucleases. We demonstrate that the AAV7m8-mediated delivery of CRISPR/SpCas9 construct achieves the most efficient gene modification in neurosensory retinal cells in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Shifting Developmental Trajectories During Critical Periods of Brain Formation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Critical periods of brain development are epochs of heightened plasticity driven by environmental influence necessary for normal brain function. Recent studies are beginning to shed light on the possibility that timely interventions during critical periods hold potential to reorient abnormal developmental trajectories in animal models of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this review, we re-examine the criteria defining critical periods, highlighting the recently discovered mechanisms of developmental plasticity in health and disease. In addition, we touch upon technological improvements for modeling critical periods in human-derived neural networks in vitro. These scientific advances associated with the use of developmental manipulations in the immature brain of animal models are the basic preclinical systems that will allow the future translatability of timely interventions into clinical applications for neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: PHF-Core Tau as the Potential Initiating Event for Tau Pathology in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00247</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, around 50 million people have dementia. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and one of the major causes of disability and dependency among the elderly worldwide. Clinically, AD is characterized by impaired memory accompanied by other deficiencies in the cognitive domain. Neuritic plaques (NPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are histopathological lesions that define brains with AD. NFTs consist of abundant intracellular paired helical filaments (PHFs) whose main constituent is tau protein. Tau undergoes posttranslational changes including hyperphosphorylation and truncation, both of which favor conformational changes in the protein. The sequential pathological processing of tau is illustrated with the following specific markers: pT231, TG3, AT8, AT100, and Alz50. Two proteolysis sites for tau have been described—truncation at glutamate 391 and at aspartate 421—and which can be demonstrated by reactivity with the antibodies 423 and TauC-3, respectively. In this review, we describe the molecular changes in tau protein as pre-NFTs progress to extracellular NFTs and during which the formation of a minimal nucleus of the filament, as the PHF core, occurs. We also analyzed the PHF core as the initiator of PHFs and tau phosphorylation as a protective neuronal mechanism against the assembly of the PHF core.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Limitations and Promise of Retinal Tissue From Human Pluripotent Stem Cells for Developing Therapies of Blindness</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00179</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00179</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The self-formation of retinal tissue from pluripotent stem cells generated a tremendous promise for developing new therapies of retinal degenerative diseases, which previously seemed unattainable. Together with use of induced pluripotent stem cells or/and CRISPR-based recombineering the retinal organoid technology provided an avenue for developing models of human retinal degenerative diseases “in a dish” for studying the pathology, delineating the mechanisms and also establishing a platform for large-scale drug screening. At the same time, retinal organoids, highly resembling developing human fetal retinal tissue, are viewed as source of multipotential retinal progenitors, young photoreceptors and just the whole retinal tissue, which may be transplanted into the subretinal space with a goal of replacing patient’s degenerated retina with a new retinal “patch.” Both approaches (transplantation and modeling/drug screening) were projected when Yoshiki Sasai demonstrated the feasibility of deriving mammalian retinal tissue from pluripotent stem cells, and generated a lot of excitement. With further work and testing of both approaches in vitro and in vivo, a major implicit limitation has become apparent pretty quickly: the absence of the uniform layer of Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) cells, which is normally present in mammalian retina, surrounds photoreceptor layer and develops and matures first. The RPE layer polarize into apical and basal sides during development and establish microvilli on the apical side, interacting with photoreceptors, nurturing photoreceptor outer segments and participating in the visual cycle by recycling 11-trans retinal (bleached pigment) back to 11-cis retinal. Retinal organoids, however, either do not have RPE layer or carry patches of RPE mostly on one side, thus directly exposing most photoreceptors in the developing organoids to neural medium. Recreation of the critical retinal niche between the apical RPE and photoreceptors, where many retinal disease mechanisms originate, is so far unattainable, imposes clear limitations on both modeling/drug screening and transplantation approaches and is a focus of investigation in many labs. Here we dissect different retinal degenerative diseases and analyze how and where retinal organoid technology can contribute the most to developing therapies even with a current limitation and absence of long and functional outer segments, supported by RPE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Downregulation of TrkC Receptors Increases Dendritic Arborization of Purkinje Cells in the Developing Cerebellum of the Opossum, Monodelphis domestica</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In therian mammals, the cerebellum is one of the late developing structures in the brain. Specifically, the proliferation of cerebellar granule cells occurs after birth, and even in humans, the generation of these cells continues during the first year of life. The main difference between marsupials and eutherians is that the majority of the brain structures in marsupials develop after birth. Herein, we report that in the newborn laboratory opossum (Monodelphis domestica), the cerebellar primordium is distinguishable in Nissl-stained sections. Additionally, bromodeoxyuridine birthdating experiments revealed that the first neurons form the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) and Purkinje cells, and are generated within postnatal days (P) 1 and 5. Three weeks after birth, progenitors of granule cells in the external germinal layer (EGL) proliferate, producing granule cells. These progenitor cells persist for a long time, approximately 5 months. Furthermore, to study the effects of neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC) during cerebellar development, cells were obtained from P3 opossums and cultured for 8 days. We found that TrkC downregulation stimulates dendritic branching of Purkinje neurons, which was surprising. The number of dendritic branches was higher in Purkinje cells transfected with the shRNA TrkC plasmid. However, there was no morphological change in the number of dendritic branches of granule cells transfected with either control or shRNA TrkC plasmids. We suggest that inhibition of TrkC activity enables NT3 binding to the neurotrophic receptor p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; that promotes dendritic arborization of Purkinje cells. This effect of TrkC receptors on dendritic branching is cell type specific, which could be explained by the strong expression of TrkC in Purkinje cells but not in granule cells. The data indicate a new role for TrkC receptors in Monodelphis opossum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Analyses Mutations in GSN, CST3, TTR, and ITM2B Genes in Chinese Patients With Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyloid protein deposition is a common mechanism of hereditary amyloidosis (HA) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Mutations of gelsolin (GSN), cystatin C (CST3), transthyretin (TTR), and integral membrane protein 2B (ITM2B) genes can lead to HA. But the relationship is unclear between these genes and AD. Genes targeted sequencing (GTS), including GSN, CST3, TTR, and ITM2B, was performed in a total of 636 patients with clinical AD and 365 normal controls from China. As a result, according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, two novel likely pathogenic frame-shift mutations (GSN:c.1036delA:p.K346fs and GSN:c.8_35del:p.P3fs) were detected in five patients with AD, whose initial symptom was memory decline, accompanied with psychological and behavioral abnormalities later. Interestingly, the patient with K346fs mutation, presented cerebral β-amyloid protein deposition, had an early onset (48 years) and experienced rapid progression, while the other four patients with P3fs mutation had a late onset [(Mean ± SD): 69.50 ± 5.20 years] and a long course of illness [(Mean ± SD): 9.24 ± 4.86 years]. Besides, we also discovered 17 variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in these four genes. To our knowledge, we are the first to report AD phenotype with GSN mutations in patients with AD in the Chinese cohort. Although mutations in the GSN gene are rare, it may explain a small portion of clinically diagnosed AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>In 2016 Gagliano et al. reported evidence for associative learning in plants (Gagliano et al., 2016). A subsequent attempt to replicate this finding by the present author was not successful (Markel, 2020). Gagliano et al. attribute this lack of replication to differences in the experimental set-ups used in the original work and the replication attempt (Gagliano et al., 2020). Here, based on a comparison of the two set-ups, I argue that these differences are unable to explain the lack of replication in Markel, 2020.</description>

In view of the far-reaching implications of this finding we welcome the attempt made by Markel to replicate our study (Markel, 2020). However, as we discuss here, the protocol employed by Markel was unsuitable for testing for associative learning.</description>

	<description>Properdin stabilizes the alternative C3 convertase (C3bBb), whereas its role as pattern recognition molecule mediating complement activation is disputed for decades. Previously, we have found that soluble collectin-12 (sCL-12) synergizes complement alternative pathway (AP) activation. However, whether this observation is C3 dependent is unknown. By application of the C3-inhibitor Cp40, we found that properdin in normal human serum bound to Aspergillus fumigatus solely in a C3b dependent manner. Cp40 also prevented properdin binding when properdin-depleted serum reconstituted with purified properdin was applied, in analogy with the findings achieved by C3- depleted serum. However, when opsonized with sCL-12, properdin bound in a C3-independent manner exclusively via its tetrameric structure and directed in situ C3bBb assembly. In conclusion, a prerequisite for properdin binding and in situ C3bBb assembly was the initial docking of sCL-12. This implies a new important function of properdin in host defence bridging pattern recognition and specific AP activation.</description>

	<title>eLife: Vascular dimorphism ensured by regulated proteoglycan dynamics favors rapid umbilical artery closure at birth</title>

	<description>The umbilical artery lumen closes rapidly at birth, preventing neonatal blood loss, whereas the umbilical vein remains patent longer. Here, analysis of umbilical cords from humans and other mammals identified differential arterial-venous proteoglycan dynamics as a determinant of these contrasting vascular responses. The umbilical artery, but not the vein, has an inner layer enriched in the hydrated proteoglycan aggrecan, external to which lie contraction-primed smooth muscle cells (SMC). At birth, SMC contraction drives inner layer buckling and centripetal displacement to occlude the arterial lumen, a mechanism revealed by biomechanical observations and confirmed by computational analyses. This vascular dimorphism arises from spatially regulated proteoglycan expression and breakdown. Mice lacking aggrecan or the metalloprotease ADAMTS1, which degrades proteoglycans, demonstrate their opposing roles in umbilical vascular dimorphism, including effects on SMC differentiation. Umbilical vessel dimorphism is conserved in mammals, suggesting that differential proteoglycan dynamics and inner layer buckling were positively selected during evolution.</description>

	<title>eLife: SOX11 promotes epithelial/mesenchymal hybrid state and alters tropism of invasive breast cancer cells</title>

	<description>SOX11 is an embryonic mammary epithelial marker that is normally silenced prior to birth. High &lt;i&gt;SOX11&lt;/i&gt; levels in breast tumours are significantly associated with distant metastasis and poor outcome in breast cancer patients. Here, we show that SOX11 confers distinct features to ER-negative DCIS.com breast cancer cells, leading to populations enriched with highly plastic hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal cells, which display invasive features and alterations in metastatic tropism when xenografted into mice. We found that SOX11+DCIS tumour cells metastasize to brain and bone at greater frequency and to lungs at lower frequency compared to cells with lower SOX11 levels. High levels of SOX11 leads to the expression of markers associated with mesenchymal state and embryonic cellular phenotypes. Our results suggest that SOX11 may be a potential biomarker for breast tumours with elevated risk of developing metastases and may require more aggressive therapies.</description>

	<description>Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects over half the world's population, is a leading cause of congenital birth defects, and poses serious risks for immuno-compromised individuals. To expand the molecular knowledge governing virion maturation, we analysed HCMV virions using proteomics, and identified a significant proportion of host exosome constituents. To validate this acquisition, we characterized exosomes released from uninfected cells, and demonstrated that over 99% of the protein cargo was subsequently incorporated into HCMV virions during infection. This suggested a common membrane origin, and utilization of host exosome machinery for virion assembly and egress. Thus, we selected a panel of exosome proteins for knock down, and confirmed that loss of 7/9 caused significantly less HCMV production. Saliently, we report that VAMP3 is essential for viral trafficking and release of infectious progeny, in various HCMV strains and cell types. Therefore, we establish that the host exosome pathway is intrinsic for HCMV maturation, and reveal new host regulators involved in viral trafficking, virion envelopment, and release. Our findings underpin future investigation of host exosome proteins as important modulators of HCMV replication with antiviral potential.</description>

	<title>eLife: Atg1 kinase in fission yeast is activated by Atg11-mediated dimerization and cis-autophosphorylation</title>

	<description>Autophagy is a proteolytic pathway conserved from yeasts to mammals. Atg1 kinase is essential for autophagy but how its activity is controlled remains insufficiently understood. Here, we show that, in the fission yeast &lt;i&gt;Schizosaccharomyces pombe,&lt;/i&gt; Atg1 kinase activity requires Atg11, the ortholog of mammalian FIP200/RB1CC1, but does not require Atg13, Atg17, or Atg101. Remarkably, a 62-amino-acid region of Atg11 is sufficient for the autophagy function of Atg11 and for supporting the Atg1 kinase activity. This region harbors an Atg1-binding domain and a homodimerization domain. Dimerizing Atg1 is the main role of Atg11, as it can be bypassed by artificially dimerizing Atg1. In an Atg1 dimer, only one Atg1 molecule needs to be catalytically active, suggesting that Atg1 activation can be achieved through cis-autophosphorylation. We propose that mediating Atg1 oligomerization and activation may be a conserved function of Atg11/FIP200 family proteins and cis-autophosphorylation may be a general mechanism of Atg1 activation.</description>

	<description>Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) checkpoint immunotherapy efficacy remains unpredictable in glioblastoma (GBM) patients due to the genetic heterogeneity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments. Here, we report a microfluidics-based, patient-specific ‘GBM-on-a-Chip’ microphysiological system to dissect the heterogeneity of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments and optimize anti-PD-1 immunotherapy for different GBM subtypes. Our clinical and experimental analyses demonstrated that molecularly distinct GBM subtypes have distinct epigenetic and immune signatures that may lead to different immunosuppressive mechanisms. The real-time analysis in GBM-on-a-Chip showed that mesenchymal GBM niche attracted low number of allogeneic CD154+CD8+ T-cells but abundant CD163+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and expressed elevated PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoints and TGF-β1, IL-10, and CSF-1 cytokines compared to proneural GBM. To enhance PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab efficacy, we co-administered a CSF-1R inhibitor BLZ945 to ablate CD163+ M2-TAMs and strengthened CD154+CD8+ T-cell functionality and GBM apoptosis on-chip. Our ex vivo patient-specific GBM-on-a-Chip provides an avenue for a personalized screening of immunotherapies for GBM patients.</description>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can map cell types, states and transitions during dynamic biological processes such as tissue development and regeneration. Many trajectory inference methods have been developed to order cells by their progression through a dynamic process. However, when time series data is available, most of these methods do not consider the available time information when ordering cells and are instead designed to work only on a single scRNA-seq data snapshot. We present Tempora, a novel cell trajectory inference method that orders cells using time information from time-series scRNA-seq data. In performance comparison tests, Tempora inferred known developmental lineages from three diverse tissue development time series data sets, beating state of the art methods in accuracy and speed. Tempora works at the level of cell clusters (types) and uses biological pathway information to help identify cell type relationships. This approach increases gene expression signal from single cells, processing speed, and interpretability of the inferred trajectory. Our results demonstrate the utility of a combination of time and pathway information to supervise trajectory inference for scRNA-seq based analysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GfF2CqpX5cA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Learning and generalization in spatial domains is often thought to rely on a “cognitive map”, representing relationships between spatial locations. Recent research suggests that this same neural machinery is also recruited for reasoning about more abstract, conceptual forms of knowledge. Yet, to what extent do spatial and conceptual reasoning share common computational principles, and what are the implications for behavior? Using a within-subject design we studied how participants used spatial or conceptual distances to generalize and search for correlated rewards in successive multi-armed bandit tasks. Participant behavior indicated sensitivity to both spatial and conceptual distance, and was best captured using a Bayesian model of generalization that formalized distance-dependent generalization and uncertainty-guided exploration as a Gaussian Process regression with a radial basis function kernel. The same Gaussian Process model best captured human search decisions and judgments in both domains, and could simulate realistic learning curves, where we found equivalent levels of generalization in spatial and conceptual tasks. At the same time, we also find characteristic differences between domains. Relative to the spatial domain, participants showed reduced levels of uncertainty-directed exploration and increased levels of random exploration in the conceptual domain. Participants also displayed a one-directional transfer effect, where experience in the spatial task boosted performance in the conceptual task, but not vice versa. While confidence judgments indicated that participants were sensitive to the uncertainty of their knowledge in both tasks, they did not or could not leverage their estimates of uncertainty to guide exploration in the conceptual task. These results support the notion that value-guided learning and generalization recruit cognitive-map dependent computational mechanisms in spatial and conceptual domains. Yet both behavioral and model-based analyses suggest domain specific differences in how these representations map onto actions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6jq1i9COfCE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In multiple sclerosis (MS), a subset of chronic active white matter lesions are identifiable on magnetic resonance imaging by their paramagnetic rims, and increasing evidence supports their association with severity of clinical disease. We studied their potential role in differential diagnosis, screening an international multicenter clinical research‐based sample of 438 individuals affected by different neurological conditions (MS, other inflammatory, infectious, and non‐inflammatory conditions). Paramagnetic rim lesions, rare in other neurological conditions (52% of MS vs 7% of non‐MS cases), yielded high specificity (93%) in differentiating MS from non‐MS. Future prospective multicenter studies should validate their role as a diagnostic biomarker. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Postnatal development of the SMI‐32 labeling in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) of kittens aged 0‐123 postnatal days, and in adults (Ad). Left – a representational examples of the SMI‐32 labeling, in kittens aged 0 days, 10 days, and in adult. Right – a number of SMI‐32 immunopositive (SMI‐32(+)) neurons in layers A, A1, and Cm of the LGNd. Different phases of the postnatal development (eyes opening, precritical period, critical period maximum) are marked by colors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accumulation of the heavy‐chain neurofilaments reflects the maturation status of neuronal structures. The spatial distribution and postnatal developmental dynamic of neurons expressing non‐phosphorylated heavy‐chain neurofilaments (labeled by SMI‐32 antibody) were analysed in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) of the cat. Both interlaminar and intralaminar differences in the dynamic of SMI‐32 staining were observed. The following results were obtained: (1) Ascending dorsoventral gradient in the density of SMI‐32 immunopositive (SMI‐32(+)) neurons (the greatest neuronal density in layer Cm, the minor in the top sublayer of layer A). This gradient was most prominent at the earliest stages of postnatal development (1st‐2nd weeks) and slowly flattened up to adulthood; (2) Layer A1 exhibits increases in SMI‐32‐positive cells earlier than layer A; (3) The general transient increment in the number and density of SMI‐32(+) neurons around 2‐5 postnatal weeks. Since SMI‐32 antibody is considered to be a putative marker for Y cells forming a motion processing stream, we suggest that peculiarities of SMI‐32 staining at geniculate level could reflect the heterogeneity of Y cell subpopulations and the heterochrony of their postnatal maturation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Sex‐specific association between infant caudate volumes and a polygenic risk score for major depressive disorder&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5b1d93b6-1d81-43f9-a833-211890c179e2/jnr24722-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A polygenic risk score for major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with sex‐specific brain structural alterations in the infant bilateral caudate which is crucially implicated in MDD in adults. Our results suggest that sex‐specific polygenic influences on early caudate volume development might contribute to the sexually dimorphic prevalence of MDD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polygenic risk scores for major depressive disorder (PRS‐MDD) have been identified in large genome‐wide association studies, and recent findings suggest that PRS‐MDD might interact with environmental risk factors to shape human limbic brain development as early as in the prenatal period. Striatal structures are crucially involved in depression; however, the association of PRS‐MDD with infant striatal volumes is yet unknown. In this study, 105 Finnish mother–infant dyads (44 female, 11–54 days old) were investigated to reveal how infant PRS‐MDD is associated with infant dorsal striatal volumes (caudate, putamen) and whether PRS‐MDD interacts with prenatal maternal depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, gestational weeks 14, 24, 34) on infant striatal volumes. A robust sex‐specific main effect of PRS‐MDD on bilateral infant caudate volumes was observed. PRS‐MDD were more positively associated with caudate volumes in boys compared to girls. No significant interaction effects of genotype PRS‐MDD with the environmental risk factor “prenatal maternal depressive symptoms” (genotype‐by‐environment interaction) nor significant interaction effects of genotype with prenatal maternal depressive symptoms and sex (genotype‐by‐environment‐by‐sex interaction) were found for infant dorsal striatal volumes. Our study showed that a higher PRS‐MDD irrespective of prenatal exposure to maternal depressive symptoms is associated with smaller bilateral caudate volumes, an indicator of greater susceptibility to major depressive disorder, in female compared to male infants. This sex‐specific polygenic effect might lay the ground for the higher prevalence of depression in women compared to men.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning at its core, contains functions that are composition of a
linear transformation with a non-linear function known as activation function.
In past few years, there is an increasing interest in construction of novel
activation functions resulting in better learning. In this work, we propose a
family of novel activation functions, namely TanhSoft, with four undetermined
hyper-parameters of the form
tanh({\alpha}x+{\beta}e^{{\gamma}x})ln({\delta}+e^x) and tune these
hyper-parameters to obtain activation functions which are shown to outperform
several well known activation functions. For instance, replacing ReLU with
xtanh(0.6e^x)improves top-1 classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 by 0.46% for
DenseNet-169 and 0.7% for Inception-v3 while with tanh(0.87x)ln(1 +e^x) top-1
classification accuracy on CIFAR-100 improves by 1.24% for DenseNet-169 and
2.57% for SimpleNet model.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain performs many nonlinear computations through intricate spiking
neural networks (SNNs). How neural network dynamics relate to arbitrary
computations under these constraints is still an open question. As a strong
constraint, these networks are hypothesized to be robust to perturbations and
use minimal energy. The theory of Spike Coding Networks (SCNs) derives the
required connectivity and dynamics for both information representation and
linear dynamical systems from first principles, and achieves robustness and
efficiency. Nonlinear dynamical systems have thus far only been implemented in
SCNs by filtering neural inputs through sets of nonlinear dendritic basis
functions. While this approach works well, it relies on providing a rich enough
basis set as well as supervised training of the connectivity weights. Another
way to implement nonlinear computations is through multiplicatively interacting
synapses. However, there is currently no principled way to implement such
synapses in SCNs. Here, we extend the core SCN derivations to implement
polynomial dynamical systems, from which also the need for such
multiplicatively interacting synapses arises. We demonstrate our approach with
a highly accurate Lorenz attractor implementation, as well as a second-order
approximation of a double pendulum. We additionally demonstrate how to
implement higher-order polynomials using sequential networks with only
pair-wise synapses. Finally, we derive upper bounds and expected numbers of
connections based on the sparsity of the underlying representation. Overall,
our work provides an alternative way to directly implement nonlinear
computations in spike coding networks, and expands our understanding about the
potential functions of multiplicative synapses. Furthermore, due to the high
accuracy and low energy usage of our approach, this work may be of interest for
neuromorphic computing.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Few-shot classification is a challenge in machine learning where the goal is
to train a classifier using a very limited number of labeled examples. This
scenario is likely to occur frequently in real life, for example when data
acquisition or labeling is expensive. In this work, we consider the problem of
post-labeled few-shot unsupervised learning, a classification task where
representations are learned in an unsupervised fashion, to be later labeled
using very few annotated examples. We argue that this problem is very likely to
occur on the edge, when the embedded device directly acquires the data, and the
expert needed to perform labeling cannot be prompted often. To address this
problem, we consider an algorithm consisting of the concatenation of transfer
learning with clustering using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). We introduce a
TensorFlow-based implementation to speed-up the process in multi-core CPUs and
GPUs. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using standard
off-the-shelf few-shot classification benchmarks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep active inference has been proposed as a scalable approach to perception
and action that deals with large policy and state spaces. However, current
models are limited to fully observable domains. In this paper, we describe a
deep active inference model that can learn successful policies directly from
high-dimensional sensory inputs. The deep learning architecture optimizes a
variant of the expected free energy and encodes the continuous state
representation by means of a variational autoencoder. We show, in the OpenAI
benchmark, that our approach has comparable or better performance than deep
Q-learning, a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning via Cooperative Coevolutionary Negatively Correlated Search. (arXiv:2009.03603v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been successfully applied to optimize the
policies for Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks due to their exploration
ability. The recently proposed Negatively Correlated Search (NCS) provides a
distinct parallel exploration search behavior and is expected to facilitate RL
more effectively. Considering that the commonly adopted neural policies usually
involves millions of parameters to be optimized, the direct application of NCS
to RL may face a great challenge of the large-scale search space. To address
this issue, this paper presents an NCS-friendly Cooperative Coevolution (CC)
framework to scale-up NCS while largely preserving its parallel exploration
search behavior. The issue of traditional CC that can deteriorate NCS is also
discussed. Empirical studies on 10 popular Atari games show that the proposed
method can significantly outperform three state-of-the-art deep RL methods with
50% less computational time by effectively exploring a 1.7 million-dimensional
search space.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic computing has recently emerged as a disruptive computational
paradigm that attempts to emulate various facets of the underlying structure
and functionalities of the brain in the algorithm and hardware design of
next-generation machine learning platforms. This work goes beyond the focus of
current neuromorphic computing architectures on computational models for neuron
and synapse to examine other computational units of the biological brain that
might contribute to cognition and especially self-repair. We draw inspiration
and insights from computational neuroscience regarding functionalities of glial
cells and explore their role in the fault-tolerant capacity of Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs) trained in an unsupervised fashion using Spike-Timing Dependent
Plasticity (STDP). We characterize the degree of self-repair that can be
enabled in such networks with varying degree of faults ranging from 50% - 90%
and evaluate our proposal on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Capturing Multiple Timescales of Adaptation to Second-Order Statistics With Generalized Linear Models: Gain Scaling and Fractional Differentiation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00060</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00060</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Single neurons can dynamically change the gain of their spiking responses to take into account shifts in stimulus variance. Moreover, gain adaptation can occur across multiple timescales. Here, we examine the ability of a simple statistical model of spike trains, the generalized linear model (GLM), to account for these adaptive effects. The GLM describes spiking as a Poisson process whose rate depends on a linear combination of the stimulus and recent spike history. The GLM successfully replicates gain scaling observed in Hodgkin-Huxley simulations of cortical neurons that occurs when the ratio of spike-generating potassium and sodium conductances approaches one. Gain scaling in the GLM depends on the length and shape of the spike history filter. Additionally, the GLM captures adaptation that occurs over multiple timescales as a fractional derivative of the stimulus envelope, which has been observed in neurons that include long timescale afterhyperpolarization conductances. Fractional differentiation in GLMs requires long spike history that span several seconds. Together, these results demonstrate that the GLM provides a tractable statistical approach for examining single-neuron adaptive computations in response to changes in stimulus variance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Inter- and Intra-subject Template-Based Multivariate Synchronization Index Using an Adaptive Threshold for SSVEP-Based BCIs</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00717</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00717</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) has been widely used in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Many studies have proved that the Multivariate synchronization index (MSI) is an efficient method for recognizing the frequency components in SSVEP-based BCIs. Despite its success, the recognition accuracy has not been satisfactory because the simplified pre-constructed sine-cosine waves lack abundant features from the real electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Recent advances in addressing this issue have achieved a significant improvement in recognition accuracy by using individual calibration data. In this study, a new extension based on inter- and intra-subject template signals is introduced to improve the performance of the standard MSI method. Through template transfer, inter-subject similarity and variability are employed to enhance the robustness of SSVEP recognition. Additionally, most existed methods for SSVEP recognition utilize a fixed time window (TW) to perform frequency domain analysis, which limits the information transfer rate (ITR) of BCIs. For addressing this problem, a novel adaptive threshold strategy is integrated into the extension of MSI, which uses a dynamic window to extract the temporal features of SSVEPs and recognizes the stimulus frequency based on a pre-set threshold. The pre-set threshold contributes to obtaining an appropriate and shorter signal length for frequency recognition and filtering ignored-invalid trials. The proposed method is evaluated on a 12-class SSVEP dataset recorded from 10 subjects, and the result shows that this achieves higher recognition accuracy and information transfer rate when compared with the CCA, MSI, Multi-set CCA, and Individual Template-based CCA. This paper demonstrates that the proposed method is a promising approach for developing high-speed BCIs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Influence of Multiple Cardiovascular Risk Factors on Task-Switching in Older Adults: An fMRI Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.561877</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.561877</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Not only are the effects of cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure and low fitness on executive functions and brain activations in older adults scarcely investigated, no fMRI study has investigated the combined effects of multiple risk factors on brain activations in older adults. This fMRI study examined the independent and combined effects of two cardiovascular risk factors, arterial plasticity, and physical fitness, on brain activations during task-switching in older adults. The effects of these two risk factors on age-related differences in activation between older and younger adults were also examined. Independently, low physical fitness and low arterial plasticity were related to reduced suppressions of occipital brain regions. The combined effects of these two risks on occipital regions were greater than the independent effects of either risk factor. Age-related overactivations in frontal cortex were observed in low fitness older adults. Brain-behavior correlation indicates that these frontal overactivations are maladaptive to older adults’ task performance. It is possible that the resulting effects of cardiovascular risks on the aging brain, especially the maladaptive overactivations of frontal brain regions by high risk older adults, contribute to often found posterior-anterior shift in aging (PASA) brain activations. Furthermore, observed age-related differences in brain activations during task-switching can be partially attributed to individual differences in cardiovascular risks among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Influence of the Stimulus Design on the Harmonic Components of the Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00343</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00343</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) are commonly used for functional objective diagnostics. In general, the main response at the stimulation frequency is used. However, some studies reported the main response at the second harmonic of the stimulation frequency. The aim of our study was to analyze the influence of the stimulus design on the harmonic components of ssVEPs. We studied 22 subjects (8 males, mean age ± SD = 27 ± 4.8 years) using a circular layout (r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0–1.6°, r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.6–3.5°, r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.5–6.4°, r&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.4–10.9°, and r&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 10.9–18°). At a given eccentricity, the stimulus was presented according to a 7.5 Hz square wave with 50% duty cycle. To analyze the influence of the stimulus eccentricity, a background luminance of 30 cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; was added to suppress foveal stray light effects; to analyze the influence of simultaneous foveal and peripheral stimulations, stimulations are performed without stray light suppression. For statistical analysis, medians M of the amplitude ratios for amplitudes at the second harmonic to the first harmonic and the probability of the occurrence of the main response at the second harmonic P(MCSH) are calculated. For stimulations with foveal stray light suppression, the medians were M&lt;sub&gt;0 –1.6^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.45, M&lt;sub&gt;1.6 –3.5^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.45, M&lt;sub&gt;3.5 –6.4^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.76, M&lt;sub&gt;6.4 –10.9^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.72, and M&lt;sub&gt;10.9 –18^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.48, and the probabilities were P&lt;sub&gt;0–1.6^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.05, P&lt;sub&gt;1.6 –3.5^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.05, P&lt;sub&gt;3.5 –6.4^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.32, P&lt;sub&gt;6.4 –10.9^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.29, and P&lt;sub&gt;10.9 –18^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.30. For stimulations without foveal stray light suppression, the medians M were M&lt;sub&gt;0 –1.6^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.29, M&lt;sub&gt;1.6 –3.5^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.37, M&lt;sub&gt;3.5 –6.4^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.98, M&lt;sub&gt;6.4 –10.9 ^^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.08, and M&lt;sub&gt;10.9 –18^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.24, and the probabilities were P&lt;sub&gt;0–1.6^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.09, P&lt;sub&gt;1.6 –3.5^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.05, P&lt;sub&gt;3.5 –6.4^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.50, P&lt;sub&gt;6.4 –10.9^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.55, and P&lt;sub&gt;10.9 –18^ ∘&lt;/sub&gt;(MCSH) = 0.55. In conclusion, the stimulus design has an influence on the harmonic components of ssVEPs. An increase in stimulation eccentricity during extrafoveal stimulation leads to a transition of the main response to the second harmonic. The effect is enhanced by a simultaneous foveal stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: A Generalized Linear Model of a Navigation Network</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00056</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00056</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Navigation by mammals is believed to rely on a network of neurons in the hippocampal formation, which includes the hippocampus, the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), and additional nearby regions. Neurons in these regions represent spatial information by tuning to the position, orientation, and speed of the animal in the form of head direction cells, speed cells, grid cells, border cells, and unclassified spatially modulated cells. While the properties of single cells are well studied, little is known about the functional structure of the network in the MEC. Here, we use a generalized linear model to study the network of spatially modulated cells in the MEC. We found connectivity patterns between all spatially encoding cells and not only grid cells. In addition, the neurons’ past activity contributed to the overall activity patterns. Finally, position-modulated cells and head direction cells differed in the dependence of the activity on the history. Our results indicate that MEC neurons form a local interacting network to support spatial information representations and suggest an explanation for their complex temporal properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Chewing Efficiency, Global Cognitive Functioning, and Dentition: A Cross-sectional Observational Study in Older People With Mild Cognitive Impairment or Mild to Moderate Dementia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00225</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00225</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Previous studies suggest an association between poor mastication and cognitive impairment. The role of chewing efficiency and dentition in this relation is unclear. The aim was to examine global cognitive functioning and dentition as predictors for chewing efficiency, in older people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In this observational cross-sectional study, 136 people with MCI or dementia were included. The chewing efficiency was assessed with a two-colored chewing gum and analyzed with the Chewing Efficiency Analysis software. The level of global cognitive functioning was measured with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) by trained clinical staff. An oral examination was performed by a dentist and included the number of present teeth, the number of occluding pairs, and the presence of prostheses. Age, gender, and educational years were derived from the medical records. Univariate and multivariate backward stepwise linear regression analyses were used to evaluate global cognitive functioning and dentition as predictors for chewing efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The mean age of the participants was 82.1 (SD 5.8) years, and 74 (54.4%) were female. The participants had a median MMSE score of 22.4 (IQR 18.0–26.0) and a median Chewing Efficiency Analysis score of 0.46 (IQR 0.14–0.59). The median number of teeth was 13.0 (IQR 0.0–23.0), and the median number of occluding pairs was 0.0 (IQR 0.0–7.0). Sixty-four (47.4%) of the participants wore full prosthesis in the upper jaw. In univariate linear regression analyses, predictive factors for the Chewing Efficiency Analysis score were age, MMSE score, full prosthesis in the upper jaw, number of present teeth, and number of occluding pairs. In the multivariate model, full prosthesis in the upper jaw and number of occluding pairs were significant predictors for the Chewing Efficiency Analysis score. Participants with full prosthesis in the upper jaw had a lower Chewing Efficiency Analysis score than participants with natural dentition in the upper jaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Better mastication is associated with a higher number of occluding pairs. Full prosthesis in the upper jaw is related to a lower chewing efficiency. Global cognitive functioning is not associated with mastication in older people with MCI or mild-to-moderate dementia. This might be explained by sufficient capacity for compensation of reduced mastication in this group.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Histone deposition pathways determine the chromatin landscapes of H3.1 and H3.3 K27M oncohistones</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.61090</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61090</link>
	<description>Lysine 27-to-methionine (K27M) mutations in the H3.1 or H3.3 histone genes are characteristic of pediatric diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs). These oncohistone mutations dominantly inhibit histone H3K27 trimethylation and silencing, but it is unknown how oncohistone type affects gliomagenesis. We show that the genomic distributions of H3.1 and H3.3 oncohistones in human patient-derived DMG cells are consistent with the DNA replication-coupled deposition of histone H3.1 and the predominant replication-independent deposition of histone H3.3. Although H3K27 trimethylation is reduced for both oncohistone types, H3.3K27M-bearing cells retain some domains, and only H3.1K27M-bearing cells lack H3K27 trimethylation. Neither oncohistone interferes with PRC2 binding. Using Drosophila as a model, we demonstrate that inhibition of H3K27 trimethylation occurs only when H3K27M oncohistones are deposited into chromatin and only when expressed in cycling cells. We propose that oncohistones inhibit the H3K27 methyltransferase as chromatin patterns are being duplicated in proliferating cells, predisposing them to tumorigenesis.</description>

	<description>Ion channel complexes promote action potential initiation at the mammalian axon initial segment (AIS), and modulation of AIS size by recruitment or loss of proteins can influence neuron excitability. Although endocytosis contributes to AIS turnover, how membrane proteins traffic to this proximal axonal domain is incompletely understood. Neurofascin186 (Nfasc186) has an essential role in stabilising the AIS complex to the proximal axon, and the AIS channel protein Kv7.3 regulates neuron excitability. Therefore, we have studied how these proteins reach the AIS. Vesicles transport Nfasc186 to the soma and axon terminal where they fuse with the neuronal plasma membrane. Nfasc186 is highly mobile after insertion in the axonal membrane and diffuses bidirectionally until immobilized at the AIS through its interaction with AnkyrinG. Kv7.3 is similarly recruited to the AIS. This study reveals how key proteins are delivered to the AIS and thereby how they may contribute to its functional plasticity.</description>

	<title>eLife: Nonlinearities between inhibition and T-type calcium channel activity bidirectionally regulate thalamic oscillations</title>

	<description>Absence seizures result from 3-5 Hz generalized thalamocortical oscillations that depend on highly regulated inhibitory neurotransmission in the thalamus. Efficient reuptake of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA is essential, and reuptake failure worsens human seizures. Here, we show that blocking GABA transporters (GATs) in acute rat brain slices containing key parts of the thalamocortical seizure network modulates epileptiform activity. As expected, we found that blocking either GAT1 or GAT3 prolonged oscillations. However, blocking both GATs unexpectedly suppressed oscillations. Integrating experimental observations into single-neuron and network-level computational models shows how a non-linear dependence of T-type calcium channel gating on GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activity regulates network oscillations. Receptor activity that is either too brief or too protracted fails to sufficiently open T-type channels necessary for sustaining oscillations. Only within a narrow range does prolonging GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activity promote channel opening and intensify oscillations. These results have implications for therapeutics that modulate inhibition kinetics.</description>

	<title>eLife: Minimally dependent activity subspaces for working memory and motor preparation in the lateral prefrontal cortex</title>

	<description>The lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in the integration of multiple types of information, including working memory and motor preparation. However, it is not known how downstream regions can extract one type of information without interference from the others present in the network. Here, we show that the lateral prefrontal cortex of non-human primates contains two minimally dependent low-dimensional subspaces: one that encodes working memory information, and another that encodes motor preparation information. These subspaces capture all the information about the target in the delay periods, and the information in both subspaces is reduced in error trials. A single population of neurons with mixed selectivity forms both subspaces, but the information is kept largely independent from each other. A bump attractor model with divisive normalization replicates the properties of the neural data. These results provide new insights into neural processing in prefrontal regions.</description>

	<title>eLife: Breakage of the oligomeric CaMKII hub by the regulatory segment of the kinase</title>

	<description>Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is an oligomeric enzyme with crucial roles in neuronal signaling and cardiac function. Previously, we showed that activation of CaMKII triggers the exchange of subunits between holoenzymes, potentially increasing the spread of the active state (Stratton et al. 2014; Bhattacharyya et al. 2016). Using mass spectrometry, we show now that unphosphorylated and phosphorylated peptides derived from the CaMKII-α regulatory segment bind to the CaMKII-α hub and break it into smaller oligomers. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the regulatory segments dock spontaneously at the interface between hub subunits, trapping large fluctuations in hub structure. Single-molecule fluorescence intensity analysis of CaMKII-α expressed in mammalian cells shows that activation of CaMKII-α results in the destabilization of the holoenzyme. Our results suggest that release of the regulatory segment by activation and phosphorylation allows it to destabilize the hub, producing smaller assemblies that might reassemble to form new holoenzymes.</description>

	<title>eLife: Natural variation in autumn expression is the major adaptive determinant distinguishing Arabidopsis FLC haplotypes</title>

	<description>In &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana,&lt;/i&gt; winter is registered during vernalization through the temperature-dependent repression and epigenetic silencing of floral repressor &lt;i&gt;FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC)&lt;/i&gt;. Natural Arabidopsis accessions show considerable variation in vernalization. However, which aspect of the &lt;i&gt;FLC &lt;/i&gt;repression mechanism is most important for adaptation to different environments is unclear. By analyzing &lt;i&gt;FLC&lt;/i&gt; dynamics in natural variants and mutants throughout winter in three field sites, we find that autumnal &lt;i&gt;FLC &lt;/i&gt;expression, rather than epigenetic silencing, is the major variable conferred by the distinct Arabidopsis &lt;i&gt;FLC&lt;/i&gt; haplotypes. This variation influences flowering responses of Arabidopsis accessions resulting in an interplay between promotion and delay of flowering in different climates to balance survival and, through a post-vernalization effect, reproductive output. These data reveal how expression variation through non-coding cis variation at &lt;i&gt;FLC&lt;/i&gt; has enabled Arabidopsis accessions to adapt to different climatic conditions and year-on-year fluctuations.</description>

	<title>eLife: Genetic variation in the social environment affects behavioral phenotypes of oxytocin receptor mutants in zebrafish</title>

	<description>Oxytocin-like peptides have been implicated in the regulation of a wide range of social behaviors across taxa. On the other hand, the social environment, which is composed of conspecifics that may vary in their genotypes, also influences social behavior, creating the possibility for indirect genetic effects. Here, we used a zebrafish oxytocin receptor knockout line to investigate how the genotypic composition of the social environment (G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) interacts with the oxytocin genotype of the focal individual (G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) in the regulation of its social behavior. For this purpose, we have raised wild-type or knock-out zebrafish in either wild-type or knock-out shoals and tested different components of social behavior in adults. G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;xG&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; effects were detected in some behaviors, highlighting the need to control for G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;xG&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; effects when interpreting results of experiments using genetically modified animals, since the genotypic composition of the social environment can either rescue or promote phenotypes associated with specific genes.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56276</link>
	<description>New species arise as the genomes of populations diverge. The developmental ‘alarm clock’ of speciation sounds off when sufficient divergence in genetic control of development leads hybrid individuals to infertility or inviability, the world awoken to the dawn of new species with intrinsic post-zygotic reproductive isolation. Some developmental stages will be more prone to hybrid dysfunction due to how molecular evolution interacts with the ontogenetic timing of gene expression. Considering the ontogeny of hybrid incompatibilities provides a profitable connection between ‘evo-devo’ and speciation genetics to better link macroevolutionary pattern, microevolutionary process, and molecular mechanisms. Here, we explore speciation alongside development, emphasizing their mutual dependence on genetic network features, fitness landscapes, and developmental system drift. We assess models for how ontogenetic timing of reproductive isolation can be predictable. Experiments and theory within this synthetic perspective can help identify new rules of speciation as well as rules in the molecular evolution of development.</description>

	<title>eLife: CB1 receptor-mediated inhibitory LTD triggers presynaptic remodeling via protein synthesis and ubiquitination</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54812</link>
	<description>Long-lasting forms of postsynaptic plasticity commonly involve protein synthesis-dependent structural changes of dendritic spines. However, the relationship between protein synthesis and presynaptic structural plasticity remains unclear. Here, we investigated structural changes in cannabinoid-receptor 1 (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)-mediated long-term depression of inhibitory transmission (iLTD), a form of presynaptic plasticity that involves a protein synthesis-dependent long-lasting reduction in GABA release. We found that CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-iLTD in acute rat hippocampal slices was associated with protein synthesis-dependent presynaptic structural changes. Using proteomics, we determined that CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; activation in hippocampal neurons resulted in increased ribosomal proteins and initiation factors, but decreased levels of proteins involved in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, such as ARPC2 and WASF1/WAVE1, and presynaptic release. Moreover, while CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-iLTD increased ubiquitin/proteasome activity, ubiquitination but not proteasomal degradation was critical for structural and functional presynaptic CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-iLTD. Thus, CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-iLTD relies on both protein synthesis and ubiquitination to elicit structural changes that underlie long-term reduction of GABA release.</description>

	<description>Understanding the genetic regulation of organ structure is a fundamental problem in developmental biology. Here, we use egg-producing structures of insect ovaries, called ovarioles, to deduce systems-level gene regulatory relationships from quantitative functional genetic analysis. We previously showed that Hippo signalling, a conserved regulator of animal organ size, regulates ovariole number in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. To comprehensively determine how Hippo signalling interacts with other pathways in this regulation, we screened all known signalling pathway genes, and identified Hpo-dependent and Hpo-independent signalling requirements. Network analysis of known protein-protein interactions among screen results identified independent gene regulatory sub-networks regulating one or both of ovariole number and egg laying. These sub-networks predict involvement of previously uncharacterised genes with higher accuracy than the original candidate screen. This shows that network analysis combining functional genetic and large-scale interaction data can predict function of novel genes regulating development.</description>

We present VALERIE (Visualising alternative splicing events from single-cell ribonucleic acid-sequencing experiments), an R package for visualising alternative splicing events at single-cell resolution. To explore any given specified genomic region, corresponding to an alternative splicing event, VALERIE generates an ensemble of informative plots to visualise cell-to-cell heterogeneity of alternative splicing profiles across single cells and performs statistical tests to compare percent spliced-in (PSI) values across the user-defined groups of cells. Among the features available, VALERIE displays PSI values, in lieu of read coverage, which is more suitable for representing alternative splicing profiles for a large number of samples typically generated by single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments. VALERIE is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/VALERIE/index.html.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pAUzcfXxr9I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Detection and segmentation of macrophage cells in fluorescence microscopy images is a challenging problem, mainly due to crowded cells, variation in shapes, and morphological complexity. We present a new deep learning approach for cell detection and segmentation that incorporates previously learned nucleus features. A novel fusion of feature pyramids for nucleus detection and segmentation with feature pyramids for cell detection and segmentation is used to improve performance on a microscopic image dataset created by us and provided for public use, containing both nucleus and cell signals. Our experimental results indicate that cell detection and segmentation performance significantly benefit from the fusion of previously learned nucleus features. The proposed feature pyramid fusion architecture clearly outperforms a state-of-the-art Mask R-CNN approach for cell detection and segmentation with relative mean average precision improvements of up to 23.88% and 23.17%, respectively.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0yEy1ii-hDo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Learning to avoid harmful consequences can be a costly trial-and-error process. In such situations, social information can be leveraged to improve individual learning outcomes. Here, we investigated how participants used their own experiences and others’ social cues to avoid harm. Participants made repeated choices between harmful and safe options, each with different probabilities of generating shocks, while also seeing the image of a social partner. Some partners made predictive gaze cues towards the harmful choice option while others cued an option at random, and did so using neutral or fearful facial expressions. We tested how learned social information about partner reliability transferred across contexts by letting participants encounter the same partner in multiple trial blocks while facing novel choice options. Participants’ decisions were best explained by a reinforcement learning model that independently learned the probabilities of options being safe and of partners being reliable and combined these combined these estimates to generate choices. Advice from partners making a fearful facial expression influenced participants’ decisions more than advice from partners with neutral expressions. Our results showed that participants made better decisions when facing predictive partners and that they cached and transferred partner reliability estimates into new blocks. Using simulations we show that participants’ transfer of social information into novel contexts is better adapted to variable social environments where social partners may change their cuing strategy or become untrustworthy. Finally, we found no relation between autism questionnaire scores and performance in our task, but do find autism trait related differences in learning rate parameters.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wfNEGcxtR64&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Generalized estimating equation modeling on correlated microbiome sequencing data with longitudinal measures</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Bo Chen, Wei Xu&lt;/p&gt;

Existing models for assessing microbiome sequencing such as operational taxonomic units (OTUs) can only test predictors’ effects on OTUs. There is limited work on how to estimate the correlations between multiple OTUs and incorporate such relationship into models to evaluate longitudinal OTU measures. We propose a novel approach to estimate OTU correlations based on their taxonomic structure, and apply such correlation structure in Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) models to estimate both predictors’ effects and OTU correlations. We develop a two-part Microbiome Taxonomic Longitudinal Correlation (MTLC) model for multivariate zero-inflated OTU outcomes based on the GEE framework. In addition, longitudinal and other types of repeated OTU measures are integrated in the MTLC model. Extensive simulations have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the MTLC method. Compared with the existing methods, the MTLC method shows robust and consistent estimation, and improved statistical power for testing predictors’ effects. Lastly we demonstrate our proposed method by implementing it into a real human microbiome study to evaluate the obesity on twins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AiYetAL6ehI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Delay-period activity in frontal, parietal, and occipital cortex tracks noise and biases in visual working memory</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Qing Yu, Matthew F. Panichello, Ying Cai, Bradley R. Postle, Timothy J. Buschman&lt;/p&gt;

Working memory is imprecise, and these imprecisions can be explained by the combined influences of random diffusive error and systematic drift toward a set of stable states (“attractors”). However, the neural correlates of diffusion and drift remain unknown. Here, we investigated how delay-period activity in frontal and parietal cortex, which is known to correlate with the decline in behavioral memory precision observed with increasing memory load, might relate to diffusion and drift. We analyzed data from an existing experiment in which subjects performed delayed recall for line orientation, at different loads, during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. To quantify the influence of drift and diffusion, we modeled subjects’ behavior using a discrete attractor model and calculated within-subject correlation between frontal and parietal delay-period activity and whole-trial estimates of drift and diffusion. We found that although increases in frontal and parietal activity were associated with increases in both diffusion and drift, diffusion explained the most variance in frontal and parietal delay-period activity. In comparison, a subsequent whole-brain regression analysis showed that drift, rather than diffusion, explained the most variance in delay-period activity in lateral occipital cortex. These results are consistent with a model of the differential recruitment of general frontoparietal mechanisms in response to diffusive noise and of stimulus-specific biases in occipital cortex.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/je9VB-_-tso&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Despite limited genomic diversity, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has shown a wide range of clinical manifestations in different patient populations. The mechanisms behind these host differences are still unclear. Here, we examined host response gene expression across infection status, viral load, age, and sex among shotgun RNA sequencing profiles of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 430 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and 54 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 induced a strong antiviral response with up-regulation of antiviral factors such as &lt;i&gt;OAS1-3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;IFIT1-3&lt;/i&gt; and T helper type 1 (Th1) chemokines &lt;i&gt;CXCL9/10/11&lt;/i&gt;, as well as a reduction in transcription of ribosomal proteins. SARS-CoV-2 culture in human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures replicated the in vivo antiviral host response 7 days post infection, with no induction of interferon-stimulated genes after 3 days. Patient-matched longitudinal specimens (mean elapsed time = 6.3 days) demonstrated reduction in interferon-induced transcription, recovery of transcription of ribosomal proteins, and initiation of wound healing and humoral immune responses. Expression of interferon-responsive genes, including &lt;i&gt;ACE2&lt;/i&gt;, increased as a function of viral load, while transcripts for B cell–specific proteins and neutrophil chemokines were elevated in patients with lower viral load. Older individuals had reduced expression of the Th1 chemokines &lt;i&gt;CXCL9/10/11&lt;/i&gt; and their cognate receptor &lt;i&gt;CXCR3&lt;/i&gt;, as well as &lt;i&gt;CD8A&lt;/i&gt; and granzyme B, suggesting deficiencies in trafficking and/or function of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Relative to females, males had reduced B cell–specific and NK cell–specific transcripts and an increase in inhibitors of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling, possibly inappropriately throttling antiviral responses. Collectively, our data demonstrate that host responses to SARS-CoV-2 are dependent on viral load and infection time course, with observed differences due to age and sex that may contribute to disease severity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/H9Tm0EdCyZs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Leiomodin creates a leaky cap at the pointed end of actin-thin filaments</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Dmitri Tolkatchev, Garry E. Smith Jr., Lauren E. Schultz, Mert Colpan, Gregory L. Helms, John R. Cort, Carol C. Gregorio, Alla S. Kostyukova&lt;/p&gt;

Improper lengths of actin-thin filaments are associated with altered contractile activity and lethal myopathies. Leiomodin, a member of the tropomodulin family of proteins, is critical in thin filament assembly and maintenance; however, its role is under dispute. Using nuclear magnetic resonance data and molecular dynamics simulations, we generated the first atomic structural model of the binding interface between the tropomyosin-binding site of cardiac leiomodin and the N-terminus of striated muscle tropomyosin. Our structural data indicate that the leiomodin/tropomyosin complex only forms at the pointed end of thin filaments, where the tropomyosin N-terminus is not blocked by an adjacent tropomyosin protomer. This discovery provides evidence supporting the debated mechanism where leiomodin and tropomodulin regulate thin filament lengths by competing for thin filament binding. Data from experiments performed in cardiomyocytes provide additional support for the competition model; specifically, expression of a leiomodin mutant that is unable to interact with tropomyosin fails to displace tropomodulin at thin filament pointed ends and fails to elongate thin filaments. Together with previous structural and biochemical data, we now propose a molecular mechanism of actin polymerization at the pointed end in the presence of bound leiomodin. In the proposed model, the N-terminal actin-binding site of leiomodin can act as a “swinging gate” allowing limited actin polymerization, thus making leiomodin a leaky pointed-end cap. Results presented in this work answer long-standing questions about the role of leiomodin in thin filament length regulation and maintenance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dMzzfXTBLHU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Selective enhancement of low-gamma activity by tACS improves phonemic processing and reading accuracy in dyslexia</title>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/dE3pBlrvRXY/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Silvia Marchesotti, Johanna Nicolle, Isabelle Merlet, Luc H. Arnal, John P. Donoghue, Anne-Lise Giraud&lt;/p&gt;

The phonological deficit in dyslexia is associated with altered low-gamma oscillatory function in left auditory cortex, but a causal relationship between oscillatory function and phonemic processing has never been established. After confirming a deficit at 30 Hz with electroencephalography (EEG), we applied 20 minutes of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to transiently restore this activity in adults with dyslexia. The intervention significantly improved phonological processing and reading accuracy as measured immediately after tACS. The effect occurred selectively for a 30-Hz stimulation in the dyslexia group. Importantly, we observed that the focal intervention over the left auditory cortex also decreased 30-Hz activity in the right superior temporal cortex, resulting in reinstating a left dominance for the oscillatory response. These findings establish a causal role of neural oscillations in phonological processing and offer solid neurophysiological grounds for a potential correction of low-gamma anomalies and for alleviating the phonological deficit in dyslexia.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dE3pBlrvRXY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Promotes Gait Training in Parkinson Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25881?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25881?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether priming with 1 or 25Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) will enhance the benefits from treadmill training up to 3 months postintervention in people with Parkinson disease (PD), and to evaluate the underlying changes in cortical excitability.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This randomized double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial was conducted between October 2016 and December 2018. Fifty‐one participants with PD were randomized to receive 12 sessions of rTMS (25Hz, 1Hz, or sham) followed by treadmill training. All participants were assessed at baseline and 1 day, 1 month, and 3 months postintervention. Primary outcome was fastest walking speed, and secondary outcomes were timed up‐and‐go test (TUG), dual‐task TUG (DT‐TUG), motor section of the Movement Disorder Society–Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS‐UPDRS‐III), and electrophysiological evaluation of cortical excitability by TMS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1 and 25Hz rTMS groups produced a greater improvement in fastest walking speed at 1 day and 3 months postintervention than the sham group. Only the 1 and 25Hz rTMS groups sustained the improvements in TUG, and had a significant improvement in DT‐TUG and MDS‐UPDRS‐III for up to 3 months. Behavioral improvements correlated with increased cortical silent period and short‐interval intracortical inhibition in both groups receiving real rTMS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priming with 1 and 25Hz rTMS can augment the benefits of treadmill training and lead to long‐term motor improvement up to 3 months postintervention. The motor improvement at follow‐up was associated with a normalization of cortical excitability, which in turn suggests an alteration of the homeostatic plasticity range. Rebalancing cortical excitability by rTMS appears critical for plasticity induction. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) is a type of cortical plasticity operating in visual cortex of mammals that are endowed with binocular vision based on the competition‐driven disparity. Earlier, a molecular mechanism was proposed that catecholamines play an important role in the maintenance of ODP in kittens. Having survived the initial test, the hypothesis was further advanced to identify noradrenaline (NA) as a key factor that regulates ODP in the immature cortex. Later, the ODP‐promoting effect of NA is extended to the adult with age‐related limitations. Following the enhanced NA availability, the chain events downstream lead to the β‐adrenoreceptor‐induced cAMP accumulation, which in turn activates the protein kinase A. Eventually, the protein kinase translocates to the cell nucleus to activate cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB). CREB is a cellular transcription factor that controls the transcription of various genes, underpinning neuronal plasticity and long‐term memory. In the advent of molecular genetics in that various types of new tools have become available with relative ease, ODP research has lightly adopted in the rodent model the original concepts and methodologies. Here, after briefly tracing the strategic maturation of our quest, the review moves to the later development of the field, with the emphasis placed around the following issues: (a) Are we testing ODP per se? (b) What does monocular deprivation deprive of the immature cortex? (c) The critical importance of binocular competition, (d) What is the adult plasticity? (e) Excitation–Inhibition balance in local circuits, and (f) Species differences in the animal models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of syllable structure in speech depended upon a coupling between vocalization and oscillatory movement of the jaw. Using functional MRI, we identify the neural basis of this coupling by demonstrating overlapping representations between the larynx and the jaw muscles in the human motor cortex.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prominent model of the origins of speech, known as the “frame/content” theory, posits that oscillatory lowering and raising of the jaw provided an evolutionary scaffold for the development of syllable structure in speech. Because such oscillations are nonvocal in most nonhuman primates, the evolution of speech required the addition of vocalization onto this scaffold in order to turn such jaw oscillations into vocalized syllables. In the present functional MRI study, we demonstrate overlapping somatotopic representations between the larynx and the jaw muscles in the human primary motor cortex. This proximity between the larynx and jaw in the brain might support the coupling between vocalization and jaw oscillations to generate syllable structure. This model suggests that humans inherited voluntary control of jaw oscillations from ancestral species, but added voluntary control of vocalization onto this via the evolution of a new brain area that came to be situated near the jaw region in the human motor cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Extracting stimulus features from neuronal ensembles is of great interest to
the development of neuroprosthetics that project sensory information directly
to the brain via electrical stimulation. Machine learning strategies that
optimize stimulation parameters as the subject learns to interpret the
artificial input could improve device efficacy, increase prosthetic
performance, ensure stability of evoked sensations, and improve power
consumption by eliminating extraneous input. Recent advances extending deep
learning techniques to non-Euclidean graph data provide a novel approach to
interpreting neuronal spiking activity. For this study, we apply graph
convolutional networks (GCNs) to infer the underlying functional relationship
between neurons that are involved in the processing of artificial sensory
information. Data was collected from a freely behaving rat using a four
infrared (IR) sensor, ICMS-based neuroprosthesis to localize IR light sources.
We use GCNs to predict the stimulation frequency across four stimulating
channels in the prosthesis, which encode relative distance and directional
information to an IR-emitting reward port. Our GCN model is able to achieve a
peak performance of 73.5% on a modified ordinal regression performance metric
in a multiclass classification problem consisting of 7 classes, where chance is
14.3%. Additionally, the inferred adjacency matrix provides a adequate
representation of the underlying neural circuitry encoding the artificial

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: A Joint Network Optimization Framework to Predict Clinical Severity from Resting State Functional MRI Data. (arXiv:2009.03238v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a novel optimization framework to predict clinical severity from
resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. Our model consists of two coupled terms. The
first term decomposes the correlation matrices into a sparse set of
representative subnetworks that define a network manifold. These subnetworks
are modeled as rank-one outer-products which correspond to the elemental
patterns of co-activation across the brain; the subnetworks are combined via
patient-specific non-negative coefficients. The second term is a linear
regression model that uses the patient-specific coefficients to predict a
measure of clinical severity. We validate our framework on two separate
datasets in a ten fold cross validation setting. The first is a cohort of
fifty-eight patients diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The second
dataset consists of sixty three patients from a publicly available ASD
database. Our method outperforms standard semi-supervised frameworks, which
employ conventional graph theoretic and statistical representation learning
techniques to relate the rs-fMRI correlations to behavior. In contrast, our
joint network optimization framework exploits the structure of the rs-fMRI
correlation matrices to simultaneously capture group level effects and patient
heterogeneity. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed framework robustly
identifies clinically relevant networks characteristic of ASD.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: The Resolution Matrix for Visualizing Functional Network Connectivity. (arXiv:2009.03187v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The resolution matrix is a mathematical tool for analyzing inverse problems
such as computational imaging systems. When treating network connectivity
estimation as an inverse problem, the resolution matrix describes the degree to
which network nodes and edges can be resolved. This is useful both for
quantifying robustness of the network estimate, as well as identifying
correlated activity. In this report we analyze the resolution matrix for
functional MRI data from the Human Connectome project. We find that common
metrics of the resolution metric can be used to identify networked activity,
though with a new twist on the relationship between default mode network and
the frontoparietal attention network.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Improving Maritime Traffic Emission Estimations on Missing Data with CRBMs. (arXiv:2009.03001v2 [cs.CY] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Maritime traffic emissions are a major concern to governments as they heavily
impact the Air Quality in coastal cities. Ships use the Automatic
Identification System (AIS) to continuously report position and speed among
other features, and therefore this data is suitable to be used to estimate
emissions, if it is combined with engine data. However, important ship features
are often inaccurate or missing. State-of-the-art complex systems, like CALIOPE
at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, are used to model Air Quality. These
systems can benefit from AIS based emission models as they are very precise in
positioning the pollution. Unfortunately, these models are sensitive to missing
or corrupted data, and therefore they need data curation techniques to
significantly improve the estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a
methodology for treating ship data using Conditional Restricted Boltzmann
Machines (CRBMs) plus machine learning methods to improve the quality of data
passed to emission models. Results show that we can improve the default methods
proposed to cover missing data. In our results, we observed that using our
method the models boosted their accuracy to detect otherwise undetectable
emissions. In particular, we used a real data-set of AIS data, provided by the
Spanish Port Authority, to estimate that thanks to our method, the model was
able to detect 45% of additional emissions, of additional emissions,
representing 152 tonnes of pollutants per week in Barcelona and propose new
features that may enhance emission modeling.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: A comparison of oscillatory characteristics in covert speech and speech perception. (arXiv:2009.02816v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02816</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Covert speech, the silent production of words in the mind, has been studied
increasingly to understand and decode thoughts. This task has often been
compared to speech perception as it brings about similar topographical
activation patterns in common brain areas. In studies of speech comprehension,
neural oscillations are thought to play a key role in the sampling of speech at
varying temporal scales. However, very little is known about the role of
oscillations in covert speech. In this study, we aimed to determine to what
extent each oscillatory frequency band is used to process words in covert
speech and speech perception tasks. Secondly, we asked whether the {\theta} and
{\gamma} activity in the two tasks are related through phase-amplitude coupling
(PAC). First, continuous wavelet transform was performed on epoched signals and
subsequently two-tailed t-tests between two classes were conducted to determine
statistical distinctions in frequency and time. While the perception task
dynamically uses all frequencies with more prominent {\theta} and {\gamma}
activity, the covert task favoured higher frequencies with significantly higher
{\gamma} activity than perception. Moreover, the perception condition produced
significant {\theta}-{\gamma} PAC suggesting a linkage of syllabic and
phonological sampling. Although this was found to be suppressed in the covert
condition, we found significant pseudo-coupling between perception {\theta} and
covert speech {\gamma}. We report that covert speech processing is largely
conducted by higher frequencies, and that the {\gamma}- and {\theta}-bands may
function similarly and differently across tasks, respectively. This study is
the first to characterize covert speech in terms of neural oscillatory
engagement. Future studies are directed to explore oscillatory characteristics
and inter-task relationships with a more diverse vocabulary.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Convergence Analysis of the Hessian Estimation Evolution Strategy. (arXiv:2009.02732v1 [math.OC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02732</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The class of algorithms called Hessian Estimation Evolution Strategies
(HE-ESs) update the covariance matrix of their sampling distribution by
directly estimating the curvature of the objective function. The approach is
practically efficient, as attested by respectable performance on the BBOB
testbed, even on rather irregular functions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper we formally prove two strong guarantees for the (1+4)-HE-ES, a
minimal elitist member of the family: stability of the covariance matrix
update, and as a consequence, linear convergence on all convex quadratic
problems at a rate that is independent of the problem instance.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a highly developed synapse linking motor neuron activity with muscle contraction. A complex of molecular cascades together with the specialized NMJ architecture ensures that each action potential arriving at the motor nerve terminal is translated into an action potential in the muscle fiber. The muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is a key molecular component located at the postsynaptic muscle membrane responsible for the generation of the endplate potential (EPP), which usually exceeds the threshold potential necessary to activate voltage-gated sodium channels and triggers a muscle action potential. Two AChR isoforms are found in mammalian muscle. The fetal isoform is present in prenatal stages and is involved in the development of the neuromuscular system whereas the adult isoform prevails thereafter, except after denervation when the fetal form is re-expressed throughout the muscle. This review will summarize the structural and functional differences between the two isoforms and outline congenital and autoimmune myasthenic syndromes that involve the isoform specific AChR subunits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are a central component in signaling networks in a multitude of mammalian cell types. This review covers recent advances on specific functions of p38 MAP kinases in cells of the central nervous system. Unique and specific functions of the four mammalian p38 kinases are found in all major cell types in the brain. Mechanisms of p38 activation and downstream phosphorylation substrates in these different contexts are outlined and how they contribute to functions of p38 in physiological and under disease conditions. Results in different model organisms demonstrated that p38 kinases are involved in cognitive functions, including functions related to anxiety, addiction behavior, neurotoxicity, neurodegeneration, and decision making. Finally, the role of p38 kinases in psychiatric and neurological conditions and the current progress on therapeutic inhibitors targeting p38 kinases are covered and implicate p38 kinases in a multitude of CNS-related physiological and disease states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gene therapy approaches using viral vectors for the overexpression of target genes have been for several years the focus of gene therapy research against neurological disorders. These approaches deliver robust expression of therapeutic genes, but are typically limited to the delivery of single genes and often do not manipulate the expression of the endogenous locus. In the last years, the advent of CRISPR-Cas9 technologies have revolutionized many areas of scientific research by providing novel tools that allow simple and efficient manipulation of endogenous genes. One of the applications of CRISPR-Cas9, termed CRISPRa, based on the use of a nuclease-null Cas9 protein (dCas9) fused to transcriptional activators, enables quick and efficient increase in target endogenous gene expression. CRISPRa approaches are varied, and different alternatives exist with regards to the type of Cas9 protein and transcriptional activator used. Several of these approaches have been successfully used in neurons in vitro and in vivo, but have not been so far extensively applied for the overexpression of genes involved in synaptic transmission. Here we describe the development and application of two different CRISPRa systems, based on single or dual Lentiviral and Adeno-Associated viral vectors and VP64 or VPR transcriptional activators, and demonstrate their efficiency in increasing mRNA and protein expression of the Cnr1 gene, coding for neuronal CB1 receptors. Both approaches were similarly efficient in primary neuronal cultures, and achieved a 2–5-fold increase in Cnr1 expression, but the AAV-based approach was more efficient in vivo. Our dual AAV-based VPR system in particular, based on Staphylococcus aureus dCas9, when injected in the hippocampus, displayed almost complete simultaneous expression of both vectors, high levels of dCas9 expression, and good efficiency in increasing Cnr1 mRNA as measured by in situ hybridization. In addition, we also show significant upregulation of CB1 receptor protein in vivo, which is reflected by an increased ability in reducing neurotransmitter release, as measured by electrophysiology. Our results show that CRISPRa techniques could be successfully used in neurons to target overexpression of genes involved in synaptic transmission, and can potentially represent a next-generation gene therapy approach against neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a prototypic chemical synapse between the spinal motor neuron and the motor endplate. Gene expression profiles of the motor endplate are not fully elucidated. Collagen Q (ColQ) is a collagenic tail subunit of asymmetric forms of acetylcholinesterase and is driven by two distinct promoters. pColQ1 is active throughout the slow-twitch muscle, whereas pColQ1a is active at the motor endplate of fast-twitch muscle. We made a transgenic mouse line that expresses nuclear localization signal (NLS)-attached Cre recombinase under the control of pColQ1a (pColQ1a-Cre mouse). RiboTag mouse expresses an HA-tagged ribosomal subunit, RPL22, in cells expressing Cre recombinase. We generated pColQ1a-Cre:RiboTag mouse, and confirmed that HA-tagged RPL22 was enriched at the NMJ of tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. Next, we confirmed that Chrne and Musk that are specifically expressed at the NMJ were indeed enriched in HA-immunoprecipitated (IP) RNA, whereas Sox10 and S100b, markers for Schwann cells, and Icam1, a marker for vascular endothelial cells, and Pax3, a marker for muscle satellite cells, were scarcely detected. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of RNA-seq data showed that “phosphatidylinositol signaling system” and “extracellular matrix receptor interaction” were enriched at the motor endplate. Subsequent analysis revealed that genes encoding diacylglycerol kinases, phosphatidylinositol kinases, phospholipases, integrins, and laminins were enriched at the motor endplate. We first characterized the gene expression profile under translation at the motor endplate of TA muscle using the RiboTag technique. We expect that our gene expression profiling will help elucidate molecular mechanisms of the development, maintenance, and pathology of the NMJ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: The Discovery and Characterization of Targeted Perikaryal-Specific Brain Lesions With Excitotoxins</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00927</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neurotoxic action of glutamic acid was first described by Lucas and Newhouse, who demonstrated neural degeneration in the inner layers of the neonatal mouse retina after systemic treatment with L-glutamate. Olney extended these findings by showing that neuronal degeneration affected other brain structures including neurons within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the area postrema, that the lesion spared axons passing through these areas, and that the neurotoxic potency of glutamate analogs correlated with their excitatory potency, resulting in the designation “excitotoxins.” As this method affected only a small number of brain regions, it was not suitable for targeted brain lesions. The Coyle laboratory showed that direct injection of the potent glutamate receptor agonist, kainic acid, into the rat striatum caused a rapid degeneration of intrinsic neurons while sparing axons of passage or termination including the unmyelinated dopaminergic terminals. Kainic acid also exhibited this perikaryal-specific and axon-sparing profile when injected into the cerebellum, hippocampus and eye. However, neuronal vulnerability was highly variable, with hippocampal CA3, pyriform cortex and amygdala neurons exhibiting great sensitivity due to kainate’s high convulsive activity. In a comparison study, ibotenic acid, a potent glutamatergic agonist isolated from the amanita muscaria mushroom, was found to have excitotoxic potency comparable to kainate but was far less epileptogenic. Ibotenate produced spherical, perikaryal-specific lesions regardless of the site of injection, and experiments with specific glutamate receptor antagonists showed that its effects were mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. Because of this uniform neurotoxicity and near ubiquitous efficacy, ibotenic acid became the excitotoxic lesioning agent of choice. The discovery of the excitotoxic properties of the tryptophan metabolite quinolinic acid and of the anti-excitotoxic, neuroprotective effects of the related metabolite kynurenic acid in the Schwarcz laboratory then gave rise to the concept that these endogenous compounds may play causative roles in the neuropathology of a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Upregulation of C Terminus of Hsc70-Interacting Protein Attenuates Apoptosis and Procoagulant Activity and Facilitates Brain Repair After Traumatic Brain Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) could highly induce coagulopathy through breaking the dynamic balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis systems, which may be a major contributor to the progressive secondary injury cascade that occurs after TBI. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) inhibition is reported to exert neuroprotection in TBI, making it a potential regulatory target involved in TBI-induced coagulation disorder. PTEN level is controlled in a major way by E3 ligase-mediated degradation through the ubiquitin–proteasome system. The C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) has been shown to regulate proteasomal degradation and ubiquitination level of PTEN. In the present study, CHIP was overexpressed and knocked down in mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (bEnd.3) and tissues during the early phase of TBI. In vitro cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, migration capacity, and invasion capacity were determined. The changes of procoagulant and apoptosis molecules after TBI were also detected as well as the micrangium density and blood–brain barrier permeability after in vivo TBI. In vitro results demonstrated that CHIP overexpression facilitated bEnd.3 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and downregulated cell apoptosis and the expressions of procoagulant molecules through promoting PTEN ubiquitination in a simulated TBI model with stretch-induced injury treatment. In vivo experiments also demonstrated that CHIP overexpression suppressed post-TBI apoptosis and procoagulant protein expressions, as well as increased microvessel density, reduced hemorrhagic injury, and blood–brain barrier permeability. These findings suggested that the upregulation of CHIP may attenuate apoptosis and procoagulant activity, facilitate brain repair, and thus exerts neuroprotective effects in TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Alzheimer’s Retinopathy: Seeing Disease in the Eyes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neurosensory retina emerges as a prominent site of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. As a CNS extension of the brain, the neuro retina is easily accessible for noninvasive, high-resolution imaging. Studies have shown that along with cognitive decline, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD often suffer from visual impairments, abnormal electroretinogram patterns, and circadian rhythm disturbances that can, at least in part, be attributed to retinal damage. Over a decade ago, our group identified the main pathological hallmark of AD, amyloid β-protein (Aβ) plaques, in the retina of patients including early-stage clinical cases. Subsequent histological, biochemical and in vivo retinal imaging studies in animal models and in humans corroborated these findings and further revealed other signs of AD neuropathology in the retina. Among these signs, hyperphosphorylated tau, neuronal degeneration, retinal thinning, vascular abnormalities and gliosis were documented. Further, linear correlations between the severity of retinal and brain Aβ concentrations and plaque pathology were described. More recently, extensive retinal pericyte loss along with vascular platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β deficiency were discovered in postmortem retinas of MCI and AD patients. This progressive loss was closely associated with increased retinal vascular amyloidosis and predicted cerebral amyloid angiopathy scores. These studies brought excitement to the field of retinal exploration in AD. Indeed, many questions still remain open, such as queries related to the temporal progression of AD-related pathology in the retina compared to the brain, the relations between retinal and cerebral changes and whether retinal signs can predict cognitive decline. The extent to which AD affects the retina, including the susceptibility of certain topographical regions and cell types, is currently under intense investigation. Advances in retinal amyloid imaging, hyperspectral imaging, optical coherence tomography, and OCT-angiography encourage the use of such modalities to achieve more accurate, patient- and user-friendly, noninvasive detection and monitoring of AD. In this review, we summarize the current status in the field while addressing the many unknowns regarding Alzheimer’s retinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Individual Baseline Performance and Electrode Montage Impact on the Effects of Anodal tDCS Over the Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00349</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00349</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC), can produce significant effects on working memory (WM) performance and associated neurophysiological activity. However, results from previous studies are inconsistent and occasionally contradictory. This inconsistency may be attributed to methodological and individual differences during experiments. This study therefore investigated two hypotheses: (1) A multichannel-optimized montage was expected to be more effective than a classical bipolar montage, because of increased focality. (2) The subjects were expected to benefit differently from the stimulation depending on their initial task performance. In a sham-controlled crossover study, 24 healthy participants received bipolar, multichannel, and sham stimulation for 20 min in randomized order, targeting the lDLPFC while performing a 2-back WM task. After stimulation, electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded at rest and during 2-back and nontarget continuous performance task (CPT) performance. Bipolar and multichannel stimulations were both well tolerated and effectively blinded. We found no effect of stimulation on behavioral performance or neuronal oscillations comparing the classical bipolar or multichannel montage with sham stimulation. We did, however, find an interaction between stimulation and initial task performance. For multichannel stimulation, initially low-performing participants tended to improve their WM performance while initially high-performing participants tended to worsen their performance compared to sham stimulation. Both tDCS montages induced changes in neural oscillatory power, which correlated with baseline performance. The worse the participants’ initial WM performance was, the more task-related theta power was induced by multichannel and bipolar stimulation. The same effect was observed for alpha power in the nontarget task following multichannel stimulation. Notably, we were not able to show a superiority of multichannel stimulation compared to bipolar stimulation. Still, comparing both montages with sham stimulation, multichannel stimulation led to stronger effects than bipolar stimulation. The current study highlights the importance of investigating different parameters with potential influence on tDCS effects in combination. Our results demonstrate how individual differences in cognitive performance and electrode montages influence effects of tDCS on neuropsychological performance. These findings support the idea of an individualized and optimized stimulation setting, potentially leading to increased tDCS effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Using Communication to Modulate Neural Synchronization in Teams</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00332</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout training and team performance, teams may be assessed based on their communication patterns to identify which behaviors contributed to the team’s performance; however, this process of establishing meaning in communication is burdensome and time consuming despite the low monetary cost. A current topic in team research is developing covert measures, which are easier to analyze in real-time, to identify team processes as they occur during team performance; however, little is known about how overt and covert measures of team process relate to one another. In this study, we investigated the relationship between overt (communication) and covert (neural) measures of team process by manipulating the interaction partner (participant or experimenter) team members worked with and the type of task (decision-making or action-based) teams performed to assess their effects on team neural synchronization (measured as neurodynamic entropy) and communication (measured as both flow and content). The results indicated that the type of task affected how the teams structured their communication but had unpredictable effects on the neural synchronization of the team when averaged across the task session. The interaction partner did not affect team neural synchronization when averaged. However, there were significant relationships when communication and neural processes were examined over time between the neurodynamic entropy and the communication flow time series due to both the type of task and the interaction partner. Specifically, significant relationships across time were observed when participants were interacting with the other participant, during the second task trial, and across different regions of the cortex depending on the type of task being performed. The findings from the time series analyses suggest that factors that are previously known to affect communication (interaction partner and task type) also structure the relationship between team communication and neural synchronization—cross-level effects—but only when examined across time. Future research should consider these factors when developing new conceptualizations of team process measurement for measuring team performance over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Nicotine Gum Administration on Vision (ENIGMA-Vis): Study Protocol of a Double-Blind, Randomized, and Controlled Clinical Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00314</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Studies reported that tobacco addiction was related to visual impairments, but one unresolved issue is whether the impairments are related to the many compounds existing in the cigarettes or to the effects of nicotine. On the other hand, nicotine gum can be used as replacement therapy or as a neuroprotective agent for some diseases. The main purpose of this controlled trial is to investigate the effects of nicotine gum on vision. The ENIGMA-Vis trial aims to compare two dosages of nicotine gum (2 and 4 mg) and a placebo gum in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 100 participants to be allocated into a single group assignment of repeated measures (two studies; N = 50 for each one). Eligibility criteria are healthy non-smokers not diagnosed with substance abuse and without an acute or chronic medical condition. Intervention will last three sessions for each participant with a window frame of 1 week per session. Study outcomes are (1) short-term effects of nicotine gum on contrast sensitivity; (2) short-term effects of nicotine gum on chromatic contrast discrimination; and (3) whether demographics, body mass index, or serum cotinine predicts response of visual processing. This study addresses an important gap in the effects of nicotine on vision. One of the main takeaways of this study is to understand the effects of nicotine on contrast sensitivity and chromatic contrast discrimination. This information will provide a further understanding of how nicotine interacts with early visual processes and help determine how the different components present during smoking can affect vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration Number: RBR-46tjy3.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: A Human iPSC Line Carrying a de novo Pathogenic FUS Mutation Identified in a Patient With Juvenile ALS Differentiated Into Motor Neurons With Pathological Characteristics</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are used to establish patient-specific cell lines and are ideal models to mirror the pathological features of diseases and investigate their underlying mechanisms in vitro, especially for rare genic diseases. Here, a de novo mutation c.1509dupA (p.R503fs) in fused in sarcoma (FUS) was detected in a patient with sporadic juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (JALS). JALS is a rare and severe form of ALS with unclear pathogenesis and no effective cure. An induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line carrying the de novo mutation was established, and it represents a good tool to study JALS pathogenesis and gene therapy strategies for the treatment of this condition. The established human iPSC line carrying the de novoFUS mutation strongly expressed pluripotency markers and could be differentiated into three embryonic germ layers with no gross chromosomal aberrations. Furthermore, the iPSCs could be successfully differentiated into motor neurons exhibiting the pathological characteristics of ALS. Our results indicate that this line may be useful for uncovering the pathogenesis of sporadic JALS and screen for drugs to treat this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Morphological Responses of Excitatory Prelimbic and Orbitofrontal Cortical Neurons to Excess Corticosterone in Adolescence and Acute Stress in Adulthood</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Considerable evidence indicates that chronic stress and excess glucocorticoids induce neuronal remodeling in prefrontal cortical (PFC) regions. Adolescence is also characterized by a structural reorganization of PFC neurons, yet interactions between stress- and age-related structural plasticity are still being determined. We quantified dendritic spine densities on apical dendrites of excitatory neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex, prelimbic subregion (PL). Densities decreased across adolescent development, as expected, and spine volume increased. Unexpectedly, exposure to excess corticosterone (CORT) throughout adolescence did not cause additional dendritic spine loss detectable in adulthood. As a positive control dendrite population expected to be sensitive to CORT, we imaged neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), confirming CORT-induced dendritic spine attrition on basal arbors of layer V neurons. We next assessed the effects of acute, mild stress in adulthood: On PL neurons, an acute stressor increased the density of mature, mushroom-shaped spines. Meanwhile, on OFC neurons, dendritic spine volumes and lengths were lower in mice exposed to both CORT and an acute stressor (also referred to as a “double hit”). In sum, prolonged exposure to excess glucocorticoids during adolescence can have morphological and also metaplastic consequences, but they are not global. Anatomical considerations are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dementia is a syndrome of acquired cognitive impairment that leads to a significant decline in a patient’s daily life, ability to learn, and the ability to communicate with others. Dementia occurs in many diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, and Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD). Although the analysis of biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood physicochemical analysis can indicate neurological impairment, there are currently no sensitive biomarkers for early clinical diagnosis of dementia or for identifying the cause of dementia. Previous studies have suggested that circulating micro (mi)RNAs may be used as biomarkers for diagnosing neurological disorders. However, miRNAs are susceptible to interference by other components in the peripheral circulation, bringing into question the diagnostic value of circulating miRNAs. Exosomes secreted by most cell types contain proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs that are closely associated with changes in cellular functions. Exosome miRNAs (ex-miRNAs) are highly stable and resistant to degradation. Therefore, these may serve as useful biomarkers for the early clinical diagnosis of dementia. Here, we review studies of ex-miRNAs that commonly cause clinical dementia and explore whether ex-miRNAs may be used as early diagnostic biomarkers of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Mood and anxiety disorders are complex heterogeneous syndromes that manifest in dysfunctions across multiple brain regions, cell types, and circuits. Biomarkers using brain-wide activity patterns in humans have proven useful in distinguishing between disorder subtypes and identifying effective treatments. In order to improve biomarker identification, it is crucial to understand the basic circuitry underpinning brain-wide activity patterns. Leveraging a large repertoire of techniques, animal studies have examined roles of specific cell types and circuits in driving maladaptive behavior.</description>

	<description>Current state-of-the-art whole-brain modeling has led to great expectations of finding novel ways to rebalance the diseased brain. Kringelbach and Deco survey the advances including interacting neuronal and neurotransmitter systems that can be studied fully in silico to predict and design pharmacological and electromagnetic interventions to rebalance them in disease.</description>

	<description>Burkewitz et al. show that modulating subcellular calcium compartmentalization and signaling is a mechanism of both aging and longevity. The loss of ATF-6, a conserved mediator of the unfolded protein response, disrupts calcium retention in the ER; subsequently, ER calcium release triggers lifespan extension by stimulating mitochondrial dynamics and function.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Here we investigated the effects of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) performed with natural speaking, on the results of linguistic activations. We found that overt speaking during fMRI induced few artifacts and did not significantly affect the results, allowing the identification of areas involved in primary motor control and prosodic regulation of speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid motion artifacts, almost all speech‐related functional magnetic resonance imagings (fMRIs) are performed covertly to detect language activations. This method may be difficult to execute, especially by patients with brain tumors, and does not allow the identification of phonological areas. Here, we aimed to evaluate overt task feasibility. Thirty‐three volunteers participated in this study. They performed two functional sessions of covert and overt generation of a short sentence semantically linked with a word. Three main contrasts were performed: Covert and Overt for the isolation of language‐activated areas, and Overt &amp;gt; Covert for the isolation of the motor cortical activation of speech. fMRI data preprocessing was performed with and without unwarping, and with and without regression of movement parameters as confounding variables. All types of results were compared to each other. For the Overt contrast, Dice coefficients showed strong overlap between each pair of types of results: 0.98 for the pair with and without unwarping, and 0.9 for the pair with and without movement parameter regression. The Overt &amp;gt; Covert contrast allowed isolation of motor laryngeal activations with high statistical reliability and revealed the right‐lateralized temporal activity related to acoustic feedback. Overt speaking during magnetic resonance imaging induced few artifacts and did not significantly affect the results, allowing the identification of areas involved in primary motor control and prosodic regulation of speech. Unwarping and motion artifact regression in the postprocessing step, seem to not be necessary. Changes in lateralization of cortical activity by overt speech shall be explored before using these tasks for presurgical mapping.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Long‐term exposure to lipid‐lowering drugs might affect Parkinson's disease (PD) risk. We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses where genetic variants indexed expected effects of modulating lipid‐lowering drug targets on PD. Statin exposure was not predicted to increase PD risk, although results were not precise enough to support benefits for prevention clearly (odds ratio [OR] = 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.65, 1.07). Other target results were null, except for variants indicating Apolipoprotein‐A5 or Apolipoprotein‐C3 inhibition might confer protection. These findings suggest peripheral lipid variation may not have a prominent role in PD etiology, but some related drug targets could influence PD via alternate pathways.

	<title>Hippocampus: Interindividual differences in memory system local field potential activity predict behavioral strategy on a dual‐solution T‐maze</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals can use diverse behavioral strategies to navigate their environment including hippocampal‐dependent place strategies reliant upon cognitive maps and striatal‐dependent response strategies reliant upon egocentric body turns. The existence of multiple memory systems appears to facilitate successful navigation across a wide range of environmental and physiological conditions. The mechanisms by which these systems interact to ultimately generate a unitary behavioral response, however, remain unclear. We trained 20 male, Sprague–Dawley rats on a dual‐solution T‐maze while simultaneously recording local field potentials that were targeted to the dorsolateral striatum and dorsal hippocampus. Eight rats spontaneously exhibited a place strategy while the remaining 12 rats exhibited a response strategy. Interindividual differences in behavioral strategy were associated with distinct patterns of LFP activity between the dorsolateral striatum and dorsal hippocampus. Specifically, striatal‐hippocampal theta activity was in‐phase in response rats and out‐of‐phase in place rats and response rats exhibited elevated striatal‐hippocampal coherence across a wide range of frequency bands. These contrasting striatal‐hippocampal activity regimes were (a) present during both maze‐learning and a 30 min premaze habituation period and (b) could be used to train support vector machines to reliably predict behavioral strategy. Distinct patterns of neuronal activity across multiple memory systems, therefore, appear to bias behavioral strategy selection and thereby contribute to interindividual differences in behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of long‐term potentiation (LTP) provides a powerful window into cellular mechanisms of learning and memory. Prior work shows late LTP (L‐LTP), lasting &amp;gt;3 hr, occurs abruptly at postnatal day 12 (P12) in the &lt;i&gt;stratum radiatum&lt;/i&gt; of rat hippocampal area CA1. The goal here was to determine the developmental profile of synaptic plasticity leading to L‐LTP in the mouse hippocampus. Two mouse strains and two mutations known to affect synaptic plasticity were chosen: C57BL/6J and &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Sparcl1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) on the 129SVE background. Like rats, hippocampal slices from all of the mice showed test pulse‐induced depression early during development that was gradually resolved with maturation by 5 weeks. All the mouse strains showed a gradual progression between P10‐P35 in the expression of short‐term potentiation (STP), lasting ≤1 hr. In the 129SVE mice, L‐LTP onset (&amp;gt;25% of slices) occurred by 3 weeks, reliable L‐LTP (&amp;gt;50% slices) was achieved by 4 weeks, and &lt;i&gt;Hevin&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; advanced this profile by 1 week. In the C57BL/6J mice, L‐LTP onset occurred significantly later, over 3–4 weeks, and reliability was not achieved until 5 weeks. Although some of the &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;−/y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed L‐LTP before 3 weeks, reliable L‐LTP also was not achieved until 5 weeks. L‐LTP onset was not advanced in any of the mouse genotypes by multiple bouts of theta‐burst stimulation at 90 or 180 min intervals. These findings show important species differences in the onset of STP and L‐LTP, which occur at the same age in rats but are sequentially acquired in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Ontogeny of the electric organ discharge and of the papillae of the electrocytes in the weakly electric fish Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus (Teleostei: Mormyridae)</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Ontogeny of the electric organ discharge and of the papillae of the electrocytes in the weakly electric fish Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus (Teleostei: Mormyridae)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ad8fb53b-4c7a-4e24-9ed2-7bafbe8ea5ec/cne25003-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electric organ (EO) of mormyrid weakly electric fish is located in the tail on either side of the spinal cord. It consists of dorsal and ventral columns of serially arranged electrocytes which are derivatives of muscle cells. In &lt;i&gt;Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus&lt;/i&gt; it produces a long triphasic discharge. We investigated the development of the EOD and the morphology of the electrocytes in order to correlate ontogenetic changes in length and shape of the EOD with dynamic morphological characteristics of the electrocyte, in particular the formation of surface evaginations (papillae) of the anterior face of electrocytes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electric organ of the mormyrid weakly electric fish, &lt;i&gt;Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus&lt;/i&gt; (Boulenger, 1898), undergoes changes in both the electric organ discharge (EOD) and the light and electron microscopic morphology as the fish mature from the juvenile to the adult form. Of particular interest was the appearance of papillae, surface specializations of the uninnervated anterior face of the electrocyte, which have been hypothesized to increase the duration of the EOD. In a 24.5 mm long juvenile the adult electric organ (EO) was not yet functional, and the electrocytes lacked papillae. A 40 mm long juvenile, which produced a short biphasic EOD of 1.3 ms duration, shows small papillae (average area 136 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). In contrast, the EOD of a 79 mm long juvenile was triphasic. The large increase in duration of the EOD to 23.2 ms was accompanied by a small change in size of the papillae (average area 159 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Similarly, a 150 mm long adult produced a triphasic EOD of comparable duration to the younger stage (24.7 ms) but featured a prominent increase in size of the papillae (average area 402 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus, there was no linear correlation between EOD duration and papillary size. The most prominent ultrastructural change was at the level of the myofilaments, which regularly extended into the papillae, only in the oldest specimen—probably serving a supporting function. Physiological mechanisms, like gene expression levels, as demonstrated in some &lt;i&gt;Campylomormyrus&lt;/i&gt; species, might be more important concerning the duration of the EOD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Dynamic Properties of a Brain Network During Spatial Working Memory Tasks in College Students With ADHD Traits</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.580813</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.580813</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study investigated deficits of spatial working memory in college students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) traits using event-related potentials (ERPs) and the spatial 2-back task. We also computed sensory-level activity using EEG data and investigated theta and alpha neural oscillations, phase-locking values (PLV), and brain networks. Based on the scores from the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) and Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS), an ADHD-trait group (n = 40) and a normal control group (n = 41) were selected. Participants were required to respond to whether the presented stimulus was at the same location as that presented two trials earlier. The ADHD-trait group showed significantly slower response times than the control group in the spatial 2-back task. In terms of spectrum, the ADHD-trait group showed significantly reduced theta power than the control group. In contrast, the ADHD-trait group exhibited an increased alpha power compared to the control group with the 250–1000 ms interval after stimulus onset. In terms of the PLV, the ADHD-trait group showed significantly weaker theta phase synchrony and fewer connection numbers in frontal-occipital areas than the control group. In terms of the theta brain network, the ADHD-trait group showed a significantly lower clustering coefficient and longer characteristic path length than the control group for the theta band. The present results indicate that college students with ADHD traits have deficits in spatial working memory and that these abnormal activities in neural oscillation, functional connectivity, and the network may contribute to spatial working memory deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Learning Long Temporal Sequences in Spiking Networks by Multiplexing Neural Oscillations</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00078</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many cognitive and behavioral tasks—such as interval timing, spatial navigation, motor control, and speech—require the execution of precisely-timed sequences of neural activation that cannot be fully explained by a succession of external stimuli. We show how repeatable and reliable patterns of spatiotemporal activity can be generated in chaotic and noisy spiking recurrent neural networks. We propose a general solution for networks to autonomously produce rich patterns of activity by providing a multi-periodic oscillatory signal as input. We show that the model accurately learns a variety of tasks, including speech generation, motor control, and spatial navigation. Further, the model performs temporal rescaling of natural spoken words and exhibits sequential neural activity commonly found in experimental data involving temporal processing. In the context of spatial navigation, the model learns and replays compressed sequences of place cells and captures features of neural activity such as the emergence of ripples and theta phase precession. Together, our findings suggest that combining oscillatory neuronal inputs with different frequencies provides a key mechanism to generate precisely timed sequences of activity in recurrent circuits of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>VPS10P (vacuolar protein sorting 10 protein) domain receptors are neuronal sorting receptors that direct cargo proteins to their destined location in subcellular compartments of the soma, dendrites, and the axon. Protein sorting by receptors such as SORLA, sortilin, and SorCS2 controls functional integrity and viability of neurons, whereas sorting receptor dysfunctions are linked to acute, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we discuss molecular mechanisms that define ligand repertoire and sorting path and that control plasticity of VPS10P domain receptor expression in the healthy brain and in response to injury.</description>

	<description>Astrocytes control multiple processes in the nervous system in health and disease. It is now clear that specific astrocyte subsets or activation states are associated with specific genomic programs and functions. The advent of novel genomic technologies has enabled rapid progress in the characterization of astrocyte heterogeneity and its control by astrocyte interactions with other cells in the central nervous system (CNS). In this review, we provide an overview of the multifaceted roles of astrocytes in the context of CNS inflammation, highlighting recent discoveries on astrocyte subsets and their regulation. We explore mechanisms of crosstalk between astrocytes and other cells in the CNS in the context of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration and discuss how these interactions shape pathological outcomes.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Variation of pro‐vasopressin processing in parvocellular and magnocellular neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus: Evidence from the vasopressin‐related glycopeptide copeptin</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Variation of pro‐vasopressin processing in parvocellular and magnocellular neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus: Evidence from the vasopressin‐related glycopeptide copeptin&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/cd81417a-11a0-4379-9874-ac745cd4c184/cne25026-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a neuropeptide produced in multiple nuclei including the paraventricular nucleus and the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The &lt;i&gt;AVP&lt;/i&gt; gene encodes prepro‐AVP that comprise the signal peptide, AVP, neurophysin (NPII), and the related glycopeptide copeptin. Here, we report not only that there are species differences between rodents and primates in the processing of the pro‐AVP precursor and production of free copeptin, but also that the processing may not be the same in different groups of pro‐AVP‐expressing cells within a given species.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is synthesized in parvocellular‐ and magnocellular neuroendocrine neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Whereas magnocellular AVP neurons project primarily to the posterior pituitary, parvocellular AVP neurons project to the median eminence and to extrahypothalamic areas. The &lt;i&gt;AVP&lt;/i&gt; gene encodes pre‐provasopressin that comprises the signal peptide, AVP, neurophysin (NPII), and a copeptin glycopeptide. In the present study, we used an N‐terminal copeptin antiserum to examine copeptin expression in magno‐ and parvocellular neurons in the hypothalamus in the mouse, rat, and macaque monkey. Although magnocellular NPII‐expressing neurons exhibited strong N‐terminal copeptin immunoreactivity in all three species, most parvocellular neurons that expressed NPII were devoid of copeptin immunoreactivity in mouse (~90%) and in rat (~53%), whereas in monkey hypothalamus, all NPII‐immunoreactive parvocellular neurons contained strong copeptin immunoreactivity. Immunoelectron microscopy in the mouse clearly showed copeptin‐immunoreactivity co‐localized with NPII‐immunoreactivity in neurosecretory vesicles in the internal median eminence and posterior pituitary, but not in the external median eminence. Intracerebroventricular administration of a prohormone convertase inhibitor, hexa‐&lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐arginine amide (D6R) resulted in a marked reduction of copeptin‐immunoreactivity in the NPII‐immunoreactive magnocellular PVN neurons in the mouse, suggesting that low protease activity and incomplete processing of pro‐vasopressin could explain the disproportionally low levels of N‐terminal copeptin expression in rodent AVP (NPII)‐expressing parvocellular neurons. Current use of the assay of copeptin as a surrogate for vasopressin means that physiologic and phylogenetic aspects of copeptin expression among neuroendocrine neurons require further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Comprehensive Topographical Map of the Serotonergic Fibers in the Male Mouse Brain&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5429e386-88fd-405e-aafa-ab1607c8fe8f/cne25027-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive look at the whole brain serotonergic projection using the SERT‐EGFP transgenic mice. The area specific pattern and rostro‐caudal change from the raphe nuclei in brainstem were mapped.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well established that serotonergic fibers distribute throughout the brain. Abnormal densities or patterns of serotonergic fibers have been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. Although many classical studies have examined the distribution pattern of serotonergic fibers, most of them were either limited to specific brain areas or had limitations in demonstrating the fine axonal morphology. In this study, we utilize male mice expressing GFP under the SERT promoter to map the topography of serotonergic fibers across the rostro‐caudal extent of each brain area. We demonstrate previously unreported regional density and fine‐grained anatomy of serotonergic fibers. Our findings include: 1) SERT fibers distribute abundantly in the thalamic nuclei close to the midline and dorsolateral areas, in most of the hypothalamic nuclei with few exceptions such as the median eminence and arcuate nuclei, and within the basal amygdaloid complex and lateral septal nuclei, 2) the source fibers of innervation of the hippocampus traverse through the septal nuclei before reaching its destination, 3) unique, filamentous type of straight terminal fibers within the nucleus accumbens, 4) laminar pattern of innervation in the hippocampus, olfactory bulb and cortex with heterogenicity in innervation density among the layers, 5) cortical labelling density gradually decreases rostro‐caudally, 6) fibers traverse and distribute mostly within the gray matter, leaving the white fiber bundles uninnervated, and 7) most of the highly labelled nuclei and cortical areas have predominant anatomical connection to limbic structures. In conclusion, we provide novel, regionally specific insights on the distribution map of serotonergic fibers using transgenic mouse.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Relations between large-scale brain connectivity and effects of regional stimulation depend on collective dynamical state</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Lia Papadopoulos, Christopher W. Lynn, Demian Battaglia, Danielle S. Bassett&lt;/p&gt;

At the macroscale, the brain operates as a network of interconnected neuronal populations, which display coordinated rhythmic dynamics that support interareal communication. Understanding how stimulation of different brain areas impacts such activity is important for gaining basic insights into brain function and for further developing therapeutic neurmodulation. However, the complexity of brain structure and dynamics hinders predictions regarding the downstream effects of focal stimulation. More specifically, little is known about how the collective oscillatory regime of brain network activity—in concert with network structure—affects the outcomes of perturbations. Here, we combine human connectome data and biophysical modeling to begin filling these gaps. By tuning parameters that control collective system dynamics, we identify distinct states of simulated brain activity and investigate how the distributed effects of stimulation manifest at different dynamical working points. When baseline oscillations are weak, the stimulated area exhibits enhanced power and frequency, and due to network interactions, activity in this excited frequency band propagates to nearby regions. Notably, beyond these linear effects, we further find that focal stimulation causes more distributed modifications to interareal coherence in a band containing regions’ baseline oscillation frequencies. Importantly, depending on the dynamical state of the system, these broadband effects can be better predicted by functional rather than structural connectivity, emphasizing a complex interplay between anatomical organization, dynamics, and response to perturbation. In contrast, when the network operates in a regime of strong regional oscillations, stimulation causes only slight shifts in power and frequency, and structural connectivity becomes most predictive of stimulation-induced changes in network activity patterns. In sum, this work builds upon and extends previous computational studies investigating the impacts of stimulation, and underscores the fact that both the stimulation site, and, crucially, the regime of brain network dynamics, can influence the network-wide responses to local perturbations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uAVtzrkU2EE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Microbial dysbiosis in the upper digestive tract is linked to an increased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Overabundance of &lt;i&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/i&gt; is associated with shorter survival of ESCC patients. We investigated the molecular mechanisms driving aggressive progression of ESCC by &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gingivalis&lt;/i&gt;. Intracellular invasion of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gingivalis&lt;/i&gt; potentiated proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis abilities of ESCC cells via transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)-dependent &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; mothers against decapentaplegic homologs (Smads)/Yes-associated protein (YAP)/Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) activation. Smads/YAP/TAZ/TEA domain transcription factor1 (TEAD1) complex formation was essential to initiate downstream target gene expression, inducing an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness features. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gingivalis&lt;/i&gt; augmented secretion and bioactivity of TGFβ through glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP) up-regulation. Accordingly, disruption of either the GARP/TGFβ axis or its activated Smads/YAP/TAZ complex abrogated the tumor-promoting role of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gingivalis&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gingivalis&lt;/i&gt; signature genes based on its activated effector molecules can efficiently distinguish ESCC patients into low- and high-risk groups. Targeting &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gingivalis&lt;/i&gt; or its activated effectors may provide novel insights into clinical management of ESCC.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/D7-8ixyJAjk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

As a novel alternative to established surface display or combinatorial chemistry approaches for the discovery of therapeutic peptides, we present a method for the isolation of small, cysteine-rich domains from bovine antibody ultralong complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). We show for the first time that isolated bovine antibody knob domains can function as autonomous entities by binding antigen outside the confines of the antibody scaffold. This yields antibody fragments so small as to be considered peptides, each stabilised by an intricate, bespoke arrangement of disulphide bonds. For drug discovery, cow immunisations harness the immune system to generate knob domains with affinities in the picomolar to low nanomolar range, orders of magnitude higher than unoptimized peptides from naïve library screening. Using this approach, knob domain peptides that tightly bound Complement component C5 were obtained, at scale, using conventional antibody discovery and peptide purification techniques.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/SDm1YrOZ8ss&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Implantable Cardiac Monitoring in the Secondary Prevention of Cryptogenic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25886?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25886?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we sought to evaluate the impact of implantable cardiac monitoring (ICM) in the prevention of stroke recurrence after a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We evaluated consecutive patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke or TIA admitted in a comprehensive stroke center during an 8‐year period. We compared the baseline characteristics and outcomes between patients receiving conventional cardiac monitoring with repeated 24‐hour Holter‐monitoring during the first 5 years in the outpatient setting and those receiving continuous cardiac monitoring with ICM during the last 3 years. Associations on the outcomes of interest were further assessed in multivariable regression models adjusting for potential confounders.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a total of 373 patients receiving conventional cardiac monitoring and 123 patients receiving ICM. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) detection was higher in the ICM cohort compared to the conventional cardiac monitoring cohort (21.1% vs 7.5%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). ICM was independently associated with an increased likelihood of PAF detection during follow‐up (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16–3.24) in multivariable analyses. Patients receiving ICM were also found to have significantly higher rates of anticoagulation initiation (18.7% vs 6.4%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and lower risk of stroke recurrence (4.1% vs 11.8%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.013). ICM was independently associated with a lower risk of stroke recurrence during follow‐up (HR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.11–0.90) in multivariable analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICM appears to be independently associated with a higher likelihood of PAF detection and anticoagulation initiation after a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or TIA. ICM was also independently related to lower risk of stroke recurrence in our cryptogenic stroke / TIA cohort. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Alertness Training Improves Spatial Bias and Functional Ability in Spatial Neglect</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25862?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25862?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a multisite, randomized, double‐blinded, controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a digital health intervention targeting the intrinsic regulation of goal‐directed alertness in patients with chronic hemispatial neglect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty‐nine participants with hemispatial neglect, who demonstrated significant spatially biased attention after acquired brain injury, were randomly assigned to the experimental attention remediation treatment or the active control group. The participants engaged with the remotely administered interventions for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was spatial bias on the Posner cueing task (response time difference: left minus right target trials). Secondary outcomes included functional abilities (measured via the Catherine Bergego scale and Barthel index), spatial cognition, executive function, quality of life, and sleep. Assessments were conducted before and immediately after participation in the experimental intervention or control condition, and again after a 3‐month no‐contact period.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with the active control group, the intervention group exhibited a significant improvement in the primary outcome, a reduction in spatially biased attention on the Posner cueing task (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.010, Cohen's &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.96), in addition to significant improvements in functional abilities as measured on the Catherine Bergego and Barthel indices (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.027, Cohen's &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.24).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrate that our attention training program was effective in improving the debilitating attention deficits common to hemispatial neglect. This benefit generalized to improvements in real‐world functional abilities. This safe, highly scalable, and self‐administered treatment for hemispatial neglect might serve as a useful addition to the existing standard of care. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;In rodents, the period of increased vulnerability to the developmental effects of general anesthetics coincides with the period of age-specific organizing (masculinizing) effects of the major female sex hormone 17β-estradiol (E2) in the male brain and excitatory GABA type A receptor (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R) signaling. We studied whether E2 synthesis and excitatory GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R signaling are involved in the mediation of the developmental effects of sevoflurane in male rats.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with the inhibitors of E2 synthesis, formestane, or the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-2Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; (NKCC1) Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; importer, bumetanide, prior to sevoflurane exposure for 6 h on postnatal (P) day 4, P5, or P6. We tested whether a subsequent exposure of these rats to sevoflurane on P∼10 would cause electroencephalography (EEG)-detectable seizures. We also evaluated their behavior during the elevated plus maze (EPM) test on P∼60, prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle responses on P∼70, and corticosterone secretion to physical restraint on P∼80.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The rats neonatally exposed to sevoflurane responded to repeated exposure to sevoflurane with increased EEG-detectable seizures (F&lt;sub&gt;(&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt; = 7.445, P = 0.001) and exhibited deficiencies during the EPM (F&lt;sub&gt;(&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.397, P = 0.008) and PPI (F&lt;sub&gt;(&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;sub&gt;110&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.222, P = 0.003) tests. They also responded to physical restraint with heightened secretion of corticosterone (F&lt;sub&gt;(&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt; = 11.906, P &amp;lt; 0.001). These parameters in the sevoflurane-exposed rats that were pretreated with formestane or bumetanide were not different from those in the control rats.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These results, along with previously published data, suggest that sevoflurane-enhanced E2 synthesis and excitatory GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R signaling at the time of sevoflurane anesthesia are involved in the mediation of the neurodevelopmental effects of the anesthetic in male rats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Wnt Signaling Through Nitric Oxide Synthase Promotes the Formation of Multi-Innervated Spines</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Structural plasticity of synapses correlates with changes in synaptic strength. Dynamic modifications in dendritic spine number and size are crucial for long-term potentiation (LTP), the cellular correlate of learning and memory. Recent studies have suggested the generation of multi-innervated spines (MIS), in the form of several excitatory presynaptic inputs onto one spine, are crucial for hippocampal memory storage. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying MIS formation and their contribution to LTP. Using 3D enhanced resolution confocal images, we examined the contribution of Wnt synaptic modulators in MIS formation in the context of LTP. We show that blockage of endogenous Wnts with specific Wnt antagonists supresses the formation of MIS upon chemical LTP induction in cultured hippocampal neurons. Gain- and loss-of-function studies demonstrate that Wnt7a signaling promotes MIS formation through the postsynaptic Wnt scaffold protein Disheveled 1 (Dvl1) by stimulating neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase (nNOS). Subsequently, NO activates soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) to increase MIS formation. Consistently, we observed an enhanced frequency and amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents. Collectively, our findings identify a unique role for Wnt secreted proteins through nNOS/NO/sGC signaling to modulate MIS formation during LTP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Paternal Deprivation and Female Biparental Family Rearing Induce Dendritic and Synaptic Changes in Octodon degus: I. Medial Prefrontal Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In most mammalian species parent-offspring interactions during early life periods primarily comprise social contacts with the mother, whereas the role of males in parental care is one of the most overlooked and understudied topics. The present study addressed the hypothesis that the complete deprivation of paternal care delays or permanently retards synaptic connectivity in the brain, particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of the offspring in a sex-specific manner. Another aim of this study was to address the question whether and in which way replacing the father with a female caregiver (in our experiments the “aunt”) can “buffer” the detrimental effects of paternal deprivation on neuronal development. The comparison of: (a) single mother rearing; (b) biparental rearing by father and mother; and (c) biparental rearing by two female caregivers revealed that: (i) paternal care represents a critical environmental factor for synaptic and dendritic development of pyramidal neurons in the vmPFC of their offspring; (ii) a second female caregiver (“aunt”) does not “buffer” the neuronal consequences of paternal deprivation; and that (iii) neuronal development in the vmPFC is differentially affected in male and female offspring in response to different family constellations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Interleukin 4 Affects Epilepsy by Regulating Glial Cells: Potential and Possible Mechanism</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a chronic brain dysfunction induced by an abnormal neuronal discharge that is caused by complicated psychopathologies. Recently, accumulating studies have revealed a close relationship between inflammation and epilepsy. Specifically, microglia and astrocytes are important inflammatory cells in the central nervous system (CNS) that have been proven to be related to the pathogenesis and development of epilepsy. Additionally, interleukin 4 (IL-4) is an anti-inflammatory factor that can regulate microglia and astrocytes in many aspects. This review article focuses on the regulatory role of IL-4 in the pathological changes of glial cells related to epilepsy. We additionally propose that IL-4 may play a protective role in epileptogenesis and suggest that IL-4 may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Prenatal Stress Impairs Postnatal Learning and Memory Development via Disturbance of the cGMP–PKG Pathway and Oxidative Phosphorylation in the Hippocampus of Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00158</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Clinical and animal studies have found that prenatal stress can lead to pathological changes in embryos and fetuses. However, the mechanisms through which this occurs have not been made clear. In the present study, pregnant rats were subjected to chronic psychological stress during gestational days using an improved communication box system, and the changes in behavioral performance and proteins in the hippocampus of offspring were analyzed. It was found that prenatal stress caused postnatal growth retardation and impairment in spatial learning and memory. Furthermore, in isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation-based proteomics analyses, 158 significantly differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were found between the two groups. Further analyses showed that these DEPs are involved in different molecular function categories and participate in several biological processes, such as energy metabolism, learning or memory, and synaptic plasticity. Moreover, the enrichment of pathways showed that the learning and memory impairment was primarily connected with the cyclic guanosine monophosphate–protein kinase G (cGMP–PKG) pathway and oxidative phosphorylation. At the same time, the cGMP level and the expression of PKG protein were significantly decreased, and the neuronal mitochondria appeared to have a swollen and irregular shape in the hippocampus of offspring of stressed rats. These results suggest that the chronic psychological stress that pregnant rats were subjected to during gestational days may have impaired the spatial learning and memory of offspring. This affected the hippocampal oxidative phosphorylation and inhibited the cGMP–PKG pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Social Cognition in Autism Spectrum Disorder Across the Adult Lifespan: Influence of Age and Sex on Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task in a Cross-sectional Sample</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.571408</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.571408</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Approximately 50,000 U.S. teens with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) become adults every year, however little is known regarding how age influences social cognition and if men and women with ASD are differentially impacted across the adult lifespan. Social cognition declines non-linearly with age in neurotypical (NT) adults. Moreover, sex differences have been observed on RME tasks in NT adults but not adults with ASD, although aging effects have been largely ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: This cross-sectional study examined the influence of age and sex on social cognition in adults with ASD compared to NT adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The Reading the Mind in the Eyes (RME) task was administered to evaluate the theory of mind abilities in 95 adults with ASD and 82 NT adults ages 18–71 years. The main effects of diagnosis, age, and sex, as well as two-way and three-way interaction were modeled using linear and quadratic aging terms in a multiple regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A main effect of diagnosis was observed, indicating poorer performance in adults with ASD relative to NT adults. Age and sex interactions were nonsignificant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: We replicated previous findings of reduced theory of mind (ToM) abilities in adults with ASD, compared to NT adults. While interactions were nonsignificant, visual inspection of quadratic age curves indicated the possibility of unique ToM trajectories in men and women with and without ASD that should be investigated in larger longitudinal studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: The Role of Microglial CX3CR1 in Schizophrenia-Related Behaviors Induced by Social Isolation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;According to the microglial hypothesis of schizophrenia, the hyperactivation of microglia and the release of proinflammatory cytokines lead to neuronal loss, which is highly related to the onset of schizophrenia. Recent studies have demonstrated that fractalkine (CX3CL1) and its receptor CX3CR1 modulate the function of microglia. Thus, the present study aimed to determine whether microglial CX3CR1 plays a role in schizophrenia-related behaviors. A classical animal model of schizophrenia, social isolation (from postnatal days 21–56), was used to induce schizophrenia-related behaviors in C57BL/6J and CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice, and the expression of the microglial CX3CR1 protein was examined in several brain areas of the C57BL/6J mice by Western blot analysis. The results revealed that social isolation caused deficits in the prepulse inhibition (PPI) in the C57BL/6J mice but not in the CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice and increased locomotor activity in both the C57BL/6J mice and the CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Moreover, the CX3CR1 protein level was increased in the medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and hippocampus of the isolated C57BL/6J mice. These findings suggested that the function of microglia regulated by CX3CR1 might participate in schizophrenia-related behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Suppression of spastin Mutant Phenotypes by Pak3 Loss Implicates a Role for Reactive Glia in AD-HSP</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00912</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative mechanisms due to mutations in spastin currently center on neuronal defects, primarily in microtubule and endomembrane regulation. Spastin loss in Drosophila larvae compromises neuronal microtubule distribution, alters synaptic bouton morphology, and weakens synaptic transmission at glutamatergic neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapses. Pak3, a p21-activated kinase that promotes actin polymerization and filopodial projections, is required for these spastin mutant defects; animals lacking both genes have normal NMJs. Here we show that Pak3 is expressed in central and peripheral glial populations, and reduction of Pak3 specifically in subperineurial glial cells is sufficient to suppress the phenotypes associated with spastin loss. Subperineurial glia in the periphery ensheathe motor neuron axons and have been shown to extend actin-based projections that regulate synaptic terminals during normal NMJ development. We find that these subperineurial glial projections are Pak3-dependent and nearly twice as frequent in spastin mutants, while in Pak3, spastin double mutants, neither glial projections nor synaptic defects are observed. Spastin deficiency thus increases Pak3-dependent subperineurial glia activity, which is in turn required for neuronal defects. Our results demonstrate a central role for Pak3-mediated, altered glial behavior in the neuronal defects due to spastin loss, and suggest that a similar reactive glia-mediated mechanism may underlie human AD-HSP pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex and serious disease as its multifaceted pathophysiological mechanisms remain vague. The molecular changes of hippocampal and cortical dysfunction in the process of TBI are poorly understood, especially their chronic effects on metabolic profiles. Here we utilize metabolomics-based liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry coupled with bioinformatics method to assess the perturbation of brain metabolism in rat hippocampus and cortex on day 7. The results revealed a signature panel which consisted of 13 identified metabolites to facilitate targeted interventions for subacute TBI discrimination. Purine metabolism change in cortical tissue and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism change in hippocampal tissue were detected. Furthermore, the associations between the metabolite markers and the perturbed pathways were analyzed based on databases: 64 enzyme and one pathway were evolved in TBI. The findings represented significant profiling changes and provided unique metabolite–protein information in a rat model of TBI following the subacute phase. This study may inspire scientists and doctors to further their studies and provide potential therapy targets for clinical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Vividness of Motor Imagery Is Correlated With Corticospinal Excitability During Combined Motor Imagery and Action Observation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between motor imagery (MI) assessment (ability and quality) and neurophysiological assessment [transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced motor-evoked potentials (MEPs)] during combined MI and action observation (AO; MI + AO). Sixteen subjects completed an MI task playing the piano with both hands, and neurophysiological assessment was performed during the MI task. The Movement Imagery Questionnaire-Revised was adopted to evaluate MI ability, while the visual analogue scale (VAS) was adopted to evaluate MI quality. A TMS pulse was delivered during the MI task, and MEPs were subsequently recorded in the abductor pollicis brevis (APB). We found a significant positive correlation between the VAS score and the TMS-induced MEPs (ρ = 0.497, p &amp;lt; 0.001). These findings suggest that the VAS score could potentially reflect the corticospinal excitability during MI + AO, particularly in complex MI tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Feeling Is Mutual: Clarity of Haptics-Mediated Social Perception Is Not Associated With the Recognition of the Other, Only With Recognition of Each Other</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.560567</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.560567</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The enactive theory of perception hypothesizes that perceptual access to objects depends on the mastery of sensorimotor contingencies, that is, on the know-how of the regular ways in which changes in sensations depend on changes in movements. This hypothesis can be extended into the social domain: perception of other minds is constituted by mastery of self-other contingencies, that is, by the know-how of the regular ways in which changes in others’ movements depend on changes in one’s movements. We investigated this proposal using the perceptual crossing paradigm, in which pairs of players are required to locate each other in an invisible one-dimensional virtual space by using a minimal haptic interface. We recorded and analyzed the real-time embodied social interaction of 10 pairs of adult participants. The results reveal a process of implicit perceptual learning: on average, clarity of perceiving the other’s presence increased over trials and then stabilized. However, a clearer perception of the other was not associated with correctness of recognition as such, but with both players correctly recognizing each other. Furthermore, the moments of correct mutual recognition tended to happen within seconds. The fact that changes in social experience can only be explained by the successful performance at the level of the dyad, and that this veridical mutual perception tends toward synchronization, lead us to hypothesize that integration of neural activity across both players played a role.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Suppression of Taboo Word Spoonerisms Is Associated With Altered Medial Frontal Negativity: An ERP Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The constant internal monitoring of speech is a crucial feature to ensure the fairly error-free process of speech production. It has been argued that internal speech monitoring takes place through detection of conflict between different response options or “speech plans.” Speech errors are thought to occur because two (or more) competing speech plans become activated, and the speaker is unable to inhibit the erroneous plan(s) prior to vocalization. A prime example for a speech plan that has to be suppressed is the involuntary utterance of a taboo word. The present study seeks to examine the suppression of involuntary taboo word utterances. We used the “Spoonerisms of Laboratory Induced Predisposition” (SLIP) paradigm to elicit two competing speech plans, one being correct and one embodying either a taboo word or a non-taboo word spoonerism. Behavioral data showed that inadequate speech plans generally were effectively suppressed, although more effectively in the taboo word spoonerism condition. Event-related potential (ERP) analysis revealed a broad medial frontal negativity (MFN) after the target word pair presentation, interpreted as reflecting conflict detection and resolution to suppress the inadequate speech plan. The MFN was found to be more pronounced in the taboo word spoonerism compared to the neutral word spoonerism condition, indicative of a higher level of conflict when subjects suppressed the involuntary utterance of taboo words.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Transient Amplitude Modulation of Alpha-Band Oscillations by Short-Time Intermittent Closed-Loop tACS</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00366</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) have recently become extensively utilized due to their potential to modulate ongoing neuronal oscillatory activity and consequently to induce cortical plasticity relevant for various cognitive functions. However, the neurophysiological basis for stimulation effects as well as their inter-individual differences is not yet understood. In the present study, we used a closed-loop electroencephalography-tACS(EEG-tACS) protocol to examine the modulation of alpha oscillations generated in occipito-parietal areas. In particular, we investigated the effects of a repeated short-time intermittent stimulation protocol (1 s in every trial) applied over the visual cortex (Cz and Oz) and adjusted according to the phase and frequency of visual alpha oscillations on the amplitude of these oscillations. Based on previous findings, we expected higher increases in alpha amplitudes for tACS applied in-phase with ongoing oscillations as compared to an application in anti-phase and this modulation to be present in low-alpha amplitude states of the visual system (eyes opened, EO) but not high (eyes closed, EC). Contrary to our expectations, we found a transient suppression of alpha power in inter-individually derived spatially specific parieto-occipital components obtained via the estimation of spatial filters by using the common spatial patterns approach. The amplitude modulation was independent of the phase relationship between the tACS signal and alpha oscillations, and the state of the visual system manipulated via closed- and open-eye conditions. It was also absent in conventionally analyzed single-channel and multi-channel data from an average parieto-occipital region. The fact that the tACS modulation of oscillations was phase-independent suggests that mechanisms driving the effects of tACS may not be explained by entrainment alone, but rather require neuroplastic changes or transient disruption of neural oscillations. Our study also supports the notion that the response to tACS is subject-specific, where the modulatory effects are shaped by the interplay between the stimulation and different alpha generators. This favors stimulation protocols as well as analysis regimes exploiting inter-individual differences, such as spatial filters to reveal otherwise hidden stimulation effects and, thereby, comprehensively induce and study the effects and underlying mechanisms of tACS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Altered Topological Properties of Brain Structural Covariance Networks in Patients With Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Brain structural alterations play an important role in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). However, while there have been studies on regional brain structural alterations, only few studies have focused on the topological organization of the brain structural covariance network. This work aimed to describe the structural covariance network architecture alterations that are possibly linked to cortex reorganization in patients with CSM.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;High-resolution anatomical images of 31 CSM patients and 31 healthy controls (HCs) were included in the study. The images were acquired using a sagittal three-dimensional T1-weighted BRAVO sequence. Firstly, the gray matter volume of 90 brain regions of automated anatomical labeling atlas were computed using a VBM toolbox based on the DARTEL algorithm. Then, the brain structural covariance network was constructed by thresholding the gray matter volume correlation matrices. Subsequently, the network measures and nodal property were calculated based on graph theory. Finally, the differences in the network metrics and nodal property between groups were compared using a non-parametric test.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Patients with CSM showed larger global efficiency and smaller local efficiency, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, and sigma values than HCs. Patients with CSM had greater betweenness in the left superior parietal gyrus (SPG.L) and the left supplementary motor area (SMA.L) than HCs. Besides, patients with CSM had smaller betweenness in right middle occipital gyrus. The brain structural covariance networks of CSM patients exhibited equal resilience to random failure as those of HCs. However, the maximum relative size of giant connected components was approximately 10% larger in HCs than in CSM patients, upon removal of 44 nodes in targeted attack.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These observed alternations in global network measures in CSM patients reflect that the brain structural covariance network in CSM exhibits the less optimal small-world model compared to that in HCs. Increased betweenness in SPG.L and SMA.L seems to be related to cortex reorganization to recover multiple sensory functions after spinal cord injury in CSM patients. The network resilience of patients with CSM exhibiting a relative mild vulnerability, compared to HCs, is probably attributable to the balance and interplay between cortex reorganization and ongoing degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Decline Variability of Cortical and Subcortical Regions in Aging: A Longitudinal Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Describing the trajectories of age-related change for different brain structures has been of interest in many recent studies. However, our knowledge regarding these trajectories and their associations is still limited due to small sample sizes and low numbers of repeated measures. For the present study, we used a large longitudinal dataset (four measurements over 4 years) comprising anatomical data from a sample of healthy older adults (N = 231 at baseline). This dataset enables us to gain new insights about volumetric cortical and subcortical changes and their associations in the context of healthy aging. Brain structure volumes were derived from T1-weighted MRI scans using FreeSurfer segmentation tools. Brain structure trajectories were fitted using mixed models and latent growth curve models to gain information about the mean extent and variability of decline trajectories for different brain structures as well as the associations between individual trajectories. On the group level, our analyses indicate similar linear changes for frontal and parietal brain regions, while medial temporal regions showed an accelerated decline with advancing age. Regarding subcortical regions, some structures showed strong declines (e.g., hippocampus), others showed little decline (e.g., pallidum). Our data provide little evidence for sex differences regarding the aforementioned trajectories. Between-person variability of the person-specific slopes (random slopes) was largest in subcortical and medial temporal brain structures. When looking at the associations between the random slopes from each brain structure, we found that the decline is largely homogenous across the majority of cortical brain structures. In subcortical and medial temporal brain structures, however, more heterogeneity of the decline was observed, meaning that the extent of the decline in one structure is less predictive of the decline in another structure. Taken together, our study contributes to enhancing our understanding of structural brain aging by demonstrating (1) that average volumetric change differs across the brain and (2) that there are regional differences with respect to between-person variability in the slopes. Moreover, our data suggest (3) that random slopes are highly correlated across large parts of the cerebral cortex but (4) that some brain regions (i.e., medial temporal regions) deviate from this homogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: A Computational Model of the Cholinergic Modulation of CA1 Pyramidal Cell Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00075</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dysfunction in cholinergic modulation has been linked to a variety of cognitive disorders including Alzheimer's disease. The important role of this neurotransmitter has been explored in a variety of experiments, yet many questions remain unanswered about the contribution of cholinergic modulation to healthy hippocampal function. To address this question, we have developed a model of CA1 pyramidal neuron that takes into consideration muscarinic receptor activation in response to changes in extracellular concentration of acetylcholine and its effects on cellular excitability and downstream intracellular calcium dynamics. This model incorporates a variety of molecular agents to accurately simulate several processes heretofore ignored in computational modeling of CA1 pyramidal neurons. These processes include the inhibition of ionic channels by phospholipid depletion along with the release of calcium from intracellular stores (i.e., the endoplasmic reticulum). This paper describes the model and the methods used to calibrate its behavior to match experimental results. The result of this work is a compartmental model with calibrated mechanisms for simulating the intracellular calcium dynamics of CA1 pyramidal cells with a focus on those related to release from calcium stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. From this model we also make various predictions for how the inhibitory and excitatory responses to cholinergic modulation vary with agonist concentration. This model expands the capabilities of CA1 pyramidal cell models through the explicit modeling of molecular interactions involved in healthy cognitive function and disease. Through this expanded model we come closer to simulating these diseases and gaining the knowledge required to develop novel treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Willin/FRMD6 Influences Mechanical Phenotype and Neuronal Differentiation in Mammalian Cells by Regulating ERK1/2 Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.552213</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.552213</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Willin/FRMD6 is part of a family of proteins with a 4.1 ezrin-radixin-moesin (FERM) domain. It has been identified as an upstream activator of the Hippo pathway and, when aberrant in its expression, is associated with human diseases and disorders. Even though Willin/FRMD6 was originally discovered in the rat sciatic nerve, most studies have focused on its functional roles in cells outside of the nervous system, where Willin/FRMD6 is involved in the formation of apical junctional cell-cell complexes and in regulating cell migration. Here, we investigate the biochemical and biophysical role of Willin/FRMD6 in neuronal cells, employing the commonly used SH-SY5Y neuronal model cell system and combining biochemical measurements with Elastic Resonator Interference Stress Micropscopy (ERISM). We present the first direct evidence that Willin/FRMD6 expression influences both the cell mechanical phenotype and neuronal differentiation. By investigating cells with increased and decreased Willin/FRMD6 expression levels, we show that Willin/FRMD6 not only affects proliferation and migration capacity of cells but also leads to changes in cell morphology and an enhanced formation of neurite-like membrane extensions. These changes were accompanied by alterations of biophysical parameters such as cell force, the organization of actin stress fibers and the formation of focal adhesions. At the biochemical level, changes in Willin/FRMD6 expression inversely affected the activity of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathway and downstream transcriptional factor NeuroD1, which seems to prime SH-SY5Y cells for retinoic acid (RA)-induced neuronal differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Notoginsenoside R1–Induced Neuronal Repair in Models of Alzheimer Disease Is Associated With an Alteration in Neuronal Hyperexcitability, Which Is Regulated by Nav</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer disease is characterized by a progressive cognitive deficit and may be associated with an aberrant hyperexcitability of the neuronal network. Notoginsenoside R1 (R1), a major activity ingredient from Panax notoginseng, has demonstrated favorable changes in neuronal plasticity and induced neuroprotective effects in brain injuries, resulting from various disorders, however, the underlying mechanisms are still not well understood. In the present study, we aimed to explore the possible neuroprotective effects induced by R1 in a mouse model of AD and the mechanisms underlying these effects. Treatment with R1 significantly improved learning and memory functions and redressed neuronal hyperexcitability in amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 mice by altering the numbers and/or distribution of the members of voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav). Moreover, we determined whether R1 contributed to the regulation of neuronal excitability in Aβ-42–injured cells. Results of our study demonstrated that treatment with R1 rescued Aβ1-42–induced injured neurons by increasing cell viability. R1-induced alleviation in neuronal hyperexcitability might be associated with reduced Navβ2 cleavage, which partially reversed the abnormal distribution of Nav1.1α. These results suggested that R1 played a vital role in the recovery of Aβ1-42–induced neuronal injury and hyperexcitability, which is regulated by Nav proteins. Therefore, R1 may be a promising candidate in the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: S100B Impairs Oligodendrogenesis and Myelin Repair Following Demyelination Through RAGE Engagement</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00279</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00279</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Increased expression of S100B and its specific receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has been described in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), being associated with an active demyelinating process. We previously showed that a direct neutralization of S100B reduces lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-induced demyelination and inflammation using an ex vivo demyelinating model. However, whether S100B actions occur through RAGE and how oligodendrogenesis and remyelination are affected are not clarified. To evaluate the role of the S100B–RAGE axis in the course of a demyelinating insult, organotypic cerebellar slice cultures (OCSC) were demyelinated with LPC in the presence or absence of RAGE antagonist FPS-ZM1. Then, we explored the effects of the S100B–RAGE axis inhibition on glia reactivity and inflammation, myelination and neuronal integrity, and on oligodendrogenesis and remyelination. In the present study, we confirmed that LPC-induced demyelination increased S100B and RAGE expression, while RAGE antagonist FPS-ZM1 markedly reduced their content and altered RAGE cellular localization. Furthermore, FPS-ZM1 prevented LPC-induced microgliosis and astrogliosis, as well as NF-κB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression. In addition, RAGE antagonist reduced LPC-induced demyelination having a beneficial effect on axonal and synaptic protein preservation. We have also observed that RAGE engagement is needed for LPC-induced oligodendrocyte (OL) maturation arrest and loss of mature myelinating OL, with these phenomena being prevented by FPS-ZM1. Our data suggest that increased levels of mature OL in the presence of FPS-ZM1 are related to increased expression of microRNAs (miRs) associated with OL differentiation and remyelination, such as miR-23a, miR-219a, and miR-338, which are defective upon LPC incubation. Finally, our electron microscopy data show that inhibition of the S100B–RAGE axis prevents axonal damage and myelin loss, in parallel with enhanced functional remyelination, as observed by the presence of thinner myelin sheaths when compared with Control. Overall, our data implicate the S100B–RAGE axis in the extent of myelin and neuronal damage, as well as in the inflammatory response that follows a demyelinating insult. Thus, prevention of RAGE engagement may represent a novel strategy for promoting not only inflammatory reduction but also neuronal and myelin preservation and/or remyelination, improving recovery in a demyelinating condition as MS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Synaptic Plasticity in Cortical Inhibitory Neurons: What Mechanisms May Help to Balance Synaptic Weight Changes?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00204</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00204</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory neurons play a fundamental role in the normal operation of neuronal networks. Diverse types of inhibitory neurons serve vital functions in cortical networks, such as balancing excitation and taming excessive activity, organizing neuronal activity in spatial and temporal patterns, and shaping response selectivity. Serving these, and a multitude of other functions effectively requires fine-tuning of inhibition, mediated by synaptic plasticity. Plasticity of inhibitory systems can be mediated by changes at inhibitory synapses and/or by changes at excitatory synapses at inhibitory neurons. In this review, we consider that latter locus: plasticity at excitatory synapses to inhibitory neurons. Despite the fact that plasticity of excitatory synaptic transmission to interneurons has been studied in much less detail than in pyramids and other excitatory cells, an abundance of forms and mechanisms of plasticity have been observed in interneurons. Specific requirements and rules for induction, while exhibiting a broad diversity, could correlate with distinct sources of excitatory inputs and distinct types of inhibitory neurons. One common requirement for the induction of plasticity is the rise of intracellular calcium, which could be mediated by a variety of ligand-gated, voltage-dependent, and intrinsic mechanisms. The majority of the investigated forms of plasticity can be classified as Hebbian-type associative plasticity. Hebbian-type learning rules mediate adaptive changes of synaptic transmission. However, these rules also introduce intrinsic positive feedback on synaptic weight changes, making plastic synapses and learning networks prone to runaway dynamics. Because real inhibitory neurons do not express runaway dynamics, additional plasticity mechanisms that counteract imbalances introduced by Hebbian-type rules must exist. We argue that weight-dependent heterosynaptic plasticity has a number of characteristics that make it an ideal candidate mechanism to achieve homeostatic regulation of synaptic weight changes at excitatory synapses to inhibitory neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: The Dual Nature of Onuf’s Nucleus: Neuroanatomical Features and Peculiarities, in Health and Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.572013</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.572013</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Onuf’s nucleus is a small group of neurons located in the ventral horns of the sacral spinal cord. The motor neurons (MNs) of Onuf’s nucleus innervate striated voluntary muscles of the pelvic floor and are histologically and biochemically comparable to the other somatic spinal MNs. However, curiously, these neurons also show some autonomic-like features as, for instance, they receive a strong peptidergic innervation. The review provides an overview of the histological, biochemical, metabolic, and gene expression peculiarities of Onuf’s nucleus. Moreover, it describes the aging-related pathologies as well as several traumatic and neurodegenerative disorders in which its neurons are involved: indeed, Onuf’s nucleus is affected in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Shy-Drager Syndrome (SDS), whereas it is spared in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). We summarize here the milestone studies that have contributed to clarifying the nature of Onuf’s neurons and in understanding what makes them either vulnerable or resistant to damage. Altogether, these works can offer the possibility to develop new therapeutic strategies for counteracting neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Monosynaptic Projections to Excitatory and Inhibitory preBötzinger Complex Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The key driver of breathing rhythm is the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) whose activity is modulated by various functional inputs, e.g., volitional, physiological, and emotional. While the preBötC is highly interconnected with other regions of the breathing central pattern generator (bCPG) in the brainstem, there is no data about the direct projections to either excitatory and inhibitory preBötC subpopulations from other elements of the bCPG or from suprapontine regions. Using modified rabies tracing, we identified neurons throughout the brain that send monosynaptic projections to identified excitatory and inhibitory preBötC neurons in mice. Within the brainstem, neurons from sites in the bCPG, including the contralateral preBötC, Bötzinger Complex, the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), parafacial region (pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;/pF&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;), and parabrachial nuclei (PB), send direct projections to both excitatory and inhibitory preBötC neurons. Suprapontine inputs to the excitatory and inhibitory preBötC neurons include the superior colliculus, red nucleus, amygdala, hypothalamus, and cortex; these projections represent potential direct pathways for volitional, emotional, and physiological control of breathing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: IL-17A Neutralization Improves the Neurological Outcome of Mice With Ischemic Stroke and Inhibits Caspase-12-Dependent Apoptosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00274</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00274</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We previously reported that the levels of astrocyte-derived interleukin-17A (IL-17A) increased both in the peri-infarct region and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of mice with 1-h middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion/12-h reperfusion (1-h MCAO/R 12 h)-induced ischemic stroke. However, the effects of IL-17A neutralization on the neurological outcome of mice with ischemic stroke and its underlying molecular mechanism are unclear. In this study, we found that the intracerebroventricular injection of IL-17A-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb; 2.0 μg) could reduce the infarct volume, alleviate neuron loss, and improve the neurological outcomes of mice with 1-h MCAO/R 24-h- or 3-day-induced ischemic-stroke mice. The IL-17A neutralization could also significantly inhibit the increase of pro-caspase-3 cleavage through caspase-12-dependent cell apoptosis, as well as preventing the decrease of antiapoptotic factor B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and the increase of proapoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) in the peri-infarct region of mice following ischemic stroke. In addition, we confirmed that the recombinant mouse (rm) IL-17A could significantly aggravate 1-h oxygen–glucose deprivation/24-h reoxygenation (1-h OGD/R 24 h)-induced ischemic injuries in cortical neurons in a dose-dependent manner, and the rmIL-17A could also exacerbate neuronal apoptosis through caspase-12 (not caspase-8 or caspase-9)-dependent pathway. These results suggest that IL-17A neutralization could improve the neurological outcome of mice with ischemic stroke through inhibiting caspase-12-dependent neuronal apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Systematic Review of the Diagnostic Validity of Brief Cognitive Screenings for Early Dementia Detection in Spanish-Speaking Adults in Latin America</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00270</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00270</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of brief cognitive screening (BCS) tools designed to diagnose mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia in Spanish-speaking individuals over the age of 50 years from Latin America (LA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A systematic search of titles and abstracts in Medline, Biomed Central, Embase, Scopus, Scirus, PsycINFO, LILACS, and SciELO was conducted. Inclusion criteria were papers written in English or Spanish involving samples from Spanish-speaking Latin American individuals published until 2018. Standard procedures were applied for reviewing the literature. The data related to the study sample, methodology, and procedures applied, as well as the performance obtained with the corresponding BCS, were collected and systematized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Thirteen of 211 articles met the inclusion criteria. The studies primarily involved memory clinic-based samples, with the exception of two studies from an adult day-care center, one from a primary care clinic, and one from a community-based sample. All the studies originated from five of the 20 countries of LA and all used standardized diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dementia and MCI; however, the diagnostic protocols applied differed. Most studies reported samples with an average of 10 years of education and only one reported a sample with an average of &amp;lt;5 years of education. No publication to date has included an illiterate population. Although the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) is the most widely-used BCS tool in LA, it is significantly influenced by education level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Although evidence is still limited, the findings from studies on LA populations suggest that MoCA requires cultural adaptations and different cutoff points according to education level. Moreover, the diagnostic validity of the INECO frontal screening (IFS) test should be evaluated in populations with a low level of education. Given the heterogeneity that exists in the levels of education in LA, more studies involving illiterate and indigenous populations are required.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Identifying Early Mild Cognitive Impairment by Multi-Modality MRI-Based Deep Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00206</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical state with a high risk of conversion to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Since there is no effective treatment for AD, it is extremely important to diagnose MCI as early as possible, as this makes it possible to delay its progression toward AD. However, it's challenging to identify early MCI (EMCI) because there are only mild changes in the brain structures of patients compared with a normal control (NC). To extract remarkable features for these mild changes, in this paper, a multi-modality diagnosis approach based on deep learning is presented. Firstly, we propose to use structure MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) images as the multi-modality data to identify EMCI. Then, a convolutional neural network based on transfer learning technique is developed to extract features of the multi-modality data, where an L1-norm is introduced to reduce the feature dimensionality and retrieve essential features for the identification. At last, the classifier produces 94.2% accuracy for EMCI vs. NC on an ADNI dataset. Experimental results show that multi-modality data can provide more useful information to distinguish EMCI from NC compared with single modality data, and the proposed method can improve classification performance, which is beneficial to early intervention of AD. In addition, it is found that DTI image can act as an important biomarker for EMCI from the point of view of a clinical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>One of the features distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from its more pathogenic counterpart SARS-CoV is the presence of premature stop codons in its ORF3b gene. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b is a potent interferon antagonist, suppressing the induction of type I interferon more efficiently than its SARS-CoV ortholog. Phylogenetic analyses and functional assays reveal that SARS-CoV-2-related viruses from bats and pangolins also encode truncated ORF3b gene products with strong anti-interferon activity.</description>

Spread of HIV typically involves uneven transmission patterns where some individuals spread to a large number of individuals while others to only a few or none. Such transmission heterogeneity can impact how fast and how much an epidemic spreads. Further, more efficient interventions may be achieved by taking such transmission heterogeneity into account. To address these issues, we developed two phylogenetic methods based on virus sequence data: 1) to generally detect if significant transmission heterogeneity is present, and 2) to pinpoint where in a phylogeny high-level spread is occurring. We derive inference procedures to estimate model parameters, including the amount of transmission heterogeneity, in a sampled epidemic. We show that it is possible to detect transmission heterogeneity under a wide range of simulated situations, including incomplete sampling, varying levels of heterogeneity, and including within-host genetic diversity. When evaluating real HIV-1 data from different epidemic scenarios, we found a lower level of transmission heterogeneity in slowly spreading situations and a higher level of heterogeneity in data that included a rapid outbreak, while &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and Sackin’s index (overall tree shape statistic) were similar in the two scenarios, suggesting that our new method is able to detect transmission heterogeneity in real data. We then show by simulations that targeted prevention, where we pinpoint high-level spread using a coalescence measurement, is efficient when sequence data are collected in an ongoing surveillance system. Such phylogeny-guided prevention is efficient under both single-step contact tracing as well as iterative contact tracing as compared to random intervention.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MvwPaDppxpk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Research publications and data nowadays should be publicly available on the internet and, theoretically, usable for everyone to develop further research, products, or services. The long-term accessibility of research data is, therefore, fundamental in the economy of the research production process. However, the availability of data is not sufficient by itself, but also their quality must be verifiable. Measures to ensure reuse and reproducibility need to include the entire research life cycle, from the experimental design to the generation of data, quality control, statistical analysis, interpretation, and validation of the results. Hence, high-quality records, particularly for providing a string of documents for the verifiable origin of data, are essential elements that can act as a certificate for potential users (customers). These records also improve the traceability and transparency of data and processes, therefore, improving the reliability of results. Standards for data acquisition, analysis, and documentation have been fostered in the last decade driven by grassroot initiatives of researchers and organizations such as the Research Data Alliance (RDA). Nevertheless, what is still largely missing in the life science academic research are agreed procedures for complex routine research workflows. Here, well-crafted documentation like standard operating procedures (SOPs) offer clear direction and instructions specifically designed to avoid deviations as an absolute necessity for reproducibility.
Therefore, this paper provides a standardized workflow that explains step by step how to write an SOP to be used as a starting point for appropriate research documentation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rDZ-zr8Vi1Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Ten simple rules for an inclusive summer coding program for non-computer-science undergraduates</title>

Since 2015, we have run a free 9-week summer program that provides non-computer science (CS) undergraduates at San Francisco State University (SFSU) with experience in coding and doing research. Undergraduate research experiences remain very limited at SFSU and elsewhere, so the summer program provides opportunities for many more students beyond the mentoring capacity of our university laboratories. In addition, we were concerned that many students from historically underrepresented (HU) groups may be unable to take advantage of traditional summer research programs because these programs require students to relocate or be available full time, which is not feasible for students who have family, work, or housing commitments. Our program, which is local and part-time, serves about 5 times as many students as a typical National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program, on a smaller budget. Based on our experiences, we present 10 simple rules for busy faculty who want to create similar programs to engage non-CS HU undergraduates in computational research. Note that while some of the strategies we implement are based on evidence-based publications in the social sciences or education research literature, the original suggestions we make here are based on our trial-and-error experiences, rather than formal hypothesis testing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oFKImM6cTKk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

With the ever-increasing quality and quantity of imaging data in biomedical research comes the demand for computational methodologies that enable efficient and reliable automated extraction of the quantitative information contained within these images. One of the challenges in providing such methodology is the need for tailoring algorithms to the specifics of the data, limiting their areas of application. Here we present a broadly applicable approach to quantification and classification of complex shapes and patterns in biological or other multi-component formations. This approach integrates the mapping of all shape boundaries within an image onto a global information-rich graph and machine learning on the multidimensional measures of the graph. We demonstrated the power of this method by (1) extracting subtle structural differences from visually indistinguishable images in our phenotype rescue experiments using the endothelial tube formations assay, (2) training the algorithm to identify biophysical parameters underlying the formation of different multicellular networks in our simulation model of collective cell behavior, and (3) analyzing the response of U2OS cell cultures to a broad array of small molecule perturbations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DBp9p8gQGGw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The circadian clock is a complex system that plays many important roles in most organisms. Previously, many mathematical models have been used to sharpen our understanding of the &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; clock, which brought to light the roles of each transcriptional and post-translational regulations. However, the presence of both regulations, instead of either transcription or post-translation, raised curiosity of whether the combination of these two regulations is important for the clock’s system. In this study, we built a series of simplified oscillators with different regulations to study the importance of post-translational regulation (specifically, 26S proteasome degradation) in the clock system. We found that a simple transcriptional-based oscillator can already generate sustained oscillation, but the oscillation can be easily destroyed in the presence of transcriptional leakage. Coupling post-translational control with transcriptional-based oscillator in a feed-forward loop will greatly improve the robustness of the oscillator in the presence of basal leakage. Using these general models, we were able to replicate the increased variability observed in the E3 ligase mutant for both plant and mammalian clocks. With this insight, we also predict a plausible regulator of several E3 ligase genes in the plant’s clock. Thus, our results provide insights into and the plausible importance in coupling transcription and post-translation controls in the clock system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sU3VD0NWU0g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Histamine-induced biphasic activation of RhoA allows for persistent RhoA signaling</title>

The small GTPase RhoA is a central signaling enzyme that is involved in various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal dynamics, transcription, and cell cycle progression. Many signal transduction pathways activate RhoA—for instance, Gα&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;-coupled Histamine 1 Receptor signaling via Gα&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent activation of RhoGEFs such as p63. Although multiple upstream regulators of RhoA have been identified, the temporal regulation of RhoA and the coordination of different upstream components in its regulation have not been well characterized. In this study, live-cell measurement of RhoA activation revealed a biphasic increase of RhoA activity upon histamine stimulation. We showed that the first and second phase of RhoA activity are dependent on p63 and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/PKC, respectively, and further identified phosphorylation of serine 240 on p115 RhoGEF by PKC to be the mechanistic link between PKC and RhoA. Combined approaches of computational modeling and quantitative measurement revealed that the second phase of RhoA activation is insensitive to rapid turning off of the receptor and is required for maintaining RhoA-mediated transcription after the termination of the receptor signaling. Thus, two divergent pathways enable both rapid activation and persistent signaling in receptor-mediated RhoA signaling via intricate temporal regulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/cebm1BYMr4k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Acetylcholinesterase and Nissl‐staining in the Atlantic white‐sided dolphin Hippocampal Formation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cetacean hippocampal formation has been noted to be one of the smallest relative to brain size of all mammals studied. This region, comprised of the dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper, subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum and the entorhinal cortex, is important in learning, memory, and navigation. There have been a number of studies detailing the distribution of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the hippocampal formation of terrestrial mammals with the goal of gaining a greater understanding of some aspects of the cholinergic innervation to this region, as well as its parcellation. The present study was undertaken to describe the organization, cytoarchitecture, and distribution of AChE in the hippocampal formation of the Atlantic white‐sided dolphin (AWSD) with the view to understand similarities and differences between this aquatic mammal and terrestrial mammals. Nissl‐staining demonstrated cytoarchitecture of the hippocampal formation in the AWSD comparable to that reported in other cetaceans. In addition, the AWSD had a rich pattern of AChE staining that distinctly varied between regions and laminae. A number of differences in the distribution of AChE staining in areas comparable to those of terrestrial species reported suggested possible alterations in connectivity of this region. Overall, however, AChE‐staining suggested that cholinergic innervation, neural pathways and function of the hippocampal formation of the AWSD is conserved, similar to other mammals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dopaminergic retinal cell loss and visual dysfunction in Parkinson's disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25897?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25897?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the demonstrated implication of the retina in PD pathology and the importance of dopaminergic cells in this tissue, we aimed to analyze the state of the dopaminergic amacrine cells and some of their main post‐synaptic neurons in the retina of PD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, we evaluated morphology, number, and synaptic connections of dopaminergic cells and their post‐synaptic cells, AII amacrine and melanopsin‐containing retinal ganglion cells, in control and PD eyes from human donors.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In PD, dopaminergic amacrine cell number was reduced between 58% and 26% in different retinal regions, involving a decline in the number of synaptic contacts with AII amacrine cells (by 60%) and melanopsin cells (by 35%). Despite losing their main synaptic input, AII cells were not reduced in number, but they showed cellular alterations compromising their adequate function: i) a loss of mitochondria inside their lobular appendages, that may indicate an energetic failure and ii) a loss of connexin 36, suggesting alterations in the AII coupling and in visual signal transmission from the rod pathway.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dopaminergic system impairment and the affection of the rod pathway through the AII cells may explain and be partially responsible for the reduced contrast sensitivity or electroretinographic response described in PD. Also, dopamine reduction and the loss of synaptic contacts with melanopsin cells may contribute to the melanopsin retinal ganglion cell loss previously described and to the disturbances in circadian rhythm and sleep reported in PD patients. These data support the idea that the retina reproduces brain neurodegeneration and is highly involved in PD pathology.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Association of Plasma Neurofilament Light with Postoperative Delirium</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25889?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25889?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine the association of plasma neuroaxonal injury markers neurofilament light (NfL), total tau, glial fibrillary acid protein and ubiquitin carboxyl‐terminal esterase l1 and delirium, delirium severity, and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delirium case‐no delirium control (n=108) pairs were matched by age, sex, surgery type, cognition, and vascular comorbidities. Biomarkers were measured in plasma collected preoperative(PREOP), 2 days(POD2) and 30 days postoperative(PO1MO) using Simoa technology (Quanterix). The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and CAM‐S(severity) was used to measure delirium and delirium severity, respectively. Cognitive function was measured with General Cognitive Performance(GCP) scores.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delirium cases had higher NfL on POD2 and PO1MO (median matched pair difference 16.2pg/ml and 13.6pg/ml, respectively (P &amp;lt; .05)). Patients with PREOP and POD2 NfL in the highest quartile (Q4) had increased risk for incident delirium (adjusted OR= 3.7(95% CI,1.1‐12.6), and 4.6(1.2‐18.2), respectively) and experienced more severe delirium, with sum CAM‐S scores 7.8 points (95%CI,1.6, 14.0), and 9.3 points higher (95%CI, 3.2, 15.5). At PO1MO, delirium cases had continued high NFL (adjusted OR of 9.7; 95% CI,2.3,41.4), and those with Q4 NfL values showed ‐2.3 point decline on GCP score (‐2.3 points, 95% CI, ‐4.7, ‐0.9).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with highest PREOP or POD2 NfL levels were more likely to develop delirium. Elevated NfL at PO1MO was associated with delirium and greater cognitive decline. These findings suggest NfL may be useful as a predictive biomarker for delirium risk and long‐term cognitive decline, and once confirmed would provide pathophysiological evidence for neuroaxonal injury following delirium.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Regional Differences in Penetration of the Protein Stabilizer Trimethoprim (TMP) in the Rat Central Nervous System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00167</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Regulating gene expression at the protein level is becoming increasingly important for answering basic questions in neurobiology. Several techniques using destabilizing domains (DD) on transgenes, which can be activated or deactivated by specific drugs, have been developed to achieve this goal. A DD from bacterial dihydrofolate reductase bound and stabilized by trimethoprim (TMP) represents such a tool. To control transgenic protein levels in the brain, the DD-regulating drugs need to have sufficient penetration into the central nervous system (CNS). Yet, very limited information is available on TMP pharmacokinetics in the CNS following systemic injection. Here, we performed a pharmacokinetic study on the penetration of TMP into different CNS compartments in the rat. We used mass spectrometry to measure TMP concentrations in serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and tissue samples of different CNS regions upon intraperitoneal TMP injection. We show that TMP quickly (within 10 min) penetrates from serum to CSF through the blood-CSF barrier. TMP also shows quick penetration into brain tissue but concentrations were an order of magnitude lower compared to serum or CSF. TMP concentration in spinal cord was lower than in any other analyzed CNS area. Nevertheless, effective levels of TMP to stabilize DDs can be reached in the CNS with half-lives around 2 h. These data show that TMP has good and fast penetration properties into the CNS and is therefore a valuable ligand for precisely controlling protein expression in the CNS in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Machine Learning Methods for Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM) Based Label-Free Detection of Microglia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00931</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Automated computational analysis techniques utilizing machine learning have been demonstrated to be able to extract more data from different imaging modalities compared to traditional analysis techniques. One new approach is to use machine learning techniques to existing multiphoton imaging modalities to better interpret intrinsically fluorescent cellular signals to characterize different cell types. Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) is a high-resolution quantitative imaging tool that can detect metabolic cellular signatures based on the lifetime variations of intrinsically fluorescent metabolic co-factors such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [NAD(P)H]. NAD(P)H lifetime-based discrimination techniques have previously been used to develop metabolic cell signatures for diverse cell types including immune cells such as macrophages. However, FLIM could be even more effective in characterizing cell types if machine learning was used to classify cells by utilizing FLIM parameters for classification. Here, we demonstrate the potential for FLIM-based, label-free NAD(P)H imaging to distinguish different cell types using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based machine learning. For our biological use case, we used the challenge of differentiating microglia from other glia cell types in the brain. Microglia are the resident macrophages of the brain and spinal cord and play a critical role in maintaining the neural environment and responding to injury. Microglia are challenging to identify as most fluorescent labeling approaches cross-react with other immune cell types, are often insensitive to activation state, and require the use of multiple specialized antibody labels. Furthermore, the use of these extrinsic antibody labels prevents application in in vivo animal models and possible future clinical adaptations such as neurodegenerative pathologies. With the ANN-based NAD(P)H FLIM analysis approach, we found that microglia in cell culture mixed with other glial cells can be identified with more than 0.9 True Positive Rate (TPR). We also extended our approach to identify microglia in fixed brain tissue with a TPR of 0.79. In both cases the False Discovery Rate was around 30%. This method can be further extended to potentially study and better understand microglia’s role in neurodegenerative disease with improved detection accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Superoxide and Non-ionotropic Signaling in Neuronal Excitotoxicity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00861</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00861</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Excitotoxicity is classically attributed to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx through NMDA receptors (NMDAr), leading to production of nitric oxide by neuronal nitric oxide synthase and superoxide by mitochondria, which react to form highly cytotoxic peroxynitrite. More recent observations warrant revision of the classic view and help to explain some otherwise puzzling aspects of excitotoxic cell injury. Studies using pharmacological and genetic approaches show that superoxide produced by NMDAr activation originates primarily from NADPH oxidase rather than from mitochondria. As NADPH oxidase is localized to the plasma membrane, this also provides an explanation for the extracellular release of superoxide and cell-to-cell “spread” of excitotoxic injury observed in vitro and in vivo. The signaling pathway linking NMDAr to NADPH oxidase involves Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, phosphoinositol-3-kinase, and protein kinase Cζ, and interventions at any of these steps can prevent superoxide production and excitotoxic injury. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx specifically through NMDAr is normally required to induce excitotoxicity, through a mechanism presumed to involve privileged Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; access to local signaling domains. However, experiments using selective blockade of the NMDAr ion channel and artificial reconstitution of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; by other routes indicate that the special effects of NMDAr activation are attributable instead to concurrent non-ionotropic NMDAr signaling by agonist binding to NMDAr. The non-ionotropic signaling driving NADPH oxidase activation is mediated in part by phosphoinositol-3-kinase binding to the C-terminal domain of GluN2B receptor subunits. These more recently identified aspects of excitotoxicity expand our appreciation of the complexity of excitotoxic processes and suggest novel approaches for limiting neuronal injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Abnormal Serum Bilirubin/Albumin Concentrations in Dementia Patients With Aβ Deposition and the Benefit of Intravenous Albumin Infusion for Alzheimer’s Disease Treatment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00859</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00859</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Our previous study in animal models revealed that bilirubin could induce Aβ formation and deposition. Bilirubin may be important in neurodegenerative dementia with Aβ deposition. Hence, lowering the concentration of the free bilirubin capable of crossing the blood brain–barrier may benefit the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;The objectives of this study were to examine the change in the serum bilirubin and albumin concentrations of dementia patients with Aβ deposition, and to determine the effects of intravenous administration of albumin in the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Bilirubin and albumin concentrations in dementia patients with Aβ deposition were examined. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined in dopaminergic neuron-like cells MN9D treated with bilirubin in the presence of diverse concentrations of serum. Human albumin at a dose of 10 g every 2 weeks for 24 weeks was administered intravenously to AD patients to examine the effect of albumin on AD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Significantly higher indirect bilirubin (IBIL) concentrations, lower albumin concentrations, and higher ratio of IBIL to albumin (IBIL/ALB) were observed in dementia patients with Aβ deposition, including AD, dementia with Lewy bodies, and general paresis of insane. In vitro assays showed that bilirubin-induced injury in cultured dopaminergic neuron-like cells negatively depends on the concentration of serum in the culture medium. General linear model with repeated measures analysis indicated a main effect of group on the change in albumin concentrations and Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory scale (ADCS-ADL) scores, and the main effect of time and group, and group-by-time interaction on the change of Clinical Dementia Rating Scale–Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores. Analysis of the combined data of the entire 28 weeks of assessment period using the area under curve convincingly showed significantly improvements in the change of albumin concentrations, ADCS-ADL scores, and CDR-SB scores.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;IBIL and the IBIL/ALB ratio are significantly higher in dementia patients with Aβ deposition, and intravenous administration of albumin is beneficial to AD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;The intervention study was registered at http://www.chictr.org.cn (ChiCTR-IOR-17011539). Date of registration: June 1, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Racial Differences in Dietary Relations to Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer’s Disease Risk: Do We Know Enough?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00359</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00359</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The elderly population in the US is increasing and projected to be 44% minority by 2060. African Americans and Hispanics are at increased risk of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease compared to non-Hispanic whites. These conditions are associated with many other adverse health outcomes, lower quality of life, and substantial economic burden. In the past few decades, diet has been identified as an important modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease. Some studies report poor diet quality among African American and Hispanic older adult populations compared to their white counterparts. We have a limited understanding of how diet affects brain health in different racial-ethnic groups. One primary reason for our lack of knowledge is that most cohort studies are of majority non-Hispanic white participants. Moreover, those that do include minority participants do not publish their findings stratified by racial-ethnic groups, and likely have a less accurate measurement of dietary intake among minority groups. In this review, we summarize the current, albeit limited, literature on racial/ethnic differences in dietary relations to dementia outcomes. We will also discuss methodological issues in conducting nutrition studies in diverse cultures, and suggestions for future research directions. Overcoming the gaps will make it possible to make dietary recommendations for Alzheimer’s prevention that are more relevant for different racial/ethnic groups and set us on a faster track to reduce health disparities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain Network Modularity Predicts Improvements in Cognitive and Scholastic Performance in Children Involved in a Physical Activity Intervention</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00346</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00346</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Brain network modularity is a principle that quantifies the degree to which functional brain networks are divided into subnetworks. Higher modularity reflects a greater number of within-module connections and fewer connections between modules, and a highly modular brain is often interpreted as a brain that contains highly specialized brain networks with less integration between networks. Recent work in younger and older adults has demonstrated that individual differences in brain network modularity at baseline can predict improvements in performance after cognitive and physical interventions. The use of brain network modularity as a predictor of training outcomes has not yet been examined in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: In the present study, we examined the relationship between baseline brain network modularity and changes (post-intervention performance minus pre-intervention performance) in cognitive and academic performance in 8- to 9-year-old children who participated in an after-school physical activity intervention for 9 months (N = 78) as well as in children in a wait-list control group (N = 72).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In children involved in the after-school physical activity intervention, higher modularity of brain networks at baseline predicted greater improvements in cognitive performance for tasks of executive function, cognitive efficiency, and mathematics achievement. There were no associations between baseline brain network modularity and performance changes in the wait-list control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: Our study has implications for biomarkers of cognitive plasticity in children. Understanding predictors of cognitive performance and academic progress during child development may facilitate the effectiveness of interventions aimed to improve cognitive and brain health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain Processes While Struggling With Evidence Accumulation During Facial Emotion Recognition: An ERP Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00340</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00340</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is tuned to recognize emotional facial expressions in faces having a natural upright orientation. The relative contributions of featural, configural, and holistic processing to decision-making are as yet poorly understood. This study used a diffusion decision model (DDM) of decision-making to investigate the contribution of early face-sensitive processes to emotion recognition from physiognomic features (the eyes, nose, and mouth) by determining how experimental conditions tapping those processes affect early face-sensitive neuroelectric reflections (P100, N170, and P250) of processes determining evidence accumulation at the behavioral level. We first examined the effects of both stimulus orientation (upright vs. inverted) and stimulus type (photographs vs. sketches) on behavior and neuroelectric components (amplitude and latency). Then, we explored the sources of variance common to the experimental effects on event-related potentials (ERPs) and the DDM parameters. Several results suggest that the N170 indicates core visual processing for emotion recognition decision-making: (a) the additive effect of stimulus inversion and impoverishment on N170 latency; and (b) multivariate analysis suggesting that N170 neuroelectric activity must be increased to counteract the detrimental effects of face inversion on drift rate and of stimulus impoverishment on the stimulus encoding component of non-decision times. Overall, our results show that emotion recognition is still possible even with degraded stimulation, but at a neurocognitive cost, reflecting the extent to which our brain struggles to accumulate sensory evidence of a given emotion. Accordingly, we theorize that: (a) the P100 neural generator would provide a holistic frame of reference to the face percept through categorical encoding; (b) the N170 neural generator would maintain the structural cohesiveness of the subtle configural variations in facial expressions across our experimental manipulations through coordinate encoding of the facial features; and (c) building on the previous configural processing, the neurons generating the P250 would be responsible for a normalization process adapting to the facial features to match the stimulus to internal representations of emotional expressions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Excitation-inhibition (E-I) balanced neural networks are a classic model for modeling neural activities and functions in the cortex. The present study investigates the potential application of E-I balanced neural networks for fast signal detection in brain-inspired computation. We first theoretically analyze the response property of an E-I balanced network, and find that the asynchronous firing state of the network generates an optimal noise structure enabling the network to track input changes rapidly. We then extend the homogeneous connectivity of an E-I balanced neural network to include local neuronal connections, so that the network can still achieve fast response and meanwhile maintain spatial information in the face of spatially heterogeneous signal. Finally, we carry out simulations to demonstrate that our model works well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: On the Right Track to Treat Movement Disorders: Promising Therapeutic Approaches for Parkinson’s and Huntington’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Movement disorders are neurological conditions in which patients manifest a diverse range of movement impairments. Distinct structures within the basal ganglia of the brain, an area involved in movement regulation, are differentially affected for every disease. Among the most studied movement disorder conditions are Parkinson’s (PD) and Huntington’s disease (HD), in which the deregulation of the movement circuitry due to the loss of specific neuronal populations in basal ganglia is the underlying cause of motor symptoms. These symptoms are due to the loss principally of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) par compacta and the GABAergic neurons of the striatum in PD and HD, respectively. Although these diseases were described in the 19th century, no effective treatment can slow down, reverse, or stop disease progression. Available pharmacological therapies have been focused on preventing or alleviating motor symptoms to improve the quality of life of patients, but these drugs are not able to mitigate the progressive neurodegeneration. Currently, considerable therapeutic advances have been achieved seeking a more efficacious and durable therapeutic effect. Here, we will focus on the new advances of several therapeutic approaches for PD and HD, starting with the available pharmacological treatments to alleviate the motor symptoms in both diseases. Then, we describe therapeutic strategies that aim to restore specific neuronal populations or their activity. Among the discussed strategies, the use of Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) and genetic approaches to prevent the neuronal loss in these diseases will be described. We will highlight strategies that have been evaluated in both Parkinson’s and Huntington’s patients, and also the ones with strong preclinical evidence. These current therapeutic techniques represent the most promising tools for the safe treatment of both diseases, specifically those aimed to avoid neuronal loss during disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Redox Post-translational Modifications of Protein Thiols in Brain Aging and Neurodegenerative Conditions—Focus on S-Nitrosation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species (RONS) are by-products of aerobic metabolism. RONS trigger a signaling cascade that can be transduced through oxidation-reduction (redox)-based post-translational modifications (redox PTMs) of protein thiols. This redox signaling is essential for normal cellular physiology and coordinately regulates the function of redox-sensitive proteins. It plays a particularly important role in the brain, which is a major producer of RONS. Aberrant redox PTMs of protein thiols can impair protein function and are associated with several diseases. This mini review article aims to evaluate the role of redox PTMs of protein thiols, in particular S-nitrosation, in brain aging, and in neurodegenerative diseases. It also discusses the potential of using redox-based therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>To predict the tropism of human coronaviruses, we profile 28 SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus-associated receptors and factors (SCARFs) using single-cell transcriptomics across various healthy human tissues. SCARFs include cellular factors both facilitating and restricting viral entry. Intestinal goblet cells, enterocytes and kidney proximal tubule cells appear highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2, consistent with clinical data. Our analysis also predicts non-canonical entry paths for lung and brain infections.</description>

The majority of neurons in primary visual cortex respond selectively to bars of light that have a specific orientation and move in a specific direction. The spatial and temporal responses of such neurons are non-separable. How neurons accomplish that computational feat without resort to explicit time delays is unknown. We propose a novel neural mechanism whereby visual cortex computes non-separable responses by generating endogenous traveling waves of neural activity that resonate with the space-time signature of the visual stimulus. The spatiotemporal characteristics of the response are defined by the local topology of excitatory and inhibitory lateral connections in the cortex. We simulated the interaction between endogenous traveling waves and the visual stimulus using spatially distributed populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons with Wilson-Cowan dynamics and inhibitory-surround coupling. Our model reliably detected visual gratings that moved with a given speed and direction provided that we incorporated neural competition to suppress false motion signals in the opposite direction. The findings suggest that endogenous traveling waves in visual cortex can impart direction-selectivity on neural responses without resort to explicit time delays. They also suggest a functional role for motion opponency in eliminating false motion signals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rHG78oa3r3g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Tubulin dimers associate longitudinally and laterally to form metastable microtubules (MTs). MT disassembly is preceded by subtle structural changes in tubulin fueled by GTP hydrolysis. These changes render the MT lattice unstable, but it is unclear exactly how they affect lattice energetics and strain. We performed long-time atomistic simulations to interrogate the impacts of GTP hydrolysis on tubulin lattice conformation, lateral inter-dimer interactions, and (non-)local lateral coordination of dimer motions. The simulations suggest that most of the hydrolysis energy is stored in the lattice in the form of longitudinal strain. While not significantly affecting lateral bond stability, the stored elastic energy results in more strongly confined and correlated dynamics of GDP-tubulins, thereby entropically destabilizing the MT lattice.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aDbDvM1xyZA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Brain of the African wild dog. I. Anatomy, architecture, and volumetrics&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6676331a-09be-4052-8678-c1333480fd3e/cne24999-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photograph of the lateral surface of the African wild dog brain. The African wild dog has a relatively large brain, but this appears to be related to a reduction in body mass during its evolutionary history, rather than an increase in brain mass in response to a complex social environment. In this image dorsal is to the top and rostral toward the left. Scale bar = 1 cm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The African wild dog is endemic to sub‐Saharan Africa and belongs to the family Canidae which includes domestic dogs and their closest relatives (i.e., wolves, coyotes, jackals, dingoes, and foxes). The African wild dog is known for its highly social behavior, co‐ordinated pack predation, and striking vocal repertoire, but little is known about its brain and whether it differs in any significant way from that of other canids. We employed gross anatomical observation, magnetic resonance imaging, and classical neuroanatomical staining to provide a broad overview of the structure of the African wild dog brain. Our results reveal a mean brain mass of 154.08 g, with an encephalization quotient of 1.73, indicating that the African wild dog has a relatively large brain size. Analysis of the various structures that comprise their brains and their topological inter‐relationships, as well as the areas and volumes of the corpus callosum, ventricular system, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum and the gyrification index, all reveal that the African wild dog brain is, in general, similar to that of other mammals, and very similar to that of other carnivorans. While at this level of analysis we do not find any striking specializations within the brain of the African wild dog, apart from a relatively large brain size, the observations made indicate that more detailed analyses of specific neural systems, particularly those involved in sensorimotor processing, sociality or cognition, may reveal features that are either unique to this species or shared among the Canidae to the exclusion of other Carnivora.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Dendritic spine abnormalities correlate with behavioral and cognitive deficits in mouse models of Lafora disease</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Dendritic spine abnormalities correlate with behavioral and cognitive deficits in mouse models of Lafora disease&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0e3512bf-4f28-471d-8c5b-64916260f95f/cne25006-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alterations in dendritic spine morphology are known to associate with cognitive dysfunctions in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we analyzed the dendritic spine morphologies in the mouse model for Lafora disease (LD)—a fatal form of epileptic disorder associated with cognitive defects. We found a significant increase in the density, length, and reduction in the width of the dendritic spines from the postnatal period onwards. These animals also exhibited hyperactivity, reduced anxiety‐like behavior, and deficits in the spatial and nonspatial memory. Thus, dendritic spine abnormalities appear to be a primary developmental defect in the LD mouse model and may contribute to the cognitive deficits in the disease.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lafora disease (LD) is a genetic and fatal form of neurodegenerative disorder characterized by myoclonic epilepsy and cognitive deficits. LD is caused by loss‐of‐function mutations in the &lt;i&gt;EPM2A&lt;/i&gt; or the &lt;i&gt;NHLRC1&lt;/i&gt; gene. A major hallmark of LD is the presence of abnormal glycogen aggregates in neurons and other tissues. Functional studies on the genes have, therefore, mostly focused on glycogen metabolism. The physiological basis of cognitive deficits in LD is thus largely unexplored. Alterations in dendritic spine morphology are known in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. We, therefore, analyzed the dendritic spine morphologies in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal and Cortical layer V of the &lt;i&gt;Epm2a&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Nhlrc1&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice brain. We found a significant increase in the density, length, and reduction in the width of the dendritic spines in Postnatal day 21 to 12‐month‐old LD animals. Similar observations were made in the primary cultures of neurons derived from the hippocampi of the embryonic brain, suggesting that the aberrant spine phenotype could be a developmental defect in LD. We also looked at the cognitive and behavioral deficits as a possible readout of the spine abnormalities. The LD animals exhibited hyperactivity, reduced anxiety‐like behavior, and deficits in the spatial and nonspatial memory. Such abnormalities were seen in the younger (1–2 months) as well as the older (7–8 months) age groups. Taken together, our results suggest that the dendritic spine abnormalities are primary developmental defects in the LD model and these defects might underlie some of the symptoms, including cognitive deficits, in LD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Administration of 5‐bromo‐2′‐deoxyuridine interferes with neuroblast proliferation and promotes apoptotic cell death in the rat cerebellar neuroepithelium</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Administration of 5‐bromo‐2′‐deoxyuridine interferes with neuroblast proliferation and promotes apoptotic cell death in the rat cerebellar neuroepithelium&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/47d0975d-38f6-44b3-b57d-bf1a199d3946/cne25005-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study reveals that low doses of BrdU (from 25 to 75 μg/g) have no deleterious effects on the development of the rat cerebellar neuroepithelium. Our results also denote that the BrdU injection at doses ranging from 100 to 300 μg/g alters neuroblasts proliferation and induces the activation of apoptotic cellular events in the prenatal cerebellum.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current study was conducted to assess whether a single administration of 5‐bromo‐2′‐deoxyuridine (BrdU) interferes with cell proliferation and leads to the activation of apoptotic cellular events in the prenatal cerebellum. BrdU effects across a wide range of doses (25–300 μg/g b.w.) were analyzed using immunohistochemical and ultrastructural procedures. The pregnant rats were injected with BrdU at embryonic day 13, and their fetuses were sacrificed from 5 to 35 hr after exposure. The quantification of several parameters such as the density of mitotic figures, and BrdU and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)‐reactive cells showed that, in comparison with the saline injected rats, the administration of BrdU impairs the proliferative behavior of neuroepithelial cells. The above‐mentioned parameters were significantly reduced in rats injected with 100 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The reduction was more evident using 200 μg/g b.w. The most severe effects were found with 300 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The present findings also revealed that high doses of BrdU lead to the activation of apoptotic cellular events as evidenced by both terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick‐end labeling (TUNEL) assay and immunohistochemistry for active caspase‐3. In comparison with saline rats, many apoptotic cells were found in rats injected with 100 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The number of dying cells increased with 200 μg/g b.w. The most important number of apoptotic cells were observed in animals injected with 300 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. Ultrastructural studies confirmed the presence of neuroblasts at different stages of apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Heteromer formation between cannabinoid type 1 and dopamine type 2 receptors is altered by combination cannabinoid and antipsychotic treatments</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Heteromer formation between cannabinoid type 1 and dopamine type 2 receptors is altered by combination cannabinoid and antipsychotic treatments&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/591cb11c-97d3-40b6-99ce-805b289a8da2/jnr24716-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present study, we identified cannabinoid type 1 (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)/dopamine type 2 (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) heteromers in the globus pallidus of C57BL/J male mice. We found that heteromer formation was differentially influenced by a cannabinoid agonist and different antipsychotics. These CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heteromers were also functionally relevant to mouse movement and γ‐aminobutyric acid release in a neuronal cell culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cannabinoid type 1 (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor and the dopamine type 2 (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor are co‐localized on medium spiny neuron terminals in the globus pallidus where they modulate neural circuits involved in voluntary movement. Physical interactions between the two receptors have been shown to alter receptor signaling in cell culture. The objectives of the current study were to identify the presence of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heteromers in the globus pallidus of C57BL/6J male mice, define how CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heteromer levels are altered following treatment with cannabinoids and/or antipsychotics, and determine if fluctuating levels of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heteromers have functional consequences. Using &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; proximity ligation assays, we observed CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heteromers in the globus pallidus of C57BL/6J mice. The abundance of the heteromers increased following treatment with the nonselective cannabinoid receptor agonist, CP55,940. In contrast, treatment with the typical antipsychotic haloperidol reduced the number of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heteromers, whereas the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine treatment had no effect. Co‐treatment with CP55,940 and haloperidol had similar effects to haloperidol alone, whereas co‐treatment with CP55,940 and olanzapine had similar effects to CP55,940. The observed changes were found to have functional consequences as the differential effects of haloperidol and olanzapine also applied to γ‐aminobutyric acid release in ST&lt;i&gt;Hdh&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;Q7/Q7&lt;/sup&gt; cells and motor function in C57BL/6J male mice. This work highlights the clinical relevance of co‐exposure to cannabinoids and different antipsychotics over acute and prolonged time periods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modulation of cortical beta rhythm (15–30 Hz) is present during preparation for and execution of voluntary movements as well as during somatosensory stimulation. A rebound in beta synchronization is observed after the end of voluntary movements as well as after somatosensory stimulation and is believed to describe the return to baseline of sensorimotor networks. However, the contribution of efferent and afferent signals to the beta rebound remains poorly understood. Here, we applied electrical median nerve stimulation (MNS) to the right side followed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the left primary motor cortex after either 15 or 25 ms. Because the afferent volley reaches the somatosensory cortex after about 20 ms, TMS on the motor cortex was either anticipating or following the cortical arrival of the peripheral stimulus. We show modulations in different beta sub-bands and in both hemispheres, following a pattern of greater resynchronization when motor signals are paired with a peripheral one. The beta rebound in the left hemisphere (stimulated) is modulated in its lower frequency range when TMS precedes the cortical arrival of the afferent volley. In the right hemisphere (unstimulated), instead, the increase is limited to higher beta frequencies when TMS is delivered after the arrival of the afferent signal. In general, we demonstrate that the temporal integration of afferent and efferent signals plays a key role in the genesis of the beta rebound and that these signals may be carried in parallel by different beta sub-bands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: EEG-Based Emotion Classification Using a Deep Neural Network and Sparse Autoencoder</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Emotion classification based on brain–computer interface (BCI) systems is an appealing research topic. Recently, deep learning has been employed for the emotion classifications of BCI systems and compared to traditional classification methods improved results have been obtained. In this paper, a novel deep neural network is proposed for emotion classification using EEG systems, which combines the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Sparse Autoencoder (SAE), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) together. In the proposed network, the features extracted by the CNN are first sent to SAE for encoding and decoding. Then the data with reduced redundancy are used as the input features of a DNN for classification task. The public datasets of DEAP and SEED are used for testing. Experimental results show that the proposed network is more effective than conventional CNN methods on the emotion recognitions. For the DEAP dataset, the highest recognition accuracies of 89.49% and 92.86% are achieved for valence and arousal, respectively. For the SEED dataset, however, the best recognition accuracy reaches 96.77%. By combining the CNN, SAE, and DNN and training them separately, the proposed network is shown as an efficient method with a faster convergence than the conventional CNN.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Epidural Electrical Stimulation: A Review of Plasticity Mechanisms That Are Hypothesized to Underlie Enhanced Recovery From Spinal Cord Injury With Stimulation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) often results in life-long sensorimotor impairment. Spontaneous recovery from SCI is limited, as supraspinal fibers cannot spontaneously regenerate to form functional networks below the level of injury. Despite this, animal models and humans exhibit many motor behaviors indicative of recovery when electrical stimulation is applied epidurally to the dorsal aspect of the lumbar spinal cord. In 1976, epidural stimulation was introduced to alleviate spasticity in Multiple Sclerosis. Since then, epidural electrical stimulation (EES) has been demonstrated to improve voluntary mobility across the knee and/or ankle in several SCI patients, highlighting its utility in enhancing motor activation. The mechanisms that EES induces to drive these improvements in sensorimotor function remain largely unknown. In this review, we discuss several sensorimotor plasticity mechanisms that we hypothesize may enable epidural stimulation to promote recovery, including changes in local lumbar circuitry, propriospinal interneurons, and the internal model. Finally, we discuss genetic tools for afferent modulation as an emerging method to facilitate the search for the mechanisms of action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Myasthenia Gravis With Antibodies Against Muscle Specific Kinase: An Update on Clinical Features, Pathophysiology and Treatment</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Muscle Specific Kinase myasthenia gravis (MuSK-MG) is an autoimmune disease that impairs neuromuscular transmission leading to generalized muscle weakness. Compared to the more common myasthenia gravis with antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), MuSK-MG affects mainly the bulbar and respiratory muscles, with more frequent and severe myasthenic crises. Treatments are usually less effective with the need for prolonged, high doses of steroids and other immunosuppressants to control symptoms. Under physiological condition, MuSK regulates a phosphorylation cascade which is fundamental for the development and maintenance of postsynaptic AChR clusters at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Agrin, secreted by the motor nerve terminal into the synaptic cleft, binds to low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) which activates MuSK. In MuSK-MG, monovalent MuSK-IgG4 autoantibodies block MuSK-LRP4 interaction preventing MuSK activation and leading to the dispersal of AChR clusters. Lower levels of divalent MuSK IgG1, 2, and 3 antibody subclasses are also present but their contribution to the pathogenesis of the disease remains controversial. This review aims to provide a detailed update on the epidemiological and clinical features of MuSK-MG, focusing on the pathophysiological mechanisms and the latest indications regarding the efficacy and safety of different treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Ultra-Endurance Associated With Moderate Exercise in Rats Induces Cerebellar Oxidative Stress and Impairs Reactive GFAP Isoform Profile</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ultra-endurance (UE) race has been associated with brain metabolic changes, but it is still unknown which regions are vulnerable. This study investigated whether high-volume training in rodents, even under moderate intensity, can induce cerebellar oxidative and inflammatory status. Forty-five adult rats were divided into six groups according to a training period, followed or not by an exhaustion test (ET) that simulated UE: control (C), control + ET (C-ET), moderate-volume (MV) training and MV-ET, high-volume training (HV) and HV-ET. The training period was 30 (MV) and 90 (HV) min/day, 5 times/week for 3 months as a continuous running on a treadmill at a maximum velocity of 12 m/min. After 24 h, the ET was performed at 50% maximum velocities up to the animals refused to run, and then serum lactate levels were evaluated. Serum and cerebellar homogenates were obtained 24 h after ET. Serum creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and corticosterone levels were assessed. Lipid peroxidation (LP), nitric oxide (NO), Interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and GFAP proteins, reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH and GSSG) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were quantified in the cerebellum. Serum lactate concentrations were lower in MV-ET (∼20%) and HV-ET (∼40%) compared to the C-ET group. CK and corticosterone levels were increased more than ∼ twofold by HV training compared to control. ET increased CK levels in MV-ET vs. MV group (P = 0.026). HV induced higher LP levels (∼40%), but an additive effect of ET was only seen in the MV-ET group (P = 0.02). SOD activity was higher in all trained groups vs. C and C-ET (P &amp;lt; 0.05). CAT activity, however, was intensified only in the MV group (P &amp;lt; 0.02). The 50 kDa GFAP levels were enhanced in C-ET and MV-ET vs. respective controls, while 42 kDa (∼40%) and 39 kDa (∼26%) isoform levels were reduced. In the HV-ET group, the 50 KDa isoform amount was reduced ∼40–60% compared to the other groups and the 39 KDa isoform, increased sevenfold. LDH levels, GSH/GSSG ratio, and NO production were not modified. ET elevated IL-1β levels in the CT and MV groups. Data shows that cerebellar resilience to oxidative damage may be maintained under moderate-volume training, but it is reduced by UE running. High-volume training per se provoked systemic metabolic changes, cerebellar lipid peroxidation, and unbalanced enzymatic antioxidant resource. UE after high-volume training modified the GFAP isoform profile suggesting impaired astrocyte reactivity in the cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative disease based on four-repeat tauopathy pathology. Currently, this entity is not fully recognized in the context of pathogenesis or clinical examination. This review evaluates the association between neuroinflammation and microglial activation with the induction of pathological cascades that result in tauopathy pathology and the clinical manifestation of PSP. Multidimensional analysis was performed by evaluating genetic, biochemical, and neuroimaging biomarkers to determine whether neurodegeneration as an effect of neuroinflammation or neuroinflammation is a consequence of neurodegeneration in PSP. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first to investigate PSP in this context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Influence of Different EEG References on Scalp EEG Functional Network Analysis During Hand Movement Tasks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although scalp EEG functional networks have been applied to the study of motor tasks using electroencephalography (EEG), the selection of a suitable reference electrode has not been sufficiently researched. To investigate the effects of the original reference (REF-CZ), the common average reference (CAR), and the reference electrode standardization technique (REST) on scalp EEG functional network analysis during hand movement tasks, EEGs of 17 right-handed subjects performing self-paced hand movements were collected, and scalp functional networks [coherence (COH), phase-locking value (PLV), phase lag index (PLI)] with different references were constructed. Compared with the REF-CZ reference, the networks with CAR and REST references exhibited more significant increases in connectivity during the left-/right-hand movement preparation (MP) and movement execution (ME) stages. The node degree of the channel near the reference electrode was significantly reduced by the REF-CZ reference. CAR and REST both decreased this reference effect, REST more so than CAR. We confirmed that the choice of reference would affect the analysis of the functional network during hand movement tasks, and the REST reference can greatly reduce the effects of the online recording reference on the analysis of EEG connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain Activity Reveals Multiple Motor-Learning Mechanisms in a Real-World Task</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00354</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many recent studies found signatures of motor learning in neural beta oscillations (13–30 Hz), and specifically in the post-movement beta rebound (PMBR). All these studies were in controlled laboratory-tasks in which the task designed to induce the studied learning mechanism. Interestingly, these studies reported opposing dynamics of the PMBR magnitude over learning for the error-based and reward-based tasks (increase vs. decrease, respectively). Here, we explored the PMBR dynamics during real-world motor-skill-learning in a billiards task using mobile-brain-imaging. Our EEG recordings highlight the opposing dynamics of PMBR magnitudes (increase vs. decrease) between different subjects performing the same task. The groups of subjects, defined by their neural dynamics, also showed behavioral differences expected for different learning mechanisms. Our results suggest that when faced with the complexity of the real-world different subjects might use different learning mechanisms for the same complex task. We speculate that all subjects combine multi-modal mechanisms of learning, but different subjects have different predominant learning mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Awareness and Stimulus-Driven Spatial Attention as Independent Processes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00352</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00352</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;To investigate the relation between attention and awareness, we manipulated visibility/awareness and stimulus-driven attention capture among metacontrast-masked visual stimuli. By varying the time interval between target and mask, we manipulated target visibility measured as target discrimination accuracies (ACCs; Experiments 1 and 2) and as subjective awareness ratings (Experiment 3). To modulate stimulus-driven attention capture, we presented the masked target either as a color-singleton (the target stands out by its unique color among homogeneously colored non-singletons), as a non-singleton together with a distractor singleton elsewhere (an irrelevant distractor has a unique color, whereas the target is colored like the other stimuli) or without a singleton (no stimulus stands out; only in Experiment 1). As color singletons capture attention in a stimulus-driven way, we expected target visibility/discrimination performance to be best for target singletons and worst with distractor singletons. In Experiments 1 and 2, we confirmed that the masking interval and the singleton manipulation influenced ACCs in an independent way and that attention capture by the singletons, with facilitated performance in target-singleton compared to distractor-singleton conditions, was found regardless of the interval-induced (in-)visibility of the targets. In Experiment 1, we also confirmed that attention capture was the same among participants with worse and better visibility/discrimination performance. In Experiment 2, we confirmed attention capture by color singletons with better discrimination performance for probes presented at singleton position, compared to other positions. Finally, in Experiment 3, we found that attention capture by target singletons also increased target awareness and that this capture effect on subjective awareness was independent of the effect of the masking interval, too. Together, results provide new evidence that stimulus-driven attention and awareness operate independently from one another and that stimulus-driven attention capture can precede awareness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: RNA Binding Protein Motif 3 Inhibits Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation/Reoxygenation-Induced Apoptosis Through Promoting Stress Granules Formation in PC12 Cells and Rat Primary Cortical Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As a sensitive cold-shock protein, RNA binding protein motif 3 (RBM3) exhibits a neuroprotective function in the condition of brain injury. However, how RBM3 is involved in acute ischemic stroke by affecting stress granules (SGs) remains unclear. Here, we established an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model in rat primary cortical neurons and PC12 cells to explore the potential mechanism between RBM3 and SG formation in acute ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) condition. The immunofluorescence results showed that the SG formation significantly decreased in rat primary cortical neurons and PC12 cells during the reperfusion period after 6 h of OGD stimulation. The western blot results, flow cytometry analysis, and cell viability assessment showed that the RBM3 expression and ratio of cell viability significantly decreased, while the rate of apoptosis increased in PC12 cells during the reperfusion period after 6 h of OGD stimulation. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and immunofluorescence indicated that RBM3 and GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) colocalized cytoplasm of PC12 cells after 6 h of OGD stimulation when the SGs formation reached the highest level. Besides, overexpression and knockdown of the RBM3 were achieved via plasmid transfection and CRISPR-Cas9 technology, respectively. The results of overexpression and knockdown of RBM3 gene illustrated the pivotal role of RBM3 in affecting SG formation and apoptosis level in OGD-treated PC12 cells. In conclusion, RBM3 could combine with G3BP1 resulted in increasing stress granules generation in rat primary cortical neurons and PC12 cells after 6 h of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) injury, which ultimately reduced the apoptosis in OGD-induced cells. Our study may enable a new promising target for alleviating ischemia-reperfusion injury in cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Inhibition of Brd4 by JQ1 Promotes Functional Recovery From Spinal Cord Injury by Activating Autophagy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a destructive neurological disorder that is characterized by impaired sensory and motor function. Inhibition of bromodomain protein 4 (Brd4) has been shown to promote the maintenance of cell homeostasis by activating autophagy. However, the role of Brd4 inhibition in SCI and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Thus, the goal of the present study was to evaluate the effects of sustained Brd4 inhibition using the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitor JQ1 on the regulation of apoptosis, oxidative stress and autophagy in a mouse model of SCI. First, we observed that Brd4 expression at the lesion sites of mouse spinal cords increased after SCI. Treatment with JQ1 significantly decreased the expression of Brd4 and improved functional recovery for up to 28 day after SCI. In addition, JQ1-mediated inhibition of Brd4 reduced oxidative stress and inhibited the expression of apoptotic proteins to promote neural survival. Our results also revealed that JQ1 treatment activated autophagy and restored autophagic flux, while the positive effects of JQ1 were abrogated by autophagy inhibitor 3-MA intervention, indicating that autophagy plays a crucial role in therapeutic effects Brd4 induced by inhibition of the functional recovery SCI. In the mechanistic analysis, we observed that modulation of the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 pathway is involved in the activation of autophagy mediated by Brd4 inhibition. Taken together, the results of our investigation provides compelling evidence that Brd4 inhibition by JQ1 promotes functional recovery after SCI and that Brd4 may serve as a potential target for SCI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Reelin Supplementation Into the Hippocampus Rescues Abnormal Behavior in a Mouse Model of Neurodevelopmental Disorders</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the majority of schizophrenia patients, chronic atypical antipsychotic administration produces a significant reduction in or even complete remission of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. However, these drugs are not effective in improving cognitive and emotional deficits in patients with schizophrenia. Atypical antipsychotic drugs have a high affinity for the dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor, and a modest affinity for the serotonin 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor. The cognitive and emotional deficits in schizophrenia are thought to involve neural networks beyond the classical dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway, however, including serotonergic systems. For example, mutations in the RELN gene, which encodes Reelin, an extracellular matrix protein involved in neural development and synaptic plasticity, are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder. Furthermore, hippocampal Reelin levels are down-regulated in the brains of both schizophrenic patients and in rodent models of schizophrenia. In the present study, we investigated the effect of Reelin microinjection into the mouse hippocampus on behavioral phenotypes to evaluate the role of Reelin in neurodevelopmental disorders and to test a therapeutic approach that extends beyond classical monoamine targets. To model the cognitive and emotional deficits, as well as histological decreases in Reelin-positive cell numbers and hippocampal synaptoporin distribution, a synaptic vesicle protein, offspring that were prenatally exposed to maternal immune activation were used. Microinjections of recombinant Reelin protein into the hippocampus rescued impairments in object memory and anxiety-like behavior and recruited synaptoporin in the hippocampus in offspring exposed to antenatal inflammation. These results suggest that Reelin supplementation has the potential to treat cognitive and emotional impairments, as well as synaptic disturbances, in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Synaptic Organizers in Alzheimer’s Disease: A Classification Based on Amyloid-β Sensitivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00281</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00281</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic pathology is one of the major hallmarks observed from the early stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), leading to cognitive and memory impairment characteristic of AD patients. Synaptic connectivity and specificity are regulated by multiple trans-bindings between pre- and post-synaptic organizers, the complex of which exerts synaptogenic activity. Neurexins (NRXs) and Leukocyte common antigen-related receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs) are the major presynaptic organizers promoting synaptogenesis through their distinct binding to a wide array of postsynaptic organizers. Recent studies have shown that amyloid-β oligomers (AβOs), a major detrimental molecule in AD, interact with NRXs and neuroligin-1, an NRX-binding postsynaptic organizer, to cause synaptic impairment. On the other hand, LAR-RPTPs and their postsynaptic binding partners have no interaction with AβOs, and their synaptogenic activity is maintained even in the presence of AβOs. Here, we review the current evidence regarding the involvement of synaptic organizers in AD, with a focus on Aβ synaptic pathology, to propose a new classification where NRX-based and LAR-RPTP-based synaptic organizing complexes are classified into Aβ-sensitive and Aβ-insensitive synaptic organizers, respectively. We further discuss how their different Aβ sensitivity is involved in Aβ vulnerability and tolerance of synapses for exploring potential therapeutic approaches for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Protective Effects of Hydrogen Sulfide Against the ATP-Induced Meningeal Nociception</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00266</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00266</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We previously showed that extracellular ATP and hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S), a recently discovered gasotransmitter, are both triggering the nociceptive firing in trigeminal nociceptors implicated in migraine pain. ATP contributes to meningeal nociception by activating the P2X3 subunit-containing receptors whereas H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S operates mainly via TRP receptors. However, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S was also proposed as a neuroprotective and anti-nociceptive agent. This study aimed to test the effect of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S on ATP-mediated nociceptive responses in rat meningeal afferents and trigeminal neurons and on ATP-induced degranulation of dural mast cells. Electrophysiological recording of trigeminal nerve activity in meninges was supplemented by patch-clamp and calcium imaging studies of isolated trigeminal neurons. The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S donor NaHS induced a mild activation of afferents and fully suppressed the subsequent ATP-induced firing of meningeal trigeminal nerve fibers. This anti-nociceptive effect of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S was specific as an even stronger effect of capsaicin did not abolish the action of ATP. In isolated trigeminal neurons, NaHS decreased the inward currents and calcium transients evoked by activation of ATP-gated P2X3 receptors. Moreover, NaHS prevented ATP-induced P2X7 receptor-mediated degranulation of meningeal mast cells which emerged as triggers of migraine pain. Finally, NaHS decreased the concentration of extracellular ATP in the meningeal preparation. Thus, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S exerted the multiple protective actions against the nociceptive effects of ATP. These data highlight the novel pathways to reduce purinergic mechanisms of migraine with pharmacological donors or by stimulation production of endogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Secretagogin (SCGN) which acts as a calcium signaling sensor, has previously been shown to be expressed by a substantial population of cortical GABAergic neurons at mid-gestation in humans but not in mice. The present study traced SCGN expression in cortical GABAergic neurons in human fetal forebrain from earlier stages than previously studied. Multiple potential origins of SCGN-expressing neurons were identified in the caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) septum and preoptic area; these cells largely co-expressed SP8 but not the medial ganglionic eminence marker LHX6. They followed various migration routes to reach their target regions in the neocortex, insular and olfactory cortex (OC) and olfactory bulbs. A robust increase in the number of SCGN-expressing GABAergic cortical neurons was observed in the midgestational period; 58% of DLX2+ neurons expressed SCGN in the cortical wall at 19 post-conceptional weeks (PCW), a higher proportion than expressed calretinin, a marker for GABAergic neurons of LGE/CGE origin. Furthermore, although most SCGN+ neurons co-expressed calretinin in the cortical plate (CP) and deeper layers, in the marginal zone (MZ) SCGN+ and calretinin+ cells formed separate populations. In the adult mouse, it has previously been shown that in the rostral migratory stream (RMS), SCGN, annexin V (ANXA5), and matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP2) are co-expressed forming a functioning complex that exocytoses MMP2 in response to calcium. In the present study, ANXA5 showed widespread expression throughout the cortical wall, although MMP2 expression was very largely limited to the CP. We found co-expression of these proteins in some SCGN+ neurons in the subventricular zones (SVZ) suggesting a limited role for these cells in remodeling the extracellular matrix, perhaps during cell migration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background and Aim&lt;p&gt;Subjective memory complaints are common in elderly people. Nutrition plays an important role in keeping brain health, however, the evidence on dietary diversity and subjective memory status is limited. This study aimed to investigate the effect of dietary diversity score (DDS) on memory status in Chinese adults in a prospective cohort study.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Data of the China Health and Nutrition Survey was used in this study. A total of 4356 participants aged 50 years or older were enrolled in the analysis. DDS was calculated based on the dietary recall data collected in the wave of 2011. Information on self-report memory status (OK, good, or bad) and memory change in the past 12 months (stayed the same, improved, or deteriorated) were obtained from the wave of 2015. A memory score was calculated based on a subset of items of the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations of DDS with memory status and memory change, and linear regression models were carried out to estimate the association between DDS and memory score.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In the study population, the percentages of participants who thought their memory was OK, bad, and good were 43.3, 24.3, and 32.4%, respectively. There were 1.4% of participants reported memory improvement in the past 12 months and 47.2% reported memory decline. Average memory score among participants was 12.8 ± 6.1. Compared with participants who thought their memory was OK, a higher DDS was associated with self-reported good memory (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.15, 95%CI 1.07–1.24) and inversely associated with bad memory (OR 0.82, 95%CI 0.75–0.89). In subgroup analysis, however, in participants aged 65 years and above, the association between DDS and self-reported good memory was insignificant (OR 1.09, 95%CI 0.94–1.25). Compared with participants whose memory stayed the same, higher DDS was inversely associated with memory decline (OR 0.85, 95%CI 0.80–0.91). Besides, higher DDS was associated with higher memory score (β 0.74, 95%CI 0.56–0.91).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study revealed that higher DDS was associated with better memory status and was inversely associated with self-reported memory decline in Chinese adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Structural Neural Correlates of Double Decision Performance in Older Adults</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Speed of processing is a cognitive domain that encompasses the speed at which an individual can perceive a given stimulus, interpret the information, and produce a correct response. Speed of processing has been shown to decline more rapidly than other cognitive domains in an aging population, suggesting that this domain is particularly vulnerable to cognitive aging (Chee et al., 2009). However, given the heterogeneity of neuropsychological measures used to assess the domains underpinning speed of processing, a diffuse pattern of brain regions has been implicated. The current study aims to investigate the structural neural correlates of speed of processing by assessing cortical volume and speed of processing scores on the POSIT Double Decision task within a healthy older adult population (N = 186; mean age = 71.70 ± 5.32 years). T1-weighted structural images were collected via a 3T Siemens scanner. The current study shows that less cortical thickness in right temporal, posterior frontal, parietal and occipital lobe structures were significantly associated with poorer Double Decision scores. Notably, these include the lateral orbitofrontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, superior, transverse, and inferior temporal gyrus, temporal pole, insula, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, lingual gyrus, superior and inferior parietal gyrus and lateral occipital gyrus. Such findings suggest that speed of processing performance is associated with a wide array of cortical regions that provide unique contributions to performance on the Double Decision task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: A Cross-species Model of Dual-Task Walking in Young and Older Humans and Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00276</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00276</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Dual-task walking is common in daily life but becomes more difficult with aging. Little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms affecting competing cognitive demands. Translational studies with human and animal models are needed to address this gap. This pilot study investigated the feasibility of implementing a novel cross-species dual-task model in humans and rats and aimed to establish preliminary evidence that the model induces a dual-task cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Young and older humans and rats performed an object discrimination task (OD), a baseline task of typical walking (baseline), an alternation turning task on a Figure 8 walking course (Alt), and a dual-task combining object discrimination with the alternation task (AltOD). Primary behavioral assessments including walking speed and correct selections for object discrimination and turning direction. In humans, left prefrontal cortex activity was measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Human subjects generally performed well on all tasks, but the older adults exhibited a trend for a slowing of walking speed immediately before the turning decision for Alt and AltOD compared to baseline. Older adults also had heightened prefrontal activity relative to young adults for the Alt and AltOD tasks. Older rodents required more training than young rodents to learn the alternation task. When tested on AltOD with and without a 15-s delay between trials, older rodents exhibited a substantial performance deficit for the delayed version on the initial day of testing. Old rats, however, did not show a significant slowing in walking speed with increasing task demand, as was evident in the young rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: This study demonstrates the feasibility and challenges associated with implementing a cross-species dual-task model. While there was preliminary evidence of dual-task cost in both humans and rats, the magnitude of effects was small and not consistent across species. This is likely due to the relative ease of each task in humans and the walking component in rats not being sufficiently challenging. Future versions of this test should make the cognitive tasks more challenging and the motor task in rats more complex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Bridging the Gap Between Fluid Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease, Model Systems, and Patients</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of two proteins in fibrillar form: amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau. Despite decades of intensive research, we cannot yet pinpoint the exact cause of the disease or unequivocally determine the exact mechanism(s) underlying its progression. This confounds early diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, which can reveal ongoing biochemical changes in the brain, can help monitor developing AD pathology prior to clinical diagnosis. Here we review preclinical and clinical investigations of commonly used biomarkers in animals and patients with AD, which can bridge translation from model systems into the clinic. The core AD biomarkers have been found to translate well across species, whereas biomarkers of neuroinflammation translate to a lesser extent. Nevertheless, there is no absolute equivalence between biomarkers in human AD patients and those examined in preclinical models in terms of revealing key pathological hallmarks of the disease. In this review, we provide an overview of current but also novel AD biomarkers and how they relate to key constituents of the pathological cascade, highlighting confounding factors and pitfalls in interpretation, and also provide recommendations for standardized procedures during sample collection to enhance the translational validity of preclinical AD models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Clinically Precedented Protein Kinases: Rationale for Their Use in Neurodegenerative Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Kinases are an intensively studied drug target class in current pharmacological research as evidenced by the large number of kinase inhibitors being assessed in clinical trials. Kinase-targeted therapies have potential for treatment of a broad array of indications including central nervous system (CNS) disorders. In addition to the many variables which contribute to identification of a successful therapeutic molecule, drug discovery for CNS-related disorders also requires significant consideration of access to the target organ and specifically crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To date, only a small number of kinase inhibitors have been reported that are specifically designed to be BBB permeable, which nonetheless demonstrates the potential for success. This review considers the potential for kinase inhibitors in the context of unmet medical need for neurodegenerative disease. A subset of kinases that have been the focus of clinical investigations over a 10-year period have been identified and discussed individually. For each kinase target, the data underpinning the validity of each in the context of neurodegenerative disease is critically evaluated. Selected molecules for each kinase are identified with information on modality, binding site and CNS penetrance, if known. Current clinical development in neurodegenerative disease are summarized. Collectively, the review indicates that kinase targets with sufficient rationale warrant careful design approaches with an emphasis on improving brain penetrance and selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Selective neuromodulation and mutual inhibition within the CA3–CA2 system can prioritize sequences for replay</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make optimal use of previous experiences, important neural activity sequences must be prioritized during hippocampal replay. Integrating insights about the interplay between CA3 and CA2, we propose a conceptual framework that allows the two regions to control which sequences are reactivated. We suggest that neuromodulatory‐gated plasticity and mutual inhibition enable discrete assembly sequences in both regions to support each other while suppressing competing sequences. This perspective provides a coherent interpretation for a variety of seemingly disconnected functional properties of CA2 and paves the way for a more general understanding of CA2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive deficits due to spinal cord injury (SCI) have been elucidated in both animals and humans with SCI. Such disorders may cause concomitant oscillatory changes in regions of the brain involving in cognition; a subject that has not been directed mechanistically. One of the crucial oscillations, having a prominent role in cognition, particularly spatial memory, is hippocampal theta rhythm. Our research revealed that SCI could induce changes not only in the neurogenesis and apoptosis rate of the hippocampus but also in theta power as well as receptors involving in the generation of this rhythm. Herein we used 24 male Wistar rats (Sham/SCI = 12) and examined the effect of spinal cord contusion on hippocampal theta rhythm, spatial memory, and neurodegeneration. We proved that SCI eliminates hippocampus‐dependent theta power through spatial working memory, and correlates significantly with neurodegeneration and expression of receptors (NMDA, GABAA, Muscarinic1/M1), which are in turn essential in generation of theta rhythm. The immunohistochemistry analysis also demonstrated a significant decrease in DCX+ and BrdU+ cells; however, according to TUNEL assay, apoptosis is significantly higher in SCI‐induced animals. The western blotting analysis further showed a significant reduction of the abovementioned receptors in the hippocampus. We also verified that SCI impairs the spatial memory, proved by poor performance in the Y‐maze task. As well as, based on the local field potential recordings analysis, SCI decreases the power of theta rhythm. Eventually, this study demonstrated that chronic brain neurodegeneration occurs after SCI accompanied by theta rhythm and cognitive deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Locus Coeruleus and neurovascular unit: From its role in physiology to its potential role in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24718?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locus coeruleus (LC) is the main noradrenergic (NA) nucleus of the central nervous system. LC degenerates early during Alzheimer's disease (AD) and NA loss might concur to AD pathogenesis. Aside from neurons, LC terminals provide dense innervation of brain intraparenchymal arterioles/capillaries, and NA modulates astrocyte functions. The term neurovascular unit (NVU) defines the strict anatomical/functional interaction occurring between neurons, glial cells, and brain vessels. NVU plays a fundamental role in coupling the energy demand of activated brain regions with regional cerebral blood flow, it includes the blood–brain barrier (BBB), plays an active role in neuroinflammation, and participates also to the glymphatic system. NVU alteration is involved in AD pathophysiology through several mechanisms, mainly related to a relative oligoemia in activated brain regions and impairment of structural and functional BBB integrity, which contributes also to the intracerebral accumulation of insoluble amyloid. We review the existing data on the morphological features of LC‐NA innervation of the NVU, as well as its contribution to neurovascular coupling and BBB proper functioning. After introducing the main experimental data linking LC with AD, which have repeatedly shown a key role of neuroinflammation and increased amyloid plaque formation, we discuss the potential mechanisms by which the loss of NVU modulation by LC might contribute to AD pathogenesis. Surprisingly, thus far not so many studies have tested directly these mechanisms in models of AD in which LC has been lesioned experimentally. Clarifying the interaction of LC with NVU in AD pathogenesis may disclose potential therapeutic targets for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Striatal interneurons of cholinergic (ChAT+) striatal interneurons in WT and heterozygous Q175 mice at 18 months of age. The images show that striatal cholinergic interneuron abundance is comparable, but dendrites in Q175 mice are significantly fewer and shorter. These abnormalities and diverse striatal projection neuron abnormalities develop between 2 and 6 months of age in Q175 heterozygotes, indicating early effects of the HD mutation on the striatum in these mice that in many regards resemble those in human HD. Nonetheless, the pathologies do not yet involve overt striatal neuron loss even by 18 months, indicating they are less severe than even in premanifest HD.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used behavioral testing and morphological methods to detail the progression of basal ganglia neuron type‐specific pathology and the deficits stemming from them in male heterozygous Q175 mice, compared to age‐matched WT males. A rotarod deficit was not present in Q175 mice until 18 months, but increased open field turn rate (reflecting hyperkinesia) and open field anxiety were evident at 6 months. No loss of striatal neurons was seen out to 18 months, but ENK+ and DARPP32+ striatal perikarya were fewer by 6 months, due to diminished expression, with further decline by 18 months. No reduction in SP+ striatal perikarya or striatal interneurons was seen in Q175 mice at 18‐months, but cholinergic interneurons showed dendrite attenuation by 6 months. Despite reduced ENK expression in indirect pathway striatal perikarya, ENK‐immunostained terminals in globus pallidus externus (GPe) were more abundant at 6 months, and remained so out to 18 months. Similarly, SP‐immunostained terminals from striatal direct pathway neurons were more abundant in globus pallidus internus and substantia nigra at 6 months, and remained so at 18 months. FoxP2+ arkypallidal GPe neurons and subthalamic nucleus neurons were lost by 18 months but not prototypical PARV+ GPe neurons or dopaminergic nigral neurons. Our results show that striatal projection neuron abnormalities and behavioral abnormalities reflecting them develop between 2 and 6 months of age in Q175 male heterozygotes, indicating early effects of the HD mutation. The striatal pathologies resemble those in human HD, but are less severe at 18 months than even in premanifest HD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Macroscopic gray matter changes have been well documented in in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The present study examined microscopic gray matter changes in CTE by comparing the dendritic arbors of supragranular pyramidal neurons from prefrontal and occipital cortices in both control and CTE cases. CTE neurons exhibited significantly lower mean dendritic measure values than did control neurons, while also displaying considerably greater variability across measures. These changes may be a newly‐described pathological marker of CTE, and could supplement current mechanistic and functional understandings of the disease.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with repetitive head impacts. Neuropathologically, it is defined by the presence of perivascular hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates in cortical tissue (McKee et al&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;, 2016). Although many pathological and assumed clinical correlates of CTE have been well‐characterized, its effects on cortical dendritic arbors are still unknown. Here, we quantified dendrites and dendritic spines of supragranular pyramidal neurons in tissue from human frontal and occipital lobes, in 11 cases with (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 79 ± 7 years) and five cases without (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 76 ± 11 years) CTE. Tissue was stained with a modified rapid Golgi technique. Dendritic systems of 20 neurons per region in each brain (N = 640 neurons) were quantified using computer‐assisted morphometry. One key finding was that CTE neurons exhibited increased variability and distributional changes across six of the eight dendritic system measures, presumably due to ongoing degeneration and compensatory reorganization of dendritic systems. However, despite heightened variation among CTE neurons, CTE cases exhibited lower mean values than control cases in seven of the eight dendritic system measures. These dendritic alterations may represent a new pathological marker of CTE, and further examination of dendritic changes could contribute to both mechanistic and functional understandings of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/b&gt;) that expressed the vesicular glutamatergic transporter 2 (&lt;b&gt;Vglut2&lt;/b&gt;) during their lifetime according to a cell fate mapping strategy. Each dot illustrates the proportion measured from one mouse.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co‐transmission of glutamate by brain dopaminergic neurons was recently proposed as a potential factor influencing cell survival in models of Parkinson’s disease. Intriguingly, brain dopaminergic nuclei are differentially affected in Parkinson’s disease. Whether this is associated with different patterns of co‐expression of the glutamatergic phenotype along the rostro‐caudal brain axis is unknown in mammals. We hypothesized that, as in zebrafish, the glutamatergic phenotype is present preferentially in the caudal meso‐diencephalic dopaminergic nuclei. Here, we used in mice a cell fate mapping strategy based on reporter protein expression (ZsGreen) consecutive to previous expression of the &lt;i&gt;vesicular glutamate transporter 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Vglut2&lt;/i&gt;) gene, coupled with immunofluorescence experiments against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or dopamine transporter (DAT). We found three expression patterns in DA cells, organized along the rostro‐caudal brain axis. The first pattern (TH‐positive, DAT‐positive, ZsGreen‐positive) was found in A8‐A10. The second pattern (TH‐positive, DAT‐negative, ZsGreen‐positive) was found in A11. The third pattern (TH‐positive, DAT‐negative, ZsGreen‐negative) was found in A12‐A13. These patterns should help to refine the establishment of the homology of dopaminergic nuclei between vertebrate species. Our results also uncover that &lt;i&gt;Vglut2&lt;/i&gt; is expressed at some point during cell lifetime in dopaminergic nuclei known to degenerate in Parkinson's disease and largely absent from those that are preserved, suggesting that co‐expression of the glutamatergic phenotype in dopaminergic cells influences their survival in Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
