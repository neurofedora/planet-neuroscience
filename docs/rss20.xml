	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Strengthening Relationships between Neural Ideals and Receptive Fields. (arXiv:1803.03204v1 [math.AC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03204</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03204</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural codes are collections of binary vectors that represent the firing
patterns of neurons. The information given by a neural code $C$ can be
represented by its neural ideal $J_C$. In turn, the polynomials in $J_C$ can be
used to determine the relationships among the receptive fields of the neurons.
In a paper by Curto et al., three such relationships, known as the Type 1-3
relations, were linked to the neural ideal by three if-and-only-if statements.
Later, Garcia et al. discovered the Type 4-6 relations. These new relations
differed from the first three in that they were related to $J_C$ by one-way
implications. In this paper, we first show that the converses of these new
implications are false at the level of both the neural ideal $J_C$ and the
larger ideal $I(C)$ of a code. We then present modified statements of these
relations that, like the first three, can be related by if-and-only-if
statements to both $J_C$ and $I(C)$. Using the modified relations, we uncover a
new relationship involving $J_C$, $I(C)$, and the Type 1-6 relations.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Quasi-patterns produced by a Mexican Hat coupling of quasi-cycles. (arXiv:1803.02917v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02917</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A family of stochastic processes has quasi-cycle oscillations if its
otherwise-damped oscillations are sustained by noise. Such a family forms the
reaction part of a stochastic reaction-diffusion system when we insert a local
Mexican Hat-type, difference of Gaussians, coupling on a one-dimensional and on
a two-dimensional lattice. We find spatial patterns of oscillating quasi-cycles
that resemble Turing patterns, called quasi-patterns. Specific properties of
these patterns, such as local phase synchronization, can be predicted from the
parameters of the reaction and of the Mexican Hat coupling. When the damping
parameters of the reaction and diffusion parts are small and balanced, phase
synchronization vanishes but amplitude patterns persist. These results extend
our knowledge of the behaviour of coupled neural field equations and its
dependence on stochastic fluctuations.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Novel Model of Cancer-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy and the Role of TRPA1 in Pain Transduction. (arXiv:1803.02905v1 [q-bio.TO])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background. Models of cancer-induced neuropathy are designed by injecting
cancer cells near the peripheral nerves. The interference of tissue-resident
immune cells does not allow a direct contact with nerve fibres which affects
the tumor microenvironment and the invasion process. Methods. Anaplastic
tumor-1 (AT-1) cells were inoculated within the sciatic nerves (SNs) of male
Copenhagen rats. Lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and the SNs were collected
on days 3, 7, 14, and 21. SN tissues were examined for morphological changes
and DRG tissues for immunofluorescence, electrophoretic tendency, and mRNA
quantification. Hypersensitivities to cold, mechanical, and thermal stimuli
were determined. HC-030031, a selective TRPA1 antagonist, was used to treat
cold allodynia. Results. Nociception thresholds were identified on day 6.
Immunofluorescent micrographs showed overexpression of TRPA1 on days 7 and 14
and of CGRP on day 14 until day 21. Both TRPA1 and CGRP were coexpressed on the
same cells. Immunoblots exhibited an increase in TRPA1 expression on day 14.
TRPA1 mRNA underwent an increase on day 7 (normalized to 18S). Injection of
HC-030031 transiently reversed the cold allodynia. Conclusion. A novel and a
promising model of cancer-induced neuropathy was established, and the role of
TRPA1 and CGRP in pain transduction was examined.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Stoichiometric balance of protein copy numbers is measurable and functionally significant in a protein-protein interaction network for yeast endocytosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006022</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Zan2QIqtr3g/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by David O. Holland, Margaret E. Johnson&lt;/p&gt;

Stoichiometric balance, or dosage balance, implies that proteins that are subunits of obligate complexes (e.g. the ribosome) should have copy numbers expressed to match their stoichiometry in that complex. Establishing balance (or imbalance) is an important tool for inferring subunit function and assembly bottlenecks. We show here that these correlations in protein copy numbers can extend beyond complex subunits to larger protein-protein interactions networks (PPIN) involving a range of reversible binding interactions. We develop a simple method for quantifying balance in any interface-resolved PPINs based on network structure and experimentally observed protein copy numbers. By analyzing such a network for the clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) system in yeast, we found that the real protein copy numbers were significantly more balanced in relation to their binding partners compared to randomly sampled sets of yeast copy numbers. The observed balance is not perfect, highlighting both under and overexpressed proteins. We evaluate the potential cost and benefits of imbalance using two criteria. First, a potential cost to imbalance is that ‘leftover’ proteins without remaining functional partners are free to misinteract. We systematically quantify how this misinteraction cost is most dangerous for strong-binding protein interactions and for network topologies observed in biological PPINs. Second, a more direct consequence of imbalance is that the formation of specific functional complexes depends on relative copy numbers. We therefore construct simple kinetic models of two sub-networks in the CME network to assess multi-protein assembly of the ARP2/3 complex and a minimal, nine-protein clathrin-coated vesicle forming module. We find that the observed, imperfectly balanced copy numbers are less effective than balanced copy numbers in producing fast and complete multi-protein assemblies. However, we speculate that strategic imbalance in the vesicle forming module allows cells to tune where endocytosis occurs, providing sensitive control over cargo uptake via clathrin-coated vesicles.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Zan2QIqtr3g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Passive acoustic sensing has emerged as a powerful tool for quantifying anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity, especially for echolocating bat species. To better assess bat population trends there is a critical need for accurate, reliable, and open source tools that allow the detection and classification of bat calls in large collections of audio recordings. The majority of existing tools are commercial or have focused on the species classification task, neglecting the important problem of first localizing echolocation calls in audio which is particularly problematic in noisy recordings. We developed a convolutional neural network based open-source pipeline for detecting ultrasonic, full-spectrum, search-phase calls produced by echolocating bats. Our deep learning algorithms were trained on full-spectrum ultrasonic audio collected along road-transects across Europe and labelled by citizen scientists from www.batdetective.org. When compared to other existing algorithms and commercial systems, we show significantly higher detection performance of search-phase echolocation calls with our test sets. As an example application, we ran our detection pipeline on bat monitoring data collected over five years from Jersey (UK), and compared results to a widely-used commercial system. Our detection pipeline can be used for the automatic detection and monitoring of bat populations, and further facilitates their use as indicator species on a large scale. Our proposed pipeline makes only a small number of bat specific design decisions, and with appropriate training data it could be applied to detecting other species in audio. A crucial novelty of our work is showing that with careful, non-trivial, design and implementation considerations, state-of-the-art deep learning methods can be used for accurate and efficient monitoring in audio.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/R2S9Qu9T6Rk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Method for the simulation of blood platelet shape and its evolution during activation</title>

We present a simple physically based quantitative model of blood platelet shape and its evolution during agonist-induced activation. The model is based on the consideration of two major cytoskeletal elements: the marginal band of microtubules and the submembrane cortex. Mathematically, we consider the problem of minimization of surface area constrained to confine the marginal band and a certain cellular volume. For resting platelets, the marginal band appears as a peripheral ring, allowing for the analytical solution of the minimization problem. Upon activation, the marginal band coils out of plane and forms 3D convoluted structure. We show that its shape is well approximated by an overcurved circle, a mathematical concept of closed curve with constant excessive curvature. Possible mechanisms leading to such marginal band coiling are discussed, resulting in simple parametric expression for the marginal band shape during platelet activation. The excessive curvature of marginal band is a convenient state variable which tracks the progress of activation. The cell surface is determined using numerical optimization. The shapes are strictly mathematically defined by only three parameters and show good agreement with literature data. They can be utilized in simulation of platelets interaction with different physical fields, e.g. for the description of hydrodynamic and mechanical properties of platelets, leading to better understanding of platelets margination and adhesion and thrombus formation in blood flow. It would also facilitate precise characterization of platelets in clinical diagnosis, where a novel optical model is needed for the correct solution of inverse light-scattering problem.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iMp85U5tcWQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Studies using anatomical, electrophysiological, imaging and optogenetic approaches revealed that the CEA network consists of recurrent inhibitory circuits comprised of precisely connected functionally and genetically defined cell types that can select and control specific behavioral outputs [3,4,5&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;,6&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;,7–9,11,12]. While bivalent functionality of the CEA in adaptive behavior has been clearly demonstrated, we are just beginning to understand to which degree individual CEA circuit elements are functionally segregated or overlapping. Importantly, recent studies seem to suggest that optogenetic manipulations of the same, or overlapping cell populations can give rise to distinct, or sometimes even opposite, behavioral phenotypes [5&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;,6&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;,9–12]. In this review, we discuss recent progress in our understanding of how defined CEA circuits can control defensive and appetitive behaviors, and how seemingly contradictory results could point to an integrated concept of CEA function. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

The development of new concepts, such as ultrafast ultrasound, has enhanced Doppler sensitivity by orders of magnitude and has paved the way for ultrasonic functional neuroimaging. In this review, we position ultrasound in the field of neuroimaging and discuss how it complements current tools available to neurobiologists and clinicians. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Guosong   Hong, Xiao   Yang, Tao   Zhou, Charles M   Lieber&lt;br /&gt; Existing implantable neurotechnologies for understanding the brain and treating neurological diseases have intrinsic properties that have limited their capability to achieve chronically-stable brain interfaces with single-neuron spatiotemporal resolution. These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

By probing how activity patterns in different types of neurons and circuits contribute to behavior, these tools can help inform mechanistic models of brain function and explain the roles of distinct circuit elements. However, in systems where functions are distributed over large networks, interpreting causality experiments can be challenging. Here we review common assumptions underlying circuit manipulations in behaving animals and discuss the strengths and limitations of different approaches. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

To be effective, these systems must be able to simultaneously record and stimulate neural activity, a task made difficult by persistent stimulation artifacts that distort and obscure underlying biomarkers. To enable simultaneous stimulation and recording, several techniques have been proposed. These techniques involve artifact-preventing system configurations, resilient recording front-ends, and back-end signal processing for removing recorded artifacts. Co-designing and integrating these artifact cancellation techniques will be key to enabling neuromodulation systems to stimulate and record at the same time. Here, we review the state-of-the-art for these techniques and their role in achieving artifact-free neuromodulation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Microelectrode arrays based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, such as Neuropixels probes, look set to transform these methods. Neuropixels probes provide ∼1000 recording sites on an extremely narrow shank, with on-board amplification, digitization, and multiplexing. They deliver low-noise recordings from hundreds of neurons, providing a step change in the type of data available to neuroscientists. Here we discuss the opportunities afforded by these probes for large-scale electrophysiology, the challenges associated with data processing and anatomical localization, and avenues for further improvements of the technology. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

With vast cell number and diversity, mammalian nervous systems present a daunting challenge for achieving specific and comprehensive cell type access—prerequisite to circuit analysis. Genetic approaches in the mouse have relied on germline engineering to access marker-defined cell populations. Combinatorial strategies that engage marker intersection, anatomy and projection pattern (e.g. antero-grade and retro-grade viral vectors), and developmental lineage substantially increase the specificity of cell type targeting. While increasing number of mouse cell types are becoming experimentally accessible, comprehensive coverage requires larger coordinated efforts with strategic infrastructural and fiscal planning. CRISPR-based genome editing may enable cell type access in other species, but issues of time, cost and ethics remain, especially for primates. Novel approaches that bypass the germline, such as somatic cell engineering and cell surface-based gene delivery, may reduce the barrier of genetic access to mammalian cell types. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Despite extensive characterization of individual brain areas involved in parental care, we do not fully understand how discrete aspects of this behavior are orchestrated at the neural circuit level. Recent progress in identifying genetically specified neuronal populations critical for parenting, and the use of genetic and viral tools for circuit-cracking now allow us to deconstruct the underlying circuitry and, thus, to elucidate how different aspects of parental care are controlled. Here we review the latest advances, outline possible organizational principles of parental circuits and discuss future challenges. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Pre-clinical investigations implicate modulation of the cortico-basal ganglia network in these therapeutic effects, and this mechanistic understanding is necessary to optimize stimulation paradigms. Recently, the principle that neuromodulation can reverse drug-evoked synaptic plasticity and reduce behavioral symptoms of addiction has inspired novel stimulation paradigms that have long-term effects in animal models. Pre-clinical studies have also raised the possibility that tailoring neuromodulation protocols can modulate distinct symptoms of addiction. Combining mechanistic knowledge of circuit dysfunction with emerging technologies for non-invasive neuromodulation holds promise for developing therapies for addiction and related disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Designing behavioral paradigms that provide a solid foundation to ask questions about decision-making computations and mechanisms is a difficult and often underestimated challenge. Here, we propose three dimensions on which we can consider rodent decision-making tasks: ethological validity, task complexity, and stimulus-response compatibility. We review recent research through this lens, and provide practical guidance for researchers in the decision-making field. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Philipp   Gutruf, John A   Rogers&lt;br /&gt; Recently developed classes of ultraminiaturized wireless devices provide powerful capabilities in neuroscience research, as implantable light sources for simulation/inhibition via optogenetics, as integrated microfluidic systems for programmed pharmacological delivery and as multimodal sensors for physiological measurements. These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

In this review, we will discuss recent human and rodent studies showing the sex-specific involvement of the neuropeptides vasopressin and oxytocin in social and anxiety-related behaviors. We discuss that sex differences can be evident at pre-pubertal ages as seen in the sex-specific regulation of social recognition, social play, and anxiety by the vasopressin system in juvenile rats. We further discuss that the oxytocin system in humans and rodents alters brain activation, anxiety, and sociosexual motivation in sex-specific ways. Finally, we propose that knowledge of vasopressin and oxytocin mediated sex-specific brain mechanisms can provide essential insights into how these neuropeptide systems contribute to sex-specific vulnerability as well as resilience to perturbations, with subsequent relevance to social and emotional disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: April 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Paola   Cognigni, Johannes   Felsenberg, Scott   Waddell&lt;br /&gt; When animals learn, plasticity in brain networks that respond to specific cues results in a change in the behavior that these cues elicit. Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Denis   Scaini, Laura   Ballerini&lt;br /&gt; Interfacing the nervous system with devices able to efficiently record or modulate the electrical activity of neuronal cells represents the underlying foundation of future theranostic applications in neurology and of current openings in neuroscience research. These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: April 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Caitlin S   Mallory, Lisa M   Giocomo&lt;br /&gt; The discovery of place cells provided fundamental insight into the neural basis by which the hippocampus encodes spatial memories and supports navigation and prompted the development of computational models to explain the emergence of their spatial selectively. Many such works posit that input from entorhinal grid cells is critical to the formation of place fields, a prediction that has received mixed experimental support. Potentially reconciling seemingly conflicting findings is recent work indicating that subpopulations of pyramidal neurons are functionally distinct and may be driven to varying degrees by different inputs. Additionally, new studies have demonstrated that hippocampal principal neurons encode a myriad of features extending beyond current position. Here, we highlight recent evidence for how extensive heterogeneity in connectivity and genetic expression could interact with membrane biophysics to enable place cells to encode a diverse range of stimuli. These recent findings highlight the need for more computational models that integrate these heterogeneous features of hippocampal principal neurons. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: PET-guided MR Spectroscopy in Alzheimer's disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25202</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: To determine if the level of metabolites in MR Spectroscopy (MRS) is a representative marker of underlying pathological changes identified in PET images in Alzheimer's disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We performed PET-guided MRS in cases of probable AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and healthy controls (HC). All participants were imaged by &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; C-Pittsburgh Compound B (&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C-PiB) and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; F-fluorodeoxy-glucose (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG)-PET followed by 3T MRS. PET images were assessed both visually and using standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR). MRS voxels were placed in regions with maximum abnormality on amyloid (Aβ+s) and FDG (hypometabolic) areas on PET scans. Corresponding normal areas were selected in controls. The ratios of total N-acetyl group (tNA), myoinositol(mI), choline(Chol), glutamate+glutamine (Glx) over Creatine (Cr) were compared between these regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Aβ+ regions had significantly higher (p=0.02) mI/Cr and lower tNA/Cr (p=0.02), while in hypometabolic areas only tNA/Cr was reduced (p=0.003). Multiple regression analysis adjusting for sex, age and education showed mI/Cr was only associated with &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C-PiB SUVR (p&amp;lt;0.0001). tNA/Cr, however was associated with both PiB (p=0.0003) and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG SUVR (p=0.006). The level of mI/Cr was not significantly different between MCI and AD (p=0.28) but tNA/Cr showed significant decline from HC to MCI to AD (p=0.001, p=0.04).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: mI/Cr has significant temporal and spatial associations with Aβ and could be potentially considered as a disease state biomarker. tNA is an indicator of early neurodegenerative changes and might have a role as disease stage biomarker and also as a valuable surrogate marker for treatment response.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Reduced contrast sensitivity among older women is associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25196</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25196</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Several cross-sectional studies have reported an association between visual contrast sensitivity (a functional measure of low contrast vision) and poor cognitive performance or dementia, but no studies have investigated this association prospectively in a population based cohort with final adjudication of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: In a prospective, community-based study of aging women (Study of Osteoporotic Fractures), we analyzed whether visual contrast sensitivity was associated with increased risk of MCI or dementia and/or worse performance on various cognitive tests assessed 10 years later. Contrast sensitivity was assessed at baseline in each eye using a VISTECH VCTS 6500 wall chart. MCI/dementia was adjudicated by an expert panel. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Of 1,352 White (88.2%) and African-American (11.8%) women with a mean age of 77.7 years (SD 3.3), 536 (39.6%) went on to develop MCI/dementia over 10 years. MCI/Dementia risk was more than doubled (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.96) in women with the lowest quartile of contrast sensitivity compared to highest (p&amp;lt;0.0001 for the linear trend). Reduced baseline contrast sensitivity was also associated with lower performance on several cognitive measures assessed 10 years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Among older women, reduced contrast sensitivity is associated with a greater risk of MCI/dementia. These findings suggest that visual system neurodegeneration or dysfunction may parallel or precede dementia-related cortical or subcortical degeneration, and that contrast sensitivity testing may be useful in identifying aging adults at high risk for dementia.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Myelin Abnormality in CMT4J Recapitulates Features of Acquired Demyelination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25198</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25198</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4J (CMT4J) is a rare autosomal recessive neuropathy caused by mutations in &lt;em&gt;FIG4&lt;/em&gt; that result in loss of FIG4 protein. This study investigates the natural history and mechanisms of segmental demyelination in CMT4J. &lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Over the past 9 years, we have enrolled and studied a cohort of 12 CMT4J patients, including 6 novel &lt;em&gt;FIG4&lt;/em&gt; mutations. We evaluated these patients and related mouse models using morphological, electrophysiological and biochemical approaches. &lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We found sensory motor demyelinating polyneuropathy consistently in all patients. This underlying myelin pathology was associated with non-uniform slowing of conduction velocities, conduction block, and temporal dispersion on nerve conduction studies (NCS), which resemble those features in acquired demyelinating peripheral nerve diseases. Segmental demyelination was also confirmed in mice without &lt;em&gt;Fig4&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Fig4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;). The demyelination was associated with an increase of Schwann cell dedifferentiation and macrophages in spinal roots where nerve blood barriers are weak. Schwann cell dedifferentiation was induced by the increasing intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Suppression of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; level by a chelator reduced dedifferentiation and demyelination of Schwann cells &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Interestingly, cell-specific knockout of &lt;em&gt;Fig4&lt;/em&gt; in mouse Schwann cells or neurons failed to cause segmental demyelination. &lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Myelin change in CMT4J recapitulates the features of acquired demyelinating neuropathies.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Grey matter (GM) damage and meningeal inflammation have been associated with early disease onset and a more aggressive disease course in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), but can these changes be identified in the patient early in the disease course?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: To identify possible biomarkers linking meningeal inflammation, GM damage and disease severity, gene and protein expression were analysed in meninges and CSF from 27 post-mortem secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and 14 control cases. Combined cytokine/chemokine CSF profiling and 3T-MRI were performed at diagnosis in two independent cohorts of MS patients (35 and 38 subjects) and in 26 non-MS patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, TNF, IL2 and IL22) and molecules related to sustained B-cell activity and lymphoid-neogenesis (CXCL13, CXCL10, LTα, IL6, IL10) was detected in the meninges and CSF of post-mortem MS cases with high levels of meningeal inflammation and GM demyelination. Similar pro-inflammatory patterns, including increased levels of CXCL13, TNF, IFNγ, CXCL12, IL6, IL8 and IL10, together with high levels of BAFF, APRIL, LIGHT, TWEAK, sTNFR1, sCD163, MMP2 and pentraxin III, were detected in the CSF of MS patients with higher levels of GM damage at diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: A common pattern of intrathecal (meninges and CSF) inflammatory profile strongly correlates with increased cortical pathology, both at time of the diagnosis and of death. These results suggest a role for detailed CSF analysis combined with MRI, as a prognostic marker for more aggressive MS. This article is protected by copyright.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;VPS13 protein family members, VPS13A through VPS13C, have been associated with various recessive movement disorders. We describe the first disease association of rare recessive &lt;em&gt;VPS13D&lt;/em&gt; variants including a frameshift, missense and a partial duplication with a novel complex, hyperkinetic neurological disorder. The clinical features include developmental delay, a childhood onset movement disorder (chorea, dystonia or tremor) and progressive spastic ataxia or paraparesis. Characteristic brain MRI shows basal ganglia or diffuse white matter T2 hyperintensities as seen in Leigh syndrome and chorea-acanthocytosis. Muscle biopsy in one case showed mitochondrial aggregates and lipidosis, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings underline the importance of the VPS13 complex in neurological disease and a possible role in mitochondrial function. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Collateral Projections Innervate the Mammillary Bodies and Retrosplenial Cortex: A New Category of Hippocampal Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0383-17.2018?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To understand the hippocampus, it is necessary to understand the subiculum. Unlike other hippocampal subfields, the subiculum projects to almost all distal hippocampal targets, highlighting its critical importance for external networks. The present studies, in male rats and mice, reveal a new category of dorsal subiculum neurons that innervate both the mammillary bodies (MBs) and the retrosplenial cortex (RSP). These bifurcating neurons comprise almost half of the hippocampal cells that project to RSP. The termination of these numerous collateral projections was visualized within the medial mammillary nucleus and the granular RSP (area 29). These collateral projections included subiculum efferents that cross to the contralateral MBs. Within the granular RSP, the collateral projections form a particularly dense plexus in deep Layer II and Layer III. This retrosplenial termination site colocalized with markers for VGluT2 and neurotensin. While efferents from the hippocampal CA fields standardly collateralize, subiculum projections often have only one target site. Consequently, the many collateral projections involving the RSP and the MBs present a relatively unusual pattern for the subiculum, which presumably relates to how both targets have complementary roles in spatial processing. Furthermore, along with the anterior thalamic nuclei, the MBs and RSP are key members of a memory circuit, which is usually described as both starting and finishing in the hippocampus. The present findings reveal how the hippocampus simultaneously engages different parts of this circuit, so forcing an important revision of this network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Losing Control in Social Situations: How the Presence of Others Affects Neural Processes Related to Sense of Agency</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social contexts substantially influence individual behavior, but little is known about how they affect cognitive processes related to voluntary action. Previously, it has been shown that social context reduces participants’ sense of agency over the outcomes of their actions and outcome monitoring. In this fMRI study on human volunteers, we investigated the neural mechanisms by which social context alters sense of agency. Participants made costly actions to stop inflating a balloon before it burst. On &quot;social&quot; trials, another player could act in their stead, but we analyzed only trials in which the other player remained passive. We hypothesized that mentalizing processes during social trials would affect decision-making fluency and lead to a decreased sense of agency. In line with this hypothesis, we found increased activity in the bilateral temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), precuneus, and middle frontal gyrus during social trials compared with nonsocial trials. Activity in the precuneus was, in turn, negatively related to sense of agency at a single-trial level. We further found a double dissociation between TPJ and angular gyrus (AG): activity in the left AG was not sensitive to social context but was negatively related to sense of agency. In contrast, activity in the TPJ was modulated by social context but was not sensitive to sense of agency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Reliability-Weighted Integration of Audiovisual Signals Can Be Modulated by Top-down Attention</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Behaviorally, it is well established that human observers integrate signals near-optimally weighted in proportion to their reliabilities as predicted by maximum likelihood estimation. Yet, despite abundant behavioral evidence, it is unclear how the human brain accomplishes this feat. In a spatial ventriloquist paradigm, participants were presented with auditory, visual, and audiovisual signals and reported the location of the auditory or the visual signal. Combining psychophysics, multivariate functional MRI (fMRI) decoding, and models of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), we characterized the computational operations underlying audiovisual integration at distinct cortical levels. We estimated observers’ behavioral weights by fitting psychometric functions to participants’ localization responses. Likewise, we estimated the neural weights by fitting neurometric functions to spatial locations decoded from regional fMRI activation patterns. Our results demonstrate that low-level auditory and visual areas encode predominantly the spatial location of the signal component of a region’s preferred auditory (or visual) modality. By contrast, intraparietal sulcus forms spatial representations by integrating auditory and visual signals weighted by their reliabilities. Critically, the neural and behavioral weights and the variance of the spatial representations depended not only on the sensory reliabilities as predicted by the MLE model but also on participants’ modality-specific attention and report (i.e., visual vs. auditory). These results suggest that audiovisual integration is not exclusively determined by bottom-up sensory reliabilities. Instead, modality-specific attention and report can flexibly modulate how intraparietal sulcus integrates sensory signals into spatial representations to guide behavioral responses (e.g., localization and orienting).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Dopamine D2 Receptors in Dopaminergic Neurons Modulate Performance in a Reversal Learning Task in Mice</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging studies in animal models and human subjects have each revealed that relatively low striatal dopamine D2-like receptor binding potential is associated with poor impulse control and with vulnerability for addiction-related behaviors. These studies cannot, however, disambiguate the roles for various pools of D2 receptors found in the striatum (e.g., those expressed on medium spiny striato-pallidal neurons vs on dopamine-releasing nerve terminals) in these behavioral outcomes. To clarify the role of the latter pool, namely, D2 autoreceptors, we studied mice carrying a conditional DRD2 gene, with or without Cre-recombinase expressed under the transcriptional control of the dopamine transporter gene locus (autoDrd2-KO, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 19 and controls, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 21). These mice were tested for locomotor response to cocaine, and spatial reversal learning was assessed in operant conditioning chambers. As predicted, compared to control mice, autoDrd2-KO animals demonstrated heightened sensitivity to the locomotor stimulating effect of cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), confirming previous research using a similar genetic model. In the spatial reversal learning task, autoDrd2-KO mice were slower to reach a learning criterion and had difficulty sustaining a prolonged nose poke response, measurements conceptually related to impaired response inhibition. Rate of learning of the initial discrimination and latencies to collect rewards, to initiate trials and to produce a response were unaffected by genetic deletion of D2 autoreceptors, discarding possible motor and motivational factors. Together, these findings confirm the role of D2 autoreceptors in reversal learning and suggest a broader involvement in behavioral inhibition mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Sulcal Polymorphisms of the IFC and ACC Contribute to Inhibitory Control Variability in Children and Adults</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory control (IC) is a core executive function that enables humans to resist habits, temptations, or distractions. IC efficiency in childhood is a strong predictor of academic and professional success later in life. Based on analysis of the sulcal pattern, a qualitative feature of cortex anatomy determined during fetal life and stable during development, we searched for evidence that interindividual differences in IC partly trace back to prenatal processes. Using anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we analyzed the sulcal pattern of two key regions of the IC neural network, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the inferior frontal cortex (IFC), which limits the inferior frontal gyrus. We found that the sulcal pattern asymmetry of both the ACC and IFC contributes to IC (Stroop score) in children and adults: participants with asymmetrical ACC or IFC sulcal patterns had better IC efficiency than participants with symmetrical ACC or IFC sulcal patterns. Such additive effects of IFC and ACC sulcal patterns on IC efficiency suggest that distinct early neurodevelopmental mechanisms targeting different brain regions likely contribute to IC efficiency. This view shares some analogies with the &quot;common variant–small effect&quot; model in genetics, which states that frequent genetic polymorphisms have small effects but collectively account for a large portion of the variance. Similarly, each sulcal polymorphism has a small but additive effect: IFC and ACC sulcal patterns, respectively, explained 3% and 14% of the variance of the Stroop interference scores.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Order exists in the world. The intelligence process enables us to realize
that order, to some extent. We provide a high level description of intelligence
using simple definitions, basic building blocks, a conceptual framework and
general hierarchy. This perspective includes multiple levels of abstraction
occurring in space and in time. The resulting model offers simple, useful ways
to help realize the essence of intelligence.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Mean field repulsive Kuramoto models: Phase locking and spatial signs. (arXiv:1803.02647v1 [nlin.AO])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon of self-synchronization in populations of oscillatory units
appears naturally in neurosciences. However, in some situations, the formation
of a coherent state is damaging. In this article we study a repulsive
mean-field Kuramoto model that describes the time evolution of n points on the
unit circle, which are transformed into incoherent phase-locked states. It has
been recently shown that such systems can be reduced to a three-dimensional
system of ordinary differential equations, whose mathematical structure is
strongly related to hyperbolic geometry. The orbits of the Kuramoto dynamical
system are then described by a ow of M\&quot;obius transformations. We show this
underlying dynamic performs statistical inference by computing dynamically
M-estimates of scatter matrices. We also describe the limiting phase-locked
states for random initial conditions using Tyler's transformation matrix.
Moreover, we show the repulsive Kuramoto model performs dynamically not only
robust covariance matrix estimation, but also data processing: the initial
configuration of the n points is transformed by the dynamic into a limiting
phase-locked state that surprisingly equals the spatial signs from
nonparametric statistics. That makes the sign empirical covariance matrix to
equal 1 2 id2, the variance-covariance matrix of a random vector that is
uniformly distributed on the unit circle.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Automated classification methods for disease diagnosis are currently in the
limelight, especially for imaging data. Classification does not fully meet a
clinician's needs, however: in order to combine the results of multiple tests
and decide on a course of treatment, a clinician needs the likelihood of a
given health condition rather than binary classification yielded by such
methods. We illustrate how likelihoods can be derived step by step from first
principles and approximations, and how they can be assessed and selected,
illustrating our approach using fMRI data from a publicly available data set
containing schizophrenic and healthy control subjects. We start from the basic
assumption of partial exchangeability, and then the notion of sufficient
statistics and the &quot;method of translation&quot; (Edgeworth, 1898) combined with
conjugate priors. This method can be used to construct a likelihood that can be
used to compare different data-reduction algorithms. Despite the
simplifications and possibly unrealistic assumptions used to illustrate the
method, we obtain classification results comparable to previous, more realistic
studies about schizophrenia, whilst yielding likelihoods that can naturally be
combined with the results of other diagnostic tests.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Ising distribution as a latent variable model. (arXiv:1803.02598v1 [cond-mat.dis-nn])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02598</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02598</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We show that the Ising distribution can be treated as a latent variable
model, where a set of N real-valued, correlated random variables are drawn and
used to generate N binary spins independently. This allows to approximate the
Ising distribution by a simpler model where the latent variables follow a
multivariate normal distribution. The resulting approximation bears
similarities with the Thouless Anderson Palmer (TAP) solution from mean field
theory, but retains a broader range of applicability when the coupling weights
are not independently distributed. Moreover, unlike classic mean field
approaches, the approximation can be used to generate correlated spin patterns.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Psychological traumas are thought to be present in a wide range of
conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder, disorganised attachment,
personality disorders, dissociative identity disorder and psychosis. This work
presents a new psychotherapy for psychological traumas, based on a functional
model of the mind, built with elements borrowed from the fields of computer
science, artificial intelligence and neural networks. The model revolves around
the concept of hierarchical value and explains the emergence of dissociation
and splitting in response to emotional pain. The key intuition is that traumas
are caused by too strong negative emotions, which are in turn made possible by
a low-value self, which is in turn determined by low-value self-associated
ideas. The therapeutic method compiles a list of patient's traumas, identifies
for each trauma a list of low-value self-associated ideas, and provides for
each idea a list of counterexamples, to raise the self value and solve the
trauma. Since the psychotherapy proposed has not been clinically tested,
statements on its effectiveness are premature. However, since the conceptual
basis is solid and traumas are hypothesised to be present in many psychological
disorders, the potential gain may be substantial.

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/279166v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Though the fusiform is well-established as a key node in the face perception network, its role in facial expression processing remains unclear, due to competing models and discrepant findings. To help resolve this debate, we recorded from 17 subjects with intracranial electrodes implanted in face sensitive patches of the fusiform. Multivariate classification analysis showed that facial expression information is represented in fusiform activity, in the same regions that represent identity, though with a smaller effect size. Examination of the spatiotemporal dynamics revealed a functional distinction between posterior and mid-fusiform expression coding, with posterior fusiform showing an early peak of facial expression sensitivity at around 180 ms after subjects viewed a face and mid-fusiform showing a later and extended peak between 230 - 460 ms. These results support the hypothesis that the fusiform plays a role in facial expression perception and highlight a qualitative functional distinction between processing in posterior and mid-fusiform, with each contributing to temporally segregated stages of expression perception.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/279117v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Little is known about how language functional MRI (fMRI) is executed in clinical practice in spite of its widespread use. Here we comprehensively documented its execution in surgical planning in epilepsy. A questionnaire focusing on cognitive design, imaging acquisition, analysis and interpretation and practical considerations was developed. Individuals responsible for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting clinical language fMRI data at 63 epilepsy surgical programs responded. The central finding was of marked heterogeneity in all aspects of fMRI. Most programs use multiple tasks, with a fifth routinely using 2, 3, 4 or 5 tasks with a modal run duration of five minutes. Variants of over fifteen protocols are in routine use with forms of noun-verb generation, verbal fluency, and semantic decision-making used most often. Nearly all aspects of data acquisition and analysis vary markedly. Neither of the two best-validated protocols were used by more than 10% of respondents. Preprocessing steps are broadly consistent across sites, language-related blood flow is most often identified using general linear modeling (76% of respondents), and statistical thresholding typically varies by patient (79%). The software SPM is most often used. fMRI programs inconsistently include input from experts with all required skills (imaging, cognitive assessment, MR physics, statistical analysis, brain-behavior relationships). These data highlight marked gaps between the evidence supporting fMRI and its clinical application. Teams performing language fMRI may benefit from evaluating practice with reference to the best-validated protocols to date and ensuring individuals trained in all aspects of fMRI are involved to optimize patient care.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Integration and segregation in Autism Spectrum Disorders modulated by age, disease, and interaction: A graph-theoretic study of intrinsic functional connectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/278846v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/278846v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 1 in 50 children between the ages of 6 and 17 years. Brain connectivity and graph-theoretic methods have been particularly very useful in shedding light on the differences between high functioning autistic children compared to typically developing (TD) ones. However, very recent developments in network measures raise a cautionary note by highlighting gross under- and over-connectivity in ASD may be an oversimplified hypothesis. Thus the primary aim of our study is to investigate these notions in functional connectomics of ASD versus TD by subjecting the data to reproducibility experiments using two independent datasets. Further, we tested the hypothesis of alteration in network segregation and integration in the ASD subjects. We have analyzed the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) multimodal connectivity database (n=42 ASD, n=37 TD) and rs-fMRI data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) (n=187 ASD, n=176 TD) dataset. We assessed the differences in connection strength between TD and ASD subjects. We also performed graph theoretical analysis to analyze the effect of disease on various network measures. Further, using the larger ABIDE dataset, we performed two-factor ANOVA test, to study the effect of age, disease and their interaction by classifying the TD and ASD participants into two cohorts: children (9-12 years, n=73 TD and n=87 ASD) and adolescents (13-16 years, n=103 TD and n=100 ASD). In ASD, we show the existence of atypical connectivity within and between functional networks as compared to TD. We also found in ASD both hypo- and hyperconnectivity within functional networks such as the default mode network (DMN). Further, the graph-theoretic analysis showed that there is a significant effect of age and disease on modularity, clustering coefficient, and local efficiency. We also identified specific areas within the DMN, sensorimotor, visual and attention networks that are affected by age, disease and their interaction. Overall, our findings suggest that maturation, disease and their interaction are critical for unraveling the biological basis and developmental trajectory in ASD and other neuropsychiatric disorders.</description>

	<description>Taste perception is thought to involve the encoding of appetitive and aversive chemical cues in food through a limited number of sensory pathways. Through expression analysis of the complete repertoire of Drosophila Ionotropic Receptors (IRs), a sensory subfamily of ionotropic glutamate receptors, we reveal that the majority of IRs is expressed in diverse peripheral neuron populations across gustatory organs in both larvae and adults, implying numerous roles in taste-evoked behaviours. We characterise Ir56d, which labels two anatomically-distinct classes of neurons in the proboscis: one represents a subset of sugar- and fatty acid-sensing neurons, while the other responds to carbonated solutions and fatty acids. Mutational analysis shows that IR56d, together with the broadly-expressed co-receptors IR25a and IR76b, is essential for physiological activation by carbonation and fatty acids, but not sucrose. We further demonstrate that carbonation is behaviourally attractive to flies (in an IR56d-dependent manner), but in a distinct way to other appetitive stimuli. Our work provides a valuable toolkit for investigating the taste functions of IRs, defines a molecular basis of carbonation sensing, and illustrates how the gustatory system uses combinatorial expression of sensory receptors in distinct neuron types to coordinate behaviour.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The illusion of uniformity does not depend on low-level vision: evidence from sensory adaptation</title>

	<description>Visual experience appears richly detailed despite the poor resolution of the majority of the visual field, thanks to foveal-peripheral integration. The recently described Uniformity Illusion (UI), in which peripheral elements of a pattern seem to take on the properties of foveal elements, may shed light on this integration. We examined the basis of UI by generating adaptation to a pattern of Gabors suitable for producing UI on orientation. After removing the pattern, participants reported the tilt of a single peripheral Gabor. The tilt after-effect (TAE) followed the physical adapting orientation rather than the global orientation perceived under UI, even when the illusion had been reported for a long time. Conversely, a control experiment replacing illusory for physical uniformity for the same durations did produce an after-effect to the global orientation. Our results indicate that the UI is not associated with changes in sensory encoding, but likely depends on high-level processes.</description>

	<description>A core element of human working memory (WM) is the ability to perform mental operations on information that is stored in a flexible, limited capacity buffer. Given the profound importance of such WM manipulation (WM-M) abilities, there is a concerted effort aimed at developing approaches to improve them. Past research has identified neural substrates of WM-M centered in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), thereby providing a plausible and accessible target for noninvasive neuromodulatory stimulation that can be used to alter cortical excitability and potentially lead to facilitation of WM-M. In the current study, 5Hz online repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), applied over the left DLPFC, was used to test the hypothesis that active rTMS would lead to significant improvements in memory recall accuracy compared to sham stimulation, and that these effects would be most pronounced in the WM-M conditions with the highest cognitive demand (registered Clinical Trial: #NCT02767323). Participants performed a delayed response alphabetization task with three individually-titrated levels of difficulty during active and sham rTMS. Analyses revealed that active rTMS led to numerically greater accuracy relative to sham stimulation for the hardest condition; however, this effect did not survive Bonferroni correction over all task conditions. Despite the lack of robust, study-wise significant effects, when considered in isolation, the magnitude of behavioral improvement in the hardest condition was negatively correlated with parametric difficulty-related fMRI activity in the targeted brain region, suggesting that individuals with less activation benefit more from rTMS. The present findings therefore suggest evidence towards the hypothesis that active rTMS can enhance performance during difficult memory manipulation conditions; however, firm conclusions cannot be drawn given the lack of overall significant effects. These findings are discussed in the context of individualized targeting and other factors that might moderate rTMS effects.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dimensionality Reduction on Spatio-Temporal Maximum Entropy Models of Spiking Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/278606v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Maximum entropy models (MEM) have been widely used in the last 10 years to characterize the statistics of networks of spiking neurons. A major drawback of this approach is that the number of parameters used in the statistical model increases very fast with the network size, hindering its interpretation and fast computation. Here, we present a novel framework of dimensionality reduction for generalized MEM handling spatio-temporal correlations. This formalism is based on information geometry where a MEM is a point on a large-dimensional manifold. We exploit the geometrical properties of this manifold in order to find a projection on a lower dimensional space that best captures the high-order statistics. This allows us to define a quantitative criterion that we call the &quot;degree of compressibility&quot; of the neuronal code. A powerful aspect of this method is that it does not require fitting the model. Indeed, the matrix defining the metric of the manifold is computed directly via the data without parameters fitting. The method is first validated using synthetic data generated by a known statistics. We then analyze a MEM having more parameters than the underlying data statistics and show that our method detects the extra dimensions. We then test it on experimental retinal data. We record retinal ganglion cells (RGC) spiking data using multi-electrode arrays (MEA) under different visual stimuli: spontaneous activity, white noise stimulus, and natural scene. Using our method, we report a dimensionality reduction up to 50% for retinal data. As we show, this is quite a huge reduction compared to a randomly generated spike train, suggesting that the neuronal code, in these experiments, is highly compressible. This additionally shows that the dimensionality reduction depends on the stimuli statistics, supporting the idea that sensory networks adapt to stimuli statistics by modifying the level of redundancy.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Slow peak alpha frequency and corticomotor depression linked to high pain susceptibility in transition to sustained pain</title>

	<description>Mechanisms that predict an individual's susceptibility to pain, before pain is present or in the first few days following pain onset, are unknown. We utilised a clinically-relevant human transitional pain model (intramuscular injections of nerve growth factor) to examine brain mechanisms that predict pain susceptibility. Resting state EEG and corticomotor excitability measured by TMS were evaluated longitudinally in healthy individuals as pain developed and resolved over 21 days. Whereas pre-pain central peak alpha frequency (PAF) correlated with peak pain occurring 4-6 days later, altered corticomotor excitability developed several days after pain onset and showed two distinct patterns (facilitation, depression). Individuals with combined slow PAF and corticomotor depression developed more severe pain. These data provide the first evidence of the temporal profile of key brain mechanisms as pain progressively develops. PAF and corticomotor excitability could represent biomarkers for susceptibility to high pain severity and subsequently, the development of chronic pain.</description>

	<description>Humans and other animals make decisions in order to satisfy their goals. However, it remains unknown how neural circuits compute which of multiple possible goals should be pursued (e.g. when balancing hunger and thirst) and combine these signals with estimates of available reward alternatives. Here, humans undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) accumulated two distinct assets over a sequence of trials. Financial outcomes depended on the minimum cumulate of either asset, creating a need to maintain 'value homeostasis' by redressing any imbalance among the assets. BOLD signals in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) tracked the level of homeostatic imbalance among goals, whereas the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) signalled the level of homeostatic redress incurred by a choice, rather than the overall amount received. These results suggest that a network of medial frontal brain regions compute a value signal that maintains homeostatic balance among internal goals.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Flexible Learning-Free Segmentation and Reconstruction for Sparse Neuronal Circuit Tracing</title>

	<description>Imaging is a dominant strategy for data collection in neuroscience, yielding 3D stacks of images that can scale to petabytes of data for a single experiment. Machine learning-based algorithms from the computer vision domain can serve as a pair of virtual eyes that tirelessly processes these images to automatically construct more complete and realistic circuits. In practice, such algorithms are often too error-prone and computationally expensive to be immediately useful. Therefore we introduce a new fast and flexible learning-free automated method for sparse segmentation and 2D/3D reconstruction of brain micro-structures. Unlike supervised learning methods, our pipeline exploits structure-specific contextual clues and requires no extensive pre-training. This approach generalizes across different modalities and sample targets, including serially-sectioned scanning electron microscopy (sSEM) of genetically labeled and contrast enhanced processes, spectral confocal reflectance (SCoRe) microscopy, and high-energy synchrotron X-ray microtomography (CT) of large tissue volumes. Experiments on newly published and novel mouse datasets demonstrate the high biological fidelity and recall of the proposed pipeline, as well as reconstructions of sufficient quality for preliminary biological study. Compared to existing supervised methods, it is both significantly faster (up to several orders of magnitude) and produces high-quality reconstructions that are robust to noise and artifacts.</description>

	<description>The neuroscientific study of human navigation has been constrained by the prerequisite of traditional brain imaging studies that require participants to remain stationary. Such imaging approaches neglect a central component that characterizes navigation - the multisensory experience of self-movement. Navigation by active movement through space combines multisensory perception with internally generated self-motion cues. We investigated the spatial micro genesis during free ambulatory exploration of interactive sparse virtual environments using motion capture synchronized to high resolution electroencephalographic (EEG) data as well psychometric and self-report measures. In such environments, map-like allocentric representations must be constructed out of transient, egocentric first-person perspective 3-D spatial information. Considering individual differences of spatial learning ability, we studied if changes in exploration behavior coincide with spatial learning of an environment. To this end, we analyzed the quality of sketch maps (a description of spatial learning) that were produced after repeated learning trials for differently complex maze environments. We observed significant changes in active exploration behavior from the first to the last exploration of a maze: a decrease in time spent in the maze predicted an increase in subsequent sketch map quality. Furthermore, individual differences in spatial abilities as well as differences in the level of experienced immersion revealed an impact on the quality of spatial learning. Our results demonstrate the feasibility to observe behavioral changes associated with spatial learning, opening the way to the study of cortical dynamics of navigation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Altered Reward Processing in Abstinent Dependent Cannabis Users: Social Context Matters</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/278044v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Public perception of cannabis as relatively harmless, alongside claimed medical benefits, have led to moves towards its legalization. Yet, long-term consequences of cannabis dependence, and whether they differ qualitatively from other drugs, are still poorly understood. A key feature of addictive drugs is that chronic use leads to adaptations in reward processing, blunting responsivity to the substance itself and other rewarding stimuli. Against this background, the present study investigated whether cannabis dependence is associated with reductions in hedonic representations by measuring behavioral and neural responses to social reward in 23 abstinent cannabis-dependent men and 24 matched non-using controls. In an interpersonal pleasant touch fMRI paradigm, participants were led to believe they were in physical closeness of or touched (CLOSE, TOUCH) by either a male or female experimenter (MALE, FEMALE), allowing the assessment of touch- and social context-dependent (i.e. female compared to male social interaction) reward dynamics. Upon female compared to male touch, dependent cannabis users displayed a significantly attenuated increase of reward experience compared to healthy controls. Controls responded to female as compared to male interaction with increased striatal activation whereas cannabis users displayed the opposite activation pattern, with stronger alterations being associated with a higher lifetime exposure to cannabis. Neural processing of pleasant touch in dependent cannabis users remained intact. These findings demonstrate that cannabis dependence in men is linked to similar lasting neuroadaptations in striatal responsivity to hedonic stimuli as observed for other drugs of abuse. However, reward processing deficits seem to depend on the social context.</description>

	<description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by cognitive dysfunction emerging from neuropathological processes impacting on brain function. AD affects brain dynamics at the local level, such as changes in the balance of inhibitory and excitatory neuronal populations, as well as long-range changes to the global network. Individual differences in these changes as they relate to behaviour are poorly understood. Here, we use a multi-scale neurophysiological model, The Virtual Brain (TVB), based on empirical multi-modal neuroimaging data, to study how local and global dynamics correlate with individual differences in cognition. In particular, we modelled individual resting-state functional activity of 124 individuals across the behavioral spectrum from healthy aging, to amnesic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), to AD. The model parameters required to accurately simulate empirical functional brain imaging data correlated significantly with cognition, and exceeded the predictive capacity of empirical connectomes.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Study of the DiI method accuracy on the example of the afferent connections of the Habenula in P6 F1-C57Bl6 / CBA mice</title>

	<description>DiI (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3'3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate) is a lipophilic carbocyanine stain diffusing in the plasma membrane and coloring the cell as a whole. The DiI injection method is an alternative to stereotaxis in the study of the neural connections of higher vertebrates. However, despite a number of studies performed to identify the neural connections of embryos and fetuses of different animals, the question of the accuracy of the DiI method remains open. The main goal of this study is to investigate the accuracy of the DiI method by examining the afferent Habenula (Hb) connections in P6 F1-C57Bl6/CBA mice. Hb is a paired structure of the intermediate brain, consisting of two nuclei - the medial (MHb) and lateral (LHb). At P6, the main Hb tracts are already formed but not yet myelinated. To estimate the accuracy of the method, two groups of cases with different types of application on different Hb nuclei were compared: bilateral applications of several DiI crystals - group 1 (26 applications); Unilateral applications of a single crystal DiI - control group 2 (7 applications). It is known that MHb is strictly innervated by Triangular septal nuclei (TS) and Septofimbrial septal nuclei (SFi); LHb is strictly innervated by the Lateral preopteic area (LPA). Any deviation from this scheme is a false positive result. When applying the marker to different Hb nuclei in group 1, the number of successful cases without deviations was -0%; in group 2 (control) - 28.57%. Unilateral applications of a single DiI crystal are more accurate. However, there are still a number of unavoidable problems, such as the fragmentation or loss of a single DiI crystal during application and the super-strong diffusion of the marker at the application site. Given this, the overall accuracy of the DiI injection method, even in the form of a single crystal, remains low. Keywords: crystals/crystal DiI, afferent connections of the Habenula; bilateral applications; unilateral applications; P6 mice F1 - C57Bl6 / CBA.</description>

	<description>The analysis of the brain from a connectivity perspective is unveiling novel insights into brain structure and function. Discovery is, however, hindered by the prior knowledge used to make hypotheses. On the other hand, exploratory data analysis is made complex by the high dimensionality of data. Indeed, in order to assess the effect of pathological states on brain networks, neuroscientists are often required to evaluate experimental effects in case-control studies, with hundreds of thousand connections. In this paper, we propose an approach to identify the multivariate relationships in brain connections that characterise two distinct groups, hence permitting the investigators to immediately discover sub-networks that contain information about the differences between experimental groups. In particular, we are interested in data discovery related to connectomics, where the connections that characterize differences between two groups of subjects are found, rather than maximizing accuracy in classification since this does not guarantee reliable interpretation of specific differences between groups. In practice, our method exploits recent machine learning techniques employing sparsity to deal with weighted networks describing the whole-brain macro connectivity. We evaluated our technique on functional and structural connectomes from human and mice brain data. In our experiments, we automatically identified disease-relevant connections in datasets with unsupervised and anatomy driven parcellation approaches using high-dimensional datasets.</description>

	<description>In real life, behavior is influenced by dynamically changing contextual factors and is rarely limited to simple tasks and binary choices. For a meaningful interpretation of brain dynamics underlying more natural cognitive processing in active humans, ecologically valid test scenarios are essential. To understand whether brain dynamics in restricted artificial lab settings reflect the neural activity in complex natural environments, we systematically tested the event-related P300 in both settings. We developed an integrative approach comprising an initial P300-study in a highly controlled laboratory set-up and a subsequent validation within a realistic driving scenario. Using a simulated dialog with a speech-based input system, increased P300 amplitudes reflected processing of infrequent and incorrect auditory feedback events in both the laboratory setting and the real world setup. Environmental noise and movement-related activity in the car driving scenario led to higher data rejection rates but revealed no effect on signal-to-noise ratio in theta and alpha frequency band or the amplitudes of the event-related P300. Our results demonstrate the possibility to investigate cognitive functions like context updating in highly adverse driving scenarios and encourage the consideration of more realistic task settings in prospective brain imaging approaches.</description>

The surveillance of influenza activity is critical to early detection of epidemics and pandemics and the design of disease control strategies. Case reporting through a voluntary network of sentinel physicians is a commonly used method of passive surveillance for monitoring rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) worldwide. Despite its ubiquity, little attention has been given to the processes underlying the observation, collection, and spatial aggregation of sentinel surveillance data, and its subsequent effects on epidemiological understanding. We harnessed the high specificity of diagnosis codes in medical claims from a database that represented 2.5 billion visits from upwards of 120,000 United States healthcare providers each year. Among influenza seasons from 2002-2009 and the 2009 pandemic, we simulated limitations of sentinel surveillance systems such as low coverage and coarse spatial resolution, and performed Bayesian inference to probe the robustness of ecological inference and spatial prediction of disease burden. Our models suggest that a number of socio-environmental factors, in addition to local population interactions, state-specific health policies, as well as sampling effort may be responsible for the spatial patterns in U.S. sentinel ILI surveillance. In addition, we find that biases related to spatial aggregation were accentuated among areas with more heterogeneous disease risk, and sentinel systems designed with fixed reporting locations across seasons provided robust inference and prediction. With the growing availability of health-associated big data worldwide, our results suggest mechanisms for optimizing digital data streams to complement traditional surveillance in developed settings and enhance surveillance opportunities in developing countries.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/98sZCdNsIU0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Mechanisms for Adaptive Learned Avoidance of Mental Effort</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2631?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans tend to avoid mental effort. Previous studies have demonstrated this tendency using various demand-selection tasks; participants generally avoid options associated with higher cognitive demand. However, it remains unclear whether humans avoid mental effort adaptively in uncertain and nonstationary environments. If so, it also remains unclear what neural mechanisms underlie such learned avoidance and whether they remain the same regardless of cognitive-demand types. We addressed these issues by developing novel demand-selection tasks where associations between choice options and cognitive-demand levels change over time, with two variations using mental arithmetic and spatial reasoning problems (males/females: 29:4 and 18:2). Most participants showed avoidance, and their choices depended on the demand experienced on multiple preceding trials. We assumed that participants updated the expected cost of mental effort through experience, and fitted their choices by reinforcement learning models, comparing several possibilities. Model-based fMRI analyses revealed that activity in the dorsomedial and lateral frontal cortices was positively correlated with the trial-by-trial expected cost for the chosen option commonly across the different types of cognitive demand. Analyses also revealed a trend of negative correlation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. We further identified correlates of cost-prediction error at time of problem presentation or answering the problem, the latter of which partially overlapped with or were proximal to the correlates of expected cost at time of choice cue in the dorsomedial frontal cortex. These results suggest that humans adaptively learn to avoid mental effort, having neural mechanisms to represent expected cost and cost-prediction error, and the same mechanisms operate for various types of cognitive demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In daily life, humans encounter various cognitive demands and tend to avoid high-demand options. However, it remains unclear whether humans avoid mental effort adaptively under dynamically changing environments. If so, it also remains unclear what the underlying neural mechanisms are and whether they operate regardless of cognitive-demand types. To address these issues, we developed novel tasks where participants could learn to avoid high-demand options under uncertain and nonstationary environments. Through model-based fMRI analyses, we found regions whose activity was correlated with the expected mental effort cost, or cost-prediction error, regardless of demand type. These regions overlap, or are adjacent with each other, in the dorsomedial frontal cortex. This finding helps clarify the mechanisms for cognitive-demand avoidance, and provides empirical building blocks for the emerging computational theory of mental effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Overlapping Role of SCYL1 and SCYL3 in Maintaining Motor Neuron Viability</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2615?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Members of the SCY1-like (SCYL) family of protein kinases are evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed proteins characterized by an N-terminal pseudokinase domain, centrally located Huntingtin, elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, yeast kinase TOR1 repeats, and an overall disorganized C-terminal segment. In mammals, three family members encoded by genes &lt;i&gt;Scyl1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Scyl2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Scyl3&lt;/i&gt; have been described. Studies have pointed to a role for SCYL1 and SCYL2 in regulating neuronal function and viability in mice and humans, but little is known about the biological function of SCYL3. Here, we show that the biochemical and cell biological properties of SCYL3 are similar to those of SCYL1 and both proteins work in conjunction to maintain motor neuron viability. Specifically, although lack of &lt;i&gt;Scyl3&lt;/i&gt; in mice has no apparent effect on embryogenesis and postnatal life, it accelerates the onset of the motor neuron disorder caused by &lt;i&gt;Scyl1&lt;/i&gt; deficiency. Growth abnormalities, motor dysfunction, hindlimb paralysis, muscle wasting, neurogenic atrophy, motor neuron degeneration, and loss of large-caliber axons in peripheral nerves occurred at an earlier age in &lt;i&gt;Scyl1&lt;/i&gt;/S&lt;i&gt;cyl3&lt;/i&gt; double-deficient mice than in &lt;i&gt;Scyl1&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice. Disease onset also correlated with the mislocalization of TDP-43 in spinal motor neurons, suggesting that SCYL1 and SCYL3 regulate TDP-43 proteostasis. Together, our results demonstrate an overlapping role for SCYL1 and SCYL3 &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and highlight the importance the SCYL family of proteins in regulating neuronal function and survival. Only male mice were used in this study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; SCYL1 and SCYL2, members of the SCY1-like family of pseudokinases, have well established roles in neuronal function. Herein, we uncover the role of SCYL3 in maintaining motor neuron viability. Although targeted disruption of &lt;i&gt;Scyl3&lt;/i&gt; in mice had little or no effect on embryonic development and postnatal life, it accelerated disease onset associated with the loss of &lt;i&gt;Scyl1&lt;/i&gt;, a novel motor neuron disease gene in humans. &lt;i&gt;Scyl1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Scyl3&lt;/i&gt; double-deficient mice had neuronal defects characteristic of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, including TDP-43 pathology, at an earlier age than did &lt;i&gt;Scyl1&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice. Thus, we show that SCYL1 and SCYL3 play overlapping roles in maintaining motor neuronal viability &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and confirm that SCYL family members are critical regulators of neuronal function and survival.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Abstract Memory Representations in the Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex and Hippocampus Support Concept Generalization</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Memory function involves both the ability to remember details of individual experiences and the ability to link information across events to create new knowledge. Prior research has identified the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and the hippocampus as important for integrating across events in the service of generalization in episodic memory. The degree to which these memory integration mechanisms contribute to other forms of generalization, such as concept learning, is unclear. The present study used a concept-learning task in humans (both sexes) coupled with model-based fMRI to test whether VMPFC and hippocampus contribute to concept generalization, and whether they do so by maintaining specific category exemplars or abstract category representations. Two formal categorization models were fit to individual subject data: a prototype model that posits abstract category representations and an exemplar model that posits category representations based on individual category members. Latent variables from each of these models were entered into neuroimaging analyses to determine whether VMPFC and the hippocampus track prototype or exemplar information during concept generalization. Behavioral model fits indicated that almost three-quarters of the subjects relied on prototype information when making judgments about new category members. Paralleling prototype dominance in behavior, correlates of the prototype model were identified in VMPFC and the anterior hippocampus with no significant exemplar correlates. These results indicate that the VMPFC and portions of the hippocampus play a broad role in memory generalization and that they do so by representing abstract information integrated from multiple events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Whether people represent concepts as a set of individual category members or by deriving generalized concept representations abstracted across exemplars has been debated. In episodic memory, generalized memory representations have been shown to arise through integration across events supported by the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and hippocampus. The current study combined formal categorization models with fMRI data analysis to show that the VMPFC and anterior hippocampus represent abstract prototype information during concept generalization, contributing novel evidence of generalized concept representations in the brain. Results indicate that VMPFC–hippocampal memory integration mechanisms contribute to knowledge generalization across multiple cognitive domains, with the degree of abstraction of memory representations varying along the long axis of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Soluble Form of LOTUS inhibits Nogo Receptor-Mediated Signaling by Interfering with the Interaction Between Nogo Receptor Type 1 and p75 Neurotrophin Receptor</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2589?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nogo receptor type 1 (NgR1) is known to inhibit neuronal regeneration in the CNS. Previously, we have shown that lateral olfactory tract usher substance (LOTUS) interacts with NgR1 and inhibits its function by blocking its ligand binding. Therefore, LOTUS is expected to have therapeutic potential for the promotion of neuronal regeneration. However, it remains unknown whether the soluble form of LOTUS (s-LOTUS) also has an inhibitory action on NgR1 function as a candidate for therapeutic agents. Here, we show that s-LOTUS inhibits NgR1-mediated signaling by inhibiting the molecular interaction between NgR1 and its coreceptor, p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt;). In contrast to the membrane-bound form of LOTUS, s-LOTUS did not block ligand binding to NgR1. However, we identified p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; as a novel LOTUS binding partner and found that s-LOTUS suppressed the interaction between p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; and NgR1. s-LOTUS inhibited myelin-associated inhibitor (MAI)-induced RhoA activation in murine cortical neurons. Functional analyses revealed that s-LOTUS inhibited MAI-induced growth cone collapse and neurite outgrowth inhibition in chick DRG neurons. In addition, whereas olfactory bulb neurons of &lt;i&gt;lotus&lt;/i&gt;-KO mice are sensitive to MAI due to a lack of LOTUS expression, treatment with s-LOTUS inhibited MAI-induced growth cone collapse in these neurons. Finally, we observed that s-LOTUS promoted axonal regeneration in optic nerve crush injury of mice (either sex). These findings suggest that s-LOTUS inhibits NgR1-mediated signaling, possibly by interfering with the interaction between NgR1 and p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, s-LOTUS may have potential as a therapeutic agent for neuronal regeneration in the damaged CNS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Nogo receptor type 1 (NgR1) is a receptor well known to inhibit neuronal regeneration in the CNS. Because the membrane-bound form of lateral olfactory tract usher substance (LOTUS) antagonizes NgR1 through a &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-type molecular interaction between LOTUS and NgR1, the soluble form of LOTUS (s-LOTUS) is expected to be a therapeutic agent for neuronal regeneration. In our present study, we show that s-LOTUS inhibits the interaction between NgR1 and p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt;, NgR1 ligand-induced RhoA activation, growth cone collapse, and neurite outgrowth inhibition and promotes axonal regeneration. Our results indicate that s-LOTUS inhibits NgR1-mediated signaling through a &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-type molecular interaction between LOTUS and NgR1 and, therefore, s-LOTUS may have therapeutic potential for neuronal regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Induction and Relief of Curiosity Elicit Parietal and Frontal Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2579?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Curiosity is a basic biological drive, but little is known about its behavioral and neural mechanisms. We can be curious about several types of information. On the one hand, curiosity is a function of the expected value of information, serving primarily to help us maximize reward. On the other hand, curiosity can be a function of the uncertainty of information, helping us to update what we know. In the current studies, we aimed to disentangle the contribution of information uncertainty and expected value of rewards to curiosity in humans. To this end, we designed a lottery task in which uncertainty and expected value of trial outcomes were manipulated independently and examined how neural activity and behavioral measures of curiosity were modulated by these factors. Curiosity increased linearly with increased outcome uncertainty, both when curiosity was explicitly probed as well as when it was implicitly tested by people's willingness to wait. Increased expected value, however, did not strongly relate to these curiosity measures. Neuroimaging results showed greater BOLD response with increasing outcome uncertainty in parietal cortex at the time of curiosity induction. Outcome updating when curiosity was relieved resulted in an increased signal in the insula, orbitofrontal cortex, and parietal cortex. Furthermore, the insula showed a linear increase corresponding to the size of the information update. These results suggest that curiosity is monotonically related to the uncertainty about one's current world model, the induction and relief of which are associated with activity in parietal and insular cortices, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Humans are curious by nature. When you hear your phone beep, you probably feel the urge to check the message right away, even though the message itself likely does not give you a direct reward. In this study, we demonstrated that curiosity can be driven by outcome uncertainty, over and above of reward. The induction of curiosity was accompanied by increased activity in the parietal cortex, whereas the information update at the time of curiosity relief was associated with activity in insular cortex. These findings advance our understanding of the behavioral and neural constituents of curiosity, which lies at the core of human information seeking and serves to optimize the individual's current world model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Roles of Prefrontal Cortex and Mediodorsal Thalamus in Task Engagement and Behavioral Flexibility</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2569?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Behavioral tasks involving auditory cues activate inhibitory neurons within auditory cortex, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of auditory evoked response potentials (ERPs). One hypothesis is that this process, termed &quot;task engagement,&quot; may enable context-dependent behaviors. Here we set out to determine (1) whether the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a role in task engagement and (2) how task engagement relates to the context-dependent processing of auditory cues in male and female mice performing a decision-making task that can be guided by either auditory or visual cues. We found that, in addition to auditory ERP suppression, task engagement is associated with increased mPFC activity and an increase in theta band (4–7 Hz) synchronization between the mPFC and auditory cortex. Optogenetically inhibiting the mPFC eliminates the task engagement-induced auditory ERP suppression, while also preventing mice from switching between auditory and visual cue-based rules. However, mPFC inhibition, which eliminates task engagement-induced auditory ERP suppression, did not prevent mice from making decisions based on auditory cues. Furthermore, a more specific manipulation, selective disruption of mPFC outputs to the mediodorsal (MD) thalamus, is sufficient to prevent switching between auditory and visual rules but does not affect auditory ERPs. Based on these findings, we conclude that (1) the mPFC contributes to both task engagement and behavioral flexibility; (2) mPFC-MD projections are important for behavioral flexibility but not task engagement; and (3) task engagement, evidenced by the suppression of cortical responses to sensory input, is not required for sensory cue-guided decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When rodents perform choice-selection tasks based on sensory cues, neural responses to these cues are modulated compared with task-free conditions. Here we demonstrate that this phenomenon depends on the prefrontal cortex and thus represents a form of &quot;top-down&quot; regulation. However, we also show that this phenomenon is not critical for task performance, as rodents can make decisions based on specific sensory cues even when the task-dependent modulation of responses to those cues is abolished. Furthermore, disrupting one specific set of prefrontal outputs impairs rule switching but not the task-dependent modulation of sensory responses. These results show that the prefrontal cortex comprises multiple circuits that mediate dissociable functions related to behavioral flexibility and sensory processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Noise-Induced Dysregulation of Quaking RNA Binding Proteins Contributes to Auditory Nerve Demyelination and Hearing Loss</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2551?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Noise exposure causes auditory nerve (AN) degeneration and hearing deficiency, though the proximal biological consequences are not entirely understood. Most AN fibers and spiral ganglion neurons are ensheathed by myelinating glia that provide insulation and ensure rapid transmission of nerve impulses from the cochlea to the brain. Here we show that noise exposure administered to mice of either sex rapidly affects myelinating glial cells, causing molecular and cellular consequences that precede nerve degeneration. This response is characterized by demyelination, inflammation, and widespread expression changes in myelin-related genes, including the RNA splicing regulator &lt;i&gt;Quaking&lt;/i&gt; (QKI) and numerous QKI target genes. Analysis of mice deficient in QKI revealed that QKI production in cochlear glial cells is essential for proper myelination of spiral ganglion neurons and AN fibers, and for normal hearing. Our findings implicate QKI dysregulation as a critical early component in the noise response, influencing cochlear glia function that leads to AN demyelination and, ultimately, to hearing deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Auditory glia cells ensheath a majority of spiral ganglion neurons with myelin, protect auditory neurons, and allow for fast conduction of electrical impulses along the auditory nerve. Here we show that noise exposure causes glial dysfunction leading to myelin abnormality and altered expression of numerous genes in the auditory nerve, including QKI, a gene implicated in regulating myelination. Study of a conditional mouse model that specifically depleted QKI in glia showed that QKI deficiency alone was sufficient to elicit myelin-related abnormality and auditory functional declines. These results establish QKI as a key molecular target in the noise response and a causative agent in hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;GABA signaling has been implicated in neural development; however, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; genetic evidence is missing because mutant mice lacking GABA activity die prematurely. Here, we studied synapse development by ablating vesicular GABA transporter (&lt;i&gt;Vgat&lt;/i&gt;) in ErbB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons. We show that inhibitory axo–somatic synapses onto pyramidal neurons vary from one cortical layer to another; however, inhibitory synapses on axon initial segments (AISs) were similar across layers. Conversely, parvalbumin-positive (PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)/ErbB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons and PV-only interneurons receive a higher number of inhibitory synapses from PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;ErbB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons compared with ErbB4-only interneurons. &lt;i&gt;Vgat&lt;/i&gt; deletion from ErbB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons reduced axo–somatic or axo–axonic synapses from PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;ErbB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons onto excitatory neurons. This effect was associated with corresponding changes in neurotransmission. However, the &lt;i&gt;Vgat&lt;/i&gt; mutation seemed to have little effect on inhibitory synapses onto PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and/or ErbB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons. Interestingly, perineuronal nets, extracellular matrix structures implicated in maturation, survival, protection, and plasticity of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons, were increased in the cortex of ErbB4-Vgat&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. No apparent difference was observed between males and females. These results demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;Vgat&lt;/i&gt; of ErbB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons is essential for the development of inhibitory synapses onto excitatory neurons and suggest a role of GABA in circuit assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; GABA has been implicated in neural development, but &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; genetic evidence is missing because mutant mice lacking GABA die prematurely. Here, we ablated &lt;i&gt;Vgat&lt;/i&gt; in ErbB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons in an inducible manner. We provide evidence that the formation of inhibitory and excitatory synapses onto excitatory neurons requires &lt;i&gt;Vgat&lt;/i&gt; in interneurons. In particular, inhibitory axo–somatic and axo–axonic synapses are more vulnerable. Our results suggest a role of GABA in circuit assembly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Identifying the Role of Complement in Triggering Neuroinflammation after Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2519?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2519?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The complement system is implicated in promoting acute secondary injury after traumatic brain injury (TBI), but its role in chronic post-traumatic neuropathology remains unclear. Using various injury-site targeted complement inhibitors that block different complement pathways and activation products, we investigated how complement is involved in neurodegeneration and chronic neuroinflammation after TBI in a clinically relevant setting of complement inhibition. The current paradigm is that complement propagates post-TBI neuropathology predominantly through the terminal membrane attack complex (MAC), but the focus has been on acute outcomes. Following controlled cortical impact in adult male mice, we demonstrate that although inhibition of the MAC (with CR2-CD59) reduces acute deficits, inhibition of C3 activation is required to prevent chronic inflammation and ongoing neuronal loss. Activation of C3 triggered a sustained degenerative mechanism of microglial and astrocyte activation, reduced dendritic and synaptic density, and inhibited neuroblast migration several weeks after TBI. Moreover, inhibiting all complement pathways (with CR2-Crry), or only the alternative complement pathway (with CR2-fH), provided similar and significant improvements in chronic histological, cognitive, and functional recovery, indicating a key role for the alternative pathway in propagating chronic post-TBI pathology. Although we confirm a role for the MAC in acute neuronal loss after TBI, this study shows that upstream products of complement activation generated predominantly via the alternative pathway propagate chronic neuroinflammation, thus challenging the current concept that the MAC represents a therapeutic target for treating TBI. A humanized version of CR2fH has been shown to be safe and non-immunogenic in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Complement, and specifically the terminal membrane attack complex, has been implicated in secondary injury and neuronal loss after TBI. However, we demonstrate here that upstream complement activation products, generated predominantly via the alternative pathway, are responsible for propagating chronic inflammation and injury following CCI. Chronic inflammatory microgliosis is triggered by sustained complement activation after CCI, and is associated with chronic loss of neurons, dendrites and synapses, a process that continues to occur even 30 d after initial impact. Acute and injury-site targeted inhibition of the alternative pathway significantly improves chronic outcomes, and together these findings modify the conceptual paradigm for targeting the complement system to treat TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sleep Deprivation Distinctly Alters Glutamate Transporter 1 Apposition and Excitatory Transmission to Orexin and MCH Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2505?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glutamate transporter 1 (GLT1) is the main astrocytic transporter that shapes glutamatergic transmission in the brain. However, whether this transporter modulates sleep–wake regulatory neurons is unknown. Using quantitative immunohistochemical analysis, we assessed perisomatic GLT1 apposition with sleep–wake neurons in the male rat following 6 h sleep deprivation (SD) or following 6 h undisturbed conditions when animals were mostly asleep (Rest). We found that SD decreased perisomatic GLT1 apposition with wake-promoting orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus compared with Rest. Reduced GLT1 apposition was associated with tonic presynaptic inhibition of excitatory transmission to these neurons due to the activation of Group III metabotropic glutamate receptors, an effect mimicked by a GLT1 inhibitor in the Rest condition. In contrast, SD resulted in increased GLT1 apposition with sleep-promoting melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. Functionally, this decreased the postsynaptic response of MCH neurons to high-frequency synaptic activation without changing presynaptic glutamate release. The changes in GLT1 apposition with orexin and MCH neurons were reversed after 3 h of sleep opportunity following 6 h SD. These SD effects were specific to orexin and MCH neurons, as no change in GLT1 apposition was seen in basal forebrain cholinergic or parvalbumin-positive GABA neurons. Thus, within a single hypothalamic area, GLT1 differentially regulates excitatory transmission to wake- and sleep-promoting neurons depending on sleep history. These processes may constitute novel astrocyte-mediated homeostatic mechanisms controlling sleep–wake behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sleep–wake cycles are regulated by the alternate activation of sleep- and wake-promoting neurons. Whether and how astrocytes can regulate this reciprocal neuronal activity are unclear. Here we report that, within the lateral hypothalamus, where functionally opposite wake-promoting orexin neurons and sleep-promoting melanin-concentrating hormone neurons codistribute, the glutamate transporter GLT1, mainly present on astrocytes, distinctly modulates excitatory transmission in a cell-type-specific manner and according to sleep history. Specifically, GLT1 is reduced around the somata of orexin neurons while increased around melanin-concentrating hormone neurons following sleep deprivation, resulting in different forms of synaptic plasticity. Thus, astrocytes can fine-tune the excitability of functionally discrete neurons via glutamate transport, which may represent novel regulatory mechanisms for sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Bottom-Up and Top-Down Factors Differentially Influence Stimulus Representations Across Large-Scale Attentional Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2495?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2495?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual attention is thought to be supported by three large-scale frontoparietal networks: the frontoparietal control network (FPCN), the dorsal attention network (DAN), and the ventral attention network (VAN). The traditional view is that these networks support visual attention by biasing and evaluating sensory representations in visual cortical regions. However, recent evidence suggests that frontoparietal regions actively represent perceptual stimuli. Here, we assessed how perceptual stimuli are represented across large-scale frontoparietal and visual networks. Specifically, we tested whether representations of stimulus features across these networks are differentially sensitive to bottom-up and top-down factors. In a pair of pattern-based fMRI studies, male and female human subjects made perceptual decisions about face images that varied along two independent dimensions: gender and affect. Across studies, we interrupted bottom-up visual input using backward masks. Within studies, we manipulated which stimulus features were goal relevant (i.e., whether gender or affect was relevant) and task switching (i.e., whether the goal on the current trial matched the goal on the prior trial). We found that stimulus features could be reliably decoded from all four networks and, importantly, that subregions within each attentional network maintained coherent representations. Critically, the different attentional manipulations (interruption, goal relevance, and task switching) differentially influenced feature representations across networks. Whereas visual interruption had a relatively greater influence on representations in visual regions, goal relevance and task switching had a relatively greater influence on representations in frontoparietal networks. Therefore, large-scale brain networks can be dissociated according to how attention influences the feature representations that they maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Visual attention is supported by multiple frontoparietal attentional networks. However, it remains unclear how stimulus features are represented within these networks and how they are influenced by attention. Here, we assessed feature representations in four large-scale networks using a perceptual decision-making paradigm in which we manipulated top-down and bottom-up factors. We found that top-down manipulations such as goal relevance and task switching modulated feature representations in attentional networks, whereas bottom-up manipulations such as interruption of visual processing had a relatively stronger influence on feature representations in visual regions. Together, these findings indicate that attentional networks actively represent stimulus features and that representations within different large-scale networks are influenced by different forms of attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ketamine Alters Lateral Prefrontal Oscillations in a Rule-Based Working Memory Task</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Acute administration of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists in healthy humans and animals produces working memory deficits similar to those observed in schizophrenia. However, it is unclear whether they also lead to altered low-frequency (≤60 Hz) neural oscillatory activities similar to those associated with schizophrenia during working memory processes. Here, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and single-unit activity from the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) of three male rhesus macaque monkeys while they performed a rule-based prosaccade and antisaccade working memory task both before and after systemic injections of a subanesthetic dose (≤0.7 mg/kg) of ketamine. Accompanying working-memory impairment, ketamine enhanced the low-gamma-band (30–60 Hz) and dampened the beta-band (13–30 Hz) oscillatory activities in the LPFC during both delay periods and intertrial intervals. It also increased task-related alpha-band activities, likely reflecting compromised attention. Beta-band oscillations may be especially relevant to working memory processes because stronger beta power weakly but significantly predicted shorter saccadic reaction time. Also in beta band, ketamine reduced the performance-related oscillation as well as the rule information encoded in the spectral power. Ketamine also reduced rule information in the spike field phase consistency in almost all frequencies up to 60 Hz. Our findings support NMDAR antagonists in nonhuman primates as a meaningful model for altered neural oscillations and synchrony, which reflect a disorganized network underlying the working memory deficits in schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Low doses of ketamine, an NMDAR blocker, produce working memory deficits similar to those observed in schizophrenia. In the lateral prefrontal cortex, a key brain region for working memory, we found that ketamine altered neural oscillatory activities in similar ways that differentiate schizophrenic patients and healthy subjects during both task and nontask periods. Ketamine induced stronger gamma (30–60 Hz) and weaker beta (13–30 Hz) oscillations, reflecting local hyperactivity and reduced long-range communications. Furthermore, ketamine reduced performance-related oscillatory activities, as well as the rule information encoded in the oscillations and in the synchrony between single-cell activities and oscillations. The ketamine model helps link the molecular and cellular basis of neural oscillatory changes to the working memory deficit in schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Diminished Cortical Thickness Is Associated with Impulsive Choice in Adolescence</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adolescence is characterized by both maturation of brain structure and increased risk of negative outcomes from behaviors associated with impulsive decision-making. One important index of impulsive choice is delay discounting (DD), which measures the tendency to prefer smaller rewards available soon over larger rewards delivered after a delay. However, it remains largely unknown how individual differences in structural brain development may be associated with impulsive choice during adolescence. Leveraging a unique large sample of 427 human youths (208 males and 219 females) imaged as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, we examined associations between delay discounting and cortical thickness within structural covariance networks. These structural networks were derived using non-negative matrix factorization, an advanced multivariate technique for dimensionality reduction, and analyzed using generalized additive models with penalized splines to capture both linear and nonlinear developmental effects. We found that impulsive choice, as measured by greater discounting, was most strongly associated with diminished cortical thickness in structural brain networks that encompassed the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, temporal pole, and temporoparietal junction. Furthermore, structural brain networks predicted DD above and beyond cognitive performance. Together, these results suggest that reduced cortical thickness in regions known to be involved in value-based decision-making is a marker of impulsive choice during the critical period of adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Risky behaviors during adolescence, such as initiation of substance use or reckless driving, are a major source of morbidity and mortality. In this study, we present evidence from a large sample of youths that diminished cortical thickness in specific structural brain networks is associated with impulsive choice. Notably, the strongest association between impulsive choice and brain structure was seen in regions implicated in value-based decision-making; namely, the ventromedial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices. Moving forward, such neuroanatomical markers of impulsivity may aid in the development of personalized interventions targeted to reduce risk of negative outcomes resulting from impulsivity during adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Altered Signaling in the Descending Pain-modulatory System after Short-Term Infusion of the {mu}-Opioid Agonist Remifentanil</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2454?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;μ-Opioid receptor agonists are widely used within the contemporary treatment of pain, but abrupt opioid suspension, even after short-term infusion, can paradoxically increase the sensitivity to noxious stimuli, a phenomenon that has been, for example, reported after application of the fast-acting μ-opioid receptor agonist remifentanil. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the effects of discontinuation of remifentanil application on pain processing in the human CNS, we analyzed neuronal responses to thermal stimuli before and after a short-term infusion of remifentanil (30 min 0.1 μg/kg body weight/min) compared with control in the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord in drug-naive male volunteers using fMRI. Subsequent to remifentanil suspension, we observed reduced heat pain thresholds and increased neuronal responses in pain-encoding as well as in key regions of the descending pain-modulatory system, such as the periaqueductal gray matter, the nucleus cuneiformis, and the rostral ventromedial medulla. Moreover, the spinal pain-related multivoxel activity pattern showed an opioid-specific change after drug suspension. Importantly, remifentanil suspension increased the functional coupling between the nucleus cuneiformis and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, and the coupling strength between the rostral anterior cingulate cortex and the nucleus cuneiformis correlated negatively with the individual pain threshold after opioid suspension. These findings demonstrate that, already subsequent to a short-term infusion of the μ-opioid receptor agonist remifentanil, signaling in the descending pain-modulatory system is fundamentally altered and that these changes are directly related to the behavioral sensitivity to pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Opioids are widely used in modern medicine, but, in addition to their known side effects, it is increasingly recognized that opioids can also increase sensitivity to pain subsequent to their use. Using the fast-acting μ-opioid receptor agonist remifentanil and fMRI in healthy male volunteers, this study demonstrates how signaling changes occur along the entire descending pain-modulatory pathway after opioid discontinuation and how these alterations are closely linked to increased behavioral pain sensitivity. Particularly by revealing modified responses in pain-modulatory brainstem regions that have been previously demonstrated to be causally involved in acute opioid withdrawal effects in rodents, the data provide a plausible neuronal mechanism by which the increased sensitivity to pain after opioid suspension is mediated in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dynamic Flexibility in Striatal-Cortical Circuits Supports Reinforcement Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2442?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Complex learned behaviors must involve the integrated action of distributed brain circuits. Although the contributions of individual regions to learning have been extensively investigated, much less is known about how distributed brain networks orchestrate their activity over the course of learning. To address this gap, we used fMRI combined with tools from dynamic network neuroscience to obtain time-resolved descriptions of network coordination during reinforcement learning in humans. We found that learning to associate visual cues with reward involves dynamic changes in network coupling between the striatum and distributed brain regions, including visual, orbitofrontal, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 22; 13 females). Moreover, we found that this flexibility in striatal network coupling correlates with participants' learning rate and inverse temperature, two parameters derived from reinforcement learning models. Finally, we found that episodic learning, measured separately in the same participants at the same time, was related to dynamic connectivity in distinct brain networks. These results suggest that dynamic changes in striatal-centered networks provide a mechanism for information integration during reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Learning from the outcomes of actions, referred to as &lt;i&gt;reinforcement learning&lt;/i&gt;, is an essential part of life. The roles of individual brain regions in reinforcement learning have been well characterized in terms of updating values for actions or cues. Missing from this account, however, is an understanding of how different brain areas interact during learning to integrate sensory and value information. Here we characterize flexible striatal-cortical network dynamics that relate to reinforcement learning behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neurons in Primate Entorhinal Cortex Represent Gaze Position in Multiple Spatial Reference Frames</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2430?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2430?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Primates rely predominantly on vision to gather information from the environment and neurons representing visual space and gaze position are found in many brain areas. Within the medial temporal lobe, a brain region critical for memory, neurons in the entorhinal cortex of macaque monkeys exhibit spatial selectivity for gaze position. Specifically, the firing rate of single neurons reflects fixation location within a visual image (Killian et al., 2012). In the rodents, entorhinal cells such as grid cells, border cells, and head direction cells show spatial representations aligned to visual environmental features instead of the body (Hafting et al., 2005; Sargolini et al., 2006; Solstad et al., 2008; Diehl et al., 2017). However, it is not known whether similar allocentric representations exist in primate entorhinal cortex. Here, we recorded neural activity in the entorhinal cortex in two male rhesus monkeys during a naturalistic, free-viewing task. Our data reveal that a majority of entorhinal neurons represent gaze position and that simultaneously recorded neurons represent gaze position relative to distinct spatial reference frames, with some neurons aligned to the visual image and others aligned to the monkey's head position. Our results also show that entorhinal neural activity can be used to predict gaze position with a high degree of accuracy. These findings demonstrate that visuospatial representation is a fundamental property of entorhinal neurons in primates and suggest that entorhinal cortex may support relational memory and motor planning by coding attentional locus in distinct, behaviorally relevant frames of reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The entorhinal cortex, a brain area important for memory, shows striking spatial activity in rodents through grid cells, border cells, head direction cells, and nongrid spatial cells. The majority of entorhinal neurons signal the location of a rodent relative to visual environmental cues, representing the location of the animal relative to space in the world instead of the body. Recently, we found that entorhinal neurons can signal location of gaze while a monkey explores images visually. Here, we report that spatial entorhinal neurons are widespread in the monkey and these neurons are capable of showing a world-based spatial reference frame locked to the bounds of explored images. These results help connect the extensive findings in rodents to the primate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Adaptive History Biases Result from Confidence-Weighted Accumulation of past Choices</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2418?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2418?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Perceptual decision-making is biased by previous events, including the history of preceding choices: observers tend to repeat (or alternate) their judgments of the sensory environment more often than expected by chance. Computational models postulate that these so-called choice history biases result from the accumulation of internal decision signals across trials. Here, we provide psychophysical evidence for such a mechanism and its adaptive utility. Male and female human observers performed different variants of a challenging visual motion discrimination task near psychophysical threshold. In a first experiment, we decoupled categorical perceptual choices and motor responses on a trial-by-trial basis. Choice history bias was explained by previous perceptual choices, not motor responses, highlighting the importance of internal decision signals in action-independent formats. In a second experiment, observers performed the task in stimulus environments containing different levels of autocorrelation and providing no external feedback about choice correctness. Despite performing under overall high levels of uncertainty, observers adjusted both the strength and the sign of their choice history biases to these environments. When stimulus sequences were dominated by either repetitions or alternations, the individual degree of this adjustment of history bias was about as good a predictor of individual performance as individual perceptual sensitivity. The history bias adjustment scaled with two proxies for observers' confidence about their previous choices (accuracy and reaction time). Together, our results are consistent with the idea that action-independent, confidence-modulated decision variables are accumulated across choices in a flexible manner that depends on decision-makers' model of their environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Decisions based on sensory input are often influenced by the history of one's preceding choices, manifesting as a bias to systematically repeat (or alternate) choices. We here provide support for the idea that such choice history biases arise from the context-dependent accumulation of a quantity referred to as the decision variable: the variable's sign dictates the choice and its magnitude the confidence about choice correctness. We show that choices are accumulated in an action-independent format and a context-dependent manner, weighted by the confidence about their correctness. This confidence-weighted accumulation of choices enables decision-makers to flexibly adjust their behavior to different sensory environments. The bias adjustment can be as important for optimizing performance as one's sensitivity to the momentary sensory input.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Inhibition of a Descending Prefrontal Circuit Prevents Ketamine-Induced Stress Resilience in Females</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Stress is a potent etiological factor in the onset of major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Therefore, significant efforts have been made to identify factors that produce resilience to the outcomes of a later stressor, in hopes of preventing untoward clinical outcomes. The NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine has recently emerged as a prophylactic capable of preventing neurochemical and behavioral outcomes of a future stressor. Despite promising results of preclinical studies performed in male rats, the effects of proactive ketamine in female rats remains unknown. This is alarming given that stress-related disorders affect females at nearly twice the rate of males. Here we explore the prophylactic effects of ketamine on stress-induced anxiety-like behavior and the neural circuit-level processes that mediate these effects in female rats. Ketamine given one week prior to an uncontrollable stressor (inescapable tailshock; IS) reduced typical stress-induced activation of the serotonergic (5-HT) dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and eliminated DRN-dependent juvenile social exploration (JSE) deficits 24 h after the stressor. Proactive ketamine altered prelimbic cortex (PL) neural ensembles so that a later experience with IS now activated these cells, which it ordinarily would not. Ketamine acutely activated a PL to DRN (PL-DRN) circuit and inhibition of this circuit with Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) at the time of IS one week later prevented stress prophylaxis, suggesting that persistent changes in PL-DRN circuit activity are responsible, at least in part, for mediating long-term effects associated with ketamine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: miR-214-3p Targets β-Catenin to Regulate Depressive-like Behaviors Induced by Chronic Social Defeat Stress in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy047</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;β-Catenin has been implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD), which is associated with synaptic plasticity and dendritic arborization. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNAs containing about 22 nucleotides and involved in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological process, but their roles in MDD remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the expression and function of miRNAs in the mouse model of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). The regulation of β-catenin by selected miRNA was validated by silico prediction, target gene luciferase reporter assay, and transfection experiment in neurons. We demonstrated that the levels of miR-214-3p, which targets β-catenin transcripts were significantly increased in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of CSDS mice. Antagomir-214-3p, a neutralizing inhibitor of miR-214-3p, increased the levels of β-catenin and reversed the depressive-like behavior in CSDS mice. Meanwhile, antagomir-214-3p increased the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) and the number of dendritic spines in mPFC of CSDS mice, which may be related to the elevated expression of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;cldn1&lt;/span&gt;. Furthermore, intranasal administered antagomir-214-3p also significantly increased the level of β-catenin and reversed the depressive-like behaviors in CSDS mice. These results may represent a new therapeutic target for MDD.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) has become a major functional magnetic resonance imaging method to study network organization of human brains. There has been recent interest in the temporal fluctuations of FC calculated using short time windows (“dynamic FC”) because this method could provide information inaccessible with conventional “static” FC, which is typically calculated using the entire scan lasting several tens of minutes. Although multiple studies have revealed considerable temporal fluctuations in FC, it is still unclear whether the fluctuations of FC measured in hemodynamics reflect the dynamics of underlying neural activity. We addressed this question using simultaneous imaging of neuronal calcium and hemodynamic signals in mice and found coordinated temporal dynamics of calcium FC and hemodynamic FC measured in the same short time windows. Moreover, we found that variation in transient neuronal coactivation patterns was significantly related to temporal fluctuations of sliding window FC in hemodynamics. Finally, we show that the observed dynamics of FC cannot be fully accounted for by simulated data assuming stationary FC. These results provide evidence for the neuronal origin of dynamic FC and further suggest that information relevant to FC is condensed in temporally sparse events that can be extracted using a small number of time points.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule 2 (NCAM2)-Induced c-Src-Dependent Propagation of Submembrane Ca2+ Spikes Along Dendrites Inhibits Synapse Maturation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy041</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2) is encoded by a gene on chromosome 21 in humans. NCAM2 accumulates in synapses, but its role in regulation of synapse formation remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that an increase in NCAM2 levels results in increased instability of dendritic protrusions and reduced conversion of protrusions to dendritic spines in mouse cortical neurons. NCAM2 overexpression induces an increase in the frequency of submembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes localized in individual dendritic protrusions and promotes propagation of submembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes over segments of dendrites or the whole dendritic tree. NCAM2-dependent submembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes are L-type voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel-dependent, and their propagation but not initiation depends on the c-Src protein tyrosine kinase. Inhibition of initiation or propagation of NCAM2-dependent submembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes reduces the NCAM2-dependent instability of dendritic protrusions. Synaptic boutons formed on dendrites of neurons with elevated NCAM2 expression are enriched in the protein marker of immature synapses GAP43, and the number of boutons with mature activity-dependent synaptic vesicle recycling is reduced. Our results indicate that synapse maturation is inhibited in NCAM2-overexpressing neurons and suggest that changes in NCAM2 levels and altered submembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics can cause defects in synapse maturation in Down syndrome and other brain disorders associated with abnormal NCAM2 expression.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Non-perceptual Regions in the Left Inferior Parietal Lobe Support Phonological Short-term Memory: Evidence for a Buffer Account?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy037</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy037/4924349?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Buffer versus embedded processes accounts of short-term memory (STM) for phonological information were addressed by testing subjects’ perception and memory for speech and non-speech auditory stimuli. Univariate and multivariate (MVPA) approaches were used to assess whether brain regions recruited in recognizing speech were involved in maintaining speech representations over a delay. As expected, a left superior temporal region was found to support speech perception. However, contrary to the embedded processes approach, this region failed to show a load effect, or any sustained activation, during a maintenance delay. Moreover, MVPA decoding during the maintenance stage was unsuccessful in this region by a perception classifier or an encoding classifier. In contrast, the left supramarginal gyrus showed both sustained activation and a load effect. Using MVPA, stimulus decoding was successful during the delay period. In addition, a functional connectivity analysis showed that, as memory load increased, the left temporal lobe involved in perception became more strongly connected with the parietal region involved in maintenance. Taken together, the findings provide greater support for a buffer than embedded processes account of phonological STM.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Toward Leveraging Human Connectomic Data in Large Consortia: Generalizability of fMRI-Based Brain Graphs Across Sites, Sessions, and Paradigms</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;While graph theoretical modeling has dramatically advanced our understanding of complex brain systems, the feasibility of aggregating connectomic data in large imaging consortia remains unclear. Here, using a battery of cognitive, emotional and resting fMRI paradigms, we investigated the generalizability of functional connectomic measures across sites and sessions. Our results revealed overall fair to excellent reliability for a majority of measures during both rest and tasks, in particular for those quantifying connectivity strength, network segregation and network integration. Processing schemes such as node definition and global signal regression (GSR) significantly affected resulting reliability, with higher reliability detected for the Power atlas (vs. AAL atlas) and data without GSR. While network diagnostics for default-mode and sensori-motor systems were consistently reliable independently of paradigm, those for higher-order cognitive systems were reliable predominantly when challenged by task. In addition, based on our present sample and after accounting for observed reliability, satisfactory statistical power can be achieved in multisite research with sample size of approximately 250 when the effect size is moderate or larger. Our findings provide empirical evidence for the generalizability of brain functional graphs in large consortia, and encourage the aggregation of connectomic measures using multisite and multisession data.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>RNA localization to neuronal dendrites is critical step for long-lasting synaptic potentiation, but there is little consensus regarding which RNAs are localized and the role of alternative isoforms in localization. Using independent RNA-sequencing from soma and dendrites of the same neuron, we deeply profiled the sub-cellular transcriptomes to assess the extent and variability of dendritic RNA localization in individual hippocampal neurons, including an assessment of differential localization of alternative 3'UTR isoforms. We identified 2,225 dendritic RNAs, including 298 cases of 3'UTR isoform-specific localization. We extensively analyzed the localized RNAs for potential localization motifs, finding that B1 and B2 SINE elements are up to 5.7 times more abundant in localized RNA 3'UTRs than non-localized, and also functionally characterized the localized RNAs using protein structure analysis. Finally, we integrate our list of localized RNAs with the literature to provide a comprehensive list of known dendritically localized RNAs as a resource.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A Deep Predictive Coding Network for Learning Latent Representations</title>

	<description>It has been argued that the brain is a prediction machine that continuously learns how to make better predictions about the stimuli received from the external environment. It builds a model of the world around us and uses this model to infer the external stimulus. Predictive coding has been proposed as a mechanism through which the brain might be able to build such a model of the external environment. However, it is not clear how predictive coding can be used to build deep neural network models of the brain while complying with the architectural constraints imposed by the brain. In this paper, we describe an algorithm to build a deep generative model using predictive coding that can be used to infer latent representations about the stimuli received from external environment. Specifically, we used predictive coding to train a deep neural network on real-world images in a unsupervised learning paradigm. To understand the capacity of the network with regards to modeling the external environment, we studied the latent representations generated by the model on images of objects that are never presented to the model during training. Despite the novel features of these objects the model is able to infer the latent representations for them. Furthermore, the reconstructions of the original images obtained from these latent representations preserve the important details of these objects.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Binaural fusion involves weak interaural suppression</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/278192v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The brain combines sounds from the two ears, but what is the algorithm used to achieve this fusion of signals? Here we take a model-driven approach to interpret both psychophysical increment detection thresholds and steady-state electrophysiology (EEG) data to reveal the architecture of binaural combination for amplitude modulated tones. Increment thresholds followed a 'dipper' shaped function of pedestal modulation depth, and were consistently lower for binaural than monaural presentation. The EEG responses were greater for binaural than monaural presentation, and when a modulated masker was presented to one ear, it produced only weak suppression of the signal presented to the other ear. Both data sets were well-fit by a computational model originally derived for visual signal combination, but with suppression between the two channels (ears) being much weaker than in binocular vision. We suggest that the distinct ecological constraints on vision and hearing can explain this difference, if it is assumed that the brain avoids over-representing sensory signals originating from a single object. These findings position our understanding of binaural summation in a broader context of work on sensory signal combination in the brain, and delineate the similarities and differences between vision and hearing.</description>

	<description>The ability for cut tissues to join and form a chimeric organism is a remarkable property of many plants; however, grafting is poorly characterized at the molecular level. To better understand this process, we monitored genome-wide gene expression changes in grafted Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyls. We observed a sequential activation of...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/MA5p3Xi6JYo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Circadian disruption as a result of shift work is associated with adverse metabolic consequences. Internal desynchrony between the phase of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and peripheral clocks is widely believed to be a major factor contributing to these adverse consequences, but this hypothesis has never been tested directly.

	<description>Subtype-selective antagonists for muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have long been elusive, owing to the highly conserved orthosteric binding site. However, allosteric sites of these receptors are less conserved, motivating the search for allosteric ligands that modulate agonists or antagonists to confer subtype selectivity. Accordingly, a 4.6 million-molecule library was docked...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/YtSjfyun2Mg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Could Interaction with Social Robots Facilitate Joint Attention of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder?. (arXiv:1803.01325v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This research addressed whether interactions with social robots could
facilitate joint attention of the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Two
conditions of initiators, namely 'Human' vs. 'Robot' were measured with 15
children with ASD and 15 age-matched typically developing (TD) children. Apart
from fixation and gaze transition, a new longest common subsequence (LCS)
approach was proposed to analyze eye-movement traces. Results revealed that
children with ASD showed deficits of joint attention. Compared to the human
agent, robot facilitate less fixations towards the targets, but it attracted
more attention and allowed the children to show gaze transition and to follow
joint attention logic. This results highlight both potential application of LCS
analysis on eye-tracking studies and of social robot to intervention.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Vocal effort modulates the motor planning of short speech structures. (arXiv:1803.01236v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01236</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Speech requires programming the sequence of vocal gestures that produce the
sounds of words. Here we explored the timing of this program by asking our
participants to pronounce, as quickly as possible, a sequence of
consonant-consonant-vowel (CCV) structures appearing on screen. We measured the
delay between visual presentation and voice onset. In the case of plosive
consonants, produced by sharp and well defined movements of the vocal tract, we
found that delays are positively correlated with the duration of the transition
between consonants. We then used a battery of statistical tests and
mathematical vocal models to show that delays reflect the motor planning of
CCVs and transitions are proxy indicators of the vocal effort needed to produce
them. These results support that the effort required to produce the sequence of
movements of a vocal gesture modulates the onset of the motor plan.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Cytosolic proteins can exploit membrane localization to trigger functional assembly</title>

Cell division, endocytosis, and viral budding would not function without the localization and assembly of protein complexes on membranes. What is poorly appreciated, however, is that by localizing to membranes, proteins search in a reduced space that effectively drives up concentration. Here we derive an accurate and practical analytical theory to quantify the significance of this dimensionality reduction in regulating protein assembly on membranes. We define a simple metric, an effective equilibrium constant, that allows for quantitative comparison of protein-protein interactions with and without membrane present. To test the importance of membrane localization for driving protein assembly, we collected the protein-protein and protein-lipid affinities, protein and lipid concentrations, and volume-to-surface-area ratios for 46 interactions between 37 membrane-targeting proteins in human and yeast cells. We find that many of the protein-protein interactions between pairs of proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human and yeast cells can experience enormous increases in effective protein-protein affinity (10–1000 fold) due to membrane localization. Localization of binding partners thus triggers robust protein complexation, suggesting that it can play an important role in controlling the timing of endocytic protein coat formation. Our analysis shows that several other proteins involved in membrane remodeling at various organelles have similar potential to exploit localization. The theory highlights the master role of phosphoinositide lipid concentration, the volume-to-surface-area ratio, and the ratio of 3D to 2D equilibrium constants in triggering (or preventing) constitutive assembly on membranes. Our simple model provides a novel quantitative framework for interpreting or designing &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments of protein complexation influenced by membrane binding.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yfpDHZa0FNA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Free energy profiles for unwrapping the outer superhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA</title>

The eukaryotic genome is packaged into a nucleus in the form of chromatin. The fundamental structural unit of chromatin is a protein-DNA complex, the nucleosome, where 146 or 147 base pairs of DNA wrap 1.75 times around a histone core. To function in cellular processes, however, nucleosomal DNA must be unwrapped. Although this unwrapping has been experimentally investigated, details of the process at an atomic level are not yet well understood. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulation with an enhanced sampling method to calculate the free energy profiles for unwrapping the outer superhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA. A free energy change of about 11.5 kcal/mol for the unwrapping agrees well with values obtained in single molecule experiments. This simulation revealed a variety of conformational states, indicating there are many potential paths to outer superhelicdal turn unwrapping, but the dominant path is likely asymmetric. At one end of the DNA, the first five bps unwrap, after which a second five bps unwrap at the same end with no increase in free energy. The unwrapping then starts at the other end of the DNA, where 10 bps are unwrapped. During further unwrapping of 15 bps, the unwrapping advances at one of the ends, after which the other end of the DNA unwraps to complete the unwrapping of the outer superhelical turn. These results provide insight into the construction, disruption, and repositioning of nucleosomes, which are continuously ongoing during cellular processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mW0whYOVxOU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Factors affecting basket catheter detection of real and phantom rotors in the atria: A computational study</title>

Anatomically based procedures to ablate atrial fibrillation (AF) are often successful in terminating paroxysmal AF. However, the ability to terminate persistent AF remains disappointing. New mechanistic approaches use multiple-electrode basket catheter mapping to localize and target AF drivers in the form of rotors but significant concerns remain about their accuracy. We aimed to evaluate how electrode-endocardium distance, far-field sources and inter-electrode distance affect the accuracy of localizing rotors. Sustained rotor activation of the atria was simulated numerically and mapped using a virtual basket catheter with varying electrode densities placed at different positions within the atrial cavity. Unipolar electrograms were calculated on the entire endocardial surface and at each of the electrodes. Rotors were tracked on the interpolated basket phase maps and compared with the respective atrial voltage and endocardial phase maps, which served as references. Rotor detection by the basket maps varied between 35–94% of the simulation time, depending on the basket’s position and the electrode-to-endocardial wall distance. However, two different types of phantom rotors appeared also on the basket maps. The first type was due to the far-field sources and the second type was due to interpolation between the electrodes; increasing electrode density decreased the incidence of the second but not the first type of phantom rotors. In the simulations study, basket catheter-based phase mapping detected rotors even when the basket was not in full contact with the endocardial wall, but always generated a number of phantom rotors in the presence of only a single real rotor, which would be the desired ablation target. Phantom rotors may mislead and contribute to failure in AF ablation procedures.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/29VabiMChAQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A computational model for how cells choose temporal or spatial sensing during chemotaxis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005966</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Rui Zhen Tan, Keng-Hwee Chiam&lt;/p&gt;

Cell size is thought to play an important role in choosing between temporal and spatial sensing in chemotaxis. Large cells are thought to use spatial sensing due to large chemical difference at its ends whereas small cells are incapable of spatial sensing due to rapid homogenization of proteins within the cell. However, small cells have been found to polarize and large cells like sperm cells undergo temporal sensing. Thus, it remains an open question what exactly governs spatial versus temporal sensing. Here, we identify the factors that determines sensing choices through mathematical modeling of chemotactic circuits. Comprehensive computational search of three-node signaling circuits has identified the negative integral feedback (NFB) and incoherent feedforward (IFF) circuits as capable of adaptation, an important property for chemotaxis. Cells are modeled as one-dimensional circular system consisting of diffusible activator, inactivator and output proteins, traveling across a chemical gradient. From our simulations, we find that sensing outcomes are similar for NFB or IFF circuits. Rather than cell size, the relevant parameters are the 1) ratio of cell speed to the product of cell diameter and rate of signaling, 2) diffusivity of the output protein and 3) ratio of the diffusivities of the activator to inactivator protein. Spatial sensing is favored when all three parameters are low. This corresponds to a cell moving slower than the time it takes for signaling to propagate across the cell diameter, has an output protein that is polarizable and has a local-excitation global-inhibition system to amplify the chemical gradient. Temporal sensing is favored otherwise. We also find that temporal sensing is more robust to noise. By performing extensive literature search, we find that our prediction agrees with observation in a wide range of species and cell types ranging from &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; to human Fibroblast cells and propose that our result is universally applicable.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NoOcWYvItXw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) Activation Suppresses TRPV1 Sensitization in Mouse, but Not Human Sensory Neurons</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The use of human tissue to validate putative analgesic targets identified in rodents is a promising strategy for improving the historically poor translational record of preclinical pain research. We recently demonstrated that in mouse and human sensory neurons, agonists for metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3) reduce membrane hyperexcitability produced by the inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Previous rodent studies indicate that mGluR2/3 can also reduce peripheral sensitization by suppressing inflammation-induced sensitization of TRPV1. Whether this observation similarly translates to human sensory neurons has not yet been tested. We found that activation of mGluR2/3 with the agonist APDC suppressed PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced sensitization of TRPV1 in mouse, but not human sensory neurons. We also evaluated sensory neuron expression of the gene transcripts for mGluR2 (&lt;i&gt;Grm2&lt;/i&gt;), mGluR3 (&lt;i&gt;Grm3&lt;/i&gt;), and TRPV1 (&lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt;). The majority of &lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt;+ mouse and human sensory neurons expressed &lt;i&gt;Grm2&lt;/i&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;Grm3&lt;/i&gt;, and in both mouse and human, &lt;i&gt;Grm2&lt;/i&gt; was expressed in a greater percentage of sensory neurons than &lt;i&gt;Grm3&lt;/i&gt;. Although we demonstrated a functional difference in the modulation of TRPV1 sensitization by mGluR2/3 activation between mouse and human, there were no species differences in the gene transcript colocalization of mGluR2 or mGluR3 with TRPV1 that might explain this functional difference. Taken together with our previous work, these results suggest that mGluR2/3 activation suppresses only some aspects of human sensory neuron sensitization caused by PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These differences have implications for potential healthy human voluntary studies or clinical trials evaluating the analgesic efficacy of mGluR2/3 agonists or positive allosteric modulators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A computational perspective of the role of Thalamus in cognition. (arXiv:1803.00997v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00997</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00997</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Thalamus has traditionally been considered as only a relay source of cortical
inputs, with hierarchically organized cortical circuits serially transforming
thalamic signals to cognitively-relevant representations. Given the absence of
local excitatory connections within the thalamus, the notion of thalamic
`relay' seemed like a reasonable description over the last several decades.
Recent advances in experimental approaches and theory provide a broader
perspective on the role of the thalamus in cognitively-relevant cortical
computations, and suggest that only a subset of thalamic circuit motifs fit the
relay description. Here, we discuss this perspective and highlight the
potential role for the thalamus in dynamic selection of cortical
representations through a combination of intrinsic thalamic computations and
output signals that change cortical network functional parameters. We suggest
that through the contextual modulation of cortical computation, thalamus and
cortex jointly optimize the information/cost tradeoff in an emergent fashion.
We emphasize that coordinated experimental and theoretical efforts will provide
a path to understanding the role of the thalamus in cognition, along with an
understanding to augment cognitive capacity in health and disease.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Synaptic Granger Causality: A New Approach to Untangling Excitatory and Inhibitory Connectivities. (arXiv:1803.00905v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00905</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Interactions between brain signals are often measured in terms of information
flow. However, when solving the inverse problem -characterizing the structure
behind a specific functional link- there are many possibilities with very
different consequences. Excitation and inhibition, for instance, may each
produce a causal dependence by coordinating neuronal populations, but
inhibitory connections do not transmit information packages. Here, we introduce
the concept of synaptic Granger causality (sGC), an extension of the well-known
Granger causality approach that quantifies the ratio of excitatory/inhibitory
projections involved in a functional link on the basis of the analysis of time
series constructed using autoregressive models. The method is validated by
using the membrane potential obtained from numerical simulations of neuronal
motifs that mimic extracellular brain activity, similar to the experimentally
measured local field potential. When excitatory and inhibitory synapses are not
mixed, the method correctly predicts the type of synapses that participate in
the signaling. Moreover, when both inputs project on the same neuron or
population, the sGC estimates the proportion of both types of interaction. Our
results suggest that sGC allows for a better inference on the anatomical
structure underlying effective connectivity and its role in the information
process.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Nanodiamonds-induced effects on neuronal firing of mouse hippocampal microcircuits. (arXiv:1803.00871v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00871</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00871</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FND) are carbon-based nanomaterials that can
efficiently incorporate optically active photoluminescent centers such as the
nitrogen-vacancy complex, thus making them promising candidates as optical
biolabels and drug-delivery agents. FNDs exhibit bright fluorescence without
photobleaching combined with high uptake rate and low cytotoxicity. Focusing on
FNDs interference with neuronal function, here we examined their effect on
cultured hippocampal neurons, monitoring the whole network development as well
as the electrophysiological properties of single neurons. We observed that FNDs
drastically decreased the frequency of inhibitory (from 1.81 Hz to 0.86 Hz) and
excitatory (from 1.61 Hz to 0.68 Hz) miniature postsynaptic currents, and
consistently reduced action potential (AP) firing frequency (by 36%), as
measured by microelectrode arrays. On the contrary, bursts synchronization was
preserved, as well as the amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory and excitatory
events. Current-clamp recordings revealed that the ratio of neurons responding
with AP trains of high-frequency (fast-spiking) versus neurons responding with
trains of low-frequency (slow-spiking) was unaltered, suggesting that FNDs
exerted a comparable action on neuronal subpopulations. At the single cell
level, rapid onset of the somatic AP (&quot;kink&quot;) was drastically reduced in
FND-treated neurons, suggesting a reduced contribution of axonal and dendritic
components while preserving neuronal excitability.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Perceptual decision making: Biases in post-error reaction times explained by attractor network dynamics. (arXiv:1803.00795v1 [physics.bio-ph])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00795</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00795</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Perceptual decision making is the subject of many experimental and
theoretical studies. Whereas most modeling analysis are based on statistical
processes of accumulation of evidence, less attention is being devoted to the
modeling with attractor network dynamics, even though they describe well
psychophysical and neurophysiological data. In particular, very few works
confront attractor models predictions with data from continuous sequences of
trials. Recently however, a biophysical competitive attractor network model has
been used to describe such sequences of decision trials, and has been shown to
reproduce repetition biases observed in perceptual decision experiments. Here
we propose an extension of the reduced attractor network model of Wong and Wang
(2006) to get more insights into such effects. We make explicit the conditions
under which such network can perform a succession of decisions, and show that
the model provides a mathematical framework for studying the effects of a trial
on the decision made on the next one. We study in details the reaction times
properties during a sequence of decision trials, and show that the model
reproduces behavioral data, both qualitatively and quantitatively. In
particular, we find that the decision made on the current trial is biased
toward the one made on the previous trial. More remarkably, we show that, in
the absence of any feedback about the correctness of the decision, the network
exhibits post-error slowing, a subtle effect in agreement with empirical data.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: How strong are correlations in strongly recurrent neuronal networks?. (arXiv:1803.00643v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00643</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00643</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cross-correlations in the activity in neural networks are commonly used to
characterize their dynamical states and their anatomical and functional
organizations. Yet, how these latter network features affect the spatiotemporal
structure of the correlations in recurrent networks is not fully understood.
Here, we develop a general theory for the emergence of correlated neuronal
activity from the dynamics in strongly recurrent networks consisting of several
populations of binary neurons. We apply this theory to the case in which the
connectivity depends on the anatomical or functional distance between the
neurons. We establish the architectural conditions under which the system
settles into a dynamical state where correlations are strong, highly robust and
spatially modulated. We show that such strong correlations arise if the network
exhibits an effective feedforward structure. We establish how this feedforward
structure determines the way correlations scale with the network size and the
degree of the connectivity. In networks lacking an effective feedforward
structure correlations are extremely small and only weakly depend on the number
of connections per neuron. Our work shows how strong correlations can be
consistent with highly irregular activity in recurrent networks, two key
features of neuronal dynamics in the central nervous system.

At baseline and 4-year follow-up assessments, sleep-related parameters (midsleep time, sleep duration, sleep latency, subjective sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and daytime dysfunction) and cognitive status were measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment, respectively. We used logistic regression models adjusted for covariates including age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E genotype, Geriatric Depression Scale, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

These relationships remained significant when these variables maintained their status throughout the follow-up period. Newly developed long sleep latency also doubled the risk of cognitive decline. In those with MCI, however, only long sleep latency reduced the chance of reversion to NC (OR = 0.69).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25180-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgical outcomes of a consecutive series of 58 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent the surgery at our institution with at least 12 months of follow-up were retrospectively evaluated. A subgroup analysis was performed comparing patients with and without mesial temporal sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25180-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One year following stereotactic laser amygdalohippocampotomy, 53.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 40.8–65.7%) of all patients were free of disabling seizures (Engel I). Three of 9 patients became seizure-free following repeat ablation. Subgroup analysis showed that 60.5% (95% CI = 45.6–73.7%) of patients with mesial temporal sclerosis were free of disabling seizures as compared to 33.3% (95% CI = 15.0–58.5%) of patients without mesial temporal sclerosis. Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 scores significantly improved at the group level, few procedure-related complications were observed, and verbal memory outcome was better than historical open resection data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Analogous to results from open surgery, patients without mesial temporal sclerosis fared less well. This novel procedure is an effective minimally invasive alternative to resective surgery. In the minority of patients not free of disabling seizures, laser ablation presents no barrier to additional open surgery. Ann Neurol 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25165-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a multicenter registry-based study (Novel Oral Anticoagulants in Stroke Patients collaboration; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02353585) of patients with stroke while taking rivaroxaban, we compared RivLev in patients with AIS and ICH. We determined how many AIS patients had RivLev ≤ 100ng/ml, indicating possible eligibility for thrombolysis, and how many ICH patients had RivLev ≥ 75ng/ml, making them possibly eligible for the use of specific reversal agents. We explored factors associated with RivLev (Spearman correlation, regression models) and studied the sensitivity and specificity of international normalized ratio (INR) thresholds to substitute RivLev using cross tables and receiver operating characteristic curves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25165-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 241 patients (median age = 80 years, interquartile range [IQR] = 73–84; median time from onset to admission = 2 hours, IQR = 1–4.5 hours; median RivLev = 89ng/ml, IQR = 31–194), 190 had AIS and 51 had ICH. RivLev was similar in AIS patients (82ng/ml, IQR = 30–202) and ICH patients (102ng/ml, IQR = 51–165; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.24). Trough RivLev&lt;sub&gt;(≤137ng/ml)&lt;/sub&gt; occurred in 126/190 (66.3%) AIS and 34/51 (66.7%) ICH patients. Among AIS patients, 108/190 (56.8%) had RivLev ≤ 100ng/ml. In ICH patients, 33/51 (64.7%) had RivLev ≥ 75ng/ml. RivLev was associated with rivaroxaban dosage, and inversely with renal function and time since last intake (each &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). INR ≤ 1.0 had a specificity of 98.9% and a sensitivity of 25.7% to predict RivLev ≤ 100ng/ml. INR ≥ 1.4 had a sensitivity of 59.3% and specificity of 90.1% to predict RivLev ≥ 75ng/ml.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25165-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;RivLev did not differ between patients with AIS and ICH. Half of the patients with AIS under rivaroxaban had a RivLev low enough to consider thrombolysis. In ICH patients, two-thirds had a RivLev high enough to meet the eligibility for the use of a specific reversal agent. INR thresholds perform poorly to inform treatment decisions in individual patients. Ann Neurol 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Although antiretroviral drug therapy suppresses human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) to undetectable levels in the blood of treated individuals, reservoirs of replication competent HIV-1 endure. Upon cessation of antiretroviral therapy, the reservoir usually allows outgrowth of virus and approaches to targeting the reservoir have had limited success. Ongoing cycles of viral replication in regions with low drug penetration contribute to this persistence. Here, we use a mathematical model to illustrate a new approach to eliminating the part of the reservoir attributable to persistent replication in drug sanctuaries. Reducing the residency time of CD4 T cells in drug sanctuaries renders ongoing replication unsustainable in those sanctuaries. We hypothesize that, in combination with antiretroviral drugs, a strategy to orchestrate CD4 T cell trafficking could contribute to a functional cure for HIV-1 infection.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pRlEmfNB4Ng&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Classifying dynamic transitions in high dimensional neural mass models: A random forest approach</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Lauric A. Ferrat, Marc Goodfellow, John R. Terry&lt;/p&gt;

Neural mass models (NMMs) are increasingly used to uncover the large-scale mechanisms of brain rhythms in health and disease. The dynamics of these models is dependent upon the choice of parameters, and therefore it is crucial to be able to understand how dynamics change when parameters are varied. Despite being considered low dimensional in comparison to micro-scale, neuronal network models, with regards to understanding the relationship between parameters and dynamics, NMMs are still prohibitively high dimensional for classical approaches such as numerical continuation. Therefore, we need alternative methods to characterise dynamics of NMMs in high dimensional parameter spaces. Here, we introduce a statistical framework that enables the efficient exploration of the relationship between model parameters and selected features of the simulated, emergent model dynamics of NMMs. We combine the classical machine learning approaches of trees and random forests to enable studying the effect that varying multiple parameters has on the dynamics of a model. The method proceeds by using simulations to transform the mathematical model into a database. This database is then used to partition parameter space with respect to dynamic features of interest, using random forests. This allows us to rapidly explore dynamics in high dimensional parameter space, capture the approximate location of qualitative transitions in dynamics and assess the relative importance of all parameters in the model in all dimensions simultaneously. We apply this method to a commonly used NMM in the context of transitions to seizure dynamics. We find that the inhibitory sub-system is most crucial for the generation of seizure dynamics, confirm and expand previous findings regarding the ratio of excitation and inhibition, and demonstrate that previously overlooked parameters can have a significant impact on model dynamics. We advocate the use of this method in future to constrain high dimensional parameter spaces enabling more efficient, person-specific, model calibration.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RmZNyRo2Y1Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Population-specific design of de-immunized protein biotherapeutics</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Schubert, Charlotta Schärfe, Pierre Dönnes, Thomas Hopf, Debora Marks, Oliver Kohlbacher&lt;/p&gt;

Immunogenicity is a major problem during the development of biotherapeutics since it can lead to rapid clearance of the drug and adverse reactions. The challenge for biotherapeutic design is therefore to identify mutants of the protein sequence that minimize immunogenicity in a target population whilst retaining pharmaceutical activity and protein function. Current approaches are moderately successful in designing sequences with reduced immunogenicity, but do not account for the varying frequencies of different human leucocyte antigen alleles in a specific population and in addition, since many designs are non-functional, require costly experimental post-screening.
Here, we report a new method for de-immunization design using multi-objective combinatorial optimization. The method simultaneously optimizes the likelihood of a functional protein sequence at the same time as minimizing its immunogenicity tailored to a target population. We bypass the need for three-dimensional protein structure or molecular simulations to identify functional designs by automatically generating sequences using probabilistic models that have been used previously for mutation effect prediction and structure prediction. As proof-of-principle we designed sequences of the C2 domain of Factor VIII and tested them experimentally, resulting in a good correlation with the predicted immunogenicity of our model.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5E6eC-9uF44&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Diego Fernandez Slezak, Mariano Sigman, Guillermo A. Cecchi&lt;/p&gt;

We present a theory of decision-making in the presence of multiple choices that departs from traditional approaches by explicitly incorporating &lt;i&gt;entropic barriers&lt;/i&gt; in a stochastic search process. We analyze response time data from an on-line repository of 15 million blitz chess games, and show that our model fits not just the mean and variance, but the entire response time distribution (over several response-time orders of magnitude) at every stage of the game. We apply the model to show that (a) higher cognitive expertise corresponds to the exploration of more complex solution spaces, and (b) reaction times of users at an on-line buying website can be similarly explained. Our model can be seen as a synergy between diffusion models used to model simple two-choice decision-making and planning agents in complex problem solving.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KOSfYo_HLEU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Synthesizing realistic neural population activity patterns using Generative Adversarial Networks. (arXiv:1803.00338v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00338</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00338</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to synthesize realistic patterns of neural activity is crucial
for studying neural information processing. Here we used the Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) framework to simulate the concerted activity of a
population of neurons. We adapted the Wasserstein-GAN variant to facilitate the
generation of unconstrained neural population activity patterns while still
benefiting from parameter sharing in the temporal domain. We demonstrate that
our proposed GAN, which we termed Spike-GAN, generates spike trains that match
accurately the first- and second-order statistics of datasets of tens of
neurons and also approximates well their higher-order statistics. We applied
Spike-GAN to a real dataset recorded from salamander retina and showed that it
performs as well as state-of-the-art approaches based on the maximum entropy
and the dichotomized Gaussian frameworks. Importantly, Spike-GAN does not
require to specify a priori the statistics to be matched by the model, and so
constitutes a more flexible method than these alternative approaches.Finally,
we show how to exploit a trained Spike-GAN to construct 'importance maps' to
detect the most relevant statistical structures present in a spike train.
Spike-GAN provides a powerful, easy-to-use technique for generating realistic
spiking neural activity and for describing the most relevant features of the
large-scale neural population recordings studied in modern systems
neuroscience.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Phase response curves are important for analysis and modeling of oscillatory
dynamics in various applications, particularly in neuroscience. Standard
experimental technique for determining them requires isolation of the system
and application of a specifically designed input. However, isolation is not
always feasible and we are compelled to observe the system in its natural
environment under free-running conditions. To that end we propose an approach
relying only on passive observations of the system and its input. We illustrate
it with simulation results of an oscillator driven by a stochastic force.

Living tissues undergo deformation during morphogenesis. In this process, cells generate mechanical forces that drive the coordinated cell motion and shape changes. Recent advances in experimental and theoretical techniques have enabled &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; measurement of the mechanical forces, but the characterization of mechanical properties that determine how these forces quantitatively affect tissue deformation remains challenging, and this represents a major obstacle for the complete understanding of morphogenesis. Here, we proposed a non-invasive reverse-engineering approach for the estimation of the mechanical properties, by combining tissue mechanics modeling and statistical machine learning. Our strategy is to model the tissue as a continuum mechanical system and to use passive observations of spontaneous tissue deformation and force fields to statistically estimate the model parameters. This method was applied to the analysis of the collective migration of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, and the tissue flow and force were simultaneously observed by the phase contrast imaging and traction force microscopy. We found that our monolayer elastic model, whose elastic moduli were reverse-engineered, enabled a long-term forecast of the traction force fields when given the tissue flow fields, indicating that the elasticity contributes to the evolution of the tissue stress. Furthermore, we investigated the tissues in which myosin was inhibited by blebbistatin treatment, and observed a several-fold reduction in the elastic moduli. The obtained results validate our framework, which paves the way to the estimation of mechanical properties of living tissues during morphogenesis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CHVPZZQ-N8s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is, together with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), the most established platform to perform metabolomics. In contrast to LC-MS however, NMR data is predominantly being processed with commercial software. Meanwhile its data processing remains tedious and dependent on user interventions. As a follow-up to speaq, a previously released workflow for NMR spectral alignment and quantitation, we present speaq 2.0. This completely revised framework to automatically analyze 1D NMR spectra uses wavelets to efficiently summarize the raw spectra with minimal information loss or user interaction. The tool offers a fast and easy workflow that starts with the common approach of peak-picking, followed by grouping, thus avoiding the binning step. This yields a matrix consisting of features, samples and peak values that can be conveniently processed either by using included multivariate statistical functions or by using many other recently developed methods for NMR data analysis. speaq 2.0 facilitates robust and high-throughput metabolomics based on 1D NMR but is also compatible with other NMR frameworks or complementary LC-MS workflows. The methods are benchmarked using a simulated dataset and two publicly available datasets. speaq 2.0 is distributed through the existing speaq R package to provide a complete solution for NMR data processing. The package and the code for the presented case studies are freely available on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=speaq) and GitHub (https://github.com/beirnaert/speaq).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JylVVwDPK18&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Receptor recharge time drastically reduces the number of captured particles</title>

Many diverse biological systems are described by randomly moving particles that can be captured by traps in their environment. Examples include neurotransmitters diffusing in the synaptic cleft before binding to receptors and prey roaming an environment before capture by predators. In most cases, the traps cannot capture particles continuously. Rather, each trap must wait a transitory “recharge” time after capturing a particle before additional captures. This recharge time is often overlooked. In the case of instant recharge, the average number of particles captured before they escape grows linearly in the total number of particles. In stark contrast, we prove that for any nonzero recharge time, the average number of captured particles grows at most logarithmically in the total particle number. This is a fundamental effect of recharge, as it holds under very general assumptions on particle motion and spatial domain. Furthermore, we characterize the parameter regime in which a given recharge time will dramatically affect a system, allowing researchers to easily verify if they need to account for recharge in their specific system. Finally, we consider a few examples, including a neural system in which recharge reduces neurotransmitter bindings by several orders of magnitude.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AWmsUhc2uf8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: An evolutionary learning and network approach to identifying key metabolites for osteoarthritis</title>

Metabolomics studies use quantitative analyses of metabolites from body fluids or tissues in order to investigate a sequence of cellular processes and biological systems in response to genetic and environmental influences. This promises an immense potential for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of complex diseases. Most conventional metabolomics analysis methods exam one metabolite at a time and may overlook the synergistic effect of combining multiple metabolites. In this article, we proposed a new bioinformatics framework that infers the non-linear synergy among multiple metabolites using a symbolic model and subsequently, identify key metabolites using network analysis. Such a symbolic model is able to represent a complex non-linear relationship among a set of metabolites associated with osteoarthritis (OA) and is automatically learned using an evolutionary algorithm. Applied to the Newfoundland Osteoarthritis Study (NFOAS) dataset, our methodology was able to identify nine key metabolites including some known osteoarthritis-associated metabolites and some novel metabolic markers that have never been reported before. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology and more importantly, with further investigations, propose new hypotheses that can help better understand the OA disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t5hZej7ZfPQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Research in rodents has established the role of the amygdaloid complex in defensive responses to conditioned threat. In human imaging studies, however, activation of the amygdala by conditioned threat cues is often not observed. One hypothesis states that this finding reflects adaptation of amygdaloid responses over time. We tested this hypothesis by estimating single-trial neural responses over a large number of conditioning trials. Functional MRI (fMRI) was recorded from 18 participants during classical differential fear conditioning: Participants viewed oriented grayscale grating stimuli (45° or 135°) presented centrally in random order. In the acquisition block, one grating (the CS+) was paired with a noxious noise, the unconditioned stimulus (US), on 25% of trials. The other grating, denoted CS–, was never paired with the US. Consistent with previous reports, BOLD in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and insula, but not the amygdala, was heightened when viewing CS+ stimuli that were not paired with US compared to CS– stimuli. Trial-by-trial analysis showed that over the course of acquisition, activity in the amygdala attenuated. Interestingly, activity in the dACC and insula also declined. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) corroborated these results, indicating that the voxel patterns evoked by CS+ and CS– in these brain regions became less distinguishable over time. Together, the present findings support the hypothesis that the lack of BOLD differences in the amygdaloid complex in many studies of classical conditioning is due to adaptation, and the adaptation effects may reflect changes in large-scale networks mediating aversive conditioning, particularly the salience network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Economic decisions arise from evaluation of alternative actions in contexts of motivation and memory. In the predatory sea-slug &lt;i&gt;Pleurobranchaea&lt;/i&gt; the economic decisions of foraging are found to occur by the workings of a simple, affectively controlled homeostat with learning abilities. Here, the neuronal circuit relations for approach-avoidance choice of &lt;i&gt;Pleurobranchaea&lt;/i&gt; are expressed and tested in the foraging simulation Cyberslug. Choice is organized around appetitive state as a moment-to-moment integration of sensation, motivation (satiation/hunger), and memory. Appetitive state controls a switch for approach vs. avoidance turn responses to sensation. Sensory stimuli are separately integrated for incentive value into appetitive state, and for prey location (stimulus place) into mapping motor response. Learning interacts with satiation to regulate prey choice affectively. The virtual predator realistically reproduces the decisions of the real one in varying circumstances and satisfies optimal foraging criteria. The basic relations are open to experimental embellishment toward enhanced neural and behavioral complexity in simulation, as was the ancestral bilaterian nervous system in evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progresses insidiously over decades. Therefore, study of preclinical AD is critical to identify early pathophysiological changes as potential targets for prevention or treatment. The brain processes at the preclinical stage remain minimally understood. Aside from age, the E4 allele of APOE flags a group at particularly high risk of late-onset AD (LOAD). Studies of these individuals could provide insights about the ontogenesis of AD offering clues for novel treatment strategies. To this end, cognitively normal, &lt;i&gt;APOE*E4&lt;/i&gt; homozygotes from the Alzheimer’s Diseases Neuroimaging Research Initiative database (ADNI-LONI) provided fluorodeoxyglucose and amyloid (florbetapir) PET scans (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8 and 7, respectively; mean age 76 years). Their scans were compared to those of matched cognitively normal elders who were not E4 carriers. There was dissociation in the distribution between glucose uptake and amyloid deposition in the homozygotes. Peak hypometabolism localized bilaterally along the medial temporal cortex. In contrast, peak amyloid deposition localized principally to the putamen, a finding also seen in preclinical carriers of autosomal dominant AD mutations and preclinical AD associated with Down syndrome. Additional regions of amyloid deposition in homozygotes were medial prefrontal cortices including the anterior cingulate, middle and inferior frontal cortices, and middle and inferior occipital cortices. These findings contrast with those reported for LOAD. These data begin to characterize elders with normal cognition despite high AD risk in comparison to the known phenotypes of patients with LOAD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Studies of feature-based attention have associated activity in a dorsal frontoparietal network with putative attentional priority signals. Yet, how this neural activity mediates attentional selection and whether it guides behavior are fundamental questions that require investigation. We reasoned that endogenous fluctuations in the quality of attentional priority should influence task performance. Human subjects detected a speed increment while viewing clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) motion (baseline task) or while attending to either direction amid distracters (attention task). In an fMRI experiment, direction-specific neural pattern similarity between the baseline task and the attention task revealed a higher level of similarity for correct than incorrect trials in frontoparietal regions. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we disrupted posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and found a selective deficit in the attention task, but not in the baseline task, demonstrating the necessity of this cortical area during feature-based attention. These results reveal that frontoparietal areas maintain attentional priority that facilitates successful behavioral selection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Damage to the CNS results in neuronal and axonal degeneration, and subsequent neurological dysfunction. Endogenous repair in the CNS is impeded by inhibitory chemical and physical barriers, such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), which prevent axon regeneration. Previously, it has been demonstrated that the inhibition of axonal histone deacetylase-6 (HDAC6) can promote microtubule α-tubulin acetylation and restore the growth of CSPGs- and MAG-inhibited axons. Since the acetylation of α-tubulin is regulated by two opposing enzymes, HDAC6 (deacetylation) and α-tubulin acetyltransferase-1 (αTAT1; acetylation), we have investigated the regulation of these enzymes downstream of a growth inhibitory signal. Our findings show that exposure of primary mouse cortical neurons to soluble CSPGs and MAG substrates cause an acute and RhoA-kinase-dependent reduction in α-tubulin acetylation and αTAT1 protein levels, without changes to either HDAC6 levels or HDAC6 activity. The CSPGs- and MAG-induced reduction in αTAT1 occurs primarily in the distal and middle regions of neurites and reconstitution of αTAT1, either by Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibition or lentiviral-mediated αTAT1 overexpression, can restore neurite growth. Lastly, we demonstrate that CSPGs and MAG signaling decreases αTAT1 levels posttranscriptionally via a ROCK-dependent increase in αTAT1 protein turnover. Together, these findings define αTAT1 as a novel potential therapeutic target for ameliorating CNS injury characterized by growth inhibitory substrates that are prohibitive to axonal regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Reconstruction of brain networks involved in magnetophosphene perception using dense electroencephalography. (arXiv:1802.10451v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Characterizing functional brain networks in humans during magnetophosphene
perception. Dense electroencephalography (EEG, 128 channels) was performed in
N=3 volunteers during high-level (50 mT) magnetic field (MF) exposure.
Functional brain networks were reconstructed, at the cortical level from scalp
recordings, using the EEG source connectivity method. Magnetophosphene
perception appears to consistently activate the right inferior
occipito-temporal pathway. This study provides the very first neuroimaging
results characterizing magnetophosphene perception in humans. The use of
dense-EEG source connectivity is a promising approach in the field of
bioelectromagnetics.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Quantum cognition goes beyond-quantum: modeling the collective participant in psychological measurements. (arXiv:1802.10448v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10448</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10448</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In psychological measurements, two levels should be distinguished: the
'individual level', relative to the different participants in a given cognitive
situation, and the 'collective level', relative to the overall statistics of
their outcomes, which we propose to associate with a notion of 'collective
participant'. When the distinction between these two levels is properly
formalized, it reveals why the modeling of the collective participant generally
requires beyond-quantum - non-Bornian - probabilistic models, when sequential
measurements at the individual level are considered, and this though a pure
quantum description remains valid for single measurement situations.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Optimal encoding in stochastic latent-variable Models. (arXiv:1802.10361v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10361</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10361</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We examine the problem of optimal sparse encoding of sensory stimuli by
latent variables in stochastic models. Analyzing restricted Boltzmann machines
with a communications theory approach, we search for the minimal model size
that correctly conveys the correlations in stimulus patterns in an
information-theoretic sense. We show that the Fisher information Matrix (FIM)
reveals the optimal model size. In larger models the FIM reveals that
irrelevant parameters are associated with individual latent variables,
displaying a surprising amount of order. For well-fit models, we observe the
emergence of statistical criticality as diverging generalized susceptibility of
the model. In this case, an encoding strategy is adopted where highly
informative, but rare stimuli selectively suppress variability in the encoding
units. The information content of the encoded stimuli acts as an unobserved
variable leading to criticality. Together, these results can explain the
stimulus-dependent variability suppression observed in sensory systems, and
suggest a simple, correlation-based measure to reduce the size of artificial
neural networks.

	<description>A brain-imaging paper by Kastner and colleagues in 1999 was the first to demonstrate that merely focusing attention at a spatial location changed the baseline activity level in various regions of human visual cortex even before any stimuli appeared. The study provided a touchstone for investigating cognitive–sensory interactions and understanding the proactive endogenous signals that shape perception.</description>

	<description>In a series of seminal behavioral and electrophysiological experiments, Knudsen and Konishi studied the mechanisms of hearing. Their 1979 article showed how the barn owl utilizes unique anatomical features for creating a systematic internal representation of auditory space. This established the barn owl as a prime model for studying sensory systems.</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Theta Oscillations Organize Spiking Activity in Higher-Order Visual Thalamus during Sustained Attention</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Higher-order visual thalamus plays a fundamental but poorly understood role in attention-demanding tasks. To investigate how neuronal dynamics in higher-order visual thalamus are modulated by sustained attention, we performed multichannel electrophysiological recordings in the lateral posterior-pulvinar complex (LP/pulvinar) in the ferret (&lt;i&gt;Mustela putorius furo&lt;/i&gt;). We recorded single unit activity and local field potential during the performance of the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) that is used in both humans and animals as an assay of sustained attention. We found that half of the units exhibited an increasing firing rate during the delay period before stimulus onset (attention-modulated units). In contrast, the non-attention-modulated units responded to the stimulus, but not during the delay period. Spike-field coherence of only the attention-modulated neurons significantly increased from the start of the delay period until screen touch, predominantly in the theta frequency band. In addition, theta power and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling were elevated throughout the delay period. Our findings suggest that the theta oscillation plays a role in orchestrating thalamic signaling during sustained attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Impaired sustained attention can be deadly, as illustrated by the number of motor vehicle accidents that are caused by drivers not reacting quickly enough to unexpected events on the road. Understanding how electrical signaling in higher-order visual nuclei, such as the LP/pulvinar, is modulated during tasks that require sustained attention is an important step in achieving a mechanistic understanding of sustained attention, which will eventually lead to new strategies to prevent and treat impairment in sustained attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dopamine D2 Receptors in Dopaminergic Neurons Modulate Performance in a Reversal Learning Task in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0229-17.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging studies in animal models and human subjects have each revealed that relatively low striatal dopamine D2-like receptor binding potential is associated with poor impulse control and with vulnerability for addiction-related behaviors. These studies cannot, however, disambiguate the roles for various pools of D2 receptors found in the striatum (e.g., those expressed on medium spiny striato-pallidal neurons vs. on dopamine-releasing nerve terminals) in these behavioral outcomes. To clarify the role of the latter pool – namely, D2 autoreceptors – we studied mice carrying a conditional DRD2 gene, with or without Cre-recombinase expressed under the transcriptional control of the dopamine transporter gene locus (autoDrd2-KO, n = 19 and controls, n = 21). These mice were tested for locomotor response to cocaine, and spatial reversal learning was assessed in operant conditioning chambers. As predicted, compared to control mice, autoDrd2-KO animals demonstrated heightened sensitivity to the locomotor stimulating effect of cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), confirming previous research using a similar genetic model. In the spatial reversal learning task, autoDrd2-KO mice were slower to reach a learning criterion and had difficulty sustaining a prolonged nose poke response, measurements conceptually related to impaired response inhibition. Rate of learning of the initial discrimination and latencies to collect rewards, to initiate trials and to produce a response were unaffected by genetic deletion of D2 autoreceptors, discarding possible motor and motivational factors. Together, these findings confirm the role of D2 autoreceptors in reversal learning and suggest a broader involvement in behavioral inhibition mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Because impulsivity and substance use disorder often co-occur, they may share common molecular and cellular determinants. Studies in humans and animal models alike have helped identify the bioavailability dopamine receptor D2 as a correlate of both impulsivity and predisposition for addictive behaviors. Nevertheless, these studies were not able to differentiate between the respective roles of D2 auto- and heteroreceptors. The present work provides evidence that D2 autoreceptors alone influence the performance in a task measuring impulsivity in mice, suggesting that impulsivity is not only resulting from dysfunctional striato-pallidal neurons, but also might also be modulated by upstream, pre-synaptic events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: cAMP, cGMP and Amyloid β: Three Ideal Partners for Memory Formation</title>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30035-3?rss=yes</link>
	<description>cAMP and cGMP are well established second messengers required for long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory formation/consolidation. By contrast, amyloid β (Aβ), mostly known as one of the main culprits for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), has received relatively little attention in the context of plasticity and memory. Of note, however, low physiological concentrations of Aβ seem necessary for LTP induction and for memory formation. This should come as no surprise, since hormesis emerged as a central dogma in biology.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Gap Junctions Interconnect Different Subtypes of Parvalbumin-Positive Interneurons in Barrels and Septa with Connectivity Unique to Each Subtype</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons form dendritic gap junctions with one another, but the connectivity among gap junction-coupled dendrites remains uninvestigated in most neocortical areas. We visualized gap junctions in layer 4 of the mouse barrel cortex and examined their structural details. PV neurons were divided into 4 types based on the location of soma and dendrites within or outside barrels. Type 1 neurons that had soma and all dendrites inside a barrel, considered most specific to single vibrissa-derived signals, unexpectedly formed gap junctions only with other types but never with each other. Type 2 neurons inside a barrel elongated dendrites outward, forming gap junctions within a column that contained the home barrel. Type 3 neurons located outside barrels established connections with all types including Type 4 neurons that were confined inside the inter-barrel septa. The majority (33/38, 86.8%) of dendritic gap junctions were within 75 μm from at least 1 of 2 paired somata. All types received vesicular glutamate transporter 2-positive axon terminals preferentially on somata and proximal dendrites, indicating the involvement of all types in thalamocortical feedforward regulation in which proximal gap junctions may also participate. These structural organizations provide a new morphological basis for regulatory mechanisms in barrel cortex.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sfrp1 Modulates Cell-signaling Events Underlying Telencephalic Patterning, Growth and Differentiation</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The mammalian dorsal telencephalic neuroepithelium develops—from medial to lateral—into the choroid plaque, cortical hem, hippocampal primordium and isocortex under the influence of Bmp, Wnt and Notch signaling. Correct telencephalic development requires a tight coordination of the extent/duration of these signals, but the identification of possible molecular coordinators is still limited. Here, we postulated that Secreted Frizzled Related Protein 1 (Sfrp1), a multifunctional regulator of Bmp, Wnt and Notch signaling strongly expressed during early telencephalic development, may represent 1 of such molecules. We report that in E10.5–E12.5 &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sfrp1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; embryos, the hem and hippocampal domains are reduced in size whereas the prospective neocortex is medially extended. These changes are associated with a significant reduction of the medio-lateral telencephalic expression of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Axin2&lt;/span&gt;, a read-out of Wnt/βcatenin signaling activation. Furthermore, in the absence of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sfrp1&lt;/span&gt;, Notch signaling is increased, cortical progenitor cell cycle is shorter, with expanded progenitor pools and enhanced generation of early-born neurons. Hence, in postnatal &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sfrp1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; animals the anterior hippocampus is reduced and the neocortex is shorter in the antero-posterior and medio-lateral axis but is thicker. We propose that, by controlling Wnt and Notch signaling in opposite directions, Sfrp1 promotes hippocampal patterning and balances medio-lateral and antero-posterior cortex expansion.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cognitive training has been suggested as a possible remediation of decline in brain structure with older age. However, it is unknown whether training effects are transient or enduring, as no studies have examined training-induced plasticity relative to decline in older adults across extended periods with multiple intervention phases. We investigated the temporal dynamics of brain plasticity across periods on and off memory training, hypothesizing that (1) a decline in white matter (WM) microstructure would be observed across the duration of the study and (2) that periods of memory training would moderate the WM microstructural decline. In total, 107 older adults followed a 40-week program, including 2 training periods separated by periods with no intervention. The general decline in WM microstructure observed across the duration of the study was moderated following the training periods, demonstrating that cognitive training may mitigate age-related brain deterioration. The training-related improvements were estimated to subside over time, indicating that continuous training may be a premise for the enduring attenuation of neural decline. Memory improvements were largely maintained after the initial training period, and may thus not rely on continuous training to the same degree as WM microstructure.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Diversity of Cortico-descending Projections: Histological and Diffusion MRI Characterization in the Monkey</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The axonal composition of cortical projections originating in premotor, supplementary motor (SMA), primary motor (a4), somatosensory and parietal areas and descending towards the brain stem and spinal cord was characterized in the monkey with histological tract tracing, electron microscopy (EM) and diffusion MRI (dMRI). These 3 approaches provided complementary information. Histology provided accurate assessment of axonal diameters and size of synaptic boutons. dMRI revealed the topography of the projections (tractography), notably in the internal capsule. From measurements of axon diameters axonal conduction velocities were computed. Each area communicates with different diameter axons and this generates a hierarchy of conduction delays in this order: a4 (the shortest), SMA, premotor (F7), parietal, somatosensory, premotor F4 (the longest). We provide new interpretations for i) the well-known different anatomical and electrophysiological estimates of conduction velocity; ii) why conduction delays are probably an essential component of the cortical motor command; and iii) how histological and dMRI tractography can be integrated.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: MeCP2 Deficiency Leads to Loss of Glial Kir4.1</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder usually caused by mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). RTT is typified by apparently normal development until 6–18 mo of age, when motor and communicative skills regress and hand stereotypies, autonomic symptoms, and seizures present. Restoration of MeCP2 function selectively to astrocytes reversed several deficits in a murine model of RTT, but the mechanism of this rescue is unknown. Astrocytes carry out many essential functions required for normal brain functioning, including extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; buffering. Kir4.1, an inwardly rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel, is largely responsible for the channel-mediated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; regulation by astrocytes. Loss-of-function mutations in Kir4.1 in human patients result in a severe neurodevelopmental disorder termed EAST or SESAME syndrome. Here, we evaluated astrocytic Kir4.1 expression in a murine model of Rett syndrome. We demonstrate by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis that Kir4.1 is a direct molecular target of MeCP2. Astrocytes from &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice express significantly less Kir4.1 mRNA and protein, which translates into a &amp;gt;50% deficiency in Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive Kir4.1-mediated currents, and impaired extracellular potassium dynamics. By examining astrocytes in isolation, we demonstrate that loss of Kir4.1 is cell autonomous. Assessment through postnatal development revealed that Kir4.1 expression in &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt;-deficient animals never reaches adult, wild-type levels, consistent with a neurodevelopmental disorder. These are the first data implicating a direct MeCP2 molecular target in astrocytes and provide novel mechanistic insight explaining a potential mechanism by which astrocytic dysfunction may contribute to RTT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Uncovering the neural dynamics of facial identity processing along with its representational basis outlines a major endeavor in the study of visual processing. To this end, here, we record human electroencephalography (EEG) data associated with viewing face stimuli; then, we exploit spatiotemporal EEG information to determine the neural correlates of facial identity representations and to reconstruct the appearance of the corresponding stimuli. Our findings indicate that multiple temporal intervals support: facial identity classification, face space estimation, visual feature extraction and image reconstruction. In particular, we note that both classification and reconstruction accuracy peak in the proximity of the N170 component. Further, aggregate data from a larger interval (50–650 ms after stimulus onset) support robust reconstruction results, consistent with the availability of distinct visual information over time. Thus, theoretically, our findings shed light on the time course of face processing while, methodologically, they demonstrate the feasibility of EEG-based image reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Cytosolic ATP Relieves Voltage-Dependent Inactivation of T-Type Calcium Channels and Facilitates Excitability of Neurons in the Rat Central Medial Thalamus</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The central medial nucleus (CeM) is a part of the intralaminar thalamus, which is involved in the control of arousal and sensory processing. However, ionic conductances and mechanisms that regulate the activity of the CeM are not well studied. Here, we used &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiology in acute brain slices from adolescent rats to demonstrate that T-type calcium currents (T-currents) are prominent in the majority of the studied CeM neurons and are critical determinants of low-threshold calcium spikes (LTSs), which in turn regulate excitability of these neurons. Using an ATP-free internal solution decreased T-current density and induced a profound hyperpolarizing shift in steady-state inactivation curves while voltage-dependent activation kinetics were spared. Furthermore, selective pharmacological blockade of T-channels or use of an ATP-free solution reduced both tonic action potential (AP) frequency and rebound burst firing in CeM neurons. Our results indicate that T-channels are critical regulators of a thalamocortical circuit output and suggest that cytosolic ATP could be an endogenous regulatory mechanism in which T-channels may functionally gate sensory transmission and arousal &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Implementing Goal-Directed Foraging Decisions of a Simpler Nervous System in Simulation</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Economic decisions arise from evaluation of alternative actions in contexts of motivation and memory. In the predatory sea-slug &lt;i&gt;Pleurobranchaea&lt;/i&gt; the economic decisions of foraging are found to occur by the workings of a simple, affectively controlled homeostat with learning abilities. Here, the neuronal circuit relations for approach-avoidance choice of &lt;i&gt;Pleurobranchaea&lt;/i&gt; are expressed and tested in the foraging simulation Cyberslug™. Choice is organized around appetitive state as a moment-to-moment integration of sensation, motivation (satiation/hunger), and memory. Appetitive state controls a switch for approach vs. avoidance turn responses to sensation. Sensory stimuli are separately integrated for incentive value into appetitive state, and for prey location (stimulus place) into mapping motor response. Learning interacts with satiation to regulate prey choice affectively. The virtual predator realistically reproduces the decisions of the real one in varying circumstances and satisfies optimal foraging criteria. The basic relations are open to experimental embellishment toward enhanced neural and behavioral complexity in simulation, as was the ancestral bilaterian nervous system in evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Contemporary artificial intelligence lacks the attributes of natural intelligence, in particular the abilities to relate information affectively. Accordingly, it is notable that the most complex animal behaviors serve primitive homeostatic goals, and emerge from the primitive mechanisms generating motivation and reward learning. Here is shown in simulation the function of a basic neuronal circuit for cost-benefit decision, derived from studies of a predatory generalist, the sea-slug &lt;i&gt;Pleurobranchaea&lt;/i&gt;, and based on affective integration of information. Its simplicity may reflect distant ancestral qualities on which complexities in economic, cognitive, and social behaviors were built. The simulation validates experimental data and provides a basic module on which complexity in economic, cognitive, and social behaviors could be built.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Inhibition of a Descending Prefrontal Circuit Prevents Ketamine-Induced Stress Resilience in Females</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Stress is a potent etiological factor in the onset of major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Therefore, significant efforts have been made to identify factors that produce resilience to the outcomes of a later stressor, in hopes of preventing untoward clinical outcomes. The NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine has recently emerged as a prophylactic capable of preventing neurochemical and behavioral outcomes of a future stressor. Despite promising results of preclinical studies performed in male rats, the effects of proactive ketamine in female rats remains unknown. This is alarming given that stress-related disorders affect females at nearly twice the rate of males. Here we explore the prophylactic effects of ketamine on stress-induced anxiety-like behavior and the neural circuit-level processes that mediate these effects in female rats. Ketamine given 1 week prior to an uncontrollable stressor (inescapable tailshock, IS) reduced typical stress-induced activation of the serotonergic (5-HT) dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and eliminated DRN-dependent juvenile social exploration (JSE) deficits 24 hours after the stressor. Proactive ketamine altered prelimbic cortex (PL) neural ensembles so that a later experience with IS now activated these cells, which it ordinarily would not. Ketamine acutely activated a prelimbic cortex (PL) to DRN (PL-DRN) circuit and inhibition of this circuit with Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) at the time of IS 1 week later prevented stress prophylaxis, suggesting that persistent changes in PL-DRN circuit activity are responsible, at least in part, for mediating long term effects associated with ketamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Stress-related disorders affect females at twice the rate of males, and so identifying factors capable of producing resilience in females is critically important. Recent efforts to identify neural mechanisms underlying the prophylactic effects of ketamine on the behavioral and neural impact of a later stressor have focused solely on male rodents. Here we show that ketamine administered to female rats 1 week before an uncontrollable stressor prevents stress-induced anxiety-like behavioral effects. The mechanisms by which ketamine exerts prophylactic effects were explored, and ketamine was found to activate an inhibitory prelimbic cortex-dorsal raphe nucleus circuit and that this circuit activation is required for the stress-buffering effects of ketamine. These data provide a basis for prophylactic use of ketamine in females.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Terminal Arbors of Callosal Axons Undergo Plastic Changes in Early-Amputated Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy043</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy043/4904065?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Sensory information is processed in specific brain regions, and shared between the cerebral hemispheres by axons that cross the midline through the corpus callosum. However, sensory deprivation usually causes sensory losses and/or functional changes. This is the case of people who suffered limb amputation and show changes of body map organization within the somatosensory cortex (S1) of the deafferented cerebral hemisphere (contralateral to the amputated limb), as well as in the afferented hemisphere (ipsilateral to the amputated limb). Although several studies have approached these functional changes, the possible finer morphological alterations, such as those occurring in callosal axons, still remain unknown. The present work combined histochemistry, single-axon tracing and 3D microscopy to analyze the fine morphological changes that occur in callosal axons of the forepaw representation in early amputated rats. We showed that the forepaw representation in S1 was reduced in the deafferented hemisphere and expanded in the afferented side. Accordingly, after amputation, callosal axons originating from the deafferented cortex undergo an expansion of their terminal arbors with increased number of terminal boutons within the homotopic representation at the afferented cerebral hemisphere. Similar microscale structural changes may underpin the macroscale morphological and functional phenomena that characterize limb amputation in humans.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: GSK3β Modulates Timing-Dependent Long-Term Depression Through Direct Phosphorylation of Kv4.2 Channels</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy042</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy042/4904064?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a form of activity-dependent remodeling of synaptic strength that underlies memory formation. Despite its key role in dictating learning rules in the brain circuits, the molecular mechanisms mediating STDP are still poorly understood. Here, we show that spike timing-dependent long-term depression (tLTD) and A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents are modulated by pharmacological agents affecting the levels of active glycogen-synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and by GSK3β knockdown in layer 2/3 of the mouse somatosensory cortex. Moreover, the blockade of A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents mimics the effects of GSK3 up-regulation on tLTD and occludes further changes in synaptic strength. Pharmacological, immunohistochemical and biochemical experiments revealed that GSK3β influence over tLTD induction is mediated by direct phosphorylation at Ser-616 of the Kv4.2 subunit, a molecular determinant of A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents. Collectively, these results identify the functional interaction between GSK3β and Kv4.2 channel as a novel mechanism for tLTD modulation providing exciting insight into the understanding of GSK3β role in synaptic plasticity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Low-Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound Attenuates LPS-Induced Neuroinflammation and Memory Impairment by Modulation of TLR4/NF-κB Signaling and CREB/BDNF Expression</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy039</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy039/4904063?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The purpose of this study was to investigate the restorative role of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation and memory impairments in a simulation of Alzheimer’s disease. Mice subjected to LPS administration (250 μg/kg, i.p.) were treated with LIPUS daily for 7 days. The levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and inflammatory markers were estimated in brain tissue using western blot. After LIPUS treatment, the neuroprotective effects of LIPUS in mice were assessed by behavioral tests. LPS plus LIPUS-treated mice exhibited a significant increase in the average time spent in the target quadrant compared to the LPS-treated group. Compared with the LPS-treated group, LPS plus LIPUS-treated mice revealed a preference for the novel object. LIPUS treatment significantly attenuated LPS-induced increases in the expression of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the hippocampus region of LPS-treated mice. Furthermore, LIPUS significantly reduced the protein levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the mice brain induced by LPS. LIPUS treatment induces neuroprotection by inhibiting the LPS-induced activation of TLR4/NF-κB inflammatory signaling and by enhancing the associated CREB/BDNF expression in LPS-treated mice. Our data showed that LIPUS attenuated LPS-induced memory impairment as well as amyloidogenesis via the suppression of neuroinflammatory activity and BDNF decline.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Preterm Birth Changes Networks of Newborn Cortical Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy012</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy012/4904062?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Preterm birth is the greatest risk factor for lifelong neurocognitive deficits, globally. The effect of prematurity on early cortical network function has, however, remained poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel methodology that allows reliable assessment of functional connectivity in neonatal brain activity at millisecond and multisecond scales in terms of cortical phase and amplitude correlations, respectively. We measured scalp electroencephalography at term-equivalent age in infants exposed to very early prematurity as well as in healthy controls. We found that newborn cortical activity organizes into multiplex networks that differ significantly between vigilance states. As compared with healthy control infants, prematurity was found to cause frequency-specific patterns of dysconnectivity in cortical network, changes that were distinct for networks of phase and amplitude correlations. Neuroanatomically, the most prominent markers of prematurity were found in connections involving the frontal regions. Phase synchrony in frontally connected networks was correlated with newborn neurological performance, suggesting the first measure of cortical functional coupling that correlates with neurological performance in human infant.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwannomatosis and neurofibromatosis type 2 are hereditary tumor syndromes and peripheral neuropathy has been reported in both. We prospectively applied &lt;em&gt;in-vivo&lt;/em&gt; morphometric measurement of dorsal root ganglia volume in 16 schwannomatosis, 14 neurofibromatosis type 2 patients, and 26 healthy controls by MR-Neurography. Compared to healthy controls, dorsal root ganglia hypertrophy was a consistent finding in neurofibromatosis type 2 (L3: +267%, L4: +235%, L5: +241%, S1: +300% and S2: +242%, Bonferroni-adjusted p&amp;lt;0.001) but not in schwannomatosis. Dorsal root ganglia may be a vulnerable site in origination of areflexia and sensory loss and a useful diagnostic marker in neurofibromatosis type 2. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Subset of Cortical Layer 6b Neurons Selectively Innervates Higher Order Thalamic Nuclei in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy036</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy036/4897996?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The thalamus receives input from 3 distinct cortical layers, but input from only 2 of these has been well characterized. We therefore investigated whether the third input, derived from layer 6b, is more similar to the projections from layer 6a or layer 5. We studied the projections of a restricted population of deep layer 6 cells (“layer 6b cells”) taking advantage of the transgenic mouse Tg(Drd1a-cre)FK164Gsat/Mmucd (Drd1a-Cre), that selectively expresses Cre-recombinase in a subpopulation of layer 6b neurons across the entire cortical mantle. At P8, 18% of layer 6b neurons are labeled with Drd1a-Cre::tdTomato in somatosensory cortex (SS), and some co-express known layer 6b markers. Using Cre-dependent viral tracing, we identified topographical projections to higher order thalamic nuclei. VGluT1+ synapses formed by labeled layer 6b projections were found in posterior thalamic nucleus (Po) but not in the (pre)thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). The lack of TRN collaterals was confirmed with single-cell tracing from SS. Transmission electron microscopy comparison of terminal varicosities from layer 5 and layer 6b axons in Po showed that L6b varicosities are markedly smaller and simpler than the majority from L5. Our results suggest that L6b projections to the thalamus are distinct from both L5 and L6a projections.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Directed Interaction Between Monkey Premotor and Posterior Parietal Cortex During Motor-Goal Retrieval from Working Memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy035</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy035/4897995?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Goal-directed behavior requires cognitive control of action, putatively by means of frontal-lobe impact on posterior brain areas. We investigated frontoparietal directed interaction (DI) in monkeys during memory-guided rule-based reaches, to test if DI supports motor-goal selection or working memory (WM) processes. We computed DI between the parietal reach region (PRR) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) with a Granger-causality measure of intracortical local field potentials (LFP). LFP mostly in the beta (12–32 Hz) and low-frequency (f≤10Hz) ranges contributed to DI. During movement withholding, beta-band activity in PRR had a Granger-causal effect on PMd independent of WM content. Complementary, low-frequency PMd activity had a transient Granger-causing effect on PRR specifically during WM retrieval of spatial motor goals, while no DI was associated with preliminary motor-goal selection. Our results support the idea that premotor and posterior parietal cortices interact functionally to achieve cognitive control during goal-directed behavior, in particular, that frontal-to-parietal interaction occurs during retrieval of motor-goal information from spatial WM.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Seizures and disturbed brain potassium dynamics in the leukodystrophy MLC</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25190</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25190</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Loss of function of the astrocyte-specific protein MLC1 leads to the childhood onset leukodystrophy “megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts” (MLC). Studies on isolated cells show a role for MLC1 in astrocyte volume regulation and suggest that disturbed brain ion and water homeostasis is central to the disease. Excitability of neuronal networks is particularly sensitive to ion and water homeostasis. In line with this, reports of seizures and epilepsy in MLC patients exist. However, systematic assessment and mechanistic understanding of seizures in MLC are lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We analyzed an MLC patient inventory to study occurrence of seizures in MLC. We used two distinct genetic mouse models of MLC to further study epileptiform activity and seizure threshold through wireless extracellular field potential recordings. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive electrode recordings in mouse brain slices were used to explore the underlying mechanisms of epilepsy in MLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: An early onset of seizures is common in MLC. Similarly, in MLC mice we uncovered spontaneous epileptiform brain activity and a lowered threshold for induced seizures. At the cellular level, we found that although passive and active properties of individual pyramidal neurons are unchanged, extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics and neuronal network activity are abnormal in MLC mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Disturbed astrocyte regulation of ion and water homeostasis in MLC causes hyperexcitability of neuronal networks and seizures. These findings suggest a role for defective astrocyte volume regulation in epilepsy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mutations in SCN3A cause early infantile epileptic encephalopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25188</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Voltage-gated sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) channels underlie action potential generation and propagation and hence are central to the regulation of excitability in the nervous system. Mutations in the genes &lt;em&gt;SCN1A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;SCN2A&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;SCN8A&lt;/em&gt;, encoding the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel pore-forming (α) subunits Nav1.1, 1.2, and 1.6, respectively, and &lt;em&gt;SCN1B&lt;/em&gt;, encoding the accessory subunit β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, are established causes of genetic epilepsies. &lt;em&gt;SCN3A&lt;/em&gt;, encoding Nav1.3, is known to be highly expressed in brain, but has not previously been linked to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy. Here, we describe a cohort of four patients with epileptic encephalopathy and heterozygous &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; missense variants in &lt;em&gt;SCN3A&lt;/em&gt; (p.Ile875Thr in two cases, p.Pro1333Leu, and p.Val1769Ala).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: All patients presented with treatment-resistant epilepsy in the first year of life, severe to profound intellectual disability, and, in two cases (both with the variant p.Ile875Thr), diffuse polymicrogyria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Electrophysiological recordings of mutant channels revealed prominent gain of channel function, with a markedly increased amplitude of the slowly inactivating current component, and, for two of three mutants (p.Ile875Thr and p.Pro1333Leu), a left-shift in the voltage dependence of activation to more hyperpolarized potentials. Gain of function was not observed for Nav1.3 variants known or presumed to be inherited (p.Arg1642Cys and p.Lys1799Gln). The anti-seizure medications phenytoin and lacosamide selectively blocked slowly inactivating over transient current in wild-type and mutant Nav1.3 channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: These findings establish &lt;em&gt;SCN3A&lt;/em&gt; as a new gene for infantile epileptic encephalopathy and suggest a potential pharmacologic intervention. These findings also reinforce the role of Nav1.3 as an important regulator of neuronal excitability in the developing brain while providing additional insight into mechanisms of slow inactivation of Nav1.3.

&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To determine relationships of memory complaints to cognitive function and decline, incident dementia, and neurodegenerative and other neuropathologies, as well as the population-attributable risk for dementia in older black and white persons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: 4015 community-based persons (28% black; 74% women; mean baseline age 78 years), were enrolled in one of four longitudinal cohort studies, and another 2937 in a population-based cohort. Memory scores, assessed using two questions (5-point Likert scales) were categorized as complaints present or absent. Global cognition and five cognitive domains were derived from annual neuropsychological tests. Dementia was assessed from these tests and additional data. Neuropathologic data were available for 1350 deceased with brain autopsies. Regression and mixed effects models were used to examine relationships of memory complaints to cognition and neuropathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Baseline memory complaints (n=1310; 33% of 4015) were associated with lower cognition and faster decline in all domains (global score estimate = -0.032 [SE=0.004], &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), during a mean follow-up of 6 (SD=2) years. Persons with memory complaints had higher dementia risk (HR=1.64; 95%CI: 1.42-1.89) and odds of pathologic Alzheimer's disease (OR=1.96; 95%CI: 1.51-2.54), neocortical Lewy bodies (OR=2.47, 95%CI: 1.54-3.96), and other neurodegenerative pathologies. Results for dementia risk were similar among blacks and whites. Among 2937 older persons in a population-based cohort with similar data, the population-attributable risk for incident dementia due to memory complaints was 14.0% (95%CI: 2.6-23.0), and did not vary between the black and white groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Memory complaints are common in older black and white persons, and relate to cognitive decline, dementia risk, and neurodegenerative pathologies.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A raster display of repeated motor cortical evoked potentials with single pulses of deep brain stimulation in the globus pallidus, pars interna in a patient with cervical dystonia. Each line represents a single trial, with stimulation beginning at the left margin, and the length of each line equivalent to 50 msec of recording. Dark blue = 0 mV, lighter blue-green colors = negative voltage, purple-red colors = positive voltage. Note that the evoked potential is negative at about 10 msec, positive at about 25 msec, and then near zero again at 50 msec. See Ni et al., pp 352–362, this issue.

	<description>It has been known for decades that degeneration of the locus coeruleus (LC), the major noradrenergic nucleus in the brain, occurs in both Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), but it was given scant attention. It is now recognized that hyperphosphorylated tau in the LC is the first detectable AD-like neuropathology in the human brain, α-synuclein inclusions in the LC represent an early step in PD, and experimental LC lesions exacerbate neuropathology and cognitive/behavioral deficits in animal models.</description>
