	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Optimizing Neural Architecture Search using Limited GPU Time in a Dynamic Search Space: A Gene Expression Programming Approach. (arXiv:2005.07669v1 [cs.CV])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Efficient identification of people and objects, segmentation of regions of
interest and extraction of relevant data in images, texts, audios and videos
are evolving considerably in these past years, which deep learning methods,
combined with recent improvements in computational resources, contributed
greatly for this achievement. Although its outstanding potential, development
of efficient architectures and modules requires expert knowledge and amount of
resource time available. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary-based neural
architecture search approach for efficient discovery of convolutional models in
a dynamic search space, within only 24 GPU hours. With its efficient search
environment and phenotype representation, Gene Expression Programming is
adapted for network's cell generation. Despite having limited GPU resource time
and broad search space, our proposal achieved similar state-of-the-art to
manually-designed convolutional networks and also NAS-generated ones, even
beating similar constrained evolutionary-based NAS works. The best cells in
different runs achieved stable results, with a mean error of 2.82% in CIFAR-10
dataset (which the best model achieved an error of 2.67%) and 18.83% for
CIFAR-100 (best model with 18.16%). For ImageNet in the mobile setting, our
best model achieved top-1 and top-5 errors of 29.51% and 10.37%, respectively.
Although evolutionary-based NAS works were reported to require a considerable
amount of GPU time for architecture search, our approach obtained promising
results in little time, encouraging further experiments in evolutionary-based
NAS, for search and network representation improvements.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Mixed-Initiative Procedural Content Generation using Level Design Patterns and Interactive Evolutionary Optimisation. (arXiv:2005.07478v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07478</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07478</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;An approach for building mixed-initiative tools for the procedural generation
of game levels using interactive evolutionary optimisation is introduced. A
tool is created based on this approach which (a) is focused on supporting the
designer to explore the design space and (b) only requires the designer to
interact with it by designing levels. The tool identifies level design patterns
in an initial hand-designed map and uses that information to drive an
optimisation algorithm. This results in a number of suggestions which are
presented to the designer, who can then edit them providing the system with
valuable designer feedback. The effectiveness of this approach to create levels
with similar level design patterns to a target is illustrated through a series
of algorithm driven benchmark tests. To test the mixed-initiative aspect of the
tool a triple-blind mixed-method, user study was conducted. When compared to a
control group, provided with random level suggestions throughout the design
process, the mixed-initiative approach increased engagement in the level design
task and was effective in inspiring new ideas and design directions. This
provides significant evidence that procedural content generation can be used as
a powerful tool to support the human design process.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Improving Neuroevolution Using Island Extinction and Repopulation. (arXiv:2005.07376v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroevolution commonly uses speciation strategies to better explore the
search space of neural network architectures. One such speciation strategy is
through the use of islands, which are also popular in improving performance and
convergence of distributed evolutionary algorithms. However, in this approach
some islands can become stagnant and not find new best solutions. In this
paper, we propose utilizing extinction events and island repopulation to avoid
premature convergence. We explore this with the Evolutionary eXploration of
Augmenting Memory Models (EXAMM) neuro-evolution algorithm. In this strategy,
all members of the worst performing island are killed of periodically and
repopulated with mutated versions of the global best genome. This island based
strategy is additionally compared to NEAT's (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting
Topologies) speciation strategy. Experiments were performed using two different
real world time series datasets (coal-fired power plant and aviation flight
data). The results show that with statistical significance, this island
extinction and repopulation strategy evolves better global best genomes than
both EXAMM's original island based strategy and NEAT's speciation strategy.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Learning Rate Annealing Can Provably Help Generalization, Even for Convex Problems. (arXiv:2005.07360v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07360</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07360</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning rate schedule can significantly affect generalization performance in
modern neural networks, but the reasons for this are not yet understood.
Li-Wei-Ma (2019) recently proved this behavior can exist in a simplified
non-convex neural-network setting. In this note, we show that this phenomenon
can exist even for convex learning problems -- in particular, linear regression
in 2 dimensions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give a toy convex problem where learning rate annealing (large initial
learning rate, followed by small learning rate) can lead gradient descent to
minima with provably better generalization than using a small learning rate
throughout. In our case, this occurs due to a combination of the mismatch
between the test and train loss landscapes, and early-stopping.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Evolved Explainable Classifications for Lymph Node Metastases. (arXiv:2005.07229v1 [cs.CV])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A novel evolutionary approach for Explainable Artificial Intelligence is
presented: the &quot;Evolved Explanations&quot; model (EvEx). This methodology consists
in combining Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME) with
Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms to allow for automated segmentation
parameter tuning in image classification tasks. In this case, the dataset
studied is Patch-Camelyon, comprised of patches from pathology whole slide
images. A publicly available Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on
this dataset to provide a binary classification for presence/absence of lymph
node metastatic tissue. In turn, the classifications are explained by means of
evolving segmentations, seeking to optimize three evaluation goals
simultaneously. The final explanation is computed as the mean of all
explanations generated by Pareto front individuals, evolved by the developed
genetic algorithm. To enhance reproducibility and traceability of the
explanations, each of them was generated from several different seeds, randomly
chosen. The observed results show remarkable agreement between different seeds.
Despite the stochastic nature of LIME explanations, regions of high explanation
weights proved to have good agreement in the heat maps, as computed by
pixel-wise relative standard deviations. The found heat maps coincide with
expert medical segmentations, which demonstrates that this methodology can find
high quality explanations (according to the evaluation metrics), with the novel
advantage of automated parameter fine tuning. These results give additional
insight into the inner workings of neural network black box decision making for
medical data.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Adversarial Perturbations Fool Deepfake Detectors. (arXiv:2003.10596v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10596</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10596</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This work uses adversarial perturbations to enhance deepfake images and fool
common deepfake detectors. We created adversarial perturbations using the Fast
Gradient Sign Method and the Carlini and Wagner L2 norm attack in both blackbox
and whitebox settings. Detectors achieved over 95% accuracy on unperturbed
deepfakes, but less than 27% accuracy on perturbed deepfakes. We also explore
two improvements to deepfake detectors: (i) Lipschitz regularization, and (ii)
Deep Image Prior (DIP). Lipschitz regularization constrains the gradient of the
detector with respect to the input in order to increase robustness to input
perturbations. The DIP defense removes perturbations using generative
convolutional neural networks in an unsupervised manner. Regularization
improved the detection of perturbed deepfakes on average, including a 10%
accuracy boost in the blackbox case. The DIP defense achieved 95% accuracy on
perturbed deepfakes that fooled the original detector, while retaining 98%
accuracy in other cases on a 100 image subsample.

	<description>Tau, a microtubule-associated protein that modifies the dynamic properties and organization of microtubules in neurons and affects axonal transport, shows remarkable heterogeneity, with multiple isoforms (45–65 kDa) generated by alternative splicing. A high-molecular-weight (HMW) isoform (110 kDa) that contains an additional large exon termed 4a was discovered more than 25 years ago. This isoform, called Big tau, is expressed mainly in the adult peripheral nervous system (PNS), but also in adult neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) that extend processes into the periphery.</description>

	<description>The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, as pandemic. There is currently a lack of knowledge about the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2 infection. One major immunological question concerns antigenic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by analyzing plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, and from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that, while cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses may be rare, indicating the presence of non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Objective Extraction of Evoked Event-related Oscillations from Time-frequency Representation of Event-related Potentials</title>

	<description>Evoked event-related oscillations (EROs) have been widely used to explore the mechanisms of brain activities for both normal people and neuropsychiatric disease patients. The selection of regions of evoked EROs tends to be subjectively based on the previous studies and the visual inspection of grand averaged time-frequency representations (TFRs) which causes some missing or redundant information. Meanwhile, the evoked EROs cannot be fully extracted via the conventional time-frequency analysis (TFA) method because they are sometimes overlapped with each other or with artifacts in time, frequency, and space domains to some extent. Hence, these shortcomings may pose some challenges to investigate the related neuronal processes. A data-driven approach was introduced to fill the gaps as below: extracting the temporal and spatial components of interest simultaneously by principal component analysis and Promax rotation and projecting them to the electrode field to correct their variance and polarity indeterminacy, calculating the TFRs of the back-projected components, and determining the regions of interest objectively using the edge detection algorithm. We performed this novel approach and the conventional TFA method in analyzing both a synthetic dataset and an actual ERP dataset in a two-factor simple gambling paradigm of waiting time (short/long) and feedback (loss/gain) separately. Synthetic dataset results indicated that N2-theta and P3-delta oscillations were detected using the proposed approach, but, by comparison, only one oscillation was obtained via the conventional TFA method. Furthermore, the actual ERP dataset results of P3-delta for our approach revealed that it was sensitive to the waiting time (which also was found in the previous reports) but not for that of the conventional TFA method. This study manifested that the proposed approach can objectively extract evoked EROs, which allows a better understanding of the modulations of the oscillatory responses.</description>

	<description>Somatic inputs originating from bioregulatory processes can guide cognition and behavior. One such bodily signal, mostly overlooked so far, is represented by visuo-vestibular coupling and its alteration, which in extreme cases may result in motion sickness. We argued that the inherently perturbed interoceptive state that follows can be a powerful determinant of human motivated behavior, resulting in a blunted response to appetitive stimuli and an exaggerated response to noxious ones. We sought to assess such differential impact of visuo-vestibular mismatches on value through a task involving conflict monitoring. We therefore administered to 42 healthy participants a modified version of the Flankers task, in which distractors (arrows, pointing in either a congruent or incongruent direction) signaled the availability of monetary incentives (gains, losses, or neutral trials). While performing the task, participants received either galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), or sham stimulation. We have found impaired behavioral performances when value, which was attached to task-irrelevant information, was at stake. Gains and losses, interestingly, dissociated, and only the latter caused enhanced interference costs in the task, suggesting that negative incentives may be more effective in capturing human attention than positive ones. Finally, we have found some weak evidence for GVS to further increase the processing of losses, as suggested by even larger interference costs in this condition. Results were, however, overall ambiguous, and suggest that much more research is needed to better understand the link between the vestibular system and motivation.</description>

	<description>Restoring vision using optogenetics is an ideal medical application because the eye offers a direct window to access and stimulate the pathological area: the retina. Optogenetic therapy could be applied to diseases with photoreceptor degeneration such as retinitis pigmentosa. Here, we select the specific optogenetic construct that is now used in the clinical trial and assess the opsin functional efficacy on non-human primates retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We chose the microbial opsin ChrimsonR and showed that the vector AAV2.7m8 produced greater transfection in RGCs compared to AAV2, and that ChrimsonR attached to tdTomato (ChR-tdT) is more efficiently expressed than ChrimsonR. The 600 nm light activates the RGCs transfected with the vector AAV2.7m8-ChR-tdT from an irradiance of 1015 photons.cm-2.s-1. Vector doses of 5.1010 and 5.1011 vg/eye transfect up to 7000 RGCs/mm2 in the perifovea, with no significant immune reaction. Furthermore, using a multielectrode array we recorded RGCs responses starting from 1ms stimulus duration. Using the recorded activity we were able to decode stimulus information and estimate a theoretical visual acuity of 20/249, above legal blindness. Altogether, our results pave the way for the ongoing clinical trial with the AAV2.7m8-ChrimsonR-tdT vector for vision restoration in patients affected by retinitis pigmentosa.</description>

	<description>Understanding how certain brain regions relate to a specific neurological disorder or cognitive stimuli has been an important area of neuroimaging research. We propose BrainGNN, a graph neural network (GNN) framework to analyze functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) and discover neurological biomarkers. In contrast to feedforward neural networks (FNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) in traditional functional connectivity-based fMRI analysis methods, we construct weighted graphs from fMRI and apply a GNN to fMRI brain graphs. Considering the special property of brain graphs, we design novel brain ROI-aware graph convolutional layers (Ra-GNN) that leverages the topological and functional information of fMRI. Motivated by the need for transparency in medical image analysis, our BrainGNN contains ROI-selection pooling layers (R-pool) that highlight salient ROIs (nodes in the graph), so that we can infer which ROIs are important for prediction. Furthermore, we propose regularization terms - unit loss, topK pooling (TPK) loss and group-level consistency (GLC) loss - on pooling results to encourage reasonable ROI-selection and provide flexibility to preserve either individual- or group-level patterns. We apply the BrainGNN framework on two independent fMRI datasets: Autism Spectral Disorder (ASD) fMRI dataset and Human Connectome Project (HCP) 900 Subject Release. We investigate different choices of the hyperparameters and show that BrainGNN outperforms the alternative FNN, CNN and GNN-based fMRI image analysis methods in terms of classification accuracy. The obtained community clustering and salient ROI detection results show high correspondence with the previous neuroimaging-derived evidence of biomarkers for ASD and specific task states decoded in task-fMRI.</description>

	<description>Precisely timed production of dexterous actions is often destabilized in anxiogenic situations. Previous studies demonstrated that cognitive functions such as attention and working memory as well as autonomic nervous functions are susceptible to induced anxiety in skillful performance while playing sports or musical instruments. However, it is not known whether the degradation of motor functions, sensory perception, or sensorimotor control underlies such a compromise of skillful performance due to psychophysiological distress. Here, we addressed this issue through a series of behavioral experiments, which demonstrated no detrimental effects of the stress on the perceptual accuracy and precision of the finger movements in pianists. By contrast, after transiently delaying the timing of tone production while playing the piano, the local tempo was abnormally disrupted only under pressure. The results suggest that psychological stress degraded the temporal stability of movement control due to an abnormal increase in sensory feedback gain but not temporal perception or motor precision. A learning experiment further demonstrated that the temporal instability of auditory-motor control under pressure was alleviated after practicing piano while ignoring delayed auditory feedback but not after practicing while compensating for the delayed feedback. Together, these findings suggest an abnormal transition from feedforward to feedback control in expert piano performance in anxiogenic situations, which can be mitigated through specialized sensorimotor training that involves piano practice while volitionally ignoring the delayed provision of auditory feedback.</description>

	<description>Biomolecular condensates, membraneless organelles found throughout the cell, play critical roles in many aspects of cellular function. Ribonucleoprotein granules (RNPs), a type of biomolecular condensate found in neurons that are necessary for local protein synthesis and are involved in long-term potentiation (LTP). Several RNA-binding proteins present in RNPs are necessary for the synaptic plasticity involved in LTP and long-term memory. Most of these proteins possess low complexity motifs, allowing for increased promiscuity. We explore the role the low complexity motif plays for RNA binding protein cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 3 (CPEB3), a protein necessary for long-term memory persistence. We found that RNA binding and SUMOylation are necessary for CPEB3 localization to the P body, thereby having functional implications on translation. Here, we investigate the role of the low complexity motif of CPEB3 and find that it is necessary for P body localization and downstream targeting for local protein synthesis.</description>

	<description>Neurons in the CNS are distinguished from each other by their morphology, the types of the neurotransmitter they release, their synaptic connections, and their genetic profiles. While attempting to characterize the retinal bipolar cell (BC) input to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), we discovered a previously undescribed type of interneuron in mice and primates. This interneuron shares some morphological, physiological, and molecular features with traditional BCs, such as having dendrites that ramify in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) and axons that ramify in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) to relay visual signals from photoreceptors to inner retinal neurons. It also shares some features with amacrine cells, particularly Aii amacrine cells, such as their axonal morphology and possibly the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine, along with the expression of some amacrine cell specific markers. Thus, we unveil an unrecognized type of interneuron, which may play unique roles in vision.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Sex differences and effects of estrous stage on hippocampal-prefrontal theta communications</title>

	<description>Effective communication between the mammalian hippocampus and neocortex is essential to certain cognitive-behavioral tasks critical to survival in a changing environment. Notably, functional synchrony between local field potentials (LFPs) of the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) within the theta band (4-12 Hz) underlies innate avoidance behavior during approach-avoidance conflict tasks in male rodents. However, the physiology of vHPC-mPFC communications in females remains unestablished. Furthermore, little is known about how mPFC subdivisions functionally interact in the theta band with hippocampal subdivisions in both sexes in the absence of task demands. Given the established roles of biological sex and gonadal hormone status on innate avoidance behaviors and neuronal excitability, here, we characterize the effects of biological sex and female estrous stage on hippocampal-prefrontal theta signaling in freely-moving female and male rats. LFPs from vHPC, dorsal hippocampus (dHPC), mPFC-prelimbic (PrL), and mPFC-infralimbic (IL) were simultaneously recorded during spontaneous exploration of a familiar arena. Data suggest that theta phase and power in vHPC preferentially synchronize with PrL; conversely, dHPC and IL preferentially synchronize. Males displayed greater vHPC-PrL theta synchrony than females, despite similar regional frequency band power and inter-regional coherence. Additionally, several significant estrous-linked changes in hippocampal-prefrontal theta dynamics were observed. These findings support the hypothesis that biological sex and female estrous stage can both affect hippocampal-prefrontal theta signaling in a familiar environment. These findings establish novel research avenues concerning sexual dimorphisms and effects of gonadal hormone status in HPC-mPFC network activity pertaining to threat evaluation biomarkers.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Vasculature-staining with lipophilic dyes in tissue-cleared brains assessed by deep learning</title>

	<description>Visualization of the vasculature in three dimensions (3D) has become attractive, particularly in stroke models. 3D-reconstruction is aided by tissue-clearing, where the transparency allows imaging of fluorescent probes in deeper structures. The vasculature is commonly stained by fluorescent lipophilic dyes that are incorporated into the wall during transcardial perfusion. Nevertheless, tissue clearing involves extracting the light-scattering lipids, and hence also the lipid-appended dyes. The wash-out likely depends on dye and its aldehyde-fixability. Fixation secures cross-linking to proteins and hence retainment in the tissue. However, the compatibility of various types of dyes is largely unknown. We tested and compared 9 different dyes for vasculature staining and tolerance to lipid clearing, which was quantified using deep learning image segmentation. Among the dyes, we found a subset that is both cost-effective and compatible with tissue lipid clearing. We suggest these dyes will provide a valuable tool for future investigations.</description>

	<description>Oscillation-based models of speech perception postulate a cortical computational principle by which decoding is performed within a window structure derived by a segmentation process. In the syllable level segmentation is realized by a theta oscillator. We provide evidence for an analogous role of a delta oscillator at the phrasal level. We recorded MEG while participants performed a target identification task. Random-digit strings, with phrasal chunks of two digits, were presented at chunk rates inside or outside of the delta range. Strong periodicities were elicited by acoustic- driven chunk rates inside of delta, in superior and middle temporal areas and speech-motor integration areas. Periodicities were diminished or absent for chunk rates outside of the delta range, closely in line with behavioral performance. No periodicities were observed for top-down driven chunking conditions. Our findings show that phrasal chunking is correlated with acoustic-driven delta oscillations, expressing anatomically specific patterns of neuronal periodicities.</description>

	<description>Understanding how a network of interconnected neurons receives, stores, and processes information in the human brain is one of the outstanding scientific challenges of our time. The ability to reliably detect neuroelectric activities is essential to addressing this challenge. Optical recording using voltage-sensitive fluorescent probes has provided unprecedented flexibility for choosing regions of interest in recording neuronal activities. However, when recording at a high frame rate such as 500-1000 Hz, fluorescence-based voltage sensors often suffer from photobleaching and phototoxicity, which limit the recording duration. Here, we report a new approach, Electro-Chromic Optical REcording (ECORE), that achieves label-free optical recording of spontaneous neuroelectrical activities. ECORE utilizes the electrochromism of PEDOT:PSS thin films, whose optical absorption can be modulated by an applied voltage. Being based on optical reflection instead of fluorescence, ECORE offers the flexibility of an optical probe without suffering from photobleaching or phototoxicity. Using ECORE, we optically recorded spontaneous action potentials in cardiomyocytes, cultured hippocampal and dorsal root ganglion neurons, and brain slices. With minimal perturbation to cells, ECORE allows long-term optical recording over multiple days.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Plasma metabolomics of presymptomatic PSEN1-H163Y mutation carriers: A pilot study</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.16.093559v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background and Objective: PSEN1-H163Y carriers, at the presymptomatic stage, have reduced 18FDG-PET binding in the cerebrum of the brain [1]. This could imply dysfunctional energy metabolism in the brain. In this study, plasma of presymptomatic PSEN1 mutation carriers was analyzed to understand associated metabolic changes. Methods: We analyzed plasma from non-carriers (NC, n=8) and presymptomatic PSEN1-H163Y mutation carriers (MC, n=6) via untargeted metabolomics using gas and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, which identified 1199 metabolites. All the metabolites were compared between MC and NC using univariate analysis, as well as correlated with the ratio of Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40, using Spearman correlation. Altered metabolites were subjected to Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA). Results: When comparing between presymptomatic MC and NC, the levels of 116 different metabolites were altered. Out of 116, only 23 were annotated metabolites, which include amino acids, fatty acyls, bile acids, hexoses, purine nucleosides, carboxylic acids, and glycerophosphatidylcholine species. 1-docosapentaenoyl-GPC, glucose and uric acid were correlated with the ratio of plasma Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 (p&amp;lt;0.05). Conclusion: This study finds dysregulated metabolite classes, which are changed before the disease onset. Also, it provides an opportunity to compare with sporadic Alzheimer Disease. Observed findings in this study need to be validated in a larger and independent Familial Alzheimer Disease (FAD) cohort.</description>

	<description>Prior knowledge and beliefs influence our reasoning in daily life and may lead us to draw unwarranted conclusions with undesirable consequences. The underlying neural correlates of the interaction between belief and logic, prior to making logical decisions, are largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to identify brain regions important in distinguishing belief load of assumptions in logical decision making. Thirty-one healthy volunteers (18-29 years old) participated in an fMRI study and were asked to respond to a series of syllogistic arguments in which assumptions were either congruent (believable) or incongruent (unbelievable) with currently-held beliefs. An interpretable machine learning algorithm, an L1 regularized Support Vector Machine, was used to explain the discriminatory pattern of conditions given the brain activation patterns. Behavioral results confirmed that believable premises were endorsed more than unbelievable ones. Imaging results revealed that the thalamus, superior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, insula, and caudate are important in distinguishing belief load. Several connectivity patterns between the insula, amygdala, and IFG were deemed to be important in distinguishing believable from unbelievable assumptions. This is the first study to investigate neural mechanisms important in distinguishing belief load of assumptions using interpretable machine learning. We uncovered brain connections involved in differentiating belief load at different time points preceding the making of a logical decision. Our discovery provides new insights into the interaction between belief load of assumptions and logic systems and has important practical implications for social decisions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Evidence for enhancer noncoding RNAs (enhancer-ncRNAs) with gene regulatory functions relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders</title>

	<description>Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) comprise a significant proportion of the mammalian genome, but their biological significance in neurodevelopment and in diseases is poorly understood. In this study, we have performed a genome-wide investigation of human noncoding RNAs for cell regulatory functions in brain tissue. By analysing ENCODE regulatory features, associations with FANTOM5 tissue-specific enhancers, as well as tissue-specific expression profiles, we have identified 17,743 noncoding RNAs comprising at least one nervous system-related expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) polymorphism that is associated with protein coding genes. Of these, 908 brain-enriched noncoding RNAs (comprising 907 long noncoding RNAs and 1 pseudogene) also overlap with chromatin states characterised as enhancers. Based on these criteria, we referred to such noncoding RNAs with putative enhancer activity as brain &quot;enhancer-ncRNAs&quot;. To investigate their impact in neurodevelopmental disorders, we integrated GWAS SNPs and Copy Number Variation (CNV) data and found that 265 enhancer-ncRNAs were either mutated (CNV deletion or duplication) or contain at least one GWAS SNPs in the context of such conditions. Of these, the eQTL-associated gene for 82 enhancer-ncRNAs did not overlap with either GWAS SNPs or CNVs. However, in 23 of these 82 enhancer-ncRNAs, eQTL interaction was explained solely by the presence of each of these noncoding RNAs, suggesting in such contexts that mutations to neurodevelopment gene enhancers disrupt ncRNA interaction. We also cross-referenced our data with the DECIPHER database of clinical phenotypes to find that mutations to 34 of the 82 enhancer-ncRNAs are significantly associated with phenotypes including behavioural abnormality, and cognitive impairment. Taken together, we provide evidence for a distinct set of brain-enriched ncRNAs that influence genomic enhancers during neurodevelopment, suggesting enhancer mutations may be relevant to the functions for such ncRNAs in neurodevelopmental disorders.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Certain aspects of central presbycusis such as temporal processing can largely exist independent of peripheral presbycusis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deleterious age‐related changes in the central auditory nervous system have been referred to as central age‐related hearing impairment (ARHI) or central presbycusis. Central ARHI is often assumed to be the consequence of peripheral ARHI. However, it is possible that certain aspects of central ARHI are independent from peripheral ARHI. A confirmation of this possibility could lead to significant improvements in current rehabilitation practices. The major difficulty in addressing this issue arises from confounding factors, such as other age‐related changes in both the cochlea and central non‐auditory brain structures. Because gap detection is a common measure of central auditory temporal processing, and gap detection thresholds are less influenced by changes in other brain functions such as learning and memory, we investigated the potential relationship between age‐related peripheral hearing loss (i.e., audiograms) and age‐related changes in gap detection. Consistent with previous studies, a significant difference was found for gap detection thresholds between young and older adults. However, among older adults, no significant associations were observed between gap detection ability and several other independent variables including the pure tone audiogram average, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale‐Vocabulary score, gender, and age. Statistical analyses showed little or no contributions from these independent variables to gap detection thresholds. Thus, our data indicate that age‐related decline in central temporal processing is largely independent of peripheral ARHI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Mammalian grid cells represent spatial locations in the brain via triangular firing patterns that tessellate the environment. They are regarded as the biological substrate for path integration thereby generating an efficient code for space. However, grid cell patterns are strongly influenced by environmental manipulations, in particular exhibiting local geometrical deformations and defects tied to the shape of the recording enclosure, challenging the view that grid cells constitute a universal code for space. We show that the observed responses to environmental manipulations arise as a natural result under the general framework of feedforward models with spatially unstructured feedback inhibition, which puts the development of triangular patterns in the context of a Turing pattern formation process over physical space. The model produces coherent neuronal populations with equal grid spacing, field size, and orientation.</description>

	<description>Ascending visual projections similar to the mammalian thalamocortical pathway are found in a wide range of vertebrate species, but their homologous relationship is debated. To get better insights into their evolutionary origin, we examined the developmental origin of a visual relay nucleus in zebrafish (a teleost fish). Similarly to the tectofugal visual thalamic nuclei in amniotes, the lateral part of the preglomerular complex (PG) in teleosts receives tectal information and projects to the pallium. However, our cell lineage study reveals that the majority of PG cells are derived from the midbrain, not from the forebrain. We also demonstrate that the PG projection neurons develop gradually until juvenile stage, unlike the thalamic projection neurons. Our data suggest that teleost PG is not homologous to the amniote thalamus and that thalamocortical-like projections can evolve from a non-forebrain cell population. Thus, sensory pathways in vertebrate brains exhibit a surprising degree of variation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Machine Learning Identifies Novel Candidates for DrugRepurposing in Alzheimer's Disease</title>

	<description>Clinical trials of novel therapeutics for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have consumed a large amount of time and resources with largely negative results. Repurposing drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for another indication is a more rapid and less expensive option. Repurposing can yield a useful therapeutic and also accelerate proof of concept studies that ultimately lead to a new molecular entity. We present a novel machine learning framework, DRIAD (Drug Repurposing In AD), that quantifies potential associations between the pathology of AD severity (the Braak stage) and molecular mechanisms as encoded in lists of gene names. DRIAD was validated on gene lists known to be associated with AD from other studies and subsequently applied to evaluate lists of genes arising from perturbations in differentiated human neural cell cultures by 80 FDA-approved and clinically tested drugs, producing a ranked list of possible repurposing candidates. Top-scoring drugs were inspected for common trends among their nominal molecular targets and their &quot;off-targets&quot;, revealing a high prevalence of kinases from the Janus (JAK), Unc-51-like (ULK) and NIMA-related (NEK) families. These kinase families are known to modulate pathways related to innate immune signaling, autophagy, and microtubule formation and function, suggesting possible disease-modifying mechanisms of action. We propose that the DRIAD method can be used to nominate drugs that, after additional validation and identification of relevant pharmacodynamic biomarker(s), could be evaluated in a clinical trial.</description>

	<description>As neuroscience datasets continue to grow in size, the complexity of data analyses can require a detailed understanding and implementation of systems computer science for storage, access, processing, and sharing. Currently, several general data standards (e.g., Zarr, HDF5, precompute, tensorstore) and purpose-built ecosystems (e.g., BossDB, CloudVolume, DVID, and Knossos) exist. Each of these systems has advantages and limitations and is most appropriate for different use cases. Using datasets that don't fit into RAM in this heterogeneous environment is challenging, and significant barriers exist to leverage underlying research investments. In this manuscript, we outline our perspective for how to approach this challenge through the use of community provided, standardized interfaces that unify various computational backends and abstract computer science challenges from the scientist. We introduce desirable design patterns and our reference implementation called intern.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Hsp70 chaperone blocks α-synuclein oligomer formation via a novel engagement mechanism</title>

	<description>Over-expression and aggregation of alpha-synuclein (ASyn) are linked to the onset and pathology of Parkinsons disease and related synucleinopathies. Elevated levels of the stress induced chaperone, Hsp70, protects against ASyn misfolding and ASyn-driven neurodegeneration in cell and animal models, yet there is minimal mechanistic understanding of this important protective pathway. It is generally assumed that Hsp70 binds to ASyn using its canonical and promiscuous substrate-binding cleft to limit aggregation. Here we report that this activity is due to a novel and unexpected mode of Hsp70 action, involving neither ATP nor the typical substrate-binding cleft. We use novel ASyn oligomerization assays to show that Hsp70 directly blocks ASyn oligomerization, an early event in ASyn misfolding. Using truncations, mutations and inhibitors, we confirmed that Hsp70 interacts with ASyn via an as yet unidentified, non-canonical interaction site in the C-terminal domain. Finally, a biological role for a non-canonical interaction was observed in H4 neuroglioma cells. Together, these findings suggest that new chemical approaches will be required to target Hsp70-ASyn interaction in synucleinopathies. Such approaches are likely to be more specific than targeting Hsp70 canonical actions. Additionally, these results raise the question of whether other misfolded proteins might also engage via the same non-canonical mechanism.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Astrocytes close a critical period of motor circuit plasticity</title>

	<description>Critical periods- brief intervals where neural circuits can be modified by sensory input- are necessary for proper neural circuit assembly. Extended critical periods are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia and autism; however, the mechanisms that ensure timely critical period closure remain unknown. Here, we define the extent of a critical period in the developing Drosophila motor circuit, and identify astrocytes as essential for proper critical period termination. During the critical period, decreased activity produces larger motor dendrites with fewer inhibitory inputs; conversely, increased motor neuron activity produces smaller motor dendrites with fewer excitatory inputs. Importantly, activity has little effect on dendrite morphology after critical period closure. Astrocytes invade the neuropil just prior to critical period closure, and astrocyte ablation prolongs the critical period. Finally, we use a genetic screen to identify astrocyte-motor neuron signaling pathways that close the critical period, including Neuroligin-Neurexin signaling. Reduced signaling destabilizes dendritic microtubules, increases dendrite dynamicity, and impairs locomotor behavior, underscoring the importance of critical period closure. Previous work defines astroglia as regulators of plasticity at individual synapses; here, we show that astrocytes also regulate large-scale structural plasticity to motor dendrite, and thus, circuit architecture to ensure proper locomotor behavior.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Dopaminergic neuromodulation of spike timing dependent plasticity in mature adult rodent and human cortical neurons</title>

	<description>Synapses in the cerebral cortex constantly change and this dynamic property, together with the action of neuromodulators such as dopamine (DA), is essential for reward learning and memory. DA modulates spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), a cellular model of learning and memory, in juvenile rodent cortical neurons. However, it is unknown whether this neuromodulation also occurs at excitatory synapses of cortical neurons in mature adult mice or in humans. Cortical layer V pyramidal neurons were recorded with whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology and an extracellular stimulating electrode was used to induce STDP. DA was either pharmacologically applied or optogenetically released in slices from mice. Classical STDP induction protocols triggered non-Hebbian excitatory synaptic depression or no plasticity at mouse or human cortical synapses, respectively. DA reverted long term synaptic depression to baseline or elicited long term synaptic potentiation at mouse or human cortical synapses, respectively. Furthermore, when DA was applied during a STDP protocol it depressed presynaptic inhibition in the mouse but not in the human cortex. The data demonstrate that DA gates excitatory synaptic plasticity at mature adult human cortical excitatory synapses showing unique features that differ from the DA modulation observed in cortical synapses from mature adult mice. Our finding that DA can trigger long term synaptic potentiation of cortical excitatory synapses of humans strengthens the importance of this neuromodulator in gating cognitive processes. This result may inform on therapeutic interventions to recover brain function in learning and memory diseases.</description>

	<description>Altered neural excitability is considered a prominent contributing factor to cognitive decline during aging. A clear example is the excess neural activity observed in several temporal lobe structures of cognitively impaired older individuals in rodents and humans. At a cellular level, aging-related changes in mechanisms regulating intrinsic excitability have been well examined in pyramidal cells of the CA1 hippocampal subfield. Studies in the inbred Fisher 344 rat strain document an age-related increase in the slow afterhyperpolarization (AHP) that normally occurs after a burst of action potentials, and serves to reduce subsequent firing. We evaluated the status of the AHP in the outbred Long-Evans rat, a well-established model for studing individual differences in neurocognitive aging. In contrast to the findings reported in the Fisher 344 rats, in the Long-Evan rats we detected a selective reduction in AHP in cognitively impaired aged individuals. We discuss plausible scenarios to account for these differences and also discuss possible implications of these differences.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Stress induces divergent gene expression among lateral habenula efferent pathways</title>

	<description>The lateral habenula (LHb) integrates critical information regarding aversive stimuli that shapes decision making and behavioral responses. The three major LHb outputs innervate dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg). LHb neurons that project to these targets are segregated and nonoverlapping, and this led us to consider whether they have distinct molecular phenotypes and adaptations to stress exposure. In order to capture a time-locked profile of gene expression after repeated forced swim stress, we used intersectional expression of RiboTag in rat LHb neurons and next-gen RNA sequencing to interrogate the RNAs actively undergoing translation from each of these pathways. The &quot;translatome&quot; in the neurons comprising these pathways was similar at baseline, but diverged after stress, especially in the neurons projecting to the RMTg. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we found one module comprising genes downregulated after stress in the RMTg-projecting LHb neurons; there was an overrepresentation of genes associated with phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) signaling in this module. Reduced PI3K signaling in RMTg-projecting LHb neurons may be a compensatory adaptation that alters the functional balance of LHb outputs to GABAergic vs. monoaminergic neurons following repeated stress exposure.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: MESMERISED: Super-accelerated 7 T STEAM imaging for quantitative multi-contrast and diffusion MRI</title>

	<description>There is an increasing interest in quantitative imaging of T1, T2 and diffusion contrast in the brain due to greater robustness against bias fields and artifacts, as well as better biophysical interpretability in terms of microstructure. However, acquisition time constraints are a challenge, particularly when multiple quantitative contrasts are desired and when extensive sampling of diffusion directions, high b-values or long diffusion times are needed for multi-compartment microstructure modeling. Although ultra-high fields of 7 T and above have desirable properties for many MR modalities, the shortening T2 and the high specific absorption rate (SAR) of inversion and refocusing pulses bring great challenges to quantitative T1, T2 and diffusion imaging. Here, we present the MESMERISED sequence (Multiplexed Echo Shifted Multiband Excited and Recalled Imaging of STEAM Encoded Diffusion). MESMERISED removes the dead time in Stimulated Echo Acquisition Mode (STEAM) imaging by an echo-shifting mechanism. The echo-shift (ES) factor is independent of multiband (MB) acceleration and allows for very high multiplicative (ESxMB) acceleration factors, particularly under moderate and long mixing times. This results in high duty cycle and time efficiency at 7 T, particularly for quantitative T1 and diffusion imaging, while also retaining the capacity to perform quantitative T2 and B1 mapping. We demonstrate the super-acceleration of MESMERISED for whole-brain T1 relaxometry with total acceleration factors up to 36 at 1.8 mm isotropic resolution, and up to 54 at 1.25 mm resolution qT1 imaging, corresponding to a 6x and 9x speed-up, respectively, compared to MB-only accelerated acquisitions. We demonstrate quantitative T2 and B1 mapping to illustrate multi-contrast mapping with the same MESMERISED sequence and the same readout train. Finally, we demonstrate highly efficient diffusion MRI with high b-values and long diffusion times in two separate cases. First, we show that super-accelerated multi-shell diffusion acquisitions with 370 whole-brain diffusion volumes over 8 b-value shells up to b = 7000 s/mm2 can be generated at 2 mm isotropic in under 8 minutes, a data rate of almost a volume per second, or at 1.8 mm isotropic in under 11 minutes. Second, we demonstrate time-efficient sampling of different diffusion times with 1.8 mm isotropic diffusion data acquired at four diffusion times up to 290 ms, which supports both Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) at each diffusion time. MESMERISED extends possibilities to efficiently probe T1, T2 and diffusion contrast for multi-component modeling of tissue microstructure.</description>

	<description>Circuit interactions within the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) translate movement into a coherent code for spatial location. Entorhinal principal cells are subject to strong lateral inhibition, suggesting that a disinhibitory mechanism may drive their activation. Cortical Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) expressing inhibitory neurons predominantly contact interneurons, providing a local disinhibitory mechanism. Here, we investigate the electrophysiological and morphological properties of VIP cells using in vitro whole-cell patch clamp recordings and use rabies-mediated circuit tracing to discover long-range inputs that may modulate this population in mice. We report physiological and morphological properties of VIP cells that differ across lamina and along the dorsal-ventral MEC axis. Furthermore, we reveal long-range inputs to VIP neurons from regions known to encode proprioceptive and auditory information, including the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus and superior para-olivary nuclei, respectively. These results characterize the properties of VIP cells and reveal sensory modalities that could drive disinhibition in the MEC.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Dopamine influences attentional rate modulation in Macaque posterior parietal cortex</title>

	<description>Selective attention facilitates the prioritization of task-relevant sensory inputs over those which are irrelevant. Although cognitive neuroscience has made great strides in understanding the neural substrates of attention, our understanding of its neuropharmacology is incomplete. Cholinergic and glutamatergic contributions have been demonstrated, but emerging evidence also suggests an important influence of dopamine (DA). DA has historically been investigated in the context of frontal/prefrontal function arguing that dopaminergic receptor density in the posterior/parietal cortex is sparse. However, this notion was derived from rodent data, whereas in primates DA innervation in parietal cortex matches that of many prefrontal areas. We recorded single- and multi-unit activity whilst iontophoretically administering dopaminergic agonists and antagonists to posterior parietal cortex of rhesus macaques engaged in a spatial attention task. Out of 88 neurons, 50 showed modulation of activity induced by drug administration. Dopamine inhibited firing rates across the population according to an inverted-U shaped dose-response curve. D1 receptor antagonists diminished firing rates in broad-spiking units according to a monotonically increasing function. Additionally, dopamine modulated attentional signals in broad, but not narrow-spiking cells. Finally, both drugs modulated the pupil light reflex. These data show that dopamine plays an important role in shaping neuronal responses and modulates attentional processing in macaque parietal cortex.</description>

	<description>Cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) harbor a peculiar presynaptic organelle, the ribbon, which is essential for aggregating synaptic vesicles and organizing Ca2+ channels at the active zone. Emerging evidence suggests that damage to the ribbon synapses represents an important form of cochlear synaptopathy that seems prevalent in age-related sensorineural hearing loss. The functional changes occurring at these synapses during aging are not fully understood. Here, we characterized the age-related changes in IHCs of C57BL/6J mice, a strain which is known to carry a cadherin23 mutation and experiences early hearing loss with age. We found a progressive loss of synaptic ribbons with aging, starting before postnatal day 180 (P180) and reaching up to 50 % loss in middle age mice at P365. A deletion of the Otof gene, encoding the Ca2+ sensor otoferlin produced an accelerated loss of IHC ribbons with aging, with a 50 % loss by P60. In both Otof +/+ and Otof -/- C57BL/6J mice, the synaptic ribbons became larger with aging and IHCs displayed a drastic cell surface reduction with a large decrease in extrasynaptic BK-channel expression. These changes are indicative of oxidative stress and synaptic autophagy as suggested by an increased expression of the autophagosomal protein LC3B. Furthermore, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and calcium imaging in IHCs from old Otof +/+ P365 C57BL/6J mice indicated an increase in Ca2+-channel density and a stronger exocytosis at the remaining ribbon active zones, suggesting synaptic release potentiation possibly explaining hyperacusis and recruitment in the elderly.</description>

	<description>Altricial mammals are born with immature nervous systems comprised of circuits that do not yet have the neuronal properties and connectivity required to produce future behaviours. During the critical period of post-natal development, neuronal properties are tuned to participate in functional circuits. In rodents, cervical motoneurons are born prior to lumbar motoneurons, and spinal cord development follows a sequential rostro-caudal sequence. Here we asked whether birth order is reflected in the post-natal development of electrophysiological properties. We show that motoneurons of both segments have similar properties at birth and follow the same developmental profile, with maximal firing increasing and excitability decreasing into the 3rd post-natal week. However, these maturative processes occur in cervical prior to lumbar motoneurons, correlating to the timing of arrival of descending systems. These results suggest that motoneuron properties do not mature by cell autonomous mechanisms alone, but rather depend on developing descending and spinal circuits.</description>

	<description>Acute cardiovascular exercise has shown to promote neuroplastic processes, and thus to improve the consolidation of newly acquired motor skills in healthy adults. First results suggest that this concept may be transferred to populations with motor and cognitive dysfunctions. In this context, Parkinson's disease (PD) is highly relevant since patients demonstrate deficits in motor learning. Hence, in the present study we sought to explore the effect of a single post-practice exercise bout on motor memory consolidation in PD patients. For this purpose, 17 PD patients (Hoehn and Yahr: 1 - 2.5, age: 60.1 +/- 7.9 y) practiced a whole-body task followed by either (i) a moderate-intense bout of cycling, or (ii) seated rest for a total of 30 minutes. The motor task required the participants to balance on a tiltable platform (stabilometer) for 30 seconds. During skill practice, patients performed 15 trials followed by a retention test 1 day and 7 days later. We calculated time in balance (platform within +/- 5 degree from horizontal) for each trial and within- and between-group differences in memory consolidation (i.e. offline learning = skill change from last acquisition block to retention tests) were analyzed. Groups revealed similar improvements during skill practice (F4,60 = .316, p = .866), but showed differences in offline learning, which was only evident after 7 days (F1,14 = 5.602, p = .033). Our results suggest that a single post-practice exercise bout is effective in enhancing long-term motor memory consolidation in a population with motor learning impairments. This may point at unique promoting effects of exercise on dopamine neurotransmission involved in memory formation. Future studies should investigate the potential role of exercise-induced effects on the dopaminergic system.</description>

	<description>Background: Cerebellar damage is common in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) and is associated with worse progression and relapse recovery. Studies into the importance of the cerebellum in pwMS are hampered by limited understanding of cerebellar damage and its relation to cerebellar function in pwMS. Objective: Examine axonal loss, as a primary driver of progressive neurological decline, in the cerebellum using advanced diffusion MRI and compare axonal loss with cerebellar dysfunction in pwMS. Methods: We recruited 55 pwMS and 14 healthy controls. Clinical assessments included scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA), and Bain tremor ratings. Subjects underwent FLAIR, T1-weighted and diffusion MRI. Cerebellar grey and white matter and lesion volume were calculated. Cerebellar axonal loss was examined with fibre-specific markers. Fibre density and cross-section (FDC) accounts for microscopic and macroscopic changes in a fibre bundle. Results: Loss of cerebellar FDC was associated with increased SARA (r=-0.42, p&amp;lt;0.01) and tremor severity (rho=-0.35, p=0.01). Cerebellar lesion volume correlated with SARA (r=0.49, p&amp;lt;0.01) and tremor severity (rho=0.41, p=0.01). Conclusion: Fibre-specific measures of cerebellar pathology could provide a functionally relevant marker of cerebellar damage in MS. Future trials using fibre-specific markers are needed to further characterize cerebellar pathology in pwMS and understand its significance in disease progression.</description>

The human affect system is responsible for producing the positive and negative feelings that color and guide our lives. At the same time, when disrupted, its workings lie at the basis of the occurrence of mood disorder. Understanding the functioning and dynamics of the affect system is therefore crucial to understand the feelings that people experience on a daily basis, their dynamics across time, and how they can become dysregulated in mood disorder. In this paper, a nonlinear stochastic model for the dynamics of positive and negative affect is proposed called the Affective Ising Model (AIM). It incorporates principles of statistical mechanics, is inspired by neurophysiological and behavioral evidence about auto-excitation and mutual inhibition of the positive and negative affect dimensions, and is intended to better explain empirical phenomena such as skewness, multimodality, and non-linear relations of positive and negative affect. The AIM is applied to two large experience sampling studies on the occurrence of positive and negative affect in daily life in both normality and mood disorder. It is examined to what extent the model is able to reproduce the aforementioned non-Gaussian features observed in the data, using two sightly different continuous-time vector autoregressive (VAR) models as benchmarks. The predictive performance of the models is also compared by means of leave-one-out cross-validation. The results indicate that the AIM is better at reproducing non-Gaussian features while their performance is comparable for strictly Gaussian features. The predictive performance of the AIM is also shown to be better for the majority of the affect time series. The potential and limitations of the AIM as a computational model approximating the workings of the human affect system are discussed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9AUmWLqrtr0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

When can ecological interactions drive an entire ecosystem into a persistent non-equilibrium state, where many species populations fluctuate without going to extinction? We show that high-diversity spatially heterogeneous systems can exhibit chaotic dynamics which persist for extremely long times. We develop a theoretical framework, based on dynamical mean-field theory, to quantify the conditions under which these fluctuating states exist, and predict their properties. We uncover parallels with the persistence of externally-perturbed ecosystems, such as the role of perturbation strength, synchrony and correlation time. But uniquely to endogenous fluctuations, these properties arise from the species dynamics themselves, creating feedback loops between perturbation and response. A key result is that fluctuation amplitude and species diversity are tightly linked: in particular, fluctuations enable dramatically more species to coexist than at equilibrium in the very same system. Our findings highlight crucial differences between well-mixed and spatially-extended systems, with implications for experiments and their ability to reproduce natural dynamics. They shed light on the maintenance of biodiversity, and the strength and synchrony of fluctuations observed in natural systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SeW8ir14OPs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The human genome harbors a variety of genetic variations. Single-nucleotide changes that alter amino acids in protein-coding regions are one of the major causes of human phenotypic variation and diseases. These single-amino acid variations (SAVs) are routinely found in whole genome and exome sequencing. Evaluating the functional impact of such genomic alterations is crucial for diagnosis of genetic disorders. We developed DeepSAV, a deep-learning convolutional neural network to differentiate disease-causing and benign SAVs based on a variety of protein sequence, structural and functional properties. Our method outperforms most stand-alone programs, and the version incorporating population and gene-level information (DeepSAV+PG) has similar predictive power as some of the best available. We transformed DeepSAV scores of rare SAVs in the human population into a quantity termed “mutation severity measure” for each human protein-coding gene. It reflects a gene's tolerance to deleterious missense mutations and serves as a useful tool to study gene-disease associations. Genes implicated in cancer, autism, and viral interaction are found by this measure as intolerant to mutations, while genes associated with a number of other diseases are scored as tolerant. Among known disease-associated genes, those that are mutation-intolerant are likely to function in development and signal transduction pathways, while those that are mutation-tolerant tend to encode metabolic and mitochondrial proteins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WiZE8G7kv4s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Standard infectious disease practice calls for aggressive drug treatment that rapidly eliminates the pathogen population before resistance can emerge. When resistance is absent, this elimination strategy can lead to complete cure. However, when resistance is already present, removing drug-sensitive cells as quickly as possible removes competitive barriers that may slow the growth of resistant cells. In contrast to the elimination strategy, a containment strategy aims to maintain the maximum tolerable number of pathogens, exploiting competitive suppression to achieve chronic control. Here, we combine in vitro experiments in computer-controlled bioreactors with mathematical modeling to investigate whether containment strategies can delay failure of antibiotic treatment regimens. To do so, we measured the “escape time” required for drug-resistant &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; populations to eclipse a threshold density maintained by adaptive antibiotic dosing. Populations containing only resistant cells rapidly escape the threshold density, but we found that matched resistant populations that also contain the maximum possible number of sensitive cells could be contained for significantly longer. The increase in escape time occurs only when the threshold density—the acceptable bacterial burden—is sufficiently high, an effect that mathematical models attribute to increased competition. The findings provide decisive experimental confirmation that maintaining the maximum number of sensitive cells can be used to contain resistance when the size of the population is sufficiently large.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qYb_asQrd9M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Effect of Circuit Structure on Odor Representation in the Insect Olfactory System</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In neuroscience, the structure of a circuit has often been used to intuit function—an inversion of Louis Kahn’s famous dictum, &quot;Form follows function&quot; (Kristan and Katz, 2006). However, different brain networks may use different network architectures to solve the same problem. The olfactory circuits of two insects, the locust, &lt;i&gt;Schistocerca americana,&lt;/i&gt; and the fruit fly, &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, serve the same function—to identify and discriminate odors. The neural circuitry that achieves this shows marked structural differences. Projection neurons (PNs) in the antennal lobe innervate Kenyon cells (KCs) of the mushroom body. In locust, each KC receives inputs from ~50% of PNs, a scheme that maximizes the difference between inputs to any two of ~50,000 KCs. In contrast, in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, this number is only 5% and appears suboptimal. Using a computational model of the olfactory system, we show that the activity of KCs is sufficiently high-dimensional that it can separate similar odors regardless of the divergence of PN–KC connections. However, when temporal patterning encodes odor attributes, dense connectivity outperforms sparse connections. Increased separability comes at the cost of reliability. The disadvantage of sparse connectivity can be mitigated by incorporating other aspects of circuit architecture seen in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Our simulations predict that &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; and locust circuits lie at different ends of a continuum where the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; gives up on the ability to resolve similar odors to generalize across varying environments, while the locust separates odor representations but risks misclassifying noisy variants of the same odor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: An Intersectional Viral-Genetic Method for Fluorescent Tracing of Axon Collaterals Reveals Details of Noradrenergic Locus Coeruleus Structure</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the function of broadly projecting neurons depends on comprehensive knowledge of the distribution and targets of their axon collaterals. While retrograde tracers and, more recently, retrograde viral vectors have been used to identify efferent projections, they have limited ability to reveal the full pattern of axon collaterals from complex, heterogeneous neuronal populations. Here we describe TrAC (tracing axon collaterals), an intersectional recombinase-based viral-genetic strategy that allows simultaneous visualization of axons from a genetically defined neuronal population and a projection-based subpopulation. To test this new method, we have applied TrAC to analysis of locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE)-containing neurons projecting to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and primary motor cortex (M1) in laboratory mice. TrAC allowed us to label each projection-based LC-NE subpopulation, together with all remaining LC-NE neurons, in isolation from other noradrenergic populations. This analysis revealed mPFC-projecting and M1-projecting LC-NE subpopulations differ from each other and from the LC as a whole in their patterns of axon collateralization. Thus, TrAC complements and extends existing axon tracing methods by permitting analyses that have not previously been possible with complex genetically defined neuronal populations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vascular structures in the developing brain are thought to form via angiogenesis from preformed blood vessels in the cephalic mesenchyme. Immunohistochemical studies of developing mouse brain from E10.5–E13.5 revealed the presence of avascular blood islands of primitive erythroid cells expressing the hemangioblast markers (Flk1, Tal1/Scl1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 [PECAM1], vascular endothelial‐cadherin [VE‐cadherin] and CD34) and an endothelial marker recognized by &lt;i&gt;Griffonia simplicifolia&lt;/i&gt; isolectin B4 (IB4) in the cephalic mesenchyme. These cells formed a perineural vascular plexus from which angiogenic sprouts originated and penetrated the neuroepithelium. In addition, avascular isolated cells expressing primitive erythroid, hemangioblast and endothelial makers were visible in the neuroepithelium where they generated vasculogenic and hemogenic foci. From E10.5–E13.5, these vasculogenic foci were a source of new blood vessel formation in the developing brain. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, cultured E13.5 brain endothelial cells contained hemogenic endothelial cells capable of generating erythroid cells. Similar cells were present in primary cultures of dissociated cells from E10.5 embryonic head. Our results provide new evidence that the brain vasculature, like that of the yolk sac and the eye choriocapillaris and hyaloid vascular systems, develops at least in part via hemovasculogenesis, a process in which vasculogenesis and hematopoiesis occur simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A major part of the circuit that coordinates bladder voiding is found in the lumbosacral spinal cord. Here we use c‐Fos and EGR‐1 (Zif268) activity mapping of lumbosacral spinal cord to investigate cystometry‐induced micturition in awake female and male rats. In both sexes, most c‐Fos neurons were identified as excitatory by their absence of Pax2 expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this approach, we have identified sex differences that were not detected by previous studies in anesthetized rats.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storage and voiding of urine from the lower urinary tract (LUT) must be timed precisely to occur in appropriate behavioral contexts. A major part of the CNS circuit that coordinates this activity is found in the lumbosacral spinal cord. Immediate early gene (IEG) activity mapping has been widely used to investigate the lumbosacral LUT‐related circuit, but most reports focus on the effects of noxious stimulation in anesthetized female rats. Here we use c‐Fos and EGR‐1 (Zif268) activity mapping of lumbosacral spinal cord to investigate cystometry‐induced micturition in awake female and male rats. In females, after cystometry c‐Fos neurons in spinal cord segments L5‐S2 were concentrated in the sacral parasympathetic nucleus (SPN), dorsal horn laminae II‐IV, and dorsal commissural nucleus (SDCom). Comparisons of cystometry and control groups in male and female revealed sex differences. Activity mapping suggested dorsal horn laminae II‐IV was activated in females but showed net inhibition in males. However, inhibition in male rats was not detected by EGR‐1 activity mapping, which showed low coexpression with c‐Fos. A class of catecholamine neurons in SPN and SDCom neurons were also more strongly activated by micturition in females. In both sexes, most c‐Fos neurons were identified as excitatory by their absence of Pax2 expression. In conclusion, IEG mapping in awake male and female rats has extended our understanding of the functional molecular anatomy of the LUT‐related circuit in spinal cord. Using this approach, we have identified sex differences that were not detected by previous studies in anesthetized rats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Synchronicity of excitatory inputs drives hippocampal networks to distinct oscillatory patterns</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rodent hippocampus expresses a variety of neuronal network oscillations depending on the behavioral state of the animal. Locomotion and active exploration are accompanied by theta‐nested gamma oscillations while resting states and slow‐wave sleep are dominated by intermittent sharp wave‐ripple complexes. It is believed that gamma rhythms create a framework for efficient acquisition of information whereas sharp wave‐ripples are thought to be involved in consolidation and retrieval of memory. While not strictly mutually exclusive, one of the two patterns usually dominates in a given behavioral state. Here we explore how different input patterns induce either of the two network states, using an optogenetic stimulation approach in hippocampal brain slices of mice. We report that the pattern of the evoked oscillation depends strongly on the initial synchrony of activation of excitatory cells within CA3. Short, synchronous activation favors the emergence of sharp wave‐ripple complexes while persistent but less synchronous activity—as typical for sensory input during exploratory behavior—supports the generation of gamma oscillations. This dichotomy is reflected by different degrees of synchrony of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents within these two states. Importantly, the induction of these two fundamental network patterns does not depend on the presence of any neuromodulatory transmitter like acetylcholine, but is merely based on a different synchrony in the initial activation pattern.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study reports an analysis of 20 T1‐weighted MRI scans from tufted capuchin monkeys (5 male, 15 female). We carried out a data‐driven, whole‐brain volumetric analysis on regional gray matter anatomy using voxel‐based morphometry. This revealed that males showed statistically significant expansion of a region of the hypothalamus, while females showed significant expansion in a distributed set of regions, including the cerebellum, early visual cortex, and higher‐order visual regions spanning occipital and temporal cortex. In order to elucidate the network connectivity of these regions, we employed probabilistic tractography on diffusion tensor imaging data. This showed that the female‐enlarged regions connect with distributed association networks across the brain. Notably, this contrasts with rodent studies, where sex differences are focused in deep, ancestral limbic regions involved in the control of reproductive behavior. Additionally, in our dataset, for several regions, male and female volumetric measures were completely non‐overlapping. This contrasts with human studies, where sex differences in cortical regions have been reported, but are characterized by overlapping rather than divergent male and female values. We suggest that these results can be understood in the context of the different lifetime experiences of males and females, which may produce increased experience‐dependent cortical plasticity in capuchins compared to rodents, and in humans compared to capuchins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Cell Specific Transcriptional Responses to Heat Shock in the Mouse Utricle Epithelium</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory epithelia of the inner ear contain mechanosensory hair cells and glia-like supporting cells, both of which are required for hearing and balance functions.  Each of these cell types has unique responses to ototoxic and cytoprotective stimuli.  Non-lethal heat stress in the mammalian utricle induces heat shock proteins (HSPs) and protects against ototoxic drug-induced hair cell death.  Induction of HSPs in the utricle demonstrates cell-type specificity at the protein level, with HSP70 induction occurring primarily in supporting cells, while HSP32 (also known as heme oxygenase 1, HMOX1) is induced primarily in resident macrophages.  Neither of these HSPs are robustly induced in hair cells, suggesting that hair cells may have little capacity for induction of stress-induced protective responses.  To determine the transcriptional responses to heat shock of these different cell types, we performed cell-type-specific transcriptional profiling using the RiboTag method, which allows for immunoprecipitation of actively translating mRNAs from specific cell types. RNA-Seq differential gene expression analyses demonstrated that the RiboTag method identified known cell type-specific markers as well as new markers for hair cells and supporting cells.  Gene expression differences suggest that hair cells and supporting cells exhibit differential transcriptional heat shock responses. The chaperonin family member Cct8 was significantly enriched only in heat-shocked hair cells, while Hspa1l (HSP70 family), and Hspb1 and Cryab (HSP27 and HSP20 families, respectively) were enriched only in supporting cells. Together our data indicate that hair cells exhibit a limited but unique heat shock response, and supporting cells exhibit a broader and more robust transcriptional response to protective heat stress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Early soft and flexible fusion of EEG and fMRI via tensor decompositions. (arXiv:2005.07134v1 [eess.SP])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Data fusion refers to the joint analysis of multiple datasets which provide
complementary views of the same task. In this preprint, the problem of jointly
analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) and functional Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (fMRI) data is considered. Jointly analyzing EEG and fMRI measurements
is highly beneficial for studying brain function because these modalities have
complementary spatiotemporal resolution: EEG offers good temporal resolution
while fMRI is better in its spatial resolution. The fusion methods reported so
far ignore the underlying multi-way nature of the data in at least one of the
modalities and/or rely on very strong assumptions about the relation of the two
datasets. In this preprint, these two points are addressed by adopting for the
first time tensor models in the two modalities while also exploring double
coupled tensor decompositions and by following soft and flexible coupling
approaches to implement the multi-modal analysis. To cope with the Event
Related Potential (ERP) variability in EEG, the PARAFAC2 model is adopted. The
results obtained are compared against those of parallel Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) and hard coupling alternatives in both simulated and real data.
Our results confirm the superiority of tensorial methods over methods based on
ICA. In scenarios that do not meet the assumptions underlying hard coupling,
the advantage of soft and flexible coupled decompositions is clearly
demonstrated.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07083</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The main result of this thesis is the development of a novel connectivity
estimation method, called Total Spiking Probability Edges (TSPE). Based on
cross-correlation and edge filtering at different time scales this method is
proposed and the theoretical framework is outlined in this work. TSPE enables
the classification between inhibitory and excitatory connections by using
recorded action potentials. To compare this method learning about state of the
art algorithms to estimate connectivity is necessary. After a research,
promising algorithms are implemented and evaluated for further research topics,
among others in the biomems lab of UAS Aschaffenburg. To evaluate these
algorithms in silico networks are used, because of their known connectivity.
This makes it possible to validate the correctness of our algorithm results.
Therefore, a biophysically representative neuronal network simulation is needed
first. Datasets were simulated in different ways and analysed in order to
develop an evaluation framework. After a successful evaluation with in silico
networks, in vitro experiments and their analyses complete this project.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: The universality of skipping behaviours on music streaming platforms. (arXiv:2005.06987v1 [cs.SI])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06987</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A recent study of skipping behaviour on music streaming platforms has shown
that the skip profile for a given song -- i.e. the measure of the skipping rate
as a function of the time in the song -- can be seen as some intrinsic
characteristic of the song, in the sense that it is both very specific and
highly stable over time and geographical regions. In this paper, we take this
analysis one step further by introducing a simple model of skip behaviours, in
which the skip profile for a given song is viewed as the response to a small
number of events that happen within it. In particular, it allows us to identify
accurately the timing of the events that trigger skip responses, as well as the
fraction of users who skip following each these events. Strikingly, the
responses triggered by individual events appears to follow a temporal profile
that is consistent across songs, genres, devices and listening contexts,
suggesting that people react to musical surprises in a universal way.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Music large-scale form, the structure of musical units ranging over several
bars, are studied using EEG measurements of 25 participants listened to the
first four minutes of a piece of electronic dance music (EDM). Grand-averages
of event-related potentials (ERPs) calculated for all electrodes show dynamics
in phase synchronization between different brain regions. Here local maxima of
the perceptual parameters correspond to strong synchronization, which culminate
at time points, where musical large-scale form boundaries were perceptually
expected. Significant differences between local maxima and minima were found,
using a Paired Samples t-test, showing global neural synchronization between
different brain regions most strongly in the gamma-band EEG frequency range.
Such synchronization increases before musical large-scale form boundaries, and
decreases afterwards, therefore representing musical large-scale form
perception.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Burst-suppression (BS) is a reliable electroencephalogram (EEG) indicator of
excessive deep anesthesia common in mammals. Since some intermittent events are
known to follow a power-law, we investigated the power-law hypothesis in BS by
comparing it with alternative functions focusing on flattish periods and
developed a new method for detecting BS as an application of statistical model
in dogs. Young-adult 6 beagles and senior 6 beagles were anesthetized with
sevoflurane 2.0%-5.0% and three of 64 sec EEG (256 Hz) from Fpz-T4 via scalp
electrodes were recorded. Three thresholds for peak-to-peak voltage were set:
mean value of peak-to-peak voltage at sevoflurane 2.0% in each dog (AS2%),
3mcrV, and 5mcrV. The subthreshold periods were discriminated as $\tau$ events.
We fitted the empirical probability distribution of $\tau$ by a power-law
distribution and an exponential distribution. These two distributions were
compared by the normalized log-likelihood ratio test to see which distribution
was better fit. At sevoflurane 2.0%-3.0%, by any threshold, the exponential
distribution became better fit in all dogs. The power-law distribution became
better fit only when BS expressed on EEG. No strict threshold was required for
detection of onset of BS. We showed a transition from exponential behavior to
power-law behavior on the right tail of $\tau$ distributions in response to the
appearance of suppression waves with increasing anesthetic. This will be a
robust tool for BS detection.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a new Statistical Forward Planning (SFP) method, Rolling
Horizon NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (rhNEAT). Unlike traditional
Rolling Horizon Evolution, where an evolutionary algorithm is in charge of
evolving a sequence of actions, rhNEAT evolves weights and connections of a
neural network in real-time, planning several steps ahead before returning an
action to execute in the game. Different versions of the algorithm are explored
in a collection of 20 GVGAI games, and compared with other SFP methods and
state of the art results. Although results are overall not better than other
SFP methods, the nature of rhNEAT to adapt to changing game features has
allowed to establish new state of the art records in games that other methods
have traditionally struggled with. The algorithm proposed here is general and
introduces a new way of representing information within rolling horizon
evolution techniques.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The training of modern deep learning neural network calls for large amounts
of computation, which is often provided by GPUs or other specific accelerators.
To scale out to achieve faster training speed, two update algorithms are mainly
applied in the distributed training process, i.e. the Synchronous SGD algorithm
(SSGD) and Asynchronous SGD algorithm (ASGD). SSGD obtains good convergence
point while the training speed is slowed down by the synchronous barrier. ASGD
has faster training speed but the convergence point is lower when compared to
SSGD. To sufficiently utilize the advantages of SSGD and ASGD, we propose a
novel technology named One-step Delay SGD (OD-SGD) to combine their strengths
in the training process. Therefore, we can achieve similar convergence point
and training speed as SSGD and ASGD separately. To the best of our knowledge,
we make the first attempt to combine the features of SSGD and ASGD to improve
distributed training performance. Each iteration of OD-SGD contains a global
update in the parameter server node and local updates in the worker nodes, the
local update is introduced to update and compensate the delayed local weights.
We evaluate our proposed algorithm on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.
Experimental results show that OD-SGD can obtain similar or even slightly
better accuracy than SSGD, while its training speed is much faster, which even
exceeds the training speed of ASGD.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The function approximator that finds the function mapping the feature to the
label is an important component in a deep neural network for classification
tasks. To overcome nonlinearity, which is the main difficulty in designing the
function approximator, one usually uses the method based on the nonlinear
activation function or the nonlinear kernel function and yields classical
networks such as the feed-forward neural network (MLP) and the radial basis
function network (RBF). Although, classical networks such as the MLP are robust
in most of the classification task, they are not the most efficient. E.g., they
use large amount of parameters and take long times to train. Additionally, the
choice of activation functions has a non-negligible influence on the
effectiveness and efficiency of the network. In this paper, we propose a new
network that is efficient in finding the function that maps the feature to the
label. Instead of using the nonlinear activation function, the new proposed
network uses the fractional form to overcome the nonlinearity, thus for the
sake of convenience, we name the network the ratio net. We compare the
effectiveness and efficiency of the ratio net and the classical networks such
as the MLP and the RBF in the classification task on the mnist database of
handwritten digits and the IMDb dataset which is a binary sentiment analysis
dataset. The result shows that the ratio net outperforms both the MLP and the
RBF.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dominance move (DoM) is a binary quality indicator to compare solution sets
in multiobjective optimization. The indicator allows a more natural and
intuitive relation when comparing solution sets. It is Pareto compliant and
does not demand any parameters or reference sets. In spite of its advantages,
the combinatorial calculation nature is a limitation. The original formulation
presents an efficient method to calculate it in a biobjective case only. This
work presents an assignment formulation to calculate DoM in problems with three
objectives or more. Some initial experiments, in the biobjective space, were
done to present the model correctness. Next, other experiments, using three
dimensions, were also done to show how DoM could be compared with other
indicators: inverted generational distance (IGD) and hypervolume (HV). Results
show the assignment formulation for DoM is valid for more than three
objectives. However, there are some strengths and weaknesses, which are
discussed and detailed. Some notes, considerations, and future research paths
conclude this work.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Altering sensorimotor simulation impacts early stages of facial expression processing depending on individual differences in alexithymic traits. (arXiv:1906.06424v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Simulation models of facial expressions suggest that posterior visual areas
and brain areas underpinning sensorimotor simulations might interact to improve
facial expression processing. According to these models, facial mimicry may
contribute to the visual processing of facial expressions by influencing early
stages. The aim of the present study was to assess whether/how early
sensorimotor simulation influences early stages of face processing. A secondary
aim was to investigate the relationship between alexithymic traits and
sensorimotor simulation. We monitored P1 and N170 components of the
event-related potentials (ERP) in participants performing a fine discrimination
task of facial expressions while implementing an animal discrimination task as
control condition. In half of the experiment, participants could freely use
their facial mimicry whereas in the other half, they had their facial mimicry
blocked by a gel. Our results revealed that, on average, both P1 and N170 ERP
components were not sensitive to mimicry manipulation. However, when taking
into account alexithymic traits, a scenario corroborating sensorimotor
simulation models emerged, with two dissociable temporal windows affected by
mimicry manipulation as a function of alexithymia levels. Specifically, as a
function of mimicry manipulation, individuals with lower alexithymic traits
showed modulations of the P1 amplitude, while individuals with higher
alexithymic traits showed modulations of the later N170). Furthermore,
connectivity analysis at the scalp level suggested increased connectivity
between sensorimotor and extrastriate visual regions in individuals with lower
alexithymic traits compared to individuals with higher alexithymic traits.
Overall, we interpreted these ERPs modulations as compensative visual
processing under conditions of interference on the sensorimotor processing.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hierarchical reinforcement learning is a promising approach to tackle
long-horizon decision-making problems with sparse rewards. Unfortunately, most
methods still decouple the lower-level skill acquisition process and the
training of a higher level that controls the skills in a new task. Leaving the
skills fixed can lead to significant sub-optimality in the transfer setting. In
this work, we propose a novel algorithm to discover a set of skills, and
continuously adapt them along with the higher level even when training on a new
task. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, we derive a new hierarchical
policy gradient with an unbiased latent-dependent baseline, and we introduce
Hierarchical Proximal Policy Optimization (HiPPO), an on-policy method to
efficiently train all levels of the hierarchy jointly. Second, we propose a
method for training time-abstractions that improves the robustness of the
obtained skills to environment changes. Code and results are available at

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Human peripheral blur is optimal for object recognition. (arXiv:1807.08476v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Our vision is sharpest at the center of our gaze and becomes progressively
blurry into the periphery. It is widely believed that this high foveal
resolution evolved at the expense of peripheral acuity. But what if this
sampling scheme is actually optimal for object recognition? To test this
hypothesis, we trained deep neural networks on 'foveated' images with high
resolution near objects and increasingly sparse sampling into the periphery.
Neural networks trained using a blur profile matching the human eye yielded the
best performance compared to shallower and steeper blur profiles. Even in
humans, categorization accuracy deteriorated only for steeper blur profiles.
Thus, our blurry peripheral vision may have evolved to optimize object
recognition rather than merely due to wiring constraints.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Achieving better exploitation and exploration capabilities (EEC) have always
been an important yet challenging issue in the design of evolutionary
optimization algorithm (EOA). The difficulties lie in obtaining a good balance
in EEC, which is determined cooperatively by operations and parameters in an
EOA. When deficiencies in exploitation or exploration are observed, most
existing works consider a piecemeal approach, either by designing new
operations or by altering the parameters. Unfortunately, when different
situations are encountered, these proposals may fail to be the winner. To
address these problems, this paper proposes an explicit EEC control method
named selective-candidate framework with similarity selection rule (SCSS). M (M
&amp;gt; 1) candidates are first generated from each current solution with independent
operations and parameters to enrich the search. Then, a similarity selection
rule is designed to determine the final candidate by considering the fitness
ranking of the current solution and its Euclidian distance to each of these M
candidates. Superior current solutions will prefer the closest candidates for
efficient local exploitation while inferior ones will favor the farthest for
exploration purpose. In this way, the rule could synthesize exploitation and
exploration, making the evolution more effective. When applied to three
classic, four state-of-the-art and four up-to-date EOAs from branches of
differential evolution, evolution strategy and particle swarm optimization,
significant enhancement in performance is achieved.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Downregulation of lncRNA-11496 in the Brain Contributes to Microglia Apoptosis via Regulation of Mef2c in Chronic T. gondii Infection Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00077</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Though it is well known that chronic infections of Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) can induce mental and behavioral disorders in the host, little is known about the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in this pathological process. In this study, we employed an advanced lncRNAs and mRNAs integration chip (Affymetrix HTA 2.0) to detect the expression of both lncRNAs and mRNAs in T. gondii Chinese 1 strain infected mouse brain. As a result, for the first time, the downregulation of lncRNA-11496 (NONMMUGO11496) was identified as the responsible factor for this pathological process. We showed that dysregulation of lncRNA-11496 affected proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of mouse microglia. Furthermore, we proved that Mef2c (Myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C), a member of the MEF2 subfamily, is the target gene of lncRNA-11496. In a more detailed study, we confirmed that lncRNA-11496 positively regulated the expression of Mef2c by binding to histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2). Importantly, Mef2c itself could coordinate neuronal differentiation, survival, as well as synapse formation. Thus, our current study provides the first evidence in terms of the modulatory action of lncRNAs in chronic toxoplasmosis in T. gondii infected mouse brain, providing a solid scientific basis for using lncRNA-11496 as a therapeutic target to treat T. gondii induced neurological disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Targeted Transgene Expression in Cholinergic Interneurons in the Monkey Striatum Using Canine Adenovirus Serotype 2 Vectors</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The striatum, the main input structure of the basal ganglia, is critical for action selection and adaptive motor control. To understand the neuronal mechanisms underlying these functions, an analysis of microcircuits that compose the striatum is necessary. Among these, cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) provide intrinsic striatal innervation whose dysfunction is implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease and Tourette syndrome. The ability to experimentally manipulate the activity of ChIs is critical to gain insights into their contribution to the normal function of the striatum and the emergence of behavioral abnormalities in pathological states. In this study, we generated and tested CAV-pChAT-GFP, a replication-defective canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector carrying the green fluorescent protein (GFP) sequence under the control of the human choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) promoter. We first tested the potential specificity of CAV-pChAT-GFP to label striatal ChIs in a rat before performing experiments on two macaque monkeys. In the vector-injected rat and monkey striatum, we found that GFP expression preferentially colocalized with ChAT-immunoreactivity throughout the striatum, including those from local circuit interneurons. CAV-2 vectors containing transgene driven by the ChAT promoter provide a powerful tool for investigating ChI contributions to circuit function and behavior in nonhuman primates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: D1 Dopamine Receptor Activation Induces Neuronal eEF2 Pathway-Dependent Protein Synthesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00067</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine, alongside other neuromodulators, defines brain and neuronal states, inter alia through regulation of global and local mRNA translation. Yet, the signaling pathways underlying the effects of dopamine on mRNA translation and psychiatric disorders are not clear. In order to examine the molecular pathways downstream of dopamine receptors, we used genetic, pharmacologic, biochemical, and imaging methods, and found that activation of dopamine receptor D1 but not D2 leads to rapid dephosphorylation of eEF2 at Thr&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt; but not eIF2α in cortical primary neuronal culture in a time-dependent manner. NMDA receptor, mTOR, and ERK pathways are upstream of the D1 receptor-dependent eEF2 dephosphorylation and essential for it. Furthermore, D1 receptor activation resulted in a major reduction in dendritic eEF2 phosphorylation levels. D1-dependent eEF2 dephosphorylation results in an increase of BDNF and synapsin2b expression which was followed by a small yet significant increase in general protein synthesis. These results reveal the role of dopamine D1 receptor in the regulation of eEF2 pathway translation in neurons and present eEF2 as a promising therapeutic target for addiction and depression as well as other psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: LRRK2 Kinase Inhibition Rescues Deficits in Lysosome Function Due to Heterozygous GBA1 Expression in Human iPSC-Derived Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00442</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A growing number of genes associated with Parkinson’s disease are implicated in the regulation of lysosome function, including LRRK2, whose missense mutations are perhaps the most common monogenic cause of this neurodegenerative disease. These mutations are collectively thought to introduce a pathologic increase in LRRK2 kinase activity, which is currently a major target for therapeutic intervention. Heterozygous carriers of many missense mutations in the GBA1 gene have dramatically increased risk of Parkinson’s disease. A critical question has recently emerged regarding the potential interplay between the proteins encoded by these two disease-linked genes. Our group has recently demonstrated that knockin mutation of a Parkinson’s-linked GBA1 variant induces severe lysosomal and cytokine abnormalities in murine astrocytes and that these deficits were normalized via inhibition of wild-type LRRK2 kinase activity in these cells. Another group independently found that LRRK2 inhibition increases glucocerebrosidase activity in wild-type human iPSC-derived neurons, as well as those whose activity is disrupted by GBA1 or LRRK2 mutation. Fundamental questions remain in terms of the lysosomal abnormalities and the effects of LRRK2 kinase inhibition in human neurons deficient in glucocerebrosidase activity. Here, we further elucidate the physiological crosstalk between LRRK2 signaling and glucocerebrosidase activity in human iPSC-derived neurons. Our studies show that the allelic loss of GBA1 manifests broad defects in lysosomal morphology and function. Furthermore, our data show an increase in both the accumulation and secretion of oligomeric α-synuclein protein in these GBA1-heterozygous-null neurons, compared to isogenic controls. Consistent with recent findings in murine astrocytes, we observed that multiple indices of lysosomal dysfunction in GBA1-deficient human neurons were normalized by LRRK2 kinase inhibition, while some defects were preserved. Our findings demonstrate a selective but functional intersection between glucocerebrosidase dysfunction and LRRK2 signaling in the cell and may have implications in the pathogenesis and treatment of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neuroergonomic Assessment of Hot Beverage Preparation and Consumption: An EEG and EDA Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroergonomics is an emerging field that investigates the human brain about behavioral performance in natural environments and everyday settings. This study investigated the body and brain activity correlates of a typical daily activity, hot beverage preparation, and consumption in a realistic office environment where participants performed natural daily tasks. Using wearable, battery operated and wireless Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Electrodermal activity (EDA) sensors, neural and physiological responses were measured in untethered, freely moving participants who prepared hot beverages using two different machines (a market leader and follower as determined by annual US sales). They later consumed the drinks they had prepared in three blocks. Emotional valence was estimated using frontal asymmetry in EEG alpha band power and emotional arousal was estimated from EDA tonic and phasic activity. Results from 26 participants showed that the market-leading coffee machine was more efficient to use based on self-reports, behavioral performance measures, and there were significant within-subject differences in valence between the two machine use. Moreover, the market leader user interface led to greater self-reported product preference, which was further supported by significant differences in measured arousal and valence (EDA and EEG, respectively) during coffee production and consumption. This is the first study that uses a multimodal and comprehensive assessment of coffee machine use and beverage consumption in a naturalistic work environment. Approaches described in this study can be adapted in the future to other task-specific machine usability and consumer neuroscience studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Disinhibition of Human Primary Somatosensory Cortex After Median Nerve Transection and Reinnervation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00166</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite state-of-the-art surgical and postoperative treatment, median nerve transection causes lasting impaired hand function due to limitations in the nerve’s reinnervation ability. The defective innervation and thus controllability of the affected hand can shape the brain’s control of manual behaviors. Earlier studies of changes in the processing of tactile stimuli have focused mainly on stimulation of the reinnervated hand and lack sufficient control over the brain’s use of the tactile input in perceptual terms. Here we used fMRI to measure brain activity (BOLD-signal) in 11 people with median nerve injury and healthy controls (N = 11) when performing demanding tactile tasks using the tip of either the index or little finger of either hand. For the nerve-injured group, the left median nerve had been traumatically transected in the distal forearm and surgically repaired on average 8 years before the study. The hand representation of their contralesional (right) primary somatosensory cortex (S1) showed greater activity compared to controls when the left reinnervated index finger was used, but also when the left-hand little finger and the fingers of the right hand innervated by uninjured nerves were used. We argue that the overall increase in activity reflects a general disinhibition of contralesional S1 consistent with an augmented functional reorganizational plasticity being an ongoing feature of chronic recovery from nerve injury. Also, the nerve-injured showed increased activity within three prefrontal cortical areas implicated in higher-level behavioral processing (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, left ventrolateral prefrontal and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), suggesting that processes supporting decision-making and response-selection were computationally more demanding due to the compromised tactile sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Electrophysiology and Structural Connectivity of the Posterior Hypothalamic Region: Much to Learn From a Rare Indication of Deep Brain Stimulation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cluster headache (CH) is among the most common and debilitating autonomic cephalalgias. We characterize clinical outcomes of deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the posterior hypothalamic region through a novel analysis of the electrophysiological topography and tractography-based structural connectivity. The left posterior hypothalamus was targeted ipsilateral to the refractory CH symptoms. Intraoperatively, field potentials were captured in 1 mm depth increments. Whole-brain probabilistic tractography was conducted to assess the structural connectivity of the estimated volume of activated tissue (VAT) associated with therapeutic response. Stimulation of the posterior hypothalamic region led to the resolution of CH symptoms, and this benefit has persisted for 1.5-years post-surgically. Active contacts were within the posterior hypothalamus and dorsoposterior border of the ventral anterior thalamus (VAp). Delta- (3 Hz) and alpha-band (8 Hz) powers increased and peaked with proximity to the posterior hypothalamus. In the posterior hypothalamus, the delta-band phase was coupled to beta-band amplitude, the latter of which has been shown to increase during CH attacks. Finally, we identified that the VAT encompassing these regions had a high proportion of streamlines of pain processing regions, including the insula, anterior cingulate gyrus, inferior parietal lobe, precentral gyrus, and the brainstem. Our unique case study of posterior hypothalamic region DBS supports durable efficacy and provides a platform using electrophysiological topography and structural connectivity, to improve mechanistic understanding of CH and this promising therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Peripheral Electrical Stimulation Paired With Movement-Related Cortical Potentials Improves Isometric Muscle Strength and Voluntary Activation Following Stroke</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Endogenous paired associative stimulation (ePAS) is a neuromodulatory intervention that has potential to aid stroke recovery. ePAS involves pairing endogenous electroencephalography (EEG) signals known as movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs), with peripheral electrical stimulation. Previous studies have used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to demonstrate changes in corticomotor excitability following ePAS. However, the use of TMS as a measure in stroke research is limited by safety precautions, intolerance, and difficulty generating a measurable response in more severely affected individuals. We were interested in evaluating the effect of ePAS using more feasible measures in people with stroke. This study asks whether ePAS produces immediate improvements in the primary outcomes of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and total neuromuscular fatigue of the dorsiflexor muscles, and in the secondary outcomes of muscle power, voluntary activation (VA), central fatigue, peripheral fatigue, and electromyography activity.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;In this repeated-measures cross-over study, 15 participants with chronic stroke completed two interventions, ePAS and sham, in a randomized order. During ePAS, 50 repetitions of visually cued dorsiflexion were completed, while single pulses of electrical stimulation were delivered to the deep branch of the common peroneal nerve. Each somatosensory volley was timed to arrive in the primary motor cortex at the peak negativity of the MRCP. Univariate and multivariate linear mixed models were used to analyze the primary and secondary data, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There was a statistically significant increase in dorsiflexor MVIC immediately following the ePAS intervention (mean increase 7 N), compared to the sham intervention (mean change 0 N) (univariate between-condition analysis p = 0.047). The multivariate analysis revealed a statistically significant effect of ePAS on VA of the tibialis anterior muscle, such that ePAS increased VA by 7 percentage units (95% confidence interval 1.3–12.7%). There was no statistically significant effect on total neuromuscular fatigue, muscle power, or other secondary measures.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;A single session of ePAS can significantly increase isometric muscle strength and VA in people with chronic stroke. The findings confirm that ePAS has a central neuromodulatory mechanism and support further exploration of its potential as an adjunct to stroke rehabilitation. In addition, the findings offer alternative, feasible outcome measures for future research.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical trial registration&lt;p&gt;Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12617000838314 (www.anzctr.org.au), Universal Trial Number U111111953714.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Optimizing Magnetoencephalographic Imaging Estimation of Language Lateralization for Simpler Language Tasks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Magnetoencephalographic imaging (MEGI) offers a non-invasive alternative for defining preoperative language lateralization in neurosurgery patients. MEGI indeed can be used for accurate estimation of language lateralization with a complex language task – auditory verb generation. However, since language function may vary considerably in patients with focal lesions, it is important to optimize MEGI for estimation of language function with other simpler language tasks. The goal of this study was to optimize MEGI laterality analyses for two such simpler language tasks that can have compliance from those with impaired language function: a non-word repetition (NWR) task and a picture naming (PN) task. Language lateralization results for these two tasks were compared to the verb-generation (VG) task. MEGI reconstruction parameters (regions and time windows) for NWR and PN were first defined in a presurgical training cohort by benchmarking these against laterality indices for VG. Optimized time windows and regions of interest (ROIs) for NWR and PN were determined by examining oscillations in the beta band (12–30 Hz) a marker of neural activity known to be concordant with the VG laterality index (LI). For NWR, additional ROIs include areas MTG/ITG and for both NWR and PN, the postcentral gyrus was included in analyses. Optimal time windows for NWR were defined as 650–850 ms (stimulus-locked) and −350 to −150 ms (response-locked) and for PN −450 to −250 ms (response-locked). To verify the optimal parameters defined in our training cohort for NWR and PN, we examined an independent validation cohort (n = 30 for NWR, n = 28 for PN) and found high concordance between VG laterality and PN laterality (82%) and between VG laterality and NWR laterality (87%). Finally, in a test cohort (n = 8) that underwent both the intracarotid amobarbital procedure (IAP) test and MEG for VG, NWR, and PN, we identified excellent concordance (100%) with IAP for VG + NWR + PN composite LI, high concordance for PN alone (87.5%), and moderate concordance for NWR alone (66.7%). These findings provide task options for non-invasive language mapping with MEGI that can be calibrated for language abilities of individual patients. Results also demonstrate that more accurate estimates can be obtained by combining laterality estimates obtained from multiple tasks. MEGI&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Optimality Principles in Human Point-to-Manifold Reaching Accounting for Muscle Dynamics</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human arm movements are highly stereotypical under a large variety of experimental conditions. This is striking due to the high redundancy of the human musculoskeletal system, which in principle allows many possible trajectories toward a goal. Many researchers hypothesize that through evolution, learning, and adaption, the human system has developed optimal control strategies to select between these possibilities. Various optimality principles were proposed in the literature that reproduce human-like trajectories in certain conditions. However, these studies often focus on a single cost function and use simple torque-driven models of motion generation, which are not consistent with human muscle-actuated motion. The underlying structure of our human system, with the use of muscle dynamics in interaction with the control principles, might have a significant influence on what optimality principles best model human motion. To investigate this hypothesis, we consider a point-to-manifold reaching task that leaves the target underdetermined. Given hypothesized motion objectives, the control input is generated using Bayesian optimization, which is a machine learning based method that trades-off exploitation and exploration. Using numerical simulations with Hill-type muscles, we show that a combination of optimality principles best predicts human point-to-manifold reaching when accounting for the muscle dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Stochastic Resonance Based Visual Perception Using Spiking Neural Networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Our aim is to propose an efficient algorithm for enhancing the contrast of dark images based on the principle of stochastic resonance in a global feedback spiking network of integrate-and-fire neurons. By linear approximation and direct simulation, we disclose the dependence of the peak signal-to-noise ratio on the spiking threshold and the feedback coupling strength. Based on this theoretical analysis, we then develop a dynamical system algorithm for enhancing dark images. In the new algorithm, an explicit formula is given on how to choose a suitable spiking threshold for the images to be enhanced, and a more effective quantifying index, the variance of image, is used to replace the commonly used measure. Numerical tests verify the efficiency of the new algorithm. The investigation provides a good example for the application of stochastic resonance, and it might be useful for explaining the biophysical mechanism behind visual perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: EZcalcium: Open-Source Toolbox for Analysis of Calcium Imaging Data</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fluorescence calcium imaging using a range of microscopy approaches, such as two-photon excitation or head-mounted “miniscopes,” is one of the preferred methods to record neuronal activity and glial signals in various experimental settings, including acute brain slices, brain organoids, and behaving animals. Because changes in the fluorescence intensity of genetically encoded or chemical calcium indicators correlate with action potential firing in neurons, data analysis is based on inferring such spiking from changes in pixel intensity values across time within different regions of interest. However, the algorithms necessary to extract biologically relevant information from these fluorescent signals are complex and require significant expertise in programming to develop robust analysis pipelines. For decades, the only way to perform these analyses was for individual laboratories to write their custom code. These routines were typically not well annotated and lacked intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which made it difficult for scientists in other laboratories to adopt them. Although the panorama is changing with recent tools like CaImAn, Suite2P, and others, there is still a barrier for many laboratories to adopt these packages, especially for potential users without sophisticated programming skills. As two-photon microscopes are becoming increasingly affordable, the bottleneck is no longer the hardware, but the software used to analyze the calcium data optimally and consistently across different groups. We addressed this unmet need by incorporating recent software solutions, namely NoRMCorre and CaImAn, for motion correction, segmentation, signal extraction, and deconvolution of calcium imaging data into an open-source, easy to use, GUI-based, intuitive and automated data analysis software package, which we named EZcalcium.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: A Probabilistic Framework for Decoding Behavior From in vivo Calcium Imaging Data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00019</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the role of neuronal activity in cognition and behavior is a key question in neuroscience. Previously, in vivo studies have typically inferred behavior from electrophysiological data using probabilistic approaches including Bayesian decoding. While providing useful information on the role of neuronal subcircuits, electrophysiological approaches are often limited in the maximum number of recorded neurons as well as their ability to reliably identify neurons over time. This can be particularly problematic when trying to decode behaviors that rely on large neuronal assemblies or rely on temporal mechanisms, such as a learning task over the course of several days. Calcium imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicators has overcome these two issues. Unfortunately, because calcium transients only indirectly reflect spiking activity and calcium imaging is often performed at lower sampling frequencies, this approach suffers from uncertainty in exact spike timing and thus activity frequency, making rate-based decoding approaches used in electrophysiological recordings difficult to apply to calcium imaging data. Here we describe a probabilistic framework that can be used to robustly infer behavior from calcium imaging recordings and relies on a simplified implementation of a naive Baysian classifier. Our method discriminates between periods of activity and periods of inactivity to compute probability density functions (likelihood and posterior), significance and confidence interval, as well as mutual information. We next devise a simple method to decode behavior using these probability density functions and propose metrics to quantify decoding accuracy. Finally, we show that neuronal activity can be predicted from behavior, and that the accuracy of such reconstructions can guide the understanding of relationships that may exist between behavioral states and neuronal activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Electroacupuncture Inhibits Neuronal Autophagy and Apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT Pathway Following Ischemic Stroke</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electroacupuncture (EA) is a safe and effective therapy for ischemic stroke in both clinical and laboratory settings. However, the underlying mechanism behind EA treatment for stroke remains unclear. Here, we aimed to evaluate whether EA treatment at the acupoints of Zusanli (ST36) and Quchi (LI11) exerted a neuroprotective effect on ischemic stroke rats by modulating autophagy and apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. EA was performed at 24 h following brain ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) for 30 min per day for 3 days. Our results indicated that EA treatment significantly decreased neurological deficits and cerebral infarct volume in ischemic stroke rats. Also, EA intervention markedly reduced neuronal apoptosis by suppressing the activation of cleaved caspase-3 (CCAS3) at 72 h following I/R, as shown by a Western blot analysis. Furthermore, EA treatment after ischemic stroke suppressed the ischemia activated expression level of LC3II/I and Atg7 and increased the ischemia inhibited expression level of PI3K, phosphorylation of mTOR, phosphorylation of AKT, P62 and LAMP1, hence mediating the autophagy level of the neurocyte, which was reversed by the PI3K inhibitor Dactolisib. In summary, our results indicate that the protective effects of EA treatment at points of Quchi (LI11) and Zusanli (ST36) in rats following cerebral I/R injury was associated with the inhibition of neuronal apoptosis and autophagy via activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human brain organoids cultured from human pluripotent stem cells provide a promising platform to recapitulate histological features of the human brain and model neural disorders. However, unlike animal models, brain organoids lack a reproducible topographic organization, which limits their application in modeling intricate biology, such as the interaction between different brain regions. To overcome these drawbacks, brain organoids have been pre-patterned into specific brain regions and fused to form an assembloid that represents reproducible models recapitulating more complex biological processes of human brain development and neurological diseases. This approach has been applied to model interneuron migration, neuronal projections, tumor invasion, oligodendrogenesis, forebrain axis establishment, and brain vascularization. In this review article, we will summarize the usage of this technology to understand the fundamental biology underpinning human brain development and disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Loss of Arid1a Promotes Neuronal Survival Following Optic Nerve Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Trauma or neurodegenerative diseases trigger the retrograde death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), causing an irreversible functional loss. AT-rich interaction domain 1A (ARID1A), a subunit of the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex, has been shown to play crucial roles in cell homeostasis and tissue regeneration. However, its function in adult RGC regeneration remains elusive. Here, we show that optic nerve injury induces dynamic changes of Arid1a expression. Importantly, deleting Arid1a in mice dramatically promotes RGC survival, but insignificantly impacts axon regeneration after optic nerve injury. Next, joint profiling of transcripts and accessible chromatin in mature RGCs reveals that Arid1a regulates several genes involved in apoptosis and JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Thus, our findings suggest modulation of Arid1a as a potential therapeutic strategy to promote RGC neuroprotection after damage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Neuroimmunomodulatory and Neuroprotective Effects of the Flavonoid Apigenin in in vitro Models of Neuroinflammation Associated With Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00119</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00119</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative disorders (ND) are characterized by the progressive and irreversible loss of neurons. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most incident age-related ND, in which the presence of a chronic inflammatory compound seems to be related to its pathogenesis. Different stimuli in the central nervous system (CNS) can induce activation, proliferation, and changes in phenotype and glial function, which can be modulated by anti-inflammatory agents. Apigenin (4,5,7–trihydroxyflavone) is a flavonoid found in abundance in many fruits and vegetables, that has shown important effects upon controlling the inflammatory response. This study evaluated the neuroprotective and neuroimmunomodulatory potential of apigenin using in vitro models of neuroinflammation associated with AD. Co-cultures of neurons and glial cells were obtained from the cortex of newborn and embryonic Wistar rats. After 26 days in vitro, cultures were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 μg/ml), or IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 24 h, or to Aβ oligomers (500 nM) for 4 h, and then treated with apigenin (1 μM) for further 24 h. It was observed that the treatment with apigenin preserved neurons and astrocytes integrity, determined by Rosenfeld’s staining and immunocytochemistry for β-tubulin III and GFAP, respectively. Moreover, it was observed by Fluoro-Jade-B and caspase-3 immunostaining that apigenin was not neurotoxic and has a neuroprotective effect against inflammatory damage. Additionally, apigenin reduced microglial activation, characterized by inhibition of proliferation (BrdU+ cells) and modulation of microglia morphology (Iba-1 + cells), and decreased the expression of the M1 inflammatory marker CD68. Moreover, as determined by RT-qPCR, inflammatory stimuli induced by IL-1β increased the mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-1β, and CCL5, and decreased the mRNA expression of IL-10. Contrary, after treatment with apigenin in inflammatory stimuli (IL-1β or LPS) there was a modulation of the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines, and reduced expression of OX42, IL-6 and gp130. Moreover, apigenin alone and after an inflammatory stimulus with IL-1β also induced the increase in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), an effect that may be associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Together these data demonstrate that apigenin presents neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and might represent an important neuroimmunomodulatory agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Transport of LDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes into the cytoplasm requires NPC1 protein; NPC1L1 mediates uptake of dietary cholesterol. We introduced single disulfide bonds into NPC1 and NPC1L1 to explore the importance of inter-domain dynamics in cholesterol transport. Using a sensitive method to monitor lysosomal cholesterol efflux, we found that NPC1’s N-terminal domain need not release from the rest of the protein for efficient cholesterol export. Either introducing single disulfide bonds to constrain lumenal/extracellular domains or shortening a cytoplasmic loop abolishes transport activity by both NPC1 and NPC1L1. The widely prescribed cholesterol uptake inhibitor, ezetimibe, blocks NPC1L1; we show that residues that lie at the interface between NPC1L1's three extracellular domains comprise the drug’s binding site. These data support a model in which cholesterol passes through the cores of NPC1/NPC1L1 proteins; concerted movement of various domains is needed for transfer and ezetimibe blocks transport by binding to multiple domains simultaneously.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56077</link>
	<description>Night vision in mammals depends fundamentally on rod photoreceptors and the well-studied rod bipolar (RB) cell pathway. The central neuron in this pathway, the AII amacrine cell (AC), exhibits a spatially tuned receptive field, composed of an excitatory center and an inhibitory surround, that propagates to ganglion cells, the retina’s projection neurons. The circuitry underlying the surround of the AII, however, remains unresolved. Here, we combined structural, functional and optogenetic analyses of the mouse retina to discover that surround inhibition of the AII depends primarily on a single interneuron type, the NOS-1 AC: a multistratified, axon-bearing GABAergic cell, with dendrites in both ON and OFF synaptic layers, but with a pure ON (depolarizing) response to light. Our study demonstrates generally that novel neural circuits can be identified from targeted connectomic analyses and specifically that the NOS-1 AC mediates long-range inhibition during night vision and is a major element of the RB pathway.</description>

	<description>We report improved automated open-source methodology for head-fixed mesoscale cortical imaging and/or behavioral training of home cage mice using Raspberry Pi-based hardware. Staged partial and probabilistic restraint allows mice to adjust to self-initiated headfixation over 3 weeks' time with ~50% participation rate. We support a cue-based behavioral licking task monitored by a capacitive touch-sensor water spout. While automatically head-fixed, we acquire spontaneous, movement-triggered, or licking task-evoked GCaMP6 cortical signals. An analysis pipeline marked both behavioral events, as well as analyzed brain fluorescence signals as they relate to spontaneous and/or task-evoked behavioral activity. Mice were trained to suppress licking and wait for cues that marked the delivery of water. Correct rewarded go-trials were associated with widespread activation of midline and lateral barrel cortex areas following a vibration cue and delayed frontal and lateral motor cortex activation. Cortical GCaMP signals predicted trial success and correlated strongly with trial-outcome dependent body movements.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55053</link>
	<description>The identification of autoantigens remains a critical challenge for understanding and treating autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1), a rare monogenic form of autoimmunity, presents as widespread autoimmunity with T and B cell responses to multiple organs. Importantly, autoantibody discovery in APS1 can illuminate fundamental disease pathogenesis, and many of the antigens found in APS1 extend to more common autoimmune diseases. Here, we performed proteome-wide programmable phage-display (PhIP-Seq) on sera from a cohort of people with APS1 and discovered multiple common antibody targets. These novel APS1 autoantigens exhibit tissue-restricted expression, including expression in enteroendocrine cells, pineal gland, and dental enamel. Using detailed clinical phenotyping, we find novel associations between autoantibodies and organ-restricted autoimmunity, including a link between anti-KHDC3L autoantibodies and premature ovarian insufficiency, and between anti-RFX6 autoantibodies and diarrheal-type intestinal dysfunction. Our study highlights the utility of PhIP-Seq for extensively interrogating antigenic repertoires in human autoimmunity and the importance of antigen discovery for improved understanding of disease mechanisms.</description>

	<description>Efficient precision genome engineering requires high frequency and specificity of integration at the genomic target site. Here, we describe a set of resources to streamline reporter gene knock-ins in zebrafish and demonstrate the broader utility of the method in mammalian cells. Our approach uses short homology of 24–48 bp to drive targeted integration of DNA reporter cassettes by homology-mediated end joining (HMEJ) at high frequency at a double strand break in the targeted gene. Our vector series, pGTag (plasmids for Gene Tagging), contains reporters flanked by a universal CRISPR sgRNA sequence which enables in vivo liberation of the homology arms. We observed high rates of germline transmission (22–100%) for targeted knock-ins at eight zebrafish loci and efficient integration at safe harbor loci in porcine and human cells. Our system provides a straightforward and cost-effective approach for high efficiency gene targeting applications in CRISPR and TALEN compatible systems.</description>

	<title>eLife: Stimulation strength controls the rate of initiation but not the molecular organization of TCR-induced signalling</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53948</link>
	<description>Millions of naïve T cells with different TCRs may interact with a peptide-MHC ligand, but very few will activate. Remarkably, this fine control is orchestrated using a limited set of intracellular machinery. It remains unclear whether changes in stimulation strength alter the programme of signalling events leading to T cell activation. Using mass cytometry to simultaneously measure multiple signalling pathways during activation of murine CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, we found a programme of distal signalling events that is shared, regardless of the strength of TCR stimulation. Moreover, the relationship between transcription of early response genes&lt;i&gt; Nr4a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Irf8&lt;/i&gt; and activation of the ribosomal protein S6 is also conserved across stimuli. Instead, we found that stimulation strength dictates the rate with which cells initiate signalling through this network. These data suggest that TCR-induced signalling results in a coordinated activation program, modulated in rate but not organization by stimulation strength.</description>

	<description>Neural tube defects (NTDs) represent a failure of the neural plate to complete the developmental transition to a neural tube. NTDs are the most common birth anomaly of the CNS. Following mandatory folic acid fortification of dietary grains, a dramatic reduction in the incidence of NTDs was observed in areas where the policy was implemented, yet the genetic drivers of NTDs in humans, and the mechanisms by which folic acid prevents disease, remain disputed. Here, we discuss current understanding of human NTD genetics, recent advances regarding potential mechanisms by which folic acid might modify risk through effects on the epigenome and transcriptome, and new approaches to study refined phenotypes for a greater appreciation of the developmental and genetic causes of NTDs.</description>

	<description>The glymphatic concept along with the discovery of meningeal lymphatic vessels have, in recent years, highlighted that fluid is directionally transported within the central nervous system (CNS). Imaging studies, as well as manipulations of fluid transport, point to a key role of the glymphatic–lymphatic system in clearance of amyloid-β and other proteins. As such, the glymphatic–lymphatic system represents a new target in combating neurodegenerative diseases. Not unexpectedly, introduction of a new plumbing system in the brain has stirred controversies.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Guang Song&lt;/p&gt;

Mass-spring models have been a standard approach in molecular modeling for the last few decades, such as elastic network models (ENMs) that are widely used for normal mode analysis. In this work, we present a vastly different elastic solid model (ESM) of macromolecules that shares the same simplicity and efficiency as ENMs in producing the equilibrium dynamics and moreover, offers some significant new features that may greatly benefit the research community. ESM is different from ENM in that it treats macromolecules as elastic solids. Our particular version of ESM presented in this work, named &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;ESM, captures the shape of a given biomolecule most economically using &lt;i&gt;alpha shape&lt;/i&gt;, a well-established technique from the computational geometry community. Consequently, it can produce most economical coarse-grained models while faithfully preserving the shape and thus makes normal mode computations and visualization of extremely large complexes more manageable. Secondly, as a solid model, ESM’s close link to finite element analysis renders it ideally suited for studying mechanical responses of macromolecules under external force. Lastly, we show that ESM can be applied also to structures without atomic coordinates such as those from cryo-electron microscopy. The complete MATLAB code of &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;ESM is provided.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qWtezuvCimM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Bridging Therapy or IV Thrombolysis in Minor Stroke with Large Vessel Occlusion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25756?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25756?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether bridging therapy (intravenous thrombolysis [IVT] followed by endovascular treatment) is superior to IVT alone in minor stroke with large vessel occlusion (LVO) is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multicentric retrospective observational study including, in intention‐to‐treat, consecutive IVT‐treated minor strokes (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] ≤ 5) with LVO, with or without additional mechanical thrombectomy. Propensity‐score (inverse probability of treatment weighting) was used to reduce baseline between‐groups differences. The primary outcome was excellent outcome, that is, modified Rankin score 0 to 1 at 3 months follow‐up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, 598 patients were included (214 and 384 in the bridging therapy and IVT groups, respectively). Following propensity‐score weighting, the distribution of baseline clinical and radiological variables was similar across the two patient groups. Compared with IVT alone, bridging therapy was not associated with excellent outcome (odds ratio [OR] = 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.75–1.24; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.76), but was associated with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR = 3.01; 95% CI = 1.77–5.11; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Occlusion site was a strong modifier of the effect of bridging therapy on outcome (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;interaction&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), with bridging therapy associated with higher odds of excellent outcome in proximal M1 (OR = 3.26; 95% CI = 1.67–6.35; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0006) and distal M1 (OR = 1.69; 95% CI = 1.01–2.82; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04) occlusions, but with lower odds of excellent outcome for M2 (OR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.38–0.75; &lt;i&gt;p =&lt;/i&gt; 0.0003) occlusions. Bridging therapy was associated with higher rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in M2 occlusions only (OR = 4.40; 95% CI = 2.20–8.83; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although overall outcomes were similar in intended bridging therapy as compared to intended IVT alone in minor strokes with LVO, our results suggest that intended bridging therapy may be beneficial in M1 occlusions, whereas the benefit–risk profile may favor IVT alone in M2 occlusions.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Real‐World Effectiveness of Initial Disease‐Modifying Therapies in Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25737?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25737?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess real‐world effectiveness of initial treatment with newer compared to injectable disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs) on disease activity in pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a cohort study of children with MS/CIS followed at 12 clinics in the US Network of Pediatric MS Centers, who received initial therapy with newer (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, natalizumab, rituximab, ocrelizumab) or injectable (interferon‐β, glatiramer acetate) DMTs. Propensity scores (PSs) were computed, including preidentified confounders. Relapse rate while on initial DMT was modeled with negative binomial regression, adjusted for PS‐quintile. Time to new/enlarging T2‐hyperintense and gadolinium‐enhancing lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging were modeled with midpoint survival analyses, adjusted for PS‐quintile.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 741 children began therapy before 18 years, 197 with newer and 544 with injectable DMTs. Those started on newer DMTs were older (15.2 vs injectable 14.4 years, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) and less likely to have a monofocal presentation. In PS‐quintile–adjusted analysis, those on newer DMTs had a lower relapse rate than those on injectables (rate ratio = 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.29–0.70, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; rate difference = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.14–0.40, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004). One would need to treat with newer rather than injectable DMTs for 3.7 person‐years to prevent 1 relapse. Those started on newer DMTs had a lower rate of new/enlarging T2 (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.36–0.72, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and gadolinium‐enhancing lesions (HR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.23–0.63, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) than those on injectables.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial treatment of pediatric MS/CIS with newer DMTs led to better disease activity control compared to injectables, supporting greater effectiveness of newer therapies. Long‐term safety data for newer DMTs are required. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Categorical perception (CP) is the phenomenon by which a smoothly varying stimulus property undergoes a non‐linear transformation during processing in the brain. Consequently, the stimuli are perceived as belonging to distinct categories separated by a sharp boundary. Originally thought to be largely innate, the discovery of CP in tasks such as novel image discrimination has piqued the interest of cognitive scientists because it provides compelling evidence that learning can shape a category’s perceptual boundaries. CP has been particularly closely studied in human face perception. In non‐primates, there is evidence for CP for sound and colour discrimination, but not for image or face discrimination. Here, we investigate the potential for learned CP in a lower vertebrate, the damselfish &lt;i&gt;Pomacentrus amboinensis.&lt;/i&gt; Specifically, we tested whether the ability of these fish to discriminate complex facial patterns tracked categorical rather than metric differences in the stimuli. We first trained the fish to discriminate sets of two facial patterns. Next, we morphed between these patterns and determined the just noticeable difference (JND) between a morph and original image. Finally, we tested for CP by analyzing the discrimination ability of the fish for pairs of JND stimuli along the spectrum of morphs between two original images. Discrimination performance was significant for the image pair straddling the boundary between categories, and chance for equivalent stimulus pairs on either side, thus producing the classic “category boundary” effect. Our results reveal how perception can be influenced in a top‐down manner even in the absence of a visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole brain neuroanatomy using tera‐voxel light‐microscopic data sets is of much current interest. A fundamental problem in this field is the mapping of individual brain datasets to a reference space. Previous work has not rigorously quantified in‐vivo to ex‐vivo distortions in brain geometry from tissue processing. Further, existing approaches focus on registering uni‐modal volumetric data; however, given the increasing interest in the marmoset model for neuroscience research and the importance of addressing individual brain architecture variations, new algorithms are necessary to cross‐register multimodal datasets including MRIs and multiple histological series. Here we present a computational approach for same‐subject multimodal MRI‐guided reconstruction of a series of consecutive histological sections, jointly with diffeomorphic mapping to a reference atlas. We quantify the scale change during different stages of brain histological processing using the Jacobian determinant of the diffeomorphic transformations involved. By mapping the final image stacks to the ex‐vivo post‐fixation MRI, we show that a) tape‐transfer assisted histological sections can be re‐assembled accurately into 3D volumes with a local scale change of 2.0 ± 0.4&lt;i&gt;%&lt;/i&gt; per axis dimension; in contrast, b) tissue perfusion/fixation as assessed by mapping the in‐vivo MRIs to the ex‐vivo post fixation MRIs shows a larger median absolute scale change of 6.9 ± 2.1&lt;i&gt;%&lt;/i&gt; per axis dimension. This is the first systematic quantification of local metric distortions associated with whole‐brain histological processing, and we expect that the results will generalize to other species. These local scale changes will be important for computing local properties to create reference brain maps.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Extremely Dilute Modular Neuronal Networks: Neocortical Memory Retrieval Dynamics. (arXiv:cond-mat/0107612v3 [cond-mat.dis-nn] CROSS LISTED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0107612</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0107612</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A model of the columnar functional organization of neocortical association
areas is studied. The neuronal network is composed of many Hebbian
autoassociators, or modules, each of which interacts with a relatively small
number of the others. Every module encodes and stores a number of elementary
percepts, or features. Memory items, or patterns, are peculiar combinations of
features sparsely distributed over the multi-modular network. Any feature
stored in any module can be involved in several of the stored patterns;
feature-sharing is in fact source of local ambiguities and, consequently, a
potential cause of erroneous memory retrieval activity spreading through the
model network.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memory retrieval dynamics of the large multi-modular autoassociator is
investigated by means of quantitative analysis and numerical simulations. An
oscillatory retrieval process is found to be very efficient in overcoming
feature-sharing drawbacks; it requires a mechanism that modulates the
robustness of local attractors to noise, and neuronal activity sparseness such
that quiescent and active modules are about equally noisy. Correlated
activation of interconnected modules and extramodular neuronal contacts more
effective than the intramodular ones seem to be general requirements in order
to efficiently achieve satisfactory quality of memory retrieval. It is also
shown that, even in ideal conditions, some spots of the network cannot be
reached by retrieval activity spread. The locations of these activity isles
depend on the pattern to retrieve and on the cue, while their extension only
depends on architecture of the graph and statistics of the stored patterns. The
existence of these isles determines an upper-bound to retrieval quality that
does not depend on the specific retrieval dynamics adopted, nor on whether
feature-sharing is permitted. The oscillatory retrieval process nearly
saturates this bound.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Implicit Regularization in Deep Learning May Not Be Explainable by Norms. (arXiv:2005.06398v1 [cs.LG])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06398</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mathematically characterizing the implicit regularization induced by
gradient-based optimization is a longstanding pursuit in the theory of deep
learning. A widespread hope is that a characterization based on minimization of
norms may apply, and a standard test-bed for studying this prospect is matrix
factorization (matrix completion via linear neural networks). It is an open
question whether norms can explain the implicit regularization in matrix
factorization. The current paper resolves this open question in the negative,
by proving that there exist natural matrix factorization problems on which the
implicit regularization drives all norms (and quasi-norms) towards infinity.
Our results suggest that, rather than perceiving the implicit regularization
via norms, a potentially more useful interpretation is minimization of rank. We
demonstrate empirically that this interpretation extends to a certain class of
non-linear neural networks, and hypothesize that it may be key to explaining
generalization in deep learning.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06318</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to follow biological information representation and
organization principles, the field of neuromorphic engineering is usually
approached bottom-up, from the biophysical models to large-scale integration in
silico. While ideal as experimentation platforms for cognitive computing and
neuroscience, bottom-up neuromorphic processors have yet to demonstrate an
efficiency advantage compared to specialized neural network accelerators for
real-world problems. Top-down approaches aim at answering this difficulty by
(i) starting from the applicative problem and (ii) investigating how to make
the associated algorithms hardware-efficient and biologically-plausible. In
order to leverage the data sparsity of spike-based neuromorphic retinas for
adaptive edge computing and vision applications, we follow a top-down approach
and propose SPOON, a 28-nm event-driven CNN (eCNN). It embeds online learning
with only 16.8-% power and 11.8-% area overheads with the
biologically-plausible direct random target projection (DRTP) algorithm. With
an energy per classification of 313nJ at 0.6V and a 0.32-mm$^2$ area for
accuracies of 95.3% (on-chip training) and 97.5% (off-chip training) on MNIST,
we demonstrate that SPOON reaches the efficiency of conventional machine
learning accelerators while embedding on-chip learning and being compatible
with event-based sensors, a point that we further emphasize with N-MNIST
benchmarking.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Binary Neural Networks (BNNs), known to be one among the effectively compact
network architectures, have achieved great outcomes in the visual tasks.
Designing efficient binary architectures is not trivial due to the binary
nature of the network. In this paper, we propose a use of evolutionary search
to facilitate the construction and training scheme when binarizing MobileNet, a
compact network with separable depth-wise convolution. Inspired by one-shot
architecture search frameworks, we manipulate the idea of group convolution to
design efficient 1-Bit Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), assuming an
approximately optimal trade-off between computational cost and model accuracy.
Our objective is to come up with a tiny yet efficient binary neural
architecture by exploring the best candidates of the group convolution while
optimizing the model performance in terms of complexity and latency. The
approach is threefold. First, we train strong baseline binary networks with a
wide range of random group combinations at each convolutional layer. This
set-up gives the binary neural networks a capability of preserving essential
information through layers. Second, to find a good set of hyperparameters for
group convolutions we make use of the evolutionary search which leverages the
exploration of efficient 1-bit models. Lastly, these binary models are trained
from scratch in a usual manner to achieve the final binary model. Various
experiments on ImageNet are conducted to show that following our construction
guideline, the final model achieves 60.09% Top-1 accuracy and outperforms the
state-of-the-art CI-BCNN with the same computational cost.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial Neural Networks (NN) are widely used for solving complex problems
from medical diagnostics to face recognition. Despite notable successes, the
main disadvantages of NN are also well known: the risk of overfitting, lack of
explainability (inability to extract algorithms from trained NN), and high
consumption of computing resources. Determining the appropriate specific NN
structure for each problem can help overcome these difficulties: Too poor NN
cannot be successfully trained, but too rich NN gives unexplainable results and
may have a high chance of overfitting. Reducing precision of NN parameters
simplifies the implementation of these NN, saves computing resources, and makes
the NN skills more transparent. This paper lists the basic NN simplification
problems and controlled pruning procedures to solve these problems. All the
described pruning procedures can be implemented in one framework. The developed
procedures, in particular, find the optimal structure of NN for each task,
measure the influence of each input signal and NN parameter, and provide a
detailed verbal description of the algorithms and skills of NN. The described
methods are illustrated by a simple example: the generation of explicit
algorithms for predicting the results of the US presidential election.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: On Kalman-Bucy filters, linear quadratic control and active inference. (arXiv:2005.06269v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control is a framework first introduced in
control theory that provides an optimal solution to linear problems of
regulation in the presence of uncertainty. This framework combines Kalman-Bucy
filters for the estimation of hidden states with Linear Quadratic Regulators
for the control of their dynamics. Nowadays, LQG is also a common paradigm in
neuroscience, where it is used to characterise different approaches to
sensorimotor control based on state estimators, forward and inverse models.
According to this paradigm, perception can be seen as a process of Bayesian
inference and action as a process of optimal control. Recently, active
inference has been introduced as a process theory derived from a variational
approximation of Bayesian inference problems that describes, among others,
perception and action in terms of (variational and expected) free energy
minimisation. Active inference relies on a mathematical formalism similar to
LQG, but offers a rather different perspective on problems of sensorimotor
control in biological systems based on a process of biased perception. In this
note we compare the mathematical treatments of these two frameworks for linear
systems, focusing on their respective assumptions and highlighting their
commonalities and technical differences.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Novelty Search makes Evolvability Inevitable. (arXiv:2005.06224v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Evolvability is an important feature that impacts the ability of evolutionary
processes to find interesting novel solutions and to deal with changing
conditions of the problem to solve. The estimation of evolvability is not
straightforward and is generally too expensive to be directly used as selective
pressure in the evolutionary process. Indirectly promoting evolvability as a
side effect of other easier and faster to compute selection pressures would
thus be advantageous. In an unbounded behavior space, it has already been shown
that evolvable individuals naturally appear and tend to be selected as they are
more likely to invade empty behavior niches. Evolvability is thus a natural
byproduct of the search in this context. However, practical agents and
environments often impose limits on the reach-able behavior space. How do these
boundaries impact evolvability? In this context, can evolvability still be
promoted without explicitly rewarding it? We show that Novelty Search
implicitly creates a pressure for high evolvability even in bounded behavior
spaces, and explore the reasons for such a behavior. More precisely we show
that, throughout the search, the dynamic evaluation of novelty rewards
individuals which are very mobile in the behavior space, which in turn promotes
evolvability.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Robots are still limited to controlled conditions, that the robot designer
knows with enough details to endow the robot with the appropriate models or
behaviors. Learning algorithms add some flexibility with the ability to
discover the appropriate behavior given either some demonstrations or a reward
to guide its exploration with a reinforcement learning algorithm. Reinforcement
learning algorithms rely on the definition of state and action spaces that
define reachable behaviors. Their adaptation capability critically depends on
the representations of these spaces: small and discrete spaces result in fast
learning while large and continuous spaces are challenging and either require a
long training period or prevent the robot from converging to an appropriate
behavior. Beside the operational cycle of policy execution and the learning
cycle, which works at a slower time scale to acquire new policies, we introduce
the redescription cycle, a third cycle working at an even slower time scale to
generate or adapt the required representations to the robot, its environment
and the task. We introduce the challenges raised by this cycle and we present
DREAM (Deferred Restructuring of Experience in Autonomous Machines), a
developmental cognitive architecture to bootstrap this redescription process
stage by stage, build new state representations with appropriate motivations,
and transfer the acquired knowledge across domains or tasks or even across
robots. We describe results obtained so far with this approach and end up with
a discussion of the questions it raises in Neuroscience.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Applying latent variable evolution to game level design has become more and
more popular as little human expert knowledge is required. However, defective
levels with illegal patterns may be generated due to the violation of
constraints for level design. A traditional way of repairing the defective
levels is programming specific rule-based repairers to patch the flaw. However,
programming these constraints is sometimes complex and not straightforward. An
autonomous level repairer which is capable of learning the constraints is
needed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, CNet, to learn the
probability distribution of tiles giving its surrounding tiles on a set of real
levels, and then detect the illegal tiles in generated new levels. Then, an
evolutionary repairer is designed to search for optimal replacement schemes
equipped with a novel search space being constructed with the help of CNet and
a novel heuristic function. The proposed approaches are proved to be effective
in our case study of repairing GAN-generated and artificially destroyed levels
of Super Mario Bros. game. Our CNet-assisted evolutionary repairer can also be
easily applied to other games of which the levels can be represented by a
matrix of objects or tiles.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cellular automata are discrete and computational models thatcan be shown as
general models of complexity. They are used in varied applications to derive
the generalized behavior of the presented model. In this paper we have took one
such application. We have made an effort to perform edge detection on an image
using genetic algorithm. The purpose and the intention here is to analyze the
capability and performance of the suggested genetic algorithm. Genetic
algorithms are used to depict or obtain a general solution of given problem.
Using this feature of GA we have tried to evolve the cellular automata and
shown that how with time it converges to the desired results.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Evaluating the Effect of Interleukin-4 in the 3xTg Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00441</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00441</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic neuroinflammation has long been hypothesized to be involved in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) progression. Previous research suggests that both anti-inflammatory and inflammatory microglia ameliorate amyloid pathology, but the latter worsen tau pathology. In this study, we sought to determine whether induction of arginase-1 positive microglia with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 modulates pathology in the 3xTg mouse model of AD. Our findings indicate that a single intracranial IL-4 injection positively modulated performance of 3xTg AD mice in a Novel Object Recognition task, and locally increased the levels of arginase-1 positive myeloid cells when assessed one-week post injection. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis revealed decreased tau phosphorylation in IL-4 injected animals; however, we were not able to detect significant changes in tau phosphorylation utilizing Western blot. Lastly, IL-4 injection did not appear to cause significant changes in amyloid β load. In conclusion, acute intracranial IL-4 led to some positive benefits in the 3xTg mouse model of AD. Although more work remains, these results support therapeutic strategies aimed at modifying microglial activation states in neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Individualized Template MRI Is a Valid and Reliable Alternative to Individual MRI for Spatial Tracking in Navigated TMS Studies in Healthy Subjects</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00174</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00174</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) provides significant benefits over classic TMS. Yet, the acquisition of individual structural magnetic resonance images (MRI&lt;sub&gt;individual&lt;/sub&gt;) is a time-consuming, expensive, and not feasible prerequisite in all subjects for spatial tracking and anatomical guidance in nTMS studies. We hypothesize that spatial transformation can be used to adjust MRI templates to individual head shapes (MRI&lt;sub&gt;warped&lt;/sub&gt;) and that TMS parameters do not differ between nTMS using MRI&lt;sub&gt;individual&lt;/sub&gt; or MRI&lt;sub&gt;warped&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: Twenty identical TMS sessions, each including four different navigation conditions, were conducted in 10 healthy subjects (one female, 27.4 ± 3.8 years), i.e., twice per subject by two researchers to additionally assess interrater reliabilities. MRI&lt;sub&gt;individual&lt;/sub&gt; were acquired for all subjects. MRI&lt;sub&gt;warped&lt;/sub&gt; were obtained through the spatial transformation of a template MRI following a 5-, 9-and 36-point head surface registration (MRI&lt;sub&gt;warped_5&lt;/sub&gt;, MRI&lt;sub&gt;warped_9&lt;/sub&gt;, MRI&lt;sub&gt;warped_36&lt;/sub&gt;). Stimulation hotspot locations, resting motor threshold (RMT), 500 μV motor threshold (500 μV-MT), and mean absolute motor evoked potential difference (MAD) of primary motor cortex (M1) examinations were compared between nTMS using either MRI&lt;sub&gt;warped&lt;/sub&gt; variants or MRI&lt;sub&gt;individual&lt;/sub&gt; and non-navigated TMS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: M1 hotspots were spatially consistent between MRI&lt;sub&gt;individual&lt;/sub&gt; and MRI&lt;sub&gt;warped_36&lt;/sub&gt; (insignificant deviation by 4.79 ± 2.62 mm). MEP thresholds and variance were also equivalent between MRI&lt;sub&gt;individual&lt;/sub&gt; and MRI&lt;sub&gt;warped_36&lt;/sub&gt; with mean differences of RMT by −0.05 ± 2.28% maximum stimulator output (%MSO; t&lt;sub&gt;(19)&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.09, p = 0.923), 500 μV-MT by −0.15 ± 1.63%MSO (t&lt;sub&gt;(19)&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.41, p = 0.686) and MAD by 70.5 ± 214.38 μV (t&lt;sub&gt;(19)&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.47, p = 0.158). Intraclass correlations (ICC) of motor thresholds were between 0.88 and 0.97.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: NTMS examinations of M1 yield equivalent topographical and functional results using MRI&lt;sub&gt;individual&lt;/sub&gt; and MRI&lt;sub&gt;warped&lt;/sub&gt; if a sufficient number of registration points are used.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Effect of Perceived Effort on Reward Valuation: Taking the Reward Positivity (RewP) to Dissonance Theory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00157</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00157</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The present research was designed to test whether the subjective experience of more effort related to more reward valuation as measured by a neural response. This prediction was derived from the theory of cognitive dissonance and its effort justification paradigm. Young adult participants (n = 82) engaged in multiple trails of a low or high effort task that resulted in a loss or reward on each trial. Neural responses to the reward (loss) cue were measured using EEG so that the event-related potential known as the Reward Positivity (RewP) could be assessed. Results revealed no significant differences between low and high effort conditions on the RewP. However, within the high effort condition, a more subjective experience of effort was associated with a larger RewP. This research extends past research on the effort justification paradigm of cognitive dissonance theory by suggesting that effort justification is associated with an implicit measure of reward valuation. It, therefore, challenges recent perspectives on dissonance processes that posit that these evaluative changes should only occur on explicit but not implicit measures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Exploring Representation of Diverse Samples in fMRI Studies Conducted in Patients With Cardiac-Related Chronic Illness: A Focused Systematic Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00108</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00108</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction/Purpose: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, and in the United States alone, CVD causes nearly 840,000 deaths annually. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a tool to assess brain activity, researchers have identified some brain-behavior connections and predicted several self-management behaviors. The purpose of this study was to examine the sample characteristics of individuals with CVD who participated in fMRI studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus. No date or language restrictions were applied and research methodology filters were used. In October 2017, 1659 titles and abstracts were identified. Inclusion criteria were: (1) utilized an empirical study design, (2) used fMRI to assess brain activity, and (3) focused on patients with CVD-related chronic illness. Articles were excluded if they: were theory or opinion articles, focused on mental or neuropathic illness, included non-human samples, or were not written in English. After duplicates were removed (230), 1,429 titles and abstracts were reviewed based on inclusion criteria; 1,243 abstracts were then excluded. A total of 186 studies were reviewed in their entirety; after additional review, 142 were further excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria. Forty-four articles met criteria and were included in the final review. An evidence table was created to capture the demographics of each study sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Ninety eight percent of the studies did not report the racial or ethnic composition of their sample. Most studies (66%) contained more men than women. Mean age ranged from 38 to 78 years; 77% reported mean age ≥50 years. The most frequently studied CVD was stroke (86%), while hypertension was studied the least (2%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Understanding brain-behavior relationships can help researchers and practitioners tailor interventions to meet specific patient needs. These findings suggest that additional studies are needed that focus on populations historically underrepresented in fMRI research. Researchers should thoughtfully consider diversity and purposefully sample groups by including individuals that are: women, from diverse backgrounds, younger, and diagnosed with a variety of CVD-related illnesses. Identifying and addressing these gaps by studying more representative samples will help healthcare providers reduce disparities and tailor interventions for all CVD populations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Strategies to Promote Long-Distance Optic Nerve Regeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00119</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mammalian retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the central nervous system (CNS) often die after optic nerve injury and surviving RGCs fail to regenerate their axons, eventually resulting in irreversible vision loss. Manipulation of a diverse group of genes can significantly boost optic nerve regeneration of mature RGCs by reactivating developmental-like growth programs or suppressing growth inhibitory pathways. By injury of the vision pathway near their brain targets, a few studies have shown that regenerated RGC axons could form functional synapses with targeted neurons but exhibited poor neural conduction or partial functional recovery. Therefore, the functional restoration of eye-to-brain pathways remains a greatly challenging issue. Here, we review recent advances in long-distance optic nerve regeneration and the subsequent reconnecting to central targets. By summarizing our current strategies for promoting functional recovery, we hope to provide potential insights into future exploration in vision reformation after neural injuries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Lack of Helios During Neural Development Induces Adult Schizophrenia-Like Behaviors Associated With Aberrant Levels of the TRIF-Recruiter Protein WDFY1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00093</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00093</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The role of the WDFY1 protein has been studied as a TLR3/4 scaffold/recruiting protein in the immune system and in different oncogenic conditions. However, its function in brain remains poorly understood. We have found that in mice devoid of Helios (He&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice), a transcription factor specifically expressed during the development of the immune cells and the central nervous system, there is a permanent and sustained increase of Wdfy1 gene expression in the striatum and hippocampus. Interestingly, we observed that WDFY1 protein levels were also increased in the hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic patients, but not in the hippocampus of Alzheimer’s disease patients with an associated psychotic disorder. Accordingly, young He&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice displayed several schizophrenic-like behaviors related to dysfunctions in the striatum and hippocampus. These changes were associated with an increase in spine density in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and with a decrease in the number and size of PSD-95-positive clusters in the stratum radiatum of the CA1. Moreover, these alterations in structural synaptic plasticity were associated with a strong reduction of neuronal NF-κB in the pyramidal layer of the CA1 in He&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Altogether, our data indicate that alterations involving the molecular axis Helios-WDFY1 in neurons during the development of core brain regions could be relevant for the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Prevalence and Atypical Clinical Characteristics of NOTCH3 Mutations Among Patients Admitted for Acute Lacunar Infarctions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00130</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00130</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common hereditary small vessel disease, with reported frequencies of 2-5/100,000 individuals. Recently, it has been reported that some patients with NOTCH3 gene mutations show atypical clinical symptoms of CADASIL. Assuming that CADASIL is underdiagnosed in some cases of lacunar infarction, this study was designed to examine the prevalence of NOTCH3 gene mutations in the patients at highest risk who were admitted for lacunar infarctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: From January 2011 to April 2018, 1,094 patients with lacunar infarctions were admitted to our hospital, of whom 31 patients without hypertension but with white matter disease (Fazekas scale 2 or 3) were selected and genetically analyzed for NOTCH3 gene mutations (Phase 1). Furthermore, 54 patients, who were 60 years or younger, were analyzed for NOTCH3 mutations (Phase 2). NOTCH3 exons 2–24, which encode the epidermal growth factor-like repeat domain of the NOTCH3 receptor, were analyzed for mutations by direct sequencing of genomic DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Three patients presented NOTCH3 p.R75P mutations: two in the Phase 1 and one in the Phase 2 cohort. Among patients aged 60 years or younger and those without hypertension but with moderate-to-severe white matter lesions, the carrier frequency of p.R75P was 3.5% (3/85), which was significantly higher than that in the Japanese general population (4.7KJPN) (odds ratio [95% CI] = 58.2 [11.6–292.5]). All three patients with NOTCH3 mutations had family histories of stroke, and the average patient age was 51.3 years. All three patients also showed white matter lesions in the external capsule but not in the temporal pole. The CADASIL and CADASIL scale-J scores of the three patients were 6, 17, 7 (mean, 10.0) and 13, 20, 10 (mean, 14.3), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Among patients hospitalized for lacunar infarctions, the p.R75P prevalence may be higher than previously estimated. The NOTCH3 p.R75P mutation may be underdiagnosed in patients with early-onset lacunar infarctions due to the atypical clinical and neuroimaging features of CADASIL. Early-onset, presence of family history of stroke, external capsule lesions, and absence of hypertension may help predict underlying NOTCH3 mutations despite no temporal white matter lesions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Increased CSF NFL in Non-demented Parkinson’s Disease Subjects Reflects Early White Matter Damage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00128</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00128</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder with various underlying pathological processes. Until now, no fluid biomarkers have been established for PD. Given recent biochemical and neuroimaging evidence for the presence of white matter damage in PD, which may even precede neuronal loss, we investigated whether neurofilament light (NFL) was increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of PD patients in comparison to controls. NFL is located mainly in large myelinated axons, and increased CSF levels of this protein reflect axonal injury. CSF levels of NFL in 58 early PD patients and 28 controls were quantified by ELISA (Uman Diagnostics). Measures of PD severity included disease duration, UPDRS-III, and Hoehn-Yahr stage. Statistically significant differences in CSF NFL levels were found between PD patients and controls [median with interquartile range 524.82 (393.28–678.34) vs. 271.84 (198.09–335.24) ng/l; p &amp;lt; 0.05)]. In PD patients, there were no correlations between CSF NFL level and the measures of disease severity. The CSF NFL turned out to have a high discriminatory value (AUC 0.850) for differentiating between PD subjects and healthy controls, with 84% sensitivity and 85.2% specificity. The study indirectly demonstrates that axonal damage is present in early PD in addition to neuronal loss. Interestingly, white matter damage was observed in non-demented PD patients. In the light of the results of recent MRI studies which confirm early white matter damage in PD, our data may turn out to be potentially useful in the diagnosis of early, or even preclinical, stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been a major health issue for more than one century since it was first reported in 1906. As one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, AD is characterized by the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the affected brain area. Microglia are the major regulators of neuroinflammation in the brain, and neuroinflammation has become recognized as the core pathophysiological process of various neurodegenerative diseases. In the central nervous system (CNS), microglia play a dual role in AD development. For one thing, they degrade amyloid β (Aβ) to resist its deposition; for another, microglia release pro-inflammatory and inflammatory factors, contributing to neuroinflammation as well as the spreading of Aβ and tau pathology. Wnt pathways are important regulators of cell fate and cell activities. The dysregulation of Wnt pathways is responsible for both abnormal tau phosphorylation and synaptic loss in AD. Recent studies have also confirmed the regulatory effect of Wnt signaling on microglial inflammation. Thus, the study of microglia, Wnt pathways, and their possible interactions may open up a new direction for understanding the mechanisms of neuroinflammation in AD. In this review, we summarize the functions of microglia and Wnt pathways and their roles in AD in order to provide new ideas for understanding the pathogenesis of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Reconstitution reveals two paths of force transmission through the kinetochore</title>

	<description>Partitioning duplicated chromosomes equally between daughter cells is a microtubule-mediated process essential to eukaryotic life. A multi-protein machine, the kinetochore, drives chromosome segregation by coupling the chromosomes to dynamic microtubule tips, even as the tips grow and shrink through the gain and loss of subunits. The kinetochore must harness, transmit, and sense mitotic forces, as a lack of tension signals incorrect chromosome-microtubule attachment and precipitates error correction mechanisms. But though the field has arrived at a 'parts list' of dozens of kinetochore proteins organized into subcomplexes, the path of force transmission through these components has remained unclear. Here we report reconstitution of functional &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae &lt;/i&gt;kinetochore assemblies from recombinantly expressed proteins. The reconstituted kinetochores are capable of self-assembling &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, coupling centromeric nucleosomes to dynamic microtubules, and withstanding mitotically relevant forces. They reveal two distinct pathways of force transmission and Ndc80c recruitment.</description>

	<title>eLife: Single-cell transcriptome reveals the novel role of T-bet in suppressing the immature NK gene signature</title>

	<description>The transcriptional activation and repression during NK cell ontology are poorly understood. Here, using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we reveal a novel role for T-bet in suppressing the immature gene signature during murine NK cell development. Based on transcriptome, we identified five distinct NK cell clusters and define their relative developmental maturity in the bone marrow. Transcriptome-based machine-learning classifiers revealed that half of the mTORC2-deficient NK cells belongs to the least mature NK cluster. Mechanistically, loss of mTORC2 results in an increased expression of signature genes representing immature NK cells. Since mTORC2 regulates the expression of T-bet through AktS473-FoxO1 axis, we further characterized the T-bet-deficient NK cells and found an augmented immature transcriptomic signature. Moreover, deletion of &lt;i&gt;Foxo1&lt;/i&gt; restores the expression of T-bet and corrects the abnormal expression of immature NK genes. Collectively, our study reveals a novel role for mTORC2-Akt&lt;sup&gt;S473&lt;/sup&gt;-FoxO1-T-bet axis in suppressing the transcriptional signature of immature NK cells.</description>

Cell culture remains as the golden standard for primary isolation of viruses in clinical specimens. In the current practice, researchers have to recognize the cytopathic effects (CPE) induced by virus infection and subsequently use virus-specific monoclonal antibody to confirm the presence of virus. Considering the broad applications of neural network in various fields, we aimed to utilize convolutional neural networks (CNN) to shorten the timing required for CPE identification and to improve the assay sensitivity. Based on the characteristics of influenza-induced CPE, a CNN model with larger sizes of filters and max-pooling kernels was constructed in the absence of transfer learning. A total of 601 images from mock-infected and influenza-infected MDCK cells were used to train the model. The performance of the model was tested by using extra 400 images and the percentage of correct recognition was 99.75%. To further examine the limit of our model in evaluating the changes of CPE overtime, additional 1190 images from a new experiment were used and the recognition rates at 16 hour (hr), 28 hr, and 40 hr post virus infection were 71.80%, 98.25%, and 87.46%, respectively. The specificity of our model, examined by images of MDCK cells infected by six other non-influenza viruses, was 100%. Hence, a simple CNN model was established to enhance the identification of influenza virus in clinical practice.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cBEhyD75-t8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Towards a data-driven characterization of behavioral changes induced by the seasonal flu</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicolò Gozzi, Daniela Perrotta, Daniela Paolotti, Nicola Perra&lt;/p&gt;

In this work, we aim to determine the main factors driving self-initiated behavioral changes during the seasonal flu. To this end, we designed and deployed a questionnaire via Influweb, a Web platform for participatory surveillance in Italy, during the 2017 − 18 and 2018 − 19 seasons. We collected 599 surveys completed by 434 users. The data provide socio-demographic information, level of concerns about the flu, past experience with illnesses, and the type of behavioral changes voluntarily implemented by each participant. We describe each response with a set of features and divide them in three target categories. These describe those that report i) no (26%), ii) only moderately (36%), iii) significant (38%) changes in behaviors. In these settings, we adopt machine learning algorithms to investigate the extent to which target variables can be predicted by looking only at the set of features. Notably, 66% of the samples in the category describing more significant changes in behaviors are correctly classified through Gradient Boosted Trees. Furthermore, we investigate the importance of each feature in the classification task and uncover complex relationships between individuals’ characteristics and their attitude towards behavioral change. We find that intensity, recency of past illnesses, perceived susceptibility to and perceived severity of an infection are the most significant features in the classification task and are associated to significant changes in behaviors. Overall, the research contributes to the small set of empirical studies devoted to the data-driven characterization of behavioral changes induced by infectious diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DtRFIElbWMo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Accelerating prediction of chemical shift of protein structures on GPUs: Using OpenACC</title>

Experimental chemical shifts (CS) from solution and solid state magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra provide atomic level information for each amino acid within a protein or protein complex. However, structure determination of large complexes and assemblies based on NMR data alone remains challenging due to the complexity of the calculations. Here, we present a hardware accelerated strategy for the estimation of NMR chemical-shifts of large macromolecular complexes based on the previously published PPM_One software. The original code was not viable for computing large complexes, with our largest dataset taking approximately 14 hours to complete. Our results show that serial code refactoring and parallel acceleration brought down the time taken of the software running on an NVIDIA Volta 100 (V100) Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) to 46.71 seconds for our largest dataset of 11.3 million atoms. We use OpenACC, a directive-based programming model for porting the application to a heterogeneous system consisting of x86 processors and NVIDIA GPUs. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in systems of increasing complexity ranging from 100K to 11.3M atoms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MIaNd42F8p8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Modeling the processes of neuronal progenitor proliferation and differentiation to produce mature cortical neuron subtypes is essential for the study of human brain development and the search for potential cell therapies. We demonstrated a novel paradigm for the generation of vascularized organoids (vOrganoids) consisting of typical human cortical cell types and a vascular structure for over 200 days as a vascularized and functional brain organoid model. The observation of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs), spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs), and bidirectional electrical transmission indicated the presence of chemical and electrical synapses in vOrganoids. More importantly, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis illustrated that vOrganoids exhibited robust neurogenesis and that cells of vOrganoids differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to blood vessel morphogenesis. The transplantation of vOrganoids into the mouse S1 cortex resulted in the construction of functional human-mouse blood vessels in the grafts that promoted cell survival in the grafts. This vOrganoid culture method could not only serve as a model to study human cortical development and explore brain disease pathology but also provide potential prospects for new cell therapies for nervous system disorders and injury.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/p34CTtfe5as&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Variations on a theme: morphological variation in the secondary eye visual pathway across the order of Araneae</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Variations on a theme: morphological variation in the secondary eye visual pathway across the order of Araneae&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/58c685be-6a94-4f04-8ea5-b7c83a31adf3/cne24945-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagrams showing the four different groups of secondary eye morphology found by the study. For each group, neuropils of the secondary eye visual pathway and the connections between the secondary eye visual pathway and the protocerebrum are given.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiders possess a wide array of sensory‐driven behaviors and therefore provide rich models for studying evolutionary hypotheses about the relationship between brain morphology, sensory systems and behavior. Despite this, only a handful of studies have examined brain variation across the order of Araneae. In this study, I present descriptions of the gross brain morphology for 19 families of spiders that vary in eye morphology. Spiders showed the most variation in the secondary eye visual pathway. Based on this variation, spiders could be categorized into four groups. Group One spiders had small, underdeveloped laminae, no medullae and no mushroom bodies. Group Two spiders had large laminae, no medullae and large mushroom bodies. Group Three spiders had laminae and some evidence of reduced medullae and mushroom bodies. Group Four spiders had the most complex systems, with large laminae, medullae formed from optical glomeruli, and robust mushroom bodies. Within groups, there was large variation in the shape and size of individual regions, indicating possible variation in neuronal organization. The possible evolutionary implications of the loss of a dedicated olfactory organ in spiders and its effects on the mushroom body are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: GGPS1 Mutations Cause Muscular Dystrophy/Hearing Loss/Ovarian Insufficiency Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25772?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25772?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hitherto undescribed phenotype of early onset muscular dystrophy associated with sensorineural hearing loss and primary ovarian insufficiency was initially identified in two siblings and in subsequent patients with a similar constellation of findings. The goal of this study was to understand the genetic and molecular etiology of this condition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We applied whole exome sequencing (WES) superimposed on shared haplotype regions to identify the initial biallelic variants in &lt;i&gt;GGPS1&lt;/i&gt; followed by &lt;i&gt;GGPS1&lt;/i&gt; Sanger sequencing or WES in five additional families with the same phenotype. Molecular modeling, biochemical analysis, laser membrane injury assay and the generation of a Y259C knock‐in mouse were done.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 11 patients in six families carrying five different biallelic mutations in specific domains of &lt;i&gt;GGPS1&lt;/i&gt; were identified. &lt;i&gt;GGPS1&lt;/i&gt; encodes geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase in the mevalonate/isoprenoid pathway, which catalyzes the synthesis of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), the lipid precursor of geranylgeranylated proteins including small GTPases. All but one patient presented with congenital sensorineural hearing loss and proximal weakness, and all post‐pubertal females had primary ovarian insufficiency. Muscle histology was dystrophic with ultrastructural evidence of autophagic material and large mitochondria in the most severe cases. There was delayed membrane healing after laser injury in patient derived myogenic cells while a knock‐in mouse of one of the mutations (Y259C) resulted in prenatal lethality.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identification of specific &lt;i&gt;GGPS1&lt;/i&gt; mutations defines the cause of a unique form of muscular dystrophy with hearing loss and ovarian insufficiency and points to a novel pathway for this clinical constellation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Model-Predicted Balance Between Neural Excitation and Inhibition Was Maintained Despite of Age-Related Decline in Sensory Evoked Local Field Potential in Rat Barrel Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The balance between neural excitation and inhibition has been shown to be crucial for normal brain function. However, it is unclear whether this balance is maintained through healthy aging. This study investigated the effect of aging on the temporal dynamics of the somatosensory evoked local field potential (LFP) in rats and tested the hypothesis that excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic activities remain balanced during the aging process. The LFP signal was obtained from the barrel cortex of three different age groups of anesthetized rats (pre-adolescence: 4–6 weeks, young adult: 2–3 months, middle-aged adult: 10–20 months) under whisker pad stimulation. To confirm our previous finding that the initial segment of the evoked LFP was solely associated with excitatory post-synaptic activity, we micro-injected gabazine into the barrel cortex to block inhibition while LFP was collected continuously under the same stimulus condition. As expected, the initial slope of the evoked LFP in the granular layer was unaffected by gabazine injection. We subsequently estimated the excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic activities through a balanced model of the LFP with delayed inhibition as an explicit constraint, and calculated the amplitude ratio of inhibition to excitation. We found an age-dependent slowing of the temporal dynamics in the somatosensory-evoked post-synaptic activity, as well as a significant age-related decrease in the amplitude of the excitatory component and a decreasing trend in the amplitude of the inhibitory component. Furthermore, the delay of inhibition with respect to excitation was significantly increased with age, but the amplitude ratio was maintained. Our findings suggest that aging reduces the amplitude of neural responses, but the balance between sensory evoked excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic activities is maintained to support normal brain function during healthy aging. Further whole cell patch clamp experiments will be needed to confirm or refute these findings by measuring sensory evoked synaptic excitatory and inhibitory activities in vivo during the normal aging process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Early Detection of Alzheimer’s Disease Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Novel Approach Combining Convolutional Neural Networks and Ensemble Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00259</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Early detection is critical for effective management of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is common practice. Among several deep-learning techniques that have been applied to assessing structural brain changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), convolutional neural network (CNN) has gained popularity due to its superb efficiency in automated feature learning with the use of a variety of multilayer perceptrons. Meanwhile, ensemble learning (EL) has shown to be beneficial in the robustness of learning-system performance via integrating multiple models. Here, we proposed a classifier ensemble developed by combining CNN and EL, i.e., the CNN-EL approach, to identify subjects with MCI or AD using MRI: i.e., classification between (1) AD and healthy cognition (HC), (2) MCIc (MCI patients who will convert to AD) and HC, and (3) MCIc and MCInc (MCI patients who will not convert to AD). For each binary classification task, a large number of CNN models were trained applying a set of sagittal, coronal, or transverse MRI slices; these CNN models were then integrated into a single ensemble. Performance of the ensemble was evaluated using stratified fivefold cross-validation method for 10 times. The number of the intersection points determined by the most discriminable slices separating two classes in a binary classification task among the sagittal, coronal, and transverse slice sets, transformed into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, acted as an indicator to assess the ability of a brain region in which the points were located to classify AD. Thus, the brain regions with most intersection points were considered as those mostly contributing to the early diagnosis of AD. The result revealed an accuracy rate of 0.84 ± 0.05, 0.79 ± 0.04, and 0.62 ± 0.06, respectively, for classifying AD vs. HC, MCIc vs. HC, and MCIc vs. MCInc, comparable to previous reports and a 3D deep learning approach (3D-SENet) based on a more state-of-the-art and popular Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks model using channel attention mechanism. Notably, the intersection points accurately located the medial temporal lobe and several other structures of the limbic system, i.e., brain regions known to be struck early in AD. More interestingly, the classifiers disclosed multiple patterned MRI changes in the brain in AD and MCIc, involving these key regions. These results suggest that as a data-driven method, the combined CNN and EL approach can locate the most discriminable brain regions indicated by the trained ensemble model while the generalization ability of the ensemble model was maximized to successfully capture AD-related brain variations early in the disease process; it can also provide new insights into understanding the complex heterogeneity of whole-brain MRI changes in AD. Further research is needed to examine the clinical implication of the finding, capability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to help understand and evaluate an individual subject’s disease status, symptom burden and progress, and the generalizability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to locate the most discriminable brain regions in the detection of other brain disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and severe depression, in a data-driven way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Upper Limit on the Thermodynamic Information Content of an Action Potential</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In computational neuroscience, spiking neurons are often analyzed as computing devices that register bits of information, with each action potential carrying at most one bit of Shannon entropy. Here, I question this interpretation by using Landauer's principle to estimate an upper limit for the quantity of thermodynamic information that can be processed within a single action potential in a typical mammalian neuron. A straightforward calculation shows that an action potential in a typical mammalian cortical pyramidal cell can process up to approximately 3.4 · 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; bits of thermodynamic information, or about 4.9 · 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; bits of Shannon entropy. This result suggests that an action potential can, in principle, carry much more than a single bit of Shannon entropy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Can Improve Spatial Learning and Memory and Attenuate Aβ42 Burden at the Early Stage of Alzheimer’s Disease in APP/PS1 Transgenic Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible progressive neurodegenerative disease. Intervention in the early stage of AD is a new path for AD treatment that is being explored. The behavioral and pathological effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (AtDCS) at the early stage of AD in the mouse model, amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) transgenic mice, were investigated based on our previous studies. Thirty-three 6-month-old male APP/PS1 mice were randomly divided into the model group (AD group), model + sham stimulation group (ADST group) and stimulation group (ADT group). Eleven 6-month-old male C57 wild-type mice were randomly selected as a control group (CTL group). The ADT group received 10 AtDCS sessions. The Morris water maze (MWM) task and novel object recognition (NOR) task were used to test mouse memory. Nissl staining, Western blot (WB), immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining of β-amyloid (Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and NF200 were conducted for pathological analysis. The ADT group and the CTL group had a shorter escape latency and more platform-region crossings than the AD group and ADST group in the MWM. There was no significant difference in the discrimination index among the groups in the NOR task. Pathological analysis showed visible differences between the AD group and ADT group. This study revealed that early-stage APP/PS1 transgenic mice did not show recognition memory impairment. AtDCS effectively improved spatial learning and memory in the early-stage APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD, alleviating Aβ burden and having a protective effect on neurons. AtDCS could improve AD-related symptoms by activating many glial cells to promote the degradation and clearance of Aβ or directly affecting production and degradation of Aβ to reduce glial activation. AtDCS is an effective means of early intervention in the early stage of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Synergism of type 1 metabotropic and ionotropic glutamate receptors in cerebellar molecular layer interneurons in vivo</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56839</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56839</link>
	<description>Type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1s) are key elements in neuronal signaling. While their function is well documented in slices, requirements for their activation in vivo are poorly understood. We examine this question in adult mice in vivo using 2-photon imaging of cerebellar molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) expressing GCaMP. In anesthetized mice, parallel fiber activation evokes beam-like Ca&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; rises in postsynaptic MLIs which depend on co-activation of mGluR1s and ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). In awake mice, blocking mGluR1 decreases Ca&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; rises associated with locomotion. In vitro studies and freeze-fracture electron microscopy show that the iGluR-mGluR1 interaction is synergistic and favored by close association of the two classes of receptors. Altogether our results suggest that mGluR1s, acting in synergy with iGluRs, potently contribute to processing cerebellar neuronal signaling under physiological conditions.</description>

	<description>Antimicrobial-resistant &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (Mtb) causes over 200,000 deaths each year. Current assays of antimicrobial resistance need knowledge of mutations that confer drug resistance, or long periods of culture time to test growth under drug pressure. We present ODELAM (One-cell Doubling Evaluation of Living Arrays of Mycobacterium), a time-lapse microscopy-based method that observes individual cells growing into microcolonies. ODELAM enables rapid quantitative measures of growth kinetics in as little as 30 hours under a wide variety of environmental conditions. We demonstrate ODELAM's utility by identifying ofloxacin resistance in cultured clinical isolates of Mtb and benchmark its performance with standard minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays. In Mtb isolate, ODELAM identified ofloxacin heteroresistance and identifies the presence of drug resistant colony forming units (CFUs) at 1 per 1000 CFUs in as little as 48 hours. ODELAM is a powerful new tool that can rapidly evaluate Mtb drug resistance in a laboratory setting.</description>

	<title>eLife: A critical re-evaluation of fMRI signatures of motor sequence learning</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55241</link>
	<description>Despite numerous studies, there is little agreement about what brain changes accompany motor sequence learning, partly because of a general publication bias that favors novel results. We therefore decided to systematically reinvestigate proposed functional magnetic resonance imaging correlates of motor learning in a preregistered longitudinal study with four scanning sessions over 5 weeks of training. Activation decreased more for trained than untrained sequences in premotor and parietal areas, without any evidence of learning-related activation increases. Premotor and parietal regions also exhibited changes in the fine-grained, sequence-specific activation patterns early in learning, which stabilized later. No changes were observed in the primary motor cortex (M1). Overall, our study provides evidence that human motor sequence learning occurs outside of M1. Furthermore, it shows that we cannot expect to find activity increases as an indicator for learning, making subtle changes in activity patterns across weeks the most promising fMRI correlate of training-induced plasticity.</description>

	<title>eLife: Synergistic roles of Synaptotagmin-1 and complexin in calcium-regulated neuronal exocytosis</title>

	<description>Calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;)-evoked release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles requires mechanisms both to prevent un-initiated fusion of vesicles (clamping) and to trigger fusion following Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-influx. The principal components involved in these processes are the vesicular fusion machinery (SNARE proteins) and the regulatory proteins, Synaptotagmin-1 and Complexin. Here, we use a reconstituted single-vesicle fusion assay under physiologically-relevant conditions to delineate a novel mechanism by which Synaptotagmin-1 and Complexin act synergistically to establish Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-regulated fusion. We find that under each vesicle, Synaptotagmin-1 oligomers bind and clamp a limited number of ‘central’ SNARE complexes via the primary interface and introduce a kinetic delay in vesicle fusion mediated by the excess of free SNAREpins. This in turn enables Complexin to arrest the remaining free ‘peripheral’ SNAREpins to produce a stably clamped vesicle. Activation of the central SNAREpins associated with Synaptotagmin-1 by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is sufficient to trigger rapid (&amp;lt;100 msec) and synchronous fusion of the docked vesicles.</description>

	<description>Bone destruction relies on interactions between bone and immune cells. Bone-resorbing osteoclasts (OCLs) were recently identified as innate immune cells activating T cells toward tolerance or inflammation. Thus, pathological bone destruction not only relies on increased osteoclast differentiation, but also on the presence of inflammatory OCLs (i-OCLs), part of which express &lt;i&gt;Cx3cr1&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we investigated the contribution of mouse Cx3cr1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cx3cr1&lt;sup&gt;neg&lt;/sup&gt; i-OCLs to bone loss. We showed that Cx3cr1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cx3cr1&lt;sup&gt;neg&lt;/sup&gt; i-OCLs differ considerably in transcriptional and functional aspects. Cx3cr1&lt;sup&gt;neg&lt;/sup&gt; i-OCLs have a high ability to resorb bone and activate inflammatory CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Although Cx3cr1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; i-OCLs are associated with inflammation, they resorb less and have in vitro an immune-suppressive effect on Cx3cr1&lt;sup&gt;neg&lt;/sup&gt; i-OCLs, mediated by PD-L1. Our results provide new insights into i-OCL heterogeneity. They also reveal that different i-OCL subsets may interact to regulate inflammation. This contributes to a better understanding and prevention of inflammatory bone destruction.</description>

	<title>eLife: Spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission are partially segregated at inhibitory synapses</title>

	<description>Synaptic transmission is initiated via spontaneous or action-potential evoked fusion of synaptic vesicles. At excitatory synapses, glutamatergic receptors activated by spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission are segregated. Although inhibitory synapses also transmit signals spontaneously or in response to action potentials, they differ from excitatory synapses in both structure and function. Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibitory synapses may have different organizing principles. We report picrotoxin, a GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonist, blocks neurotransmission in a use-dependent manner at rat hippocampal synapses and therefore can be used to interrogate synaptic properties. Using this tool, we uncovered partial segregation of inhibitory spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission. We found up to 40% of the evoked response is mediated through GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs which are only activated by evoked neurotransmission. These data indicate GABAergic spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission processes are partially non-overlapping, suggesting they may serve divergent roles in neuronal signaling.</description>

	<description>Copy number alterations (CNAs) play an important role in molding the genomes of breast cancers and have been shown to be clinically useful for prognostic and therapeutic purposes. However, our knowledge of intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity of this important class of somatic alterations is limited. Here, using single-cell sequencing, we comprehensively map out the facets of copy number alteration heterogeneity in a cohort of breast cancer tumors. Ou/var/www/html/elife/12-05-2020/backup/r analyses reveal: genetic heterogeneity of non-tumor cells (i.e. stroma) within the tumor mass; the extent to which copy number heterogeneity impacts breast cancer genomes and the importance of both the genomic location and dosage of sub-clonal events; the pervasive nature of genetic heterogeneity of chromosomal amplifications; and the association of copy number heterogeneity with clinical and biological parameters such as polyploidy and estrogen receptor negative status. Our data highlight the power of single-cell genomics in dissecting, in its many forms, intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity of CNAs, the magnitude with which CNA heterogeneity affects the genomes of breast cancers, and the potential importance of CNA heterogeneity in phenomena such as therapeutic resistance and disease relapse.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: StanDep: Capturing transcriptomic variability improves context-specific metabolic models</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Chintan J. Joshi, Song-Min Schinn, Anne Richelle, Isaac Shamie, Eyleen J. O’Rourke, Nathan E. Lewis&lt;/p&gt;

Diverse algorithms can integrate transcriptomics with genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) to build context-specific metabolic models. These algorithms require identification of a list of high confidence (core) reactions from transcriptomics, but parameters related to identification of core reactions, such as thresholding of expression profiles, can significantly change model content. Importantly, current thresholding approaches are burdened with setting singular arbitrary thresholds for all genes; thus, resulting in removal of enzymes needed in small amounts and even many housekeeping genes. Here, we describe StanDep, a novel heuristic method for using transcriptomics to identify core reactions prior to building context-specific metabolic models. StanDep clusters gene expression data based on their expression pattern across different contexts and determines thresholds for each cluster using data-dependent statistics, specifically standard deviation and mean. To demonstrate the use of StanDep, we built hundreds of models for the NCI-60 cancer cell lines. These models successfully increased the inclusion of housekeeping reactions, which are often lost in models built using standard thresholding approaches. Further, StanDep also provided a transcriptomic explanation for inclusion of lowly expressed reactions that were otherwise only supported by model extraction methods. Our study also provides novel insights into how cells may deal with context-specific and ubiquitous functions.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Ana G. Pereira, Matheus Farias, Marta A. Moita&lt;/p&gt;

Animals use auditory cues generated by defensive responses of others to detect impending danger. Here we identify a neural circuit in rats involved in the detection of one such auditory cue, the cessation of movement-evoked sound resulting from freezing. This circuit comprises the dorsal subnucleus of the medial geniculate body (MGD) and downstream areas, the ventral area of the auditory cortex (VA), and the lateral amygdala (LA). This study suggests a role for the auditory offset pathway in processing a natural sound cue of threat.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CecMedAIA0A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Pharmacological sex hormone manipulation as a risk model for depression</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex hormone transition may trigger severe depressive episodes in some women. In order to map mechanisms related to such phenomena we developed a pharmacological preclinical human model using sex hormone manipulation with gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) in a placebo‐controlled design. Here the findings from this model is synthesized and discussed in the context of related literature on hormonal contributions to reproductive mental health disorders. The GnRHa model points to an estradiol‐dependent depressive response in healthy women undergoing short‐term sex hormone manipulation with GnRHa, which is linked to serotonin transporter changes (a key regulator of synaptic serotonin), a disengagement of hippocampus, and an overengagement of brain networks recruited when processing emotional salient information. Further, the GnRHa model suggest that key brain regions in the reward circuit are less engaged in positive stimuli when undergoing sex hormone manipulation, which may underlie anhedonia. Also, the work supports that enhanced sensitivity to estrogen signaling at the level of gene expression may drive increased risk for depressive symptoms when exposed to sex steroid hormone fluctuations. In conclusion, the GnRHa model work highlights brain signatures of rapid and profound changes in sex steroid hormone milieu, which reflect plausible mechanisms by which risk for mood disorders works. This model points to the role of estrogen dynamics and sensitivity, and offers a rationale for personalized prevention in hormonal transition phases, for example pregnancy to postpartum transition, perimenopause, and hormone treatments, which now can move into clinical translation and ideally pave the way for protecting mental and cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Frequency‐ and state‐dependent effects of hippocampal neural disinhibition on hippocampal local field potential oscillations in anesthetized rats</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced inhibitory GABA function, so‐called neural disinhibition, has been implicated in cognitive disorders, including schizophrenia and age‐related cognitive decline. We previously showed in rats that hippocampal disinhibition by local microinfusion of the GABA‐A receptor antagonist picrotoxin disrupted memory and attention and enhanced hippocampal multi‐unit burst firing recorded around the infusion site under isoflurane anesthesia. Here, we analyzed the hippocampal local field potential (LFP) recorded alongside the multi‐unit data. We predicted frequency‐specific LFP changes, based on previous studies implicating GABA in hippocampal oscillations, with the weight of evidence suggesting that disinhibition would facilitate theta and disrupt gamma oscillations. Using a new semi‐automated method based on the kurtosis of the LFP peak‐amplitude distribution as well as on amplitude envelope thresholding, we separated three distinct hippocampal LFP states under isoflurane anesthesia: “burst” and “suppression” states—high‐amplitude LFP spike bursts and the interspersed low‐amplitudeperiods—and a medium‐amplitude “continuous” state. The burst state showed greater overall power than suppression and continuous states and higher relative delta/theta power, but lower relative beta/gamma power. The burst state also showed reduced functional connectivity across the hippocampal recording area, especially around theta and beta frequencies. Overall neuronal firing was higher in the burst than the other two states, whereas the proportion of burst firing was higher in burst and continuous states than the suppression state. Disinhibition caused state‐ and frequency‐dependent LFP changes, tending to increase power at lower frequencies (&amp;lt;20 Hz), but to decrease power and connectivity at higher frequencies (&amp;gt;20 Hz) in burst and suppression states. The disinhibition‐induced enhancement of multi‐unit bursting was also state‐dependent, tending to be more pronounced in burst and suppression states than the continuous state. Overall, we characterized three distinct hippocampal LFP states in isoflurane‐anesthetized rats. Disinhibition changed hippocampal LFP oscillations in a state‐ and frequency‐dependent way. Moreover, the disinhibition‐induced enhancement of multi‐unit bursting was also LFP state‐dependent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Faster Cortical Thinning and Surface Area Loss in Presymptomatic and Symptomatic C9orf72 Repeat Expansion Adult Carriers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25748?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25748?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; expansion is the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We examined aging trajectories of cortical thickness (CTh) and surface area in &lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; expansion adult carriers compared to healthy controls to characterize preclinical cerebral changes leading to symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data were obtained from the Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia Initiative. T1‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans were processed with CIVET 2.1 to extract vertex‐wide CTh and cortical surface area (CSA). Symptomatic and presymptomatic subjects were compared to age‐matched controls using mixed‐effects models, controlling for demographic variables. Aging trajectories were compared between carriers and noncarriers by testing the “age by genetic status” interaction. False discovery rate corrections were applied to all vertex‐wide analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sample included 640 scans from 386 subjects, including 54 symptomatic &lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; carriers (72.2% behavioral variant FTD), 83 asymptomatic carriers, and 249 controls (age range = 18–86 years). Symptomatic carriers showed fairly symmetric reduction in CTh/CSA in most of the frontal lobes, in addition to large temporoparietal areas. Presymptomatic subjects had reduced CTh/CSA in more restricted areas of the medial frontoparietal lobes, in addition to scattered lateral frontal, parietal, and temporal areas. These differences were explained by faster cortical thinning linearly throughout adulthood in a similar anatomical distribution, with differences emerging in the early 30s. CSA reduction was also faster in mutation carriers predominantly in the ventrofrontal regions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; mutation carriers have faster cortical thinning and surface loss throughout adulthood in regions that show atrophy in symptomatic subjects. This suggests that the pathogenic effects of the mutation lead to structural cerebral changes decades prior to symptoms. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Topological Data Analysis Reveals Robust Alterations in the Whole-Brain and Frontal Lobe Functional Connectomes in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a developmental disorder characterized by difficulty to control the own behavior. Neuroimaging studies have related ADHD with the interplay of fronto-parietal attention systems with the default mode network (DMN; Castellanos and Aoki, 2016). However, some results have been inconsistent, potentially due to methodological differences in the analytical strategies when defining the brain functional network, i.e., the functional connectivity threshold and/or the brain parcellation scheme. Here, we make use of topological data analysis (TDA) to explore the brain connectome as a function of the filtration value (i.e., the connectivity threshold), instead of using a static connectivity threshold. Specifically, we characterized the transition from all nodes being isolated to being connected into a single component as a function of the filtration value. We explored the utility of such a method to identify differences between 81 children with ADHD (45 male, age: 7.26–17.61 years old) and 96 typically developing children (TDC; 59 male, age: 7.17–17.96 years old), using a public dataset of resting state (rs)fMRI in human subjects. Results were highly congruent when using four different brain segmentations (atlases), and exhibited significant differences for the brain topology of children with ADHD, both at the whole-brain network and the functional subnetwork levels, particularly involving the frontal lobe and the DMN. Therefore, this is a solid approach that complements connectomics-related methods and may contribute to identify the neurophysio-pathology of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Rodent Arena Tracker (RAT): A Machine Vision Rodent Tracking Camera and Closed Loop Control System</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Video tracking is an essential tool in rodent research. Here, we demonstrate a machine vision rodent tracking camera based on a low-cost, open-source, machine vision camera, the OpenMV Cam M7. We call our device the rodent arena tracker (RAT), and it is a pocket-sized machine vision-based position tracker. The RAT does not require a tethered computer to operate and costs about $120 per device to build. These features make the RAT scalable to large installations and accessible to research institutions and educational settings where budgets may be limited. The RAT processes incoming video in real-time at 15 Hz and saves &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; positional information to an onboard microSD card. The RAT also provides a programmable multi-function input/output pin that can be used for controlling other equipment, transmitting tracking information in real time, or receiving data from other devices. Finally, the RAT includes a real-time clock (RTC) for accurate time stamping of data files. Real-time image processing averts the need to save video, greatly reducing storage, data handling, and communication requirements. To demonstrate the capabilities of the RAT, we performed three validation studies: (1) a 4-d experiment measuring circadian activity patterns; (2) logging of mouse positional information alongside status information from a pellet dispensing device; and (3) control of an optogenetic stimulation system for a real-time place preference (RTPP) brain stimulation reinforcement study. Our design files, build instructions, and code for the RAT implementation are open source and freely available online to facilitate dissemination and further development of the RAT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Subthalamic nucleus stimulation modulates motor epileptic activity in humans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25776?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25776?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharmaco‐refractory focal motor epileptic seizures pose a significant challenge. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is recently a recognized therapeutic option for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. To identify the specific target for focal motor seizures, we evaluate the modulatory effects of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation because of the critical role of STN in cortico‐subcortical motor processing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven epilepsy patients with refractory seizures who underwent chronic stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) monitoring were studied in presurgical evaluation. Seizure onset zone was hypothesized to be partially involved in the motor areas in six patients. For each patient, one electrode was temporally implanted into STN that was ipsilateral to the seizure onset zone. The cortical‐subcortical seizure propagation was systemically evaluated. The simultaneously electrophysiological responses over distributed cortical areas to STN stimulation at varied frequencies were quantitatively assessed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed the consistent downstream propagation of seizures from the motor cortex towards the ipsilateral STN and remarkable cortical responses on motor cortex to single‐pulse STN stimulation. Furthermore, we showed frequency‐dependent upstream modulatory effect of STN stimulation on motor cortex specifically. In contrast to the enhanced effects of low frequency stimulation, high‐frequency stimulation of STN can significantly reduce interictal spikes, high‐frequency oscillations over motor cortex disclosing effective connections to the STN.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result showed STN is not only engaged in as a propagation network of focal motor seizures but STN stimulation can profoundly modulate the epileptic activity of motor cortex in humans, suggesting a mechanism‐based alternative for patients suffering from refractory focal motor seizures.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, the scientific community has accelerated its process for knowledge synthesis and dissemination at multiple levels, from creating pathways for expedited journal peer review to establishing specialty task forces that curate information most relevant to individual fields of expertise. We describe our experience engaging with the latter to fill a gap in knowledge. At our institution, we established a group of fifteen neurologists from six subspecialties that created protocols on managing inpatients with concurrent neurological disorders and COVID‐19, using best available evidence and expert opinion. These protocols were disseminated online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://covidneurology.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;covidneurology.org&lt;/a&gt; on April 3, 2020, and have been updated continuously based on emerging literature and frontline clinical experience. We evaluated utility using data analytics, characterizing the number of unique visitors over a week of “normal” usage and the demographic data of visitors. We discuss here the limitations of this imperfect method of knowledge synthesis and dissemination, and acknowledge our peers nationwide who have provided feedback to greatly enhance the quality of these protocols. We believe that our experience highlights the need for exceptionally high levels of collaboration in these unprecedented times.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Pre-exposure to Lower-Level Noise Mitigates Cochlear Synaptic Loss Induced by High-Level Noise</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00025</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00025</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The auditory sensory organs appear to be less damaged by exposure to high-level noise that is presented after exposure to non-traumatizing low-level noise. This phenomenon is known as the toughening or conditioning effect. Functionally, it is manifested by a reduced threshold shift, and morphologically by a reduced hair cell loss. However, it remains unclear whether prior exposure to toughening noise can mitigate the synaptic loss induced by exposure to damaging noise. Since the cochlear afferent synapse between the inner hair cells and primary auditory neurons has been identified as a novel site involved in noise-induced cochlear damage, we were interested in assessing whether this synapse can be toughened. In the present study, the synaptic loss was induced by a damaging noise exposure (106 dB SPL) and compared across Guinea pigs who had and had not been previously exposed to a toughening noise (85 dB SPL). Results revealed that the toughening noise heavily reduced the synaptic loss observed 1 day after exposure to the damaging noise. Although it was significant, the protective effect of the toughening noise on permanent synaptic loss was much smaller. Compared with cases in the control group without noise exposure, coding deficits were seen in both toughened groups, as reflected in the compound action potential (CAP) by signals with amplitude modulation. In general, the pre-exposure to the toughening noise resulted in a significantly reduced synaptic loss by the high-level noise. However, this morphological protection was not accompanied by a robust functional benefit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Modified in situ Hybridization Chain Reaction Using Short Hairpin DNAs</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00075</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The visualization of multiple gene expressions in well-preserved tissues is crucial for the elucidation of physiological and pathological processes. In situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR) is a method to visualize specific mRNAs in diverse organisms by applying a HCR that is an isothermal enzyme-free nucleotide polymerization method using hairpin DNAs. Although in situ HCR is a versatile method, this method is not widely used by researchers because of their higher cost than conventional in situ hybridization (ISH). Here, we redesigned hairpin DNAs so that their lengths were half the length of commonly used hairpin DNAs. We also optimized the conjugated fluorophores and linkers. Modified in situ HCR showed sufficient fluorescent signals to detect various mRNAs such as Penk, Oxtr, Vglut2, Drd1, Drd2, and Moxd1 in mouse neural tissues with a high signal-to-noise ratio. The sensitivity of modified in situ HCR in detecting the Oxtr mRNA was better than that of fluorescent ISH using tyramide signal amplification. Notably, the modified in situ HCR does not require proteinase K treatment so that it enables the preservation of morphological structures and antigenicity. The modified in situ HCR simultaneously detected the distributions of c-Fos immunoreactivity and Vglut2 mRNA, and detected multiple mRNAs with a high signal-noise ratio at subcellular resolution in mouse brains. These results suggest that the modified in situ HCR using short hairpin DNAs is cost-effective and useful for the visualization of multiple mRNAs and proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: α-Synuclein Negatively Regulates Nurr1 Expression Through NF-κB-Related Mechanism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00064</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The nuclear receptor-related 1 protein (Nurr1) is critical for the development and survival of midbrain dopamine neurons that are predominantly affected and progressively degenerated in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The expression level of Nurr1 has been proposed to be modulated by α-synuclein (α-SYN), an important pathological hallmark of PD. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of α-SYN-Nurr1 interaction are still rarely explored. In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of α-SYN on the transcription level of Nurr1. Our results showed that overexpression of α-SYN (WT or A53T) reduced Nurr1 and its downstream gene expressions. α-SYN neither affected the mRNA stability nor bound with the promoter of Nurr1, but modulated the transcription activity of Nurr1 promoter region ranging from −605 bp to −418 bp, which contains the binding site of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). Moreover, overexpression of α-SYN (WT or A53T) down-regulated NF-κB expression level, thereby inhibiting the transcription factor activity of NF-κB and decreasing the binding quantity of NF-κB with Nurr1 promoter. These findings may give us new insights to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the α-SYN-regulated Nurr1 function, which may fascinate the investigation of dopamine neuron degeneration in PD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: How Much Instructional Time Is Necessary? Mid-intervention Results of Fundamental Movement Skills Training Within ABA Early Intervention Centers</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The purpose of this study was to explore the question of the minimal amount of instructional time needed to still be effective by assessing the efficacy at mid-intervention of an early fundamental movement skill (FMS) intervention for preschoolers with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Fourteen preschoolers participated in this randomized controlled trial daily over 10 weeks (10 h total at mid-intervention). A two-factor mixed MANOVA tested the significance of group*time interactions for two dependent variables: object control and locomotor raw scores on the Test of Gross Motor Development—III.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Group*time interactions approached significance with large effect sizes on the vector of both dependent variables and in a univariate fashion on object control scores, but not locomotor scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These findings hold relevance for physical educators working with young children with ASD, indicating that 10 h of FMS instruction, at least in this form, is not adequate to improve FMS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Deep Brain Stimulation of the Medial Septal Nucleus Induces Expression of a Virally Delivered Reporter Gene in Dentate Gyrus</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Mechanisms of deep brain stimulation (DBS) remain controversial, and spatiotemporal control of brain-wide circuits remains elusive. Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have emerged as vehicles for spatiotemporal expression of exogenous transgenes in several tissues, including specific nuclei in the brain. Coupling DBS with viral vectors to modulate exogenous transgene expression remains unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;This study examines whether DBS of the medial septal nucleus (MSN) can regulate gene expression of AAV-transduced neurons in a brain region anatomically remote from the stimulation target: the hippocampal dentate gyrus.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Rats underwent unilateral hippocampal injection of an AAV vector with c-Fos promoter-driven expression of TdTomato (TdT), followed by MSN electrode implantation. Rodents received no stimulation, 7.7 Hz (theta), or 130 Hz (gamma) DBS for 1 h one week after surgery. In a repeat stimulation experiment, rodents received either no stimulation, or two 1 h MSN DBS over 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;No significant differences in hippocampal TdT expression between controls and acute MSN DBS were found. With repeat DBS we found c-Fos protein expression was induced and we could detect increased TdT with either gamma or theta stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that viral vector-mediated gene expression can be regulated spatially and temporally using DBS. Control of gene expression by DBS warrants further investigation into stimulation-responsive promoters for clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Closed-Loop Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation for Real-Time Non-invasive Neuromodulation in vivo</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00445</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The closed-loop brain stimulation technique plays a key role in neural network information processing and therapies of neurological diseases. Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is an established neuromodulation method for the neural oscillation in animals or human. All available TUS systems provide brain stimulation in an open-loop pattern. In this study, we developed a closed-loop transcranial ultrasound stimulation (CLTUS) system for real-time non-invasive neuromodulation in vivo. We used the CLTUS system to modulate the neural activities of the hippocampus of a wild-type mouse based on the phase of the theta rhythm recorded at the ultrasound-targeted location. In addition, we modulated the hippocampus of a temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) mouse. The ultrasound stimulation increased the absolute power and reduced the relative power of the theta rhythm, which were independent of the specific phase of the theta rhythm. Compared with those of a sham stimulation, the latency of epileptic seizures was significantly increased, while the epileptic seizure duration was significantly decreased under the CLTUS. The above results indicate that the CLTUS can be used to not only modulate the neural oscillation through the theta-phase-specific manipulation of the hippocampus but also effectively inhibit the seizure of a TLE mouse in time. CLTUS has large application potentials for the understanding of the causal relationship of neural circuits as well as for timely, effective, and non-invasive therapies of neurological diseases such as epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Neurorestoration Approach by Biomaterials in Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00431</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke (IS) is the leading cause of disability in the western world, assuming a high socio-economic cost. One of the most used strategies in the last decade has been biomaterials, which have been initially used with a structural support function. They have been perfected, different compounds have been combined, and they have been used together with cell therapy or controlled release chemical compounds. This double function has driven them as potential candidates for the chronic treatment of IS. In fact, the most developed are in different phases of clinical trial. In this review, we will show the ischemic scenario and address the most important criteria to achieve a successful neuroreparation from the point of view of biomaterials. The spontaneous processes that are activated and how to enhance them is one of the keys that contribute to the success of the therapeutic approach. In addition, the different routes of administration and how they affect the design of biomaterials are analyzed. Future perspectives show where this broad scientific field is heading, which advances every day with the help of technology and advanced therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Temperature Measurements in the Vicinity of Human Intracranial EEG Electrodes Exposed to Body-Coil RF for MRI at 1.5T</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00429</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The application of intracranial electroencephalography (icEEG) recording during functional magnetic resonance imaging (icEEG-fMRI) has allowed the study of the hemodynamic correlates of epileptic activity and of the neurophysiological basis of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal. However, the applicability of this technique is affected by data quality issues such as signal drop out in the vicinity of the implanted electrodes. In our center we have limited the technique to a quadrature head transmit and receive RF coil following the results of a safety evaluation. The purpose of this study is to gather further safety-related evidence for performing icEEG-fMRI using a body RF-transmit coil, to allow the greater flexibility afforded by the use of modern, high-density receive arrays, and therefore parallel imaging with benefits such as reduced signal drop-out and distortion artifact. Specifically, we performed a set of empirical temperature measurements on a 1.5T Siemens Avanto MRI scanner with the body RF-transmit coil in a range of electrode and connector cable configurations. The observed RF-induced heating during a high-SAR sequence was maximum in the immediate vicinity of a depth electrode located along the scanner’s central axis (range: 0.2–2.4°C) and below 0.5°C at the other electrodes. Also for the high-SAR sequence, we observed excessive RF-related heating in connection cable configurations that deviate from our recommended setup. For the low-SAR sequence, the maximum observed temperature increase across all configurations was 0.3°C. This provides good evidence to allow simultaneous icEEG-fMRI to be performed utilizing the body transmit coil on the 1.5T Siemens Avanto MRI scanner at our center with acceptable additional risk by following a well-defined protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Metabolic brain network analysis based on graph theory using FDG PET imaging is potentially useful for investigating brain activity alternation due to metabolism changes in different stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Most studies on metabolic network construction have been based on group data. Here a novel approach in building an individual metabolic network was proposed to investigate individual metabolic network abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;First, a weighting matrix was calculated based on the interregional effect size difference of mean uptake between a single subject and average normal controls (NCs). Then the weighting matrix for a single subject was multiplied by a group-based connectivity matrix from an NC cohort. To study the performance of the proposed individual metabolic network, inter- and intra-hemispheric connectivity patterns in the groups of NC, sMCI (stable mild cognitive impairment), pMCI (progressive mild cognitive impairment), and AD using the proposed individual metabolic network were constructed and compared with those from the group-based results. The network parameters of global efficiency and clustering coefficient and the network density score (NDS) in the default-mode network (DMN) of generated individual metabolic networks were estimated and compared among the disease groups in AD.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our results show that the intra- and inter-hemispheric connectivity patterns estimated from our individual metabolic network are similar to those from the group-based method. In particular, the key patterns of occipital-parietal and occipital-temporal inter-regional connectivity deficits detected in the groupwise network study for differentiating different disease groups in AD were also found in the individual network. A reduction trend was observed for network parameters of global efficiency and clustering coefficient, and also for the NDS from NC, sMCI, pMCI, and AD. There was no significant difference between NC and sMCI for all network parameters.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We proposed a novel method in constructing the individual metabolic network using a single-subject FDG PET image and a group-based NC connectivity matrix. The result has shown the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed individual metabolic network in differentiating disease groups in AD. Future studies should include investigation of inter-individual variability and the correlation of individual network features to disease severities and clinical performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Importance of the Habenula for Avoidance Learning Including Contextual Cues in the Human Brain: A Preliminary fMRI Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human habenula studies are gradually advancing, primarily through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis of passive (Pavlovian) conditioning tasks as well as probabilistic reinforcement learning tasks. However, no studies have particularly targeted aversive prediction errors, despite the essential importance for the habenula in the field. Complicated learned strategies including contextual contents are involved in making aversive prediction errors during the learning process. Therefore, we examined habenula activation during a contextual learning task. We performed fMRI on a group of 19 healthy controls. We assessed the manually traced habenula during negative outcomes during the contextual learning task. The Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II), the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) were also administered. The left and right habenula were activated during aversive outcomes and the activation was associated with aversive prediction errors. There was also a positive correlation between TCI reward dependence scores and habenula activation. Furthermore, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analyses demonstrated the left and right habenula to the left and right hippocampus connections during the presentation of contextual stimuli. These findings serve to highlight the neural mechanisms that may be relevant to understanding the broader relationship between the habenula and learning processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Remote, Automated, and MRI-Compatible Administration of Interoceptive Inspiratory Resistive Loading</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Research on how humans perceive sensory inputs from their bodies (“interoception”) has been rapidly gaining momentum, with interest across a host of disciplines from physiology through to psychiatry. However, studying interoceptive processes is not without significant challenges, and many methods utilized to access internal states have been largely devoted to capturing and relating naturally occurring variations in interoceptive signals (such as heartbeats) to measures of how the brain processes these signals. An alternative procedure involves the controlled perturbation of specific interoceptive axes. This is challenging because it requires non-invasive interventions that can be repeated many times within a subject and that are potent but safe. Here we present an effective methodology for instigating these perturbations within the breathing domain. We describe a custom-built circuitry that is capable of delivering inspiratory resistive loads automatically and precisely. Importantly, our approach is compatible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environments, allowing for the administration of complicated experimental designs in neuroimaging as increasingly required within developing fields such as computational psychiatry/psychosomatics. We describe the experimental setup for both the control and monitoring of the inspiratory resistive loads, and demonstrate its possible utilities within different study designs. This methodology represents an important step forward from the previously utilized, manually controlled resistive loading setups, which present significant experimental burdens with prolonged and/or complicated sequences of breathing stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Emergent Spaces for Coupled Oscillators</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Systems of coupled dynamical units (e.g., oscillators or neurons) are known to exhibit complex, emergent behaviors that may be simplified through coarse-graining: a process in which one discovers coarse variables and derives equations for their evolution. Such coarse-graining procedures often require extensive experience and/or a deep understanding of the system dynamics. In this paper we present a systematic, data-driven approach to discovering “bespoke” coarse variables based on manifold learning algorithms. We illustrate this methodology with the classic Kuramoto phase oscillator model, and demonstrate how our manifold learning technique can successfully identify a coarse variable that is one-to-one with the established Kuramoto order parameter. We then introduce an extension of our coarse-graining methodology which enables us to learn evolution equations for the discovered coarse variables via an artificial neural network architecture templated on numerical time integrators (initial value solvers). This approach allows us to learn accurate approximations of time derivatives of state variables from sparse flow data, and hence discover useful approximate differential equation descriptions of their dynamic behavior. We demonstrate this capability by learning ODEs that agree with the known analytical expression for the Kuramoto order parameter dynamics at the continuum limit. We then show how this approach can also be used to learn the dynamics of coarse variables discovered through our manifold learning methodology. In both of these examples, we compare the results of our neural network based method to typical finite differences complemented with geometric harmonics. Finally, we present a series of computational examples illustrating how a variation of our manifold learning methodology can be used to discover sets of “effective” parameters, reduced parameter combinations, for multi-parameter models with complex coupling. We conclude with a discussion of possible extensions of this approach, including the possibility of obtaining data-driven effective partial differential equations for coarse-grained neuronal network behavior, as illustrated by the synchronization dynamics of Hodgkin–Huxley type neurons with a Chung-Lu network. Thus, we build an integrated suite of tools for obtaining data-driven coarse variables, data-driven effective parameters, and data-driven coarse-grained equations from detailed observations of networks of oscillators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently DCNN (Deep Convolutional Neural Network) has been advocated as a general and promising modeling approach for neural object representation in primate inferotemporal cortex. In this work, we show that some inherent non-uniqueness problem exists in the DCNN-based modeling of image object representations. This non-uniqueness phenomenon reveals to some extent the theoretical limitation of this general modeling approach, and invites due attention to be taken in practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dopamine Modulates Excitatory Synaptic Transmission by Activating Presynaptic D1-like Dopamine Receptors in the RA Projection Neurons of Zebra Finches</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Songbirds are useful vertebrate study models for vocal learning and memory. The robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) receives synaptic inputs from both the posterior and anterior pathways of the song control system in songbirds. Hence, RA plays an important role in the control of singing. RA receives dopaminergic (DArgic) inputs that increase the excitability of RA projection neurons (PNs). However, the effects of DA on excitatory synaptic transmission are yet to be deciphered. In this study, the effects of DA on the excitatory synaptic transmission of the PNs in the RA of adult male zebra finches were investigated using a whole-cell patch-clamp recording. We observed that DA decreased the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). The effects of DA were mimicked by the D1-like DA receptor (D1R) agonist, SKF-38393, but not the D2-like DA receptor (D2R) agonist, Quinpirole. Also, the effects of DA were blocked by D1R antagonist, SCH-23390, but not the D2R antagonist, Sulpiride. These results demonstrate that DA modulates excitatory synaptic transmission by acting on D1R in the RA of adult male zebra finches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Cytoplasmic TDP43 Binds microRNAs: New Disease Targets in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00117</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, fatal, and incurable neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies suggest that dysregulation of gene expression by microRNAs (miRNAs) may play an important role in ALS pathogenesis. The reversible nature of this dysregulation makes miRNAs attractive pharmacological targets and a potential therapeutic avenue. Under physiological conditions, miRNA biogenesis, which begins in the nucleus and includes further maturation in the cytoplasm, involves trans-activation response element DNA/RNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP43). However, TDP43 mutations or stress trigger TDP43 mislocalization and inclusion formation, a hallmark of most ALS cases, that may lead to aberrant protein/miRNA interactions in the cytoplasm. Herein, we demonstrated that TDP43 exhibits differential binding affinity for select miRNAs, which prompted us to profile miRNAs that preferentially bind cytoplasmic TDP43. Using cellular models expressing TDP43 variants and miRNA profiling analyses, we identified differential levels of 65 cytoplasmic TDP43-associated miRNAs. Of these, approximately 30% exhibited levels that differed by more than 3-fold in the cytoplasmic TDP43 models relative to our control model. The hits included both novel miRNAs and miRNAs previously associated with ALS that potentially regulate several predicted genes and pathways that may be important for pathogenesis. Accordingly, these findings highlight specific miRNAs that may shed light on relevant disease pathways and could represent potential biomarkers and reversible treatment targets for ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Azadirachta indica A. Juss Ameliorates Mouse Hepatitis Virus-Induced Neuroinflammatory Demyelination by Modulating Cell-to-Cell Fusion in an Experimental Animal Model of Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00116</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-induced murine neuroinflammation serves as a model to study acute meningoencephalomyelitis, hepatitis, and chronic neuroinflammatory demyelination; which mimics certain pathologies of the human neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis (MS). MHV-induced acute neuroinflammation occurs due to direct glial cell dystrophy instigated by central nervous system (CNS)-resident microglia and astrocytes, in contrast to peripheral CD4+T cell-mediated myelin damage prevalent in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. Viral envelope Spike glycoprotein-mediated cell-to-cell fusion is an essential mechanistic step for MHV-induced CNS pathogenicity. Although Azadirachta indica (Neem), a traditional phytomedicine, is known for its anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, and spermicidal activities, not much is known about anti-neuroinflammatory properties of its bark (NBE) in MHV-induced acute neuroinflammation and chronic demyelination. Recombinant demyelinating MHV strain (RSA59) was preincubated with NBE to arrest the infection-initiation event, and its effect on viral replication, viral transcription, cytokine expression, and successive pathogenicity were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Virus-free Luciferase assay explained NBE’s anti-virus-to-cell fusion activity in vitro. Intracranial inoculation of RSA59 preincubated with NBE into the mouse brain significantly reduces acute hepatitis, meningoencephalomyelitis, and chronic progressive demyelination. Additionally, NBE effectively restricts viral entry, dissemination in CNS, viral replication, viral transcription, and expression of the viral nucleocapsid and inflammatory cytokines. From mechanistic standpoints, RSA59 preincubated with NBE reduced viral entry, viral replication and cell-to-cell fusion, as a mode of viral dissemination. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection with NBE (25 mg/kg B.W.) into mice revealed a significant reduction in viral Nucleocapsid protein expression in vivo. Conclusively, A. indica bark extract may directly bind to the virus-host attachment Spike glycoprotein and suppresses MHV-induced neuroinflammation and neuropathogenesis by inhibiting cell-to-cell fusion and viral replication. Further studies will focus on combining bioanalytical assays to isolate potential NBE bioactive compound(s) that contribute towards the anti-viral activity of NBE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental interest in circuit analysis is to parse out the synaptic inputs underlying a behavioral experience. Toward this aim, we have devised an unbiased strategy that specifically labels the afferent inputs that are activated by a defined stimulus in an activity-dependent manner. We validated this strategy in four brain circuits receiving known sensory inputs. This strategy, as demonstrated here, accurately identifies these inputs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Juvenile Social Isolation Enhances the Activity of Inhibitory Neuronal Circuits in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00105</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;During brain development, the design of primary neural networks is primarily determined by environmental stimuli after their formation. In particular, the juvenile period is critical, during which neuronal circuits that consist of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons are remodeled by experience. Social isolation during the juvenile period profoundly affects brain development and contributes to the development of psychiatric disorders. We previously reported that 2 weeks of social isolation after weaning reduced excitatory synaptic inputs and intrinsic excitability in a subtype of layer 5 pyramidal cells, which we defined as prominent h-current (PH) cells, in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in mice. However, it remains unclear how juvenile social isolation affects inhibitory neuronal circuits that consist of pyramidal cells and interneurons. We found that 2 weeks of social isolation after weaning increased inhibitory synaptic inputs exclusively onto PH cells with a concomitant deterioration of action potential properties. Although social isolation did not alter the inhibitory synaptic release mechanisms or the number of inhibitory functional synapses on PH cells, we found that it increased the intrinsic excitability of fast-spiking (FS) interneurons with less excitatory synaptic inputs and more h-current. Our findings indicate that juvenile social isolation enhances the activity of inhibitory neuronal circuits in the mPFC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Emerging Roles of Activity-Dependent Alternative Splicing in Homeostatic Plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00104</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00104</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Homeostatic plasticity refers to the ability of neuronal networks to stabilize their activity in the face of external perturbations. Most forms of homeostatic plasticity ultimately depend on changes in the expression or activity of ion channels and synaptic proteins, which may occur at the gene, transcript, or protein level. The most extensively investigated homeostatic mechanisms entail adaptations in protein function or localization following activity-dependent posttranslational modifications. Numerous studies have also highlighted how homeostatic plasticity can be achieved by adjusting local protein translation at synapses or transcription of specific genes in the nucleus. In comparison, little attention has been devoted to whether and how alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNAs underlies some forms of homeostatic plasticity. AS not only expands proteome diversity but also contributes to the spatiotemporal dynamics of mRNA transcripts. Prominent in the brain where it can be regulated by neuronal activity, it is a flexible process, tightly controlled by a multitude of factors. Given its extensive use and versatility in optimizing the function of ion channels and synaptic proteins, we argue that AS is ideally suited to achieve homeostatic control of neuronal output. We support this thesis by reviewing emerging evidence linking AS to various forms of homeostatic plasticity: homeostatic intrinsic plasticity, synaptic scaling, and presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. Further, we highlight the relevance of this connection for brain pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Blocking the LncRNA MALAT1/miR-224-5p/NLRP3 Axis Inhibits the Hippocampal Inflammatory Response in T2DM With OSA</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that diabetes can cause cognitive dysfunction, and cognitive dysfunction in patients with diabetes combined with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is more severe. LncRNAs are known to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with OSA. This study aimed to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of the lncRNA MALAT1/miR-224-5p/NLRP3 axis in T2DM with OSA. qRT-PCR was used to quantify the expression of MALAT1, miR-224-5p, and NLRP3 in brain tissues. NLRP3 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescent labeling. The interaction involving MALAT1, miR-224-5p, and NLRP3 was evaluated by transfection. Western blotting was utilized to evaluate the expression levels of the pathway-related proteins NLRP3, caspase 1, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) both in vitro and in vivo. qRT-PCR was used to assess the mRNA expression levels of NLRP3, caspase 1, TNF-α and IL-1β both in vitro and in vivo. In brain tissues of T2DM with OSA, MALAT1 and NLRP3 were overexpressed, while miR-224-5p was downregulated, which was consistent with subsequent cell experiments. We screened the miRNAs that could bind to MALAT1 and NLRP3 by the StarBase database and the TargetScanMouse7.2 website. Our research showed that among these miRNAs, the level of miR-224-5p was most significantly negatively correlated with the levels of MALAT1 and NLRP3. Also, a firefly luciferase assay showed that miR-224-5p, which is a target of MALAT1, directly reduced the expression of the downstream protein NLRP3. Overexpression of miR-224-5p significantly inhibited the expression levels of NLRP3, caspase 1, TNF-α and IL-1β in vitro. MALAT1 promoted NLRP3 expression by acting as a competing endogenous RNA and sponging miR-224-5p. MiR-224-5p reduces microglial inflammation activation through the regulation of NLRP3 expression, which ultimately affected the NLRP3/IL-1β pathway in the hippocampus. This suggests that miR-224-5p may serve as a potential target for T2DM and OSA therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: High-Resolution Episcopic Imaging for Visualization of Dermal Arteries and Nerves of the Auricular Cymba Conchae in Humans</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic applications of auricular vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) have drawn recent attention. Since the targeted stimulation process and parameters depend on the electrode–tissue interaction, the lack of structural anatomical information on innervation and vascularization of the auricle restrain the current optimization of stimulation paradigms. For the first time, we employed high-resolution episcopic imaging (HREM) to generate histologic volume data from donated human cadaver ears. Optimal parameters for specimen preparation were evaluated. Anatomical 3D vascular and nerve structures were reconstructed in one sample of an auricular cymba conchae (CC). The feasibility of HREM to visualize anatomical structures was assessed in that diameters, occupied areas, volumes, and mutual distances between auricular arteries, nerves, and veins were registered. The selected region of CC (3 × 5.5 mm) showed in its cross-sections 21.7 ± 2.7 (mean ± standard deviation) arteries and 14.66 ± 2.74 nerve fibers. Identified nerve diameters were 33.66 ± 21.71 μm, and arteries had diameters in the range of 71.58 ± 80.70 μm. The respective occupied area showed a share of, on average, 2.71% and 0.3% for arteries and nerves, respectively, and similar volume occupancy for arteries and nerves. Inter-centroid minimum distance between arteries and nerves was 274 ± 222 μm. The density of vessels and nerves around a point within CC on a given grid was assessed, showing that 50% of all vessels and nerves were found in a radial distance of 1.6–1.8 mm from any of these points, which is strategically relevant when using stimulation needles in the auricle for excitation of nerves. HREM seems suitable for anatomical studies of the human ear. A 3D model of CC was established in the micrometer scale, which forms the basis for future optimization of the auricular VNS. Obviously, the presented single cadaver study needs to be validated by additional anatomical data on the innervation and vascularization of the auricle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Exploration of the Molecular Mechanism for Lipoprotein Lipase Expression Variations in SH-SY5Y Cells Exposed to Different Doses of Amyloid-Beta Protein</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Progressive accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in the brain is a characteristic pathological change in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We previously found the expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) was increased in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to low-dose Aβ and decreased in cells with high-dose Aβ exposure, but the molecular mechanism is still unclear. Based on previous studies, the opposite regulation of histone deacetylase2 (HDAC2) and HDAC3 on LPL expression probably explain the above molecular mechanism, in which microRNA-29a and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) may be involved. This study further revealed the mechanism of HDAC2 and HDAC3 on conversely regulating LPL expression. The results showed that HDAC2 down-regulated microRNA-29a by decreasing histone acetylation (Ace-H3K9) level in its promoter region, subsequently increasing LPL expression directly or through PPARγ/LPL pathway; HDAC3 decreased LPL expression through inhibiting Ace-H3K9 levels in LPL and PPARγ promoter regions and up-regulating microRNA-29a. This study also found that with increasing concentrations of Aβ in cells, HDAC2 and HDAC3 expression were gradually increased, and Ace-H3K9 levels in LPL and PPARγ promoter region regulated by HDAC3 were decreased correspondingly, while Ace-H3K9 levels in microRNA-29a promoter region modulated by HDAC2 were not decreased gradually but presented a U-shaped trend. These may lead to the results that a U-shaped alteration in microRNA-29a expression, subsequently leading to an inverse U-shaped alteration in PPARγ or LPL expression. In conclusion, HDAC2 and HDAC3 at least partly mediate LPL expression variations in different concentrations of Aβ exposed SH-SY5Y cells, in which microRNA-29a and PPARγ are involved, and the histone acetylation level in microRNA-29a promoter region plays a key role.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Time for a Systems Biological Approach to Cognitive Aging?—A Critical Review</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The underlying premise of current theories of cognitive decline with age tend to be primarily cognitive or biological explanations, with relatively few theories adequately integrating both aspects. Though literature has also emphasized the importance of several factors that contribute to cognitive aging including: (a) decline in sensory abilities; (b) the effect of motor speed on paper-pencil measures of cognitive speed; (c) the impact of level of education and physical activity; and (d) molecular biological changes that occur with age, these factors have seldom been implicated into any single theoretical model of cognitive aging. Indeed, such an integrated bio-cognitive model of aging has the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of attention, perception, learning, and memory across the lifespan. Thus, the aim of this review was to critically evaluate common theories of age-related cognitive decline and highlight the need for a more comprehensive systems neuroscience approach to cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Differences in Cerebral Structure Associated With Depressive Symptoms in the Elderly With Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00107</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00107</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by global deterioration in multiple cognitive domains. In addition to cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms are common issues that trouble AD patients. The neuroanatomical basis of depressive symptoms in AD patients has yet to be elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Twenty AD patients and 22 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited for the present study. Depressive symptoms in AD patients and HCs were assessed according to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Anatomical structural differences were assessed between AD patients and HCs using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and surface-based morphometry (SBM). Correlation analyses were conducted to investigate relationships between depressive symptoms and structural altered regions. Multiple pattern analysis using linear support vector machine (SVM) was performed in another independent cohort, which was collected from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data and contained 20 AD patients and 20 HCs, to distinguish AD patients from HCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared with HCs, AD patients exhibited global cerebral atrophy in gray matter volume (GMV) and cortical thickness, including frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, and insular lobes. In addition, insular GMV was negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. Moreover, SVM-based classification achieved an accuracy of 77.5%, a sensitivity of 70%, and a specificity of 85% by leave-one-out cross-validation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: GMV of the insula displayed atrophy among AD patients, which is associated with depressive symptoms. Our observations provide a potential neural substrate for analysis to examine the co-occurrence of AD with depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Extracellular Sortilin Proteopathy Relative to β-Amyloid and Tau in Aged and Alzheimer’s Disease Human Brains</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are hallmark lesions of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) related to β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition and intraneuronal phosphorylated tau (pTau) accumulation. Sortilin C-terminal fragments (shortened as “sorfra”) can deposit as senile plaque-like lesions within AD brains. The course and pattern of sorfra plaque formation relative to Aβ and pTau pathogenesis remain unknown. In the present study, cerebral and subcortical sections in postmortem human brains (n = 46) from aged and AD subjects were stained using multiple markers (6E10, β-secretase 1, pTau, and sortilin antibodies, as well as Bielschowsky silver stain). The course and pattern of sorfra plaque formation relative to Thal Aβ and Braak NFT pathogenic stages were determined. Sorfra plaques occurred in the temporal, inferior frontal and occipital neocortices in cases with Thal 1 and Braak III stages. They were also found additionally in the hippocampal formation, amygdala, and associative neocortex in cases with Thal 2–4 and Braak IV–V. Lastly, they were also found in the primary motor, somatosensory, and visual cortices in cases with Thal 4–5 and Braak VI. Unlike Aβ and pTau pathologies, sorfra plaques did not occur in subcortical structures in cases with Aβ/pTau lesions in Thal 3–5/Braak IV–VI stages. We establish here that sorfra plaques are essentially a cerebral proteopathy. We believe that the development of sorfra plaques in both cortical and hippocampal regions proceeds in a typical spatiotemporal pattern, and the stages of cerebral sorfra plaque formation partially overlap with that of Aβ and pTau pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Heterogeneity of proteome dynamics between connective tissue phases of adult tendon</title>

	<description>Maintenance of connective tissue integrity is fundamental to sustain function, requiring protein turnover to repair damaged tissue. However, connective tissue proteome dynamics remain largely undefined, as do differences in turnover rates of individual proteins in the collagen and glycoprotein phases of connective tissue extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we investigate proteome dynamics in the collagen and glycoprotein phases of connective tissues by exploiting the spatially distinct fascicular (collagen-rich) and interfascicular (glycoprotein-rich) ECM phases of tendon. Using isotope labelling, mass spectrometry and bioinformatics, we calculate turnover rates of individual proteins within rat Achilles tendon and its ECM phases. Our results demonstrate complex proteome dynamics in tendon, with ~1000 fold differences in protein turnover rates, and overall faster protein turnover within the glycoprotein-rich interfascicular matrix compared to the collagen-rich fascicular matrix. These data provide insights into the complexity of proteome dynamics in tendon, likely required to maintain tissue homeostasis.</description>

	<description>The cognitive abilities of biological organisms only make sense in the context of their environment. Here, we study longhorn crazy ant collective navigation skills within the context of a semi-natural, randomized environment. Mapping this biological setting into the 'Ant-in-a-Labyrinth' framework which studies physical transport through disordered media allows us to formulate precise links between the statistics of environmental challenges and the ants' collective navigation abilities. We show that, in this environment, the ants use their numbers to collectively extend their sensing range. Although this extension is moderate, it nevertheless allows for extremely fast traversal times that overshadow known physical solutions to the 'Ant-in-a-Labyrinth' problem. To explain this large payoff, we use percolation theory and prove that whenever the labyrinth is solvable, a logarithmically small sensing range suffices for extreme speedup. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential advantages of group living and collective cognition in increasing a species' habitable range.</description>

	<title>eLife: Tgfb3 collaborates with PP2A and Notch signaling pathways to inhibit retina regeneration</title>

	<description>Neuronal degeneration in the zebrafish retina stimulates Müller glia (MG) to proliferate and generate multipotent progenitors for retinal repair. Controlling this proliferation is critical to successful regeneration. Previous studies reported that retinal injury stimulates pSmad3 signaling in injury-responsive MG. Contrary to these findings, we report pSmad3 expression is restricted to quiescent MG and suppressed in injury-responsive MG. Our data indicates that Tgfb3 is the ligand responsible for regulating pSmad3 expression. Remarkably, although overexpression of either Tgfb1b or Tgfb3 can stimulate pSmad3 expression in the injured retina, only Tgfb3 inhibits injury-dependent MG proliferation; suggesting the involvement of a non-canonical Tgfb signaling pathway. Furthermore, inhibition of Alk5, PP2A or Notch signaling rescues MG proliferation in Tgfb3 overexpressing zebrafish. Finally, we report that this Tgfb3 signaling pathway is active in zebrafish MG, but not those in mice, which may contribute to the different regenerative capabilities of MG from fish and mammals.</description>

	<title>eLife: IP3 mediated global Ca2+ signals arise through two temporally and spatially distinct modes of Ca2+ release</title>

	<description>The 'building-block' model of inositol trisphosphate (IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)-mediated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; liberation posits that cell-wide cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals arise through coordinated activation of localized Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; puffs generated by stationary clusters of IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rs). Here, we revise this hypothesis, applying fluctuation analysis to resolve Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals otherwise obscured during large Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations. We find the rising phase of global Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals is punctuated by a flurry of puffs, which terminate before the peak by a mechanism involving partial ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; depletion. The continuing rise in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and persistence of global signals even when puffs are absent, reveal a second mode of spatiotemporally diffuse Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling. Puffs make only small, transient contributions to global Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals, which are sustained by diffuse release of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; through a functionally distinct process. These two modes of IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; liberation have important implications for downstream signaling, imparting spatial and kinetic specificity to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent effector functions and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport.</description>

	<description>&lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; blood cells, called hemocytes, are classified into plasmatocytes, crystal cells, and lamellocytes based on the expression of a few marker genes and cell morphologies, which are inadequate to classify the complete hemocyte repertoire. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map hemocytes across different inflammatory conditions in larvae. We resolved plasmatocytes into different states based on the expression of genes involved in cell cycle, antimicrobial response, and metabolism together with the identification of intermediate states. Further, we discovered rare subsets within crystal cells and lamellocytes that express fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligand &lt;i&gt;branchless&lt;/i&gt; and receptor &lt;i&gt;breathless&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. We demonstrate that these FGF components are required for mediating effective immune responses against parasitoid wasp eggs, highlighting a novel role for FGF signaling in inter-hemocyte crosstalk. Our scRNA-seq analysis reveals the diversity of hemocytes and provides a rich resource of gene expression profiles for a systems-level understanding of their functions.</description>

	<title>eLife: Bmal1 integrates mitochondrial metabolism and macrophage activation</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54090</link>
	<description>Metabolic pathways and inflammatory processes are under circadian regulation. While rhythmic immune cell recruitment is known to impact infection outcomes, whether the circadian clock modulates immunometabolism remains unclear. We find the molecular clock Bmal1 is induced by inflammatory stimulants, including Ifn-g/lipopolysaccharide (M1) and tumor-conditioned medium, to maintain mitochondrial metabolism under these metabolically stressed conditions in mouse macrophages. Upon M1 stimulation, myeloid-specific &lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt; knockout (M-BKO) renders macrophages unable to sustain mitochondrial function, enhancing succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-mediated mitochondrial ROS production and Hif-1a-dependent metabolic reprogramming and inflammatory damage. In tumor-associated macrophages, the aberrant Hif-1a activation and metabolic dysregulation by M-BKO contribute to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Consequently, M-BKO increases melanoma tumor burden, while administrating an SDH inhibitor dimethyl malonate suppresses tumor growth. Therefore, Bmal1 functions as a metabolic checkpoint integrating macrophage mitochondrial metabolism, redox homeostasis and effector functions. This Bmal1-Hif-1a regulatory loop may provide therapeutic opportunities for inflammatory diseases and immunotherapy.</description>

	<description>Loop extrusion by structural maintenance of chromosomes complexes (SMCs) has been proposed as a mechanism to organize chromatin in interphase and metaphase. However, the requirements for chromatin organization in these cell cycle phases are different, and it is unknown whether loop extrusion dynamics and the complexes that extrude DNA also differ. Here, we used &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; egg extracts to reconstitute and image loop extrusion of single DNA molecules during the cell cycle. We show that loops form in both metaphase and interphase, but with distinct dynamic properties. Condensin extrudes DNA loops non-symmetrically in metaphase, whereas cohesin extrudes loops symmetrically in interphase. Our data show that loop extrusion is a general mechanism underlying DNA organization, with dynamic and structural properties that are biochemically regulated during the cell cycle.</description>

	<description>Alveolar formation increases the surface area for gas-exchange and is key to the physiological function of the lung. Alveolar epithelial cells, myofibroblasts and endothelial cells undergo coordinated morphogenesis to generate epithelial folds (secondary septa) to form alveoli. A mechanistic understanding of alveologenesis remains incomplete. We found that the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway is required in alveolar epithelial cells and myofibroblasts for alveologenesis in mammals. Our studies uncovered a &lt;i&gt;Wnt5a–Ror2–Vangl2&lt;/i&gt; cascade that endows cellular properties and novel mechanisms of alveologenesis. This includes PDGF secretion from alveolar type I and type II cells, cell shape changes of type I cells and migration of myofibroblasts. All these cellular properties are conferred by changes in the cytoskeleton and represent a new facet of PCP function. These results extend our current model of PCP signaling from polarizing a field of epithelial cells to conferring new properties at subcellular levels to regulate collective cell behavior.</description>

	<description>Mammalian articular cartilage is an avascular tissue with poor capacity for spontaneous repair. Here, we show that embryonic development of cartilage in the skate (&lt;i&gt;Leucoraja erinacea&lt;/i&gt;) mirrors that of mammals, with developing chondrocytes co-expressing genes encoding the transcription factors Sox5, Sox6 and Sox9. However, in skate, transcriptional features of developing cartilage persist into adulthood, both in peripheral chondrocytes and in cells of the fibrous perichondrium that ensheaths the skeleton. Using pulse-chase label retention experiments and multiplexed in situ hybridization, we identify a population of cycling &lt;i&gt;Sox5/6/9&lt;/i&gt;+ perichondral progenitor cells that generate new cartilage during adult growth, and we show that persistence of chondrogenesis in adult skates correlates with ability to spontaneously repair cartilage injuries. Skates therefore offer a unique model for adult chondrogenesis and cartilage repair and may serve as inspiration for novel cell-based therapies for skeletal pathologies, such as osteoarthritis.</description>

	<description>Platelets are anucleate cells in blood whose principal function is to stop bleeding by forming aggregates for hemostatic reactions. In addition to their participation in physiological hemostasis, platelet aggregates are also involved in pathological thrombosis and play an important role in inflammation, atherosclerosis, and cancer metastasis. The aggregation of platelets is elicited by various agonists, but these platelet aggregates have long been considered indistinguishable and impossible to classify. Here we present an intelligent method for classifying them by agonist type. It is based on a convolutional neural network trained by high-throughput imaging flow cytometry of blood cells to identify and differentiate subtle yet appreciable morphological features of platelet aggregates activated by different types of agonists. The method is a powerful tool for studying the underlying mechanism of platelet aggregation and is expected to open a window on an entirely new class of clinical diagnostics, pharmacometrics, and therapeutics.</description>

	<description>Antimalarial drug resistance has historically arisen through convergent &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; mutations in &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; parasite populations in Southeast Asia and South America. For the past decade in Southeast Asia, artemisinins, the core component of first-line antimalarial therapies, have experienced delayed parasite clearance associated with several &lt;i&gt;pfk13&lt;/i&gt; mutations, primarily C580Y. We report that mutant &lt;i&gt;pfk13&lt;/i&gt; has emerged independently in Guyana, with genome analysis indicating an evolutionary origin distinct from Southeast Asia. &lt;i&gt;Pfk13&lt;/i&gt; C580Y parasites were observed in 1.6% (14/854) of samples collected in Guyana in 2016–2017. Introducing &lt;i&gt;pfk13&lt;/i&gt; C580Y or R539T mutations by gene editing into local parasites conferred high levels of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; artemisinin resistance. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; growth competition assays revealed a fitness cost associated with these &lt;i&gt;pfk13&lt;/i&gt; variants, potentially explaining why these resistance alleles have not increased in frequency more quickly in South America. These data place local malaria control efforts at risk in the Guiana Shield.</description>

The microbiome is a new frontier for building predictors of human phenotypes. However, machine learning in the microbiome is fraught with issues of reproducibility, driven in large part by the wide range of analytic models and metagenomic data types available. We aimed to build robust metagenomic predictors of host phenotype by comparing prediction performances and biological interpretation across 8 machine learning methods and 4 different types of metagenomic data. Using 1,570 samples from 300 infants, we fit 7,865 models for 6 host phenotypes. We demonstrate the dependence of accuracy on algorithm choice and feature definition in microbiome data and propose a framework for building microbiome-derived indicators of host phenotype. We additionally identify biological features predictive of age, sex, breastfeeding status, historical antibiotic usage, country of origin, and delivery type. Our complete results can be viewed at http://apps.chiragjpgroup.org/ubiome_predictions/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t1NImbbWSKA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Calibration of individual-based models to epidemiological data: A systematic review</title>

Individual-based models (IBMs) informing public health policy should be calibrated to data and provide estimates of uncertainty. Two main components of model-calibration methods are the parameter-search strategy and the goodness-of-fit (GOF) measure; many options exist for each of these. This review provides an overview of calibration methods used in IBMs modelling infectious disease spread. We identified articles on PubMed employing simulation-based methods to calibrate IBMs informing public health policy in HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria epidemiology published between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2018. Articles were included if models stored individual-specific information, and calibration involved comparing model output to population-level targets. We extracted information on parameter-search strategies, GOF measures, and model validation. The PubMed search identified 653 candidate articles, of which 84 met the review criteria. Of the included articles, 40 (48%) combined a quantitative GOF measure with an algorithmic parameter-search strategy–either an optimisation algorithm (14/40) or a sampling algorithm (26/40). These 40 articles varied widely in their choices of parameter-search strategies and GOF measures. For the remaining 44 (52%) articles, the parameter-search strategy could either not be identified (32/44) or was described as an informal, non-reproducible method (12/44). Of these 44 articles, the majority (25/44) were unclear about the GOF measure used; of the rest, only five quantitatively evaluated GOF. Only a minority of the included articles, 14 (17%) provided a rationale for their choice of model-calibration method. Model validation was reported in 31 (37%) articles. Reporting on calibration methods is far from optimal in epidemiological modelling studies of HIV, malaria and TB transmission dynamics. The adoption of better documented, algorithmic calibration methods could improve both reproducibility and the quality of inference in model-based epidemiology. There is a need for research comparing the performance of calibration methods to inform decisions about the parameter-search strategies and GOF measures.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/M4Jh9Js-NLQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Standard multiscale entropy reflects neural dynamics at mismatched temporal scales: What’s signal irregularity got to do with it?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007885</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Gzt1qa0Qd-8/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Julian Q. Kosciessa, Niels A. Kloosterman, Douglas D. Garrett&lt;/p&gt;

Multiscale Entropy (MSE) is used to characterize the temporal irregularity of neural time series patterns. Due to its’ presumed sensitivity to non-linear signal characteristics, MSE is typically considered a complementary measure of brain dynamics to signal variance and spectral power. However, the divergence between these measures is often unclear in application. Furthermore, it is commonly assumed (yet sparingly verified) that entropy estimated at specific time scales reflects signal irregularity at those precise time scales of brain function. We argue that such assumptions are not tenable. Using simulated and empirical electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 47 younger and 52 older adults, we indicate strong and previously underappreciated associations between MSE and spectral power, and highlight how these links preclude traditional interpretations of MSE time scales. Specifically, we show that the typical definition of temporal patterns via “similarity bounds” biases coarse MSE scales–that are thought to reflect slow dynamics–by high-frequency dynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate that entropy at fine time scales–presumed to indicate fast dynamics–is highly sensitive to broadband spectral power, a measure dominated by low-frequency contributions. Jointly, these issues produce counterintuitive reflections of frequency-specific content on MSE time scales. We emphasize the resulting inferential problems in a conceptual replication of cross-sectional age differences at rest, in which scale-specific entropy age effects could be explained by spectral power differences at mismatched temporal scales. Furthermore, we demonstrate how such problems may be alleviated, resulting in the indication of scale-specific age differences in rhythmic irregularity. By controlling for narrowband contributions, we indicate that spontaneous alpha rhythms during eyes open rest transiently reduce broadband signal irregularity. Finally, we recommend best practices that may better permit a valid estimation and interpretation of neural signal irregularity at time scales of interest.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Gzt1qa0Qd-8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The hopes of precision medicine rely on our capacity to measure various high-throughput genomic information of a patient and to integrate them for personalized diagnosis and adapted treatment. Reaching these ambitious objectives will require the development of efficient tools for the detection of molecular defects at the individual level. Here, we propose a novel method, PenDA, to perform Personalized Differential Analysis at the scale of a single sample. PenDA is based on the local ordering of gene expressions within individual cases and infers the deregulation status of genes in a sample of interest compared to a reference dataset. Based on realistic simulations of RNA-seq data of tumors, we showed that PenDA outcompetes existing approaches with very high specificity and sensitivity and is robust to normalization effects. Applying the method to lung cancer cohorts, we observed that deregulated genes in tumors exhibit a cancer-type-specific commitment towards up- or down-regulation. Based on the individual information of deregulation given by PenDA, we were able to define two new molecular histologies for lung adenocarcinoma cancers strongly correlated to survival. In particular, we identified 37 biomarkers whose up-regulation lead to bad prognosis and that we validated on two independent cohorts. PenDA provides a robust, generic tool to extract personalized deregulation patterns that can then be used for the discovery of therapeutic targets and for personalized diagnosis. An open-access, user-friendly R package is available at https://github.com/bcm-uga/penda.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JD2Xxse9oQ8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Scale free topology as an effective feedback system</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexander Rivkind, Hallel Schreier, Naama Brenner, Omri Barak&lt;/p&gt;

Biological networks are often heterogeneous in their connectivity pattern, with degree distributions featuring a heavy tail of highly connected hubs. The implications of this heterogeneity on dynamical properties are a topic of much interest. Here we show that interpreting topology as a feedback circuit can provide novel insights on dynamics. Based on the observation that in finite networks a small number of hubs have a disproportionate effect on the entire system, we construct an approximation by lumping these nodes into a single effective hub, which acts as a feedback loop with the rest of the nodes. We use this approximation to study dynamics of networks with scale-free degree distributions, focusing on their probability of convergence to fixed points. We find that the approximation preserves convergence statistics over a wide range of settings. Our mapping provides a parametrization of scale free topology which is predictive at the ensemble level and also retains properties of individual realizations. Specifically, outgoing hubs have an organizing role that can drive the network to convergence, in analogy to suppression of chaos by an external drive. In contrast, incoming hubs have no such property, resulting in a marked difference between the behavior of networks with outgoing vs. incoming scale free degree distribution. Combining feedback analysis with mean field theory predicts a transition between convergent and divergent dynamics which is corroborated by numerical simulations. Furthermore, they highlight the effect of a handful of outlying hubs, rather than of the connectivity distribution law as a whole, on network dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KxHqjuTd_Lk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1{alpha} (HIF-1{alpha}) Counteracts the Acute Death of Cells Transplanted into the Injured Spinal Cord</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Cellular transplantation is in clinical testing for a number of central nervous system disorders, including spinal cord injury (SCI). One challenge is acute transplanted cell death. To prevent this death, there is a need to both establish when the death occurs and develop approaches to mitigate its effects. Here, using luciferase (luc) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing Schwann cell (SC) transplants in the contused thoracic rat spinal cord 7 d postinjury, we establish via &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; bioluminescent (IVIS) imaging and stereology that cell death occurs prior to 2–3 d postimplantation. We then test an alternative approach to the current paradigm of enhancing transplant survival by including multiple factors along with the cells. To stimulate multiple cellular adaptive pathways concurrently, we activate the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) transcriptional pathway. Retroviral expression of VP16-HIF-1α in SCs increased HIF-α by 5.9-fold and its target genes implicated in oxygen transport and delivery (VEGF, 2.2-fold) and cellular metabolism (enolase, 1.7-fold). In cell death assays &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, HIF-1α protected cells from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced oxidative damage. It also provided some protection against camptothecin-induced DNA damage, but not thapsigargin-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress or tunicamycin-induced unfolded protein response. Following transplantation, VP16-HIF-1α increased SC survival by 34.3%. The increase in cell survival was detectable by stereology, but not by &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; luciferase or &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; GFP IVIS imaging. The results support the hypothesis that activating adaptive cellular pathways enhances transplant survival and identifies an alternative pro-survival approach that, with optimization, could be amenable to clinical translation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;A software tool for synchronization of video with signals would be of broad general use to behavioral neuroscientists. A new program, called &lt;i&gt;neurotic&lt;/i&gt; (NEUROscience Tool for Interactive Characterization), allows users to review and annotate signal data synchronized with video, performs simple initial analyses including signal filtering and spike detection, is easy to use, and supports a variety of file formats. The program also facilitates collaborations by using a portable specification for loading and processing data and retrieving data files from online sources. Two examples are shown in which the software is used to explore experimental datasets with extracellular nerve or muscle recordings and simultaneous video of behavior. The configuration specification for controlling how data are located, loaded, processed, and plotted is also summarized. Algorithms for spike detection and burst detection are demonstrated. This new program could be used in many applications in which behavior and signals need to be analyzed together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Familiarity Detection and Memory Consolidation in Cortical Assemblies</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Humans have a large capacity of recognition memory (Dudai, 1997), a fundamental property of higher-order brain functions such as abstraction and generalization (Vogt and Magnussen, 2007). Familiarity is the first step towards recognition memory. We have previously demonstrated using unsupervised neural network simulations that familiarity detection of complex patterns emerges in generic cortical microcircuits with bidirectional synaptic plasticity. It is therefore meaningful to conduct similar experiments on biological neuronal networks to validate these results. Studies of learning and memory in dissociated rodent neuronal cultures remain inconclusive to date. Synchronized network bursts (SNBs) that occur spontaneously and periodically have been speculated to be an intervening factor. By optogenetically stimulating cultured cortical networks with random dot movies (RDMs), we were able to reduce the occurrence of SNBs, after which an ability for familiarity detection emerged: previously seen patterns elicited higher firing rates than novel ones. Differences in firing rate were distributed over the entire network, suggesting that familiarity detection is a system level property. We also studied the change in SNB patterns following familiarity encoding. Support vector machine (SVM) classification results indicate that SNBs may be facilitating memory consolidation of the learned pattern. In addition, using a novel network connectivity probing method, we were able to trace the change in synaptic efficacy induced by familiarity encoding, providing insights on the long-term impact of having SNBs in the cultures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Genes that establish the circadian clock have differential expression with respect to solar time in central and peripheral tissues. Here, we find circadian-time-induced differential expression in a large number of genes not associated with circadian rhythms in two brain regions lacking overt circadian function: the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). These regions primarily engage in autonomic, homeostatic, and emotional regulation. However, we find striking diurnal shifts in gene expression in these regions of male Sprague Dawley rats with no obvious patterns that could be attributed to function or region. These findings have implications for the design of gene expression studies as well as for the potential effects of xenobiotics on these regions that regulate autonomic and emotional states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Screening of healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 highlights the role of asymptomatic carriage in COVID-19 transmission</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58728</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58728</link>
	<description>Significant differences exist in the availability of healthcare worker (HCW) SARS-CoV-2 testing between countries, and existing programmes focus on screening symptomatic rather than asymptomatic staff. Over a 3-week period (April 2020), 1,032 asymptomatic HCWs were screened for SARS-CoV-2 in a large UK teaching hospital. Symptomatic staff and symptomatic household contacts were additionally tested. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect viral RNA from a throat+nose self-swab. 3% of HCWs in the &lt;i&gt;asymptomatic screening group&lt;/i&gt; tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 17/30 (57%) were truly asymptomatic/pauci-symptomatic. 12/30 (40%) had experienced symptoms compatible with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) &amp;gt;7 days prior to testing, most self-isolating, returning well. Clusters of HCW infection were discovered on two independent wards. Viral genome sequencing showed that the majority of HCWs had the dominant lineage B∙1. Our data demonstrates the utility of comprehensive screening of HCWs with minimal or no symptoms. This approach will be critical for protecting patients and hospital staff.</description>

	<description>Memories are consolidated from hippocampus to cortex, and recent evidence points to an anterior–posterior/ventral–dorsal gradient (in humans/rodents, respectively) across the brain that may be specialized for different types of memories. In a recent article, Cowan et al. provided evidence for this functional difference and gradient, which is also associated with sleep spindles.</description>

	<description>Exercise has been shown to benefit brain structure and function, particularly in aging populations. However, the mechanisms by which exercise exerts its effects, especially in humans, are not fully understood. This review argues that one reason for this knowledge gap is that exercise likely operates through multiple levels of mechanisms. Furthermore, the mechanisms of exercise may vary depending on factors such as age and health state. We discuss the state of evidence at each of three levels of analysis (molecular/cellular, brain structure/function, and mental states and higher-order behaviors) and highlight consistencies across these levels, inconsistencies within them, and knowledge gaps.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Leucine rich repeat transmembrane (LRRTM) proteins are synaptic adhesion molecules with roles in synapse formation and signaling. LRRTM4 was found to reside at rod bipolar cell (BC) dendritic tips, where it colocalized with the transduction channel protein, TRPM1. LRRTM4 was not detected at dendritic tips of ON‐cone BCs. Following somatic knockout of LRRTM4 in BCs by subretinal injection and electroporation of CRISPR/Cas9, LRRTM4 was abolished or reduced in the dendritic tips of transfected cells. Knockout cells had a normal complement of TRPM1 at their dendritic tips, while GPR179 accumulation was partially reduced. In experiments with heterologously expressed protein, the extracellular domain of LRRTM4 was found to engage in heparan‐sulfate dependent binding with pikachurin. These results implicate LRRTM4 in the GPR179‐pikachurin‐dystroglycan transsynaptic complex at rod synapses.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leucine rich repeat transmembrane (LRRTM) proteins are synaptic adhesion molecules with roles in synapse formation and signaling. LRRTM4 transcripts were previously shown to be enriched in rod bipolar cells (BCs), secondary neurons of the retina that form synapses with rod photoreceptors. Using two different antibodies, LRRTM4 was found to reside primarily at rod BC dendritic tips, where it colocalized with the transduction channel protein, TRPM1. LRRTM4 was not detected at dendritic tips of ON‐cone BCs. Following somatic knockout of LRRTM4 in BCs by subretinal injection and electroporation of CRISPR/Cas9, LRRTM4 was abolished or reduced in the dendritic tips of transfected cells. Knockout cells had a normal complement of TRPM1 at their dendritic tips, while GPR179 accumulation was partially reduced. In experiments with heterologously expressed protein, the extracellular domain of LRRTM4 was found to engage in heparan‐sulfate dependent binding with pikachurin. These results implicate LRRTM4 in the GPR179‐pikachurin‐dystroglycan transsynaptic complex at rod synapses.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Changes in the actin cytoskeleton are a primary mechanism mediating the morphological and functional plasticity that underlies learning and memory. The synaptic RhoGEFs Kalirin and Trio have emerged as central regulators of actin dynamics at the synapse. The increased attention surrounding Kalirin and Trio stems from the growing evidence for their roles in the etiology of a wide range of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we discuss recent findings revealing the unique and diverse functions of these paralog proteins in neurodevelopment, excitatory synaptic transmission, and plasticity.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A new glycogen storage disease caused by a dominant PYGM mutation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25771?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25771?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycogen storage diseases (GSD) are severe human disorders resulting from abnormal glucose metabolism, and all previously described GSDs segregate as autosomal recessive or X‐linked traits. Here we aimed to molecularly characterize the first family with a dominant GSD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe a dominant GSD family with 13 affected members presenting with adult‐onset muscle weakness, and we provide clinical, metabolic, histological, and ultrastructural data. We performed exome sequencing to uncover the causative gene, and functional experiments in the cell model and on recombinant proteins to investigate the pathogenic effect of the identified mutation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a heterozygous missense mutation in &lt;i&gt;PYGM&lt;/i&gt; segregating with the disease in the family. &lt;i&gt;PYGM&lt;/i&gt; codes for myophosphorylase, the enzyme catalyzing the initial step of glycogen breakdown. Enzymatic tests revealed that the &lt;i&gt;PYGM&lt;/i&gt; mutation impairs the AMP‐independent myophosphorylase activity, while the AMP‐dependent activity was preserved. Further functional investigations demonstrated an altered conformation and aggregation of mutant myophosphorylase, and the concurrent accumulation of the intermediate filament desmin in the myofibers of the patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this study describes the first example of a dominant glycogen storage disease in humans, and elucidates the underlying pathomechanisms by deciphering the sequence of events from the &lt;i&gt;PYGM&lt;/i&gt; mutation to the accumulation of glycogen in the muscle fibers.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Hippocampus: Differential propagation of ripples along the proximodistal and septotemporal axes of dorsal CA1 of rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23211?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23211?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functional connectivity of the hippocampus with its primary cortical input, the entorhinal cortex, is organized topographically. In area CA1 of the hippocampus, this leads to different functional gradients along the proximodistal and septotemporal axes of spatial/sensory responsivity and spatial resolution respectively. CA1 ripples, a network phenomenon, allow us to test whether the hippocampal neural network shows corresponding gradients in functional connectivity along the two axes. We studied the occurrence and propagation of ripples across the entire proximodistal axis along with a comparable spatial range of the septotemporal axis of dorsal CA1. We observed that ripples could occur at any location, and their amplitudes were independent of the tetrode location along the proximodistal and septotemporal axes. When a ripple was detected on a particular tetrode (“reference tetrode”), however, the probability of cooccurrence of ripples and ripple amplitude observed on the other tetrodes decreased as a function of distance from the reference tetrode. This reduction was greater along the proximodistal axis than the septotemporal axis. Furthermore, we found that ripples propagate primarily along the proximodistal axis. Thus, over a spatial scale of ∼1.5 mm, the network is anisotropic along the two axes, complementing the topographically organized cortico‐hippocampal connections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Mechanistic modeling of light-induced chemotactic infiltration of bacteria into leaf stomata</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Mohsen Ranjbaran, Mina Solhtalab, Ashim K. Datta&lt;/p&gt;

Light is one of the factors that can play a role in bacterial infiltration into leafy greens by keeping stomata open and providing photosynthetic products for microorganisms. We model chemotactic transport of bacteria within a leaf tissue in response to photosynthesis occurring within plant mesophyll. The model includes transport of carbon dioxide, oxygen, bicarbonate, sucrose/glucose, bacteria, and autoinducer-2 within the leaf tissue. Biological processes of carbon fixation in chloroplasts, and respiration in mitochondria of the plant cells, as well as motility, chemotaxis, nutrient consumption and communication in the bacterial community are considered. We show that presence of light is enough to boost bacterial chemotaxis through the stomatal opening and toward photosynthetic products within the leaf tissue. Bacterial chemotactic ability is a major player in infiltration, and plant stomatal defense in closing the stomata as a perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns is an effective way to inhibit the infiltration.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TYKo3FA9LpI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Autonomous emergence of connectivity assemblies via spike triplet interactions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007835</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Lisandro Montangie, Christoph Miehl, Julijana Gjorgjieva&lt;/p&gt;

Non-random connectivity can emerge without structured external input driven by activity-dependent mechanisms of synaptic plasticity based on precise spiking patterns. Here we analyze the emergence of global structures in recurrent networks based on a triplet model of spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) which depends on the interactions of three precisely-timed spikes and can describe plasticity experiments with varying spike frequency better than the classical pair-based STDP rule. We derive synaptic changes arising from correlations up to third-order and describe them as the sum of structural motifs which determine how any spike in the network influences a given synaptic connection through possible connectivity paths. This motif expansion framework reveals novel structural motifs under the triplet STDP rule, which support the formation of bidirectional connections and ultimately the spontaneous emergence of global network structure in the form of self-connected groups of neurons, or assemblies. We propose that under triplet STDP assembly structure can emerge without the need for externally patterned inputs or assuming a symmetric pair-based STDP rule common in previous studies. The emergence of non-random network structure under triplet STDP occurs through internally-generated higher-order correlations, which are ubiquitous in natural stimuli and neuronal spiking activity, and important for coding. We further demonstrate how neuromodulatory mechanisms that modulate the shape of the triplet STDP rule or the synaptic transmission function differentially promote structural motifs underlying the emergence of assemblies, and quantify the differences using graph theoretic measures.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kXUhjNXvt2A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Aging But Not Age-Related Hearing Loss Dominates the Decrease of Parvalbumin Immunoreactivity in the Primary Auditory Cortex of Mice</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Alterations in inhibitory circuits of the primary auditory cortex (pAC) have been shown to be an aspect of aging and age-related hearing loss (AHL). Several studies reported a decline in parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactivity in aged rodent pAC of animals displaying AHL and conclude a relationship between reduced sensitivity and declined PV immunoreactivity. However, it remains elusive whether AHL or a general molecular aging is causative for decreased PV immunoreactivity. In this study, we aimed to disentangle the effects of AHL and general aging on PV immunoreactivity patterns in inhibitory interneurons of mouse pAC. We compared young and old animals of a mouse line with AHL (C57BL/6) and a mutant (C57B6.CAST-&lt;i&gt;Cdh23&lt;sup&gt;Ahl+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) that is not vulnerable to AHL according to their hearing status by measuring auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and by an immunohistochemical evaluation of the PV immunoreactivity patterns in two dimensions (rostro-caudal and layer) in the pAC. Although AHL could be confirmed by ABR measurements for the C57BL/6 mice, both aged strains showed a similar reduction of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; positive interneurons in both, number and density. The pattern of reduction across the rostro-caudal axis and across cortical layers was similar for both aged lines. Our results demonstrate that a reduced PV immunoreactivity is a sign of general, molecular aging and not related to AHL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Shunting Inhibition Improves Synchronization in Heterogeneous Inhibitory Interneuronal Networks with Type 1 Excitability Whereas Hyperpolarizing Inhibition Is Better for Type 2 Excitability</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;All-to-all homogeneous networks of inhibitory neurons synchronize completely under the right conditions; however, many modeling studies have shown that biological levels of heterogeneity disrupt synchrony. Our fundamental scientific question is &quot;how can neurons maintain partial synchrony in the presence of heterogeneity and noise?&quot; A particular subset of strongly interconnected interneurons, the PV+ fast-spiking (FS) basket neurons, are strongly implicated in  oscillations and in phase locking of nested  oscillations to theta. Their excitability type apparently varies between brain regions: in CA1 and the dentate gyrus they have type 1 excitability, meaning that they can fire arbitrarily slowly, whereas in the striatum and cortex they have type 2 excitability, meaning that there is a frequency thresh old below which they cannot sustain repetitive firing. We constrained the models to study the effect of excitability type (more precisely bifurcation type) in isolation from all other factors. We use sparsely connected, heterogeneous, noisy networks with synaptic delays to show that synchronization properties, namely the resistance to suppression and the strength of theta phase to  amplitude coupling, are strongly dependent on the pairing of excitability type with the type of inhibition. Shunting inhibition performs better for type 1 and hyperpolarizing inhibition for type 2.  Oscillations and their nesting within theta oscillations are thought to subserve cognitive functions like memory encoding and recall; therefore, it is important to understand the contribution of intrinsic properties to these rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Negative correlation between grey matter in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus in healthy aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23210?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23210?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurobiological changes that occur with aging include a reduction in function and volume of the hippocampus. These changes were associated with corresponding memory deficits in navigation tasks. However, navigation can involve different strategies that are dependent on the hippocampus and caudate nucleus. The proportion of people using hippocampus‐dependent spatial strategies decreases across the lifespan. As such, the decrease in spatial strategies, and corresponding increase in caudate nucleus‐dependent response strategies with age, may play a role in the observed neurobiological changes in the hippocampus. Furthermore, we previously showed a negative correlation between grey matter in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus/striatum in mice, young adults, and in individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. As such, we hypothesized that this negative relationship between the two structures would be present during normal aging. The aim of the current study was to investigate this gap in the literature by studying the relationship between grey matter in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus of the striatum, in relation to each other and to navigation strategies, during healthy aging. Healthy older adults (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 39) were tested on the Concurrent Spatial Discrimination Learning Task (CSDLT), a virtual radial task that dissociates between spatial and response strategies. A regression of strategies against structural MRIs showed for the first time in older adults that the response strategy was associated with higher amounts of grey matter in the caudate nucleus. As expected, the spatial strategy correlated with grey matter in the hippocampus, which was negatively correlated with grey matter in the caudate nucleus. Interestingly, a sex difference emerged showing that among older adult response learners, women have the least amount of grey matter in the hippocampus, which is a known risk for Alzheimer's disease. This difference was absent among spatial learners. These results are discussed in the context of the putative protective role of spatial memory against grey matter loss in the hippocampus, especially in women.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: SARS‐CoV‐2 and Multiple Sclerosis: Not all immune depleting DMTs are equal or bad</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25770?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A major concern during the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) pandemic&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is the use of immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) due to an increased risk of contracting SARS‐CoV‐2 and more severe disease. The Society of Italian Neurologists (SIN) and the Association of British Neurologists (ABN) MS and Neuroimmunology Advisory Group published guidance for the use of current disease modifying treatments (DMTs) in MS (Table 1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. However, taking into account, less conservative viewpoints&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the emerging knowledge of the biology of SARS‐CoV‐2, and in particular the role of the immune mechanisms contributing to the disease, we propose modification of these guidelines since it is not clear that immunosuppression is indeed detrimental in people with MS infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. We are thus proposing a more nuanced approach and that the categories of DMTs should be modified based on scientific principles and the biology of severe COVID‐19 (Table 2).&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Li et al. used whole-cell recording to reveal a large and unexpected voltage-gated intrinsic conductance that dramatically alters the integrative properties of primate V1 neurons. Therefore, a standard computational model of sensory neurons that incorporates linear integration of synaptic inputs followed by a threshold nonlinearity requires revision.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Perspective on the Multiple Pathways to Changing Brain States</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00023</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00023</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this review article, we highlight several disparate ideas that are linked to changes in brain state (i.e., sleep to arousal, Down to Up, synchronized to de-synchronized). In any discussion of the brain state, we propose that the cortical pyramidal neuron has a central position. EEG recordings, which typically assess brain state, predominantly reflect the activity of cortical pyramidal neurons. This means that the dominant rhythmic activity that characterizes a particular brain state ultimately has to manifest globally across the pyramidal neuron population. During state transitions, it is the long-range connectivity of these neurons that broadcast the resultant changes in activity to many subcortical targets. Structures like the thalamus, brainstem/hypothalamic neuromodulatory systems, and respiratory systems can also strongly influence brain state, and for many decades we have been uncovering bidirectional pathways that link these structures to state changes in the cerebral cortex. More recently, movement and active behaviors have emerged as powerful drivers of state changes. Each of these systems involve different circuits distributed across the brain. Yet, for a system-wide change in brain state, there must be a collaboration between these circuits that reflects and perhaps triggers the transition between brain states. As we expand our understanding of how brain state changes, our current challenge is to understand how these diverse sets of circuits and pathways interact to produce the changes observed in cortical pyramidal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Up and Down States and Memory Consolidation Across Somatosensory, Entorhinal, and Hippocampal Cortices</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the course of a day, brain states fluctuate, from conscious awake information-acquiring states to sleep states, during which previously acquired information is further processed and stored as memories. One hypothesis is that memories are consolidated and stored during “offline” states such as sleep, a process thought to involve transfer of information from the hippocampus to other cortical areas. Up and Down states (UDS), patterns of activity that occur under anesthesia and sleep states, are likely to play a role in this process, although the nature of this role remains unclear. Here we review what is currently known about these mechanisms in three anatomically distinct but interconnected cortical areas: somatosensory cortex, entorhinal cortex, and the hippocampus. In doing so, we consider the role of this activity in the coordination of “replay” during sleep states, particularly during hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. We conclude that understanding the generation and propagation of UDS may provide key insights into the cortico-hippocampal dialogue linking archi- and neocortical areas during memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Progesterone and Allopregnanolone Rapidly Attenuate Estrogen-Associated Mechanical Allodynia in Rats with Persistent Temporomandibular Joint Inflammation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00026</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD) is associated with pain in the joint (temporomandibular joint, TMJ) and muscles involved in mastication. TMD pain dissipates following menopause but returns in some women undergoing estrogen replacement therapy. Progesterone has both anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive properties, while estrogen’s effects on nociception are variable and highly dependent on both natural hormone fluctuations and estrogen dosage during pharmacological treatments, with high doses increasing pain. Allopregnanolone, a progesterone metabolite and positive allosteric modulator of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor, also has antinociceptive properties. While progesterone and allopregnanolone are antinociceptive, their effect on estrogen-exacerbated TMD pain has not been determined. We hypothesized that removing the source of endogenous ovarian hormones would reduce inflammatory allodynia in the TMJ of rats and both progesterone and allopregnanolone would attenuate the estrogen-provoked return of allodynia. Baseline mechanical sensitivity was measured in female Sprague–Dawley rats (150–175 g) using the von Frey filament method followed by a unilateral injection of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) into the TMJ. Mechanical allodynia was confirmed 24 h later; then rats were ovariectomized or received sham surgery. Two weeks later, allodynia was reassessed and rats received one of the following subcutaneous hormone treatments over 5 days: a daily pharmacological dose of estradiol benzoate (E2; 50 μg/kg), daily E2 and pharmacological to sub-physiological doses of progesterone (P4; 16 mg/kg, 16 μg/kg, or 16 ng/kg), E2 daily and interrupted P4 given every other day, daily P4, or daily vehicle control. A separate group of animals received allopregnanolone (0.16 mg/kg) instead of P4. Allodynia was reassessed 1 h following injections. Here, we report that CFA-evoked mechanical allodynia was attenuated following ovariectomy and daily high E2 treatment triggered the return of allodynia, which was rapidly attenuated when P4 was also administered either daily or every other day. Allopregnanolone treatment, whether daily or every other day, also attenuated estrogen-exacerbated allodynia within 1 h of treatment, but only on the first treatment day. These data indicate that when gonadal hormone levels have diminished, treatment with a lower dose of progesterone may be effective at rapidly reducing the estrogen-evoked recurrence of inflammatory mechanical allodynia in the TMJ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Differential Proliferation and Maturation of Subcortical Astrocytes During Postnatal Development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00435</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes exhibit a region-dependent molecular and functional heterogeneity in the CNS. Although cortical astrocytes proliferate robustly during the first postnatal week and become proliferation quiescent, the temporal proliferation dynamics of astrocytes in subcortical regions during postnatal development remain essentially unknown. Whether subcortical astrocytes mature similarly to cortical astrocytes is also unexplored. In this current study, we examined proliferation of subcortical, especially hypothalamic, astrocytes during postnatal development using genetic labeling of astrocytes and pulse-chase EdU labeling of proliferating cells. While a lower number of proliferating astrocytes was found in the hypothalamus compared to cortex during the first postnatal week, astrocyte proliferation is much more active in hypothalamus than in cortex from P15 to P30 in both proliferating astrocyte density and percentage, indicating a persistent and distinct proliferation pattern of astrocytes in hypothalamus. This observation is further confirmed by Ki67 immunostaining with genetically or immunolabeled astrocytes in hypothalamus and cortex during P15–30. In addition, astrocytes in representative subcortical regions have a modest growth of their domain size and exhibit a significantly smaller domain size compared to cortical astrocytes at P30 when astrocytes have generally completed postnatal maturation. However, the expression of astrocyte-derived Sparc, an important synaptogenic inhibitor, is consistently higher in hypothalamic astrocytes than in cortical astrocytes throughout postnatal development. In summary, our study unveiled a distinct proliferation and maturation pattern of subcortical, especially hypothalamic, astrocytes during postnatal development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Toward Establishing Internal Validity for Correlated Gene Expression Measures in Imaging Genomics of Functional Networks: Why Distance Corrections and External Face Validity Alone Fall Short. Reply to “Distance Is Not Everything in Imaging Genomics of Functional Networks: Reply to a Commentary on Correlated Gene Expression Supports Synchronous Activity in Brain Networks”</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The primary claim of the Richiardi et al. (2015) Science article is that a measure of correlated gene expression, significant strength fraction (SSF), is related to resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) networks. However, there is still debate about this claim and whether spatial proximity, in the form of contiguous clusters, accounts entirely, or only partially, for SSF (Pantazatos and Li, 2017; Richiardi et al., 2017). Here, 13 distributed networks were simulated by combining 34 contiguous clusters randomly placed throughout cortex, with resulting edge distance distributions similar to rsfMRI networks. Cluster size was modulated (6–15 mm radius) to test its influence on SSF false positive rate (SSF-FPR) among the simulated “noise” networks. The contribution of rsfMRI networks on SSF-FPR was examined by comparing simulated networks whose clusters were sampled from: (1) all 1,777 cortical tissue samples, (2) all samples, but with non-rsfMRI cluster centers, and (3) only 1,276 non-rsfMRI samples. Results show that SSF-FPR is influenced only by cluster size (r &amp;gt; 0.9, p &amp;lt; 0.001), not by rsfMRI samples. Simulations using 14 mm radius clusters most resembled rsfMRI networks. When thresholding at p &amp;lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;–4&lt;/sup&gt;, the SSF-FPR was 0.47. Genes that maximize SF have high global spatial autocorrelation. In conclusion, SSF is unrelated to rsfMRI networks. The main conclusion of Richiardi et al. (2015) is based on a finding that is ∼50% likely to be a false positive, not &amp;lt;0.01% as originally reported in the article (Richiardi et al., 2015). We discuss why distance corrections alone and external face validity are insufficient to establish a trustworthy relationship between correlated gene expression measures and rsfMRI networks, and propose more rigorous approaches to preclude common pitfalls in related studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Attentional Processes in Children With Attentional Problems or Reading Difficulties as Revealed Using Brain Event-Related Potentials and Their Source Localization</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual attention-related processes include three functional sub-processes: alerting, orienting, and inhibition. We examined these sub-processes using reaction times, event-related potentials (ERPs), and their neuronal source activations during the Attention Network Test (ANT) in control children, attentional problems (AP) children, and reading difficulties (RD) children. During the ANT, electroencephalography was measured using 128 electrodes on three groups of Finnish sixth-graders aged 12–13 years (control = 77; AP = 15; RD = 23). Participants were asked to detect the direction of a middle target fish within a group of five fish. The target stimulus was either preceded by a cue (center, double, or spatial), or without a cue, to manipulate the alerting and orienting sub-processes of attention. The direction of the target fish was either congruent or incongruent in relation to the flanker fish, thereby manipulating the inhibition sub-processes of attention. Reaction time performance showed no differences between groups in alerting, orienting, and inhibition effects. The group differences in ERPs were only found at the source level. Neuronal source analysis in the AP children revealed a larger alerting effect (double-cued vs. non-cued target stimuli) than control and RD children in the left occipital lobe. Control children showed a smaller orienting effect (spatially cued vs. center-cued target stimuli) in the left occipital lobe than AP and RD children. No group differences were found for the neuronal sources related to the inhibition effect. The neuronal activity differences related to sub-processes of attention in the AP and RD groups suggest different underlying mechanisms for attentional and reading problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effect of External Force on Agency in Physical Human-Machine Interaction</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the advent of intelligent robotic tools for physically assisting humans, user experience, and intuitiveness in particular have become important features for control designs. However, existing works predominantly focus on performance-related measures for evaluating control systems as the subjective experience of a user by large cannot be directly observed. In this study, we therefore focus on agency-related interactions between control and embodiment in the context of physical human-machine interaction. By applying an intentional binding paradigm in a virtual, machine-assisted reaching task, we evaluate how the sense of agency of able-bodied humans is modulated by assistive force characteristics of a physically coupled device. In addition to measuring how assistive force profiles influence the sense of agency with intentional binding, we analyzed the sense of agency using a questionnaire. Remarkably, our participants reported to experience stronger agency when being appropriately assisted, although they contributed less to the control task. This is substantiated by the overall consistency of intentional binding results and the self-reported sense of agency. Our results confirm the fundamental feasibility of the sense of agency to objectively evaluate the quality of human-in-the-loop control for assistive technologies. While the underlying mechanisms causing the perceptual bias observed in the intentional binding paradigm are still to be understood, we believe that this study distinctly contributes to demonstrating how the sense of agency characterizes intuitiveness of assistance in physical human-machine interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Exponential Time Differencing Algorithm for Pulse-Coupled Hodgkin-Huxley Neural Networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The exponential time differencing (ETD) method allows using a large time step to efficiently evolve stiff systems such as Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neural networks. For pulse-coupled HH networks, the synaptic spike times cannot be predetermined and are convoluted with neuron's trajectory itself. This presents a challenging issue for the design of an efficient numerical simulation algorithm. The stiffness in the HH equations are quite different, for example, between the spike and non-spike regions. Here, we design a second-order adaptive exponential time differencing algorithm (AETD2) for the numerical evolution of HH neural networks. Compared with the regular second-order Runge-Kutta method (RK2), our AETD2 method can use time steps one order of magnitude larger and improve computational efficiency more than ten times while excellently capturing accurate traces of membrane potentials of HH neurons. This high accuracy and efficiency can be robustly obtained and do not depend on the dynamical regimes, connectivity structure or the network size.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: The Photoconvertible Fluorescent Probe, CaMPARI, Labels Active Neurons in Freely-Moving Intact Adult Fruit Flies</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Linking neural circuitry to behavior by mapping active neurons in vivo is a challenge. Both genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) and intermediate early genes (IEGs) have been used to pinpoint active neurons during a stimulus or behavior but have drawbacks such as limiting the movement of the organism, requiring a priori knowledge of the active region or having poor temporal resolution. Calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI) was engineered to overcome these spatial-temporal challenges. CaMPARI is a photoconvertible protein that only converts from green to red fluorescence in the presence of high calcium concentration and 405 nm light. This allows the experimenter to precisely mark active neurons within defined temporal windows. The photoconversion can then be quantified by taking the ratio of the red fluorescence to the green. CaMPARI promises the ability to trace active neurons during a specific stimulus; however, CaMPARI’s uses in adult Drosophila have been limited to photoconversion during fly immobilization. Here, we demonstrate a method that allows photoconversion of multiple freely-moving intact adult flies during a stimulus. Flies were placed in a dish with filter paper wet with acetic acid (pH = 2) or neutralized acetic acid (pH = 7) and exposed to photoconvertible light (60 mW) for 30 min (500 ms on, 200 ms off). Immediately following photoconversion, whole flies were fixed and imaged by confocal microscopy. The red:green ratio was quantified for the DC4 glomerulus, a bundle of neurons expressing Ir64a, an ionotropic receptor that senses acids in the Drosophila antennal lobe. Flies exposed to acetic acid showed 1.3-fold greater photoconversion than flies exposed to neutralized acetic acid. This finding was recapitulated using a more physiological stimulus of apple cider vinegar. These results indicate that CaMPARI can be used to label neurons in intact, freely-moving adult flies and will be useful for identifying the circuitry underlying complex behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;mTORopathies are a heterogeneous group of neurological disorders characterized by malformations of cortical development (MCD), enhanced cellular mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, and epilepsy that results from mutations in mTOR pathway regulatory genes. Homozygous mutations (del exon 9–13) in the pseudokinase STE20-related kinase adaptor alpha (STRAD-α; STRADA), an mTOR modulator, are associated with Pretzel Syndrome (PS), a neurodevelopmental disorder within the Old Order Mennonite Community characterized by megalencephaly, intellectual disability, and intractable epilepsy. To study the cellular mechanisms of STRADA loss, we generated CRISPR-edited Strada mouse N2a cells, a germline mouse Strada knockout (KO−/−) strain, and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from PS individuals harboring the STRADA founder mutation. Strada KO in vitro leads to enhanced mTOR signaling and iPSC-derived neurons from PS individuals exhibit enhanced cell size and mTOR signaling activation, as well as subtle alterations in electrical firing properties e.g., increased input resistance, a more depolarized resting membrane potential, and decreased threshold for action potential (AP) generation. Strada−/− mice exhibit high rates of perinatal mortality and out of more than 100 litters yielding both WT and heterozygous pups, only eight Strada−/− animals survived past P5. Strada−/− mice are hypotonic and tremulous. Histopathological examination (n = 5 mice) revealed normal gross brain organization and lamination but all had ventriculomegaly. Ectopic neurons were seen in all five Strada−/− brains within the subcortical white matter mirroring what is observed in human PS brain tissue. These distinct experimental platforms demonstrate that STRADA modulates mTOR signaling and is a key regulator of cell size, neuronal excitability, and cortical lamination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Human Brain Organoids to Decode Mechanisms of Microcephaly</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain organoids are stem cell-based self-assembling 3D structures that recapitulate early events of human brain development. Recent improvements with patient-specific 3D brain organoids have begun to elucidate unprecedented details of the defective mechanisms that cause neurodevelopmental disorders of congenital and acquired microcephaly. In particular, brain organoids derived from primary microcephaly patients have uncovered mechanisms that deregulate neural stem cell proliferation, maintenance, and differentiation. Not only did brain organoids reveal unknown aspects of neurogenesis but also have illuminated surprising roles of cellular structures of centrosomes and primary cilia in regulating neurogenesis during brain development. Here, we discuss how brain organoids have started contributing to decoding the complexities of microcephaly, which are unlikely to be identified in the existing non-human models. Finally, we discuss the yet unresolved questions and challenges that can be addressed with the use of brain organoids as in vitro models of neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Influence of Physical Activity and Epigenomics On Cognitive Function and Brain Health in Breast Cancer</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The risk of breast cancer increases with age, with the majority of women diagnosed with breast cancer being postmenopausal. It has been estimated that 25–75% of women with breast cancer experience changes in cognitive function (CF) related to disease and treatment, which compromises psychological well-being, decision making, ability to perform daily activities, and adherence to cancer therapy. Unfortunately, the mechanisms that underlie neurocognitive changes in women with breast cancer remain poorly understood, which in turn limits the development of effective treatments and prevention strategies. Exercise has great potential as a non-pharmaceutical intervention to mitigate the decline in CF in women with breast cancer. Evidence suggests that DNA methylation, an epigenetic mechanism for gene regulation, impacts CF and brain health (BH), that exercise influences DNA methylation, and that exercise impacts CF and BH. Although investigating DNA methylation has the potential to uncover the biologic foundations for understanding neurocognitive changes within the context of breast cancer and its treatment as well as the ability to understand how exercise mitigates these changes, there is a dearth of research on this topic. The purpose of this review article is to compile the research in these areas and to recommend potential areas of opportunity for investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affect a high proportion of the elderly population with an increasing prevalence. Sleep disturbances are frequent in those with MCI and AD. This review summarizes existing research on sleep disturbances and neuroinflammation in MCI and AD. Although strong evidence supports various pathways linking sleep and AD pathology, the temporal direction of this central relationship is not yet known. Improved understanding of sleep disturbance and neuroinflammation in MCI and AD may aid in the identification of targets for their prevention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Dynamic metabolic adaptation can promote species coexistence in competitive communities</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007896</guid>

Microbes are capable of physiologically adapting to diverse environmental conditions by differentially varying the rates at which they uptake different nutrients. In particular, microbes can switch hierarchically between different energy sources, consuming first those that ensure the highest growth rate. Experimentally, this can result in bi-phasic growth curves called “diauxic shifts” that typically arise when microbes are grown in media containing several nutrients. Despite these observations are well-known in microbiology and molecular biology, the mathematical models generally used to describe the population dynamics of microbial communities do not account for dynamic metabolic adaptation, thus implicitly assuming that microbes cannot switch dynamically from one resource to another. Here, we introduce dynamic metabolic adaptation in the framework of consumer-resource models, which are commonly used to describe competitive microbial communities, allowing each species to temporally change its preferred energy source to maximize its own relative fitness. We show that dynamic metabolic adaptation enables the community to self-organize, allowing several species to coexist even in the presence of few resources, and to respond optimally to a time-dependent environment, thus showing that dynamic metabolic adaptation could be an important mechanism for maintaining high levels of diversity even in environments with few energy sources. We show that introducing dynamic metabolic strategies in consumer-resource models is necessary for reproducing experimental growth curves of the baker’s yeast &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; growing in the presence of two carbon sources. Even though diauxic shifts emerge naturally from the model when two resources are qualitatively very different, the model predicts that the existence of such shifts is not a prerequisite for species coexistence in competitive communities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XmDLglyfd1Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Randomly connected networks generate emergent selectivity and predict decoding properties of large populations of neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Audrey Sederberg, Ilya Nemenman&lt;/p&gt;

Modern recording methods enable sampling of thousands of neurons during the performance of behavioral tasks, raising the question of how recorded activity relates to theoretical models. In the context of decision making, functional connectivity between choice-selective cortical neurons was recently reported. The straightforward interpretation of these data suggests the existence of selective pools of inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Computationally investigating an alternative mechanism for these experimental observations, we find that a randomly connected network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons generates single-cell selectivity, patterns of pairwise correlations, and the same ability of excitatory and inhibitory populations to predict choice, as in experimental observations. Further, we predict that, for this task, there are no anatomically defined subpopulations of neurons representing choice, and that choice preference of a particular neuron changes with the details of the task. We suggest that distributed stimulus selectivity and functional organization in population codes could be emergent properties of randomly connected networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TXO2XX1UZlM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Single nucleotide polymorphisms affect RNA-protein interactions at a distance through modulation of RNA secondary structures</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Elan Shatoff, Ralf Bundschuh&lt;/p&gt;

Single nucleotide polymorphisms are widely associated with disease, but the ways in which they cause altered phenotypes are often unclear, especially when they appear in non-coding regions. One way in which non-coding polymorphisms could cause disease is by affecting crucial RNA-protein interactions. While it is clear that changing a protein binding motif will alter protein binding, it has been shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms can affect RNA secondary structure, and here we show that single nucleotide polymorphisms can affect RNA-protein interactions from outside binding motifs through altered RNA secondary structure. By using a modified version of the Vienna Package and PAR-CLIP data for HuR (ELAVL1) in humans we characterize the genome-wide effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms on HuR binding and show that they can have a many-fold effect on the affinity of HuR binding to RNA transcripts from tens of bases away. We also find some evidence that the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms on protein binding might be under selection, with the non-reference alleles tending to make it harder for a protein to bind.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7KPWm87FGE4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Ten Simple Rules for a successful remote postdoc</title>

Author summary: Postdocs are a critical transition for early-career researchers. This transient period, between finishing a PhD and finding a permanent position, is when early-career researchers develop independent research programs and establish collaborative relationships that can make a successful career. Traditionally, postdocs physically relocate—sometimes multiple times—for these short-term appointments, which creates challenges that can disproportionately affect members of traditionally underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). However, many research activities involving analytical and quantitative work do not require a physical presence in a lab and can be accomplished remotely. Other fields have embraced remote work, yet many academics have been hesitant to hire remote postdocs. In this article, we present advice to both principal investigators (PIs) and postdocs for successfully navigating a remote position. Using the combined experience of the authors (as either remote postdocs or employers of remote postdocs), we provide a road map to overcome the real (and perceived) obstacles associated with remote work. With planning, communication, and creativity, remote postdocs can be a fully functioning and productive member of a research lab. Further, our rules can be useful for research labs generally and can help foster a more flexible and inclusive environment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/y6RvQlKqVc8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The current academic culture facing women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields in the United States has sparked the formation of grassroots advocacy groups to empower female scientists in training. However, the impact of these initiatives often goes unmeasured and underappreciated. Our Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) organization serves postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and research technicians (trainees) at a private research institute for biological sciences. Here we propose the following guidelines for cultivating a successful women-in-STEM-focused group based upon survey results from our own scientific community as well as the experience of our WiSE group leaders. We hope these recommendations can provide guidance to advocacy groups at other research and academic organizations that wish to strengthen their efforts. Whereas our own group specifically focuses on the underrepresented state of women in science, we hope these guidelines may be adapted and applied to groups that advocate for any minority group within the greater scientific community (i.e., those of gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic background, sexual orientation, etc.).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AvXtUUFG44Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

With increasing demand for training in data science, extracurricular or “ad hoc” education efforts have emerged to help individuals acquire relevant skills and expertise. Although extracurricular efforts already exist for many computationally intensive disciplines, their support of data science education has significantly helped in coping with the speed of innovation in data science practice and formal curricula. While the proliferation of ad hoc efforts is an indication of their popularity, less has been documented about the needs that they are designed to meet, the limitations that they face, and practical suggestions for holding successful efforts. To holistically understand the role of different ad hoc formats for data science, we surveyed organizers of ad hoc data science education efforts to understand how organizers perceived the events to have gone—including areas of strength and areas requiring growth. We also gathered recommendations from these past events for future organizers. Our results suggest that the perceived benefits of ad hoc efforts go beyond developing technical skills and may provide continued benefit in conjunction with formal curricula, which warrants further investigation. As increasing numbers of researchers from computational fields with a history of complex data become involved with ad hoc efforts to share their skills, the lessons learned that we extract from the surveys will provide concrete suggestions for the practitioner-leaders interested in creating, improving, and sustaining future efforts.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FGHwcxZsHCE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Modeling cancer cells is essential to better understand the dynamic nature of brain tumors and glioma cells, including their invasion of normal brain. Our goal is to study how the morphology of the glioma cell influences the formation of patterns of collective behavior such as flocks (cells moving in the same direction) or streams (cells moving in opposite direction) referred to as &lt;i&gt;oncostream&lt;/i&gt;. We have observed experimentally that the presence of oncostreams correlates with tumor progression. We propose an original agent-based model that considers each cell as an ellipsoid. We show that stretching cells from round to ellipsoid increases stream formation. A systematic numerical investigation of the model was implemented in R 2. We deduce a phase diagram identifying key regimes for the dynamics (e.g. formation of flocks, streams, scattering). Moreover, we study the effect of cellular density and show that, in contrast to classical models of flocking, increasing cellular density reduces the formation of flocks. We observe similar patterns in R 3 with the noticeable difference that stream formation is more ubiquitous compared to flock formation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yjgIFp7h1B0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Path integration is thought to rely on vestibular and proprioceptive cues yet most studies in humans involve primarily visual input, providing limited insight into their respective contributions. We developed a paradigm involving walking in an omnidirectional treadmill in which participants were guided on two sides of a triangle and then found their back way to origin. In Experiment 1, we tested a range of different triangle types while keeping the distance of the unguided side constant to determine the influence of spatial geometry. Participants overshot the angle they needed to turn and undershot the distance they needed to walk, with no consistent effect of triangle type. In Experiment 2, we manipulated distance while keeping angle constant to determine how path integration operated over both shorter and longer distances. Participants underestimated the distance they needed to walk to the origin, with error increasing as a function of the walked distance. To attempt to account for our findings, we developed configural-based computational models involving vector addition, the second of which included terms for the influence of past trials on the current one. We compared against a previously developed configural model of human path integration, the Encoding-Error model. We found that the vector addition models captured the tendency of participants to under-encode guided sides of the triangles and an influence of past trials on current trials. Together, our findings expand our understanding of body-based contributions to human path integration, further suggesting the value of vector addition models in understanding these important components of human navigation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IlBS8UmnS-w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Hippocampal shape is associated with memory deficits in temporal lobe epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25762?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25762?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive problems, especially disturbances in episodic memory, and hippocampal sclerosis are common in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) but little is known about the relationship of hippocampal morphology with memory. We aimed to relate hippocampal surface‐shape patterns to verbal and visual learning.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analysed hippocampal surface shapes on high‐resolution MRI images and the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery in 145 unilateral refractory TLE patients undergoing epilepsy surgery, a validation set of 55 unilateral refractory TLE patients and 39 age‐ and sex‐matched healthy volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both left (LTLE) and right (RTLE) TLE patients had lower verbal (LTLE 44 ± 11; RTLE 45 ± 10) and visual learning (LTLE 34 ± 8; RTLE 30 ± 8) scores than healthy controls (verbal 58 ± 8; visual 39 ± 6; p&amp;lt;0.001). Verbal learning was more impaired the greater the atrophy of the left superolateral hippocampal head. In contrast, visual memory was worse with greater bilateral inferiomedial hippocampal atrophy. Postsurgical verbal memory decline was more common in LTLE than in RTLE (reliable change index in LTLE 27% vs. RTLE 7%, p=0.006), whereas there were no differences in postsurgical visual memory decline between those groups. Preoperative atrophy of the left hippocampal tail predicted postsurgical verbal memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory deficits in TLE are associated with specific morphological alterations of the hippocampus, which could help stratify TLE patients into those at high vs. low risk of presurgical or postsurgical memory deficits. This knowledge could improve planning and prognosis of selective epilepsy surgery and neuropsychological counselling in TLE.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Identification of spinal afferent nerve endings in the colonic mucosa and submucosa that communicate directly with the spinal cord: The gut–brain axis&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4b559b07-b91b-4f8b-8f07-6ae815eed91d/cne24854-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinal afferent nerve endings in the submucosa of mouse distal colon that arise from a single nonpeptidergic spinal afferent neuron whose cell body originated in lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The nerve endings identified from this single sensory neuron were labeled after injection of neuronal tracer into DRG.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major sensory nerve pathway between the colon and central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) that underlies the gut–brain axis, is via spinal afferent neurons, with cell bodies in dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Our aim was to identify the sensory nerve endings in the colon that arise from single colorectal‐projecting DRG neurons. C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized and lumbosacral L6‐S1 DRG injected with dextran biotin. Mice recovered for 7 days. The whole colon was then removed and stained to visualize single axons and nerve endings immunoreactive to calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP). Single axons arising from DRG were identified in the distal colon and their morphological features and CGRP immunoreactivity characterized. After entering the colon, single axons ramified rostrally or caudally along many rows of myenteric ganglia with little circumferential displacement, giving off varicose endings in multiple ganglia. Nerve endings arising from two classes of colorectal‐projecting DRG neuron were identified. One class was peptidergic neurons that had nerve endings in circular muscle, myenteric ganglia, and submucosa. Another class of nonpeptidergic neurons innervated mucosal crypts, myenteric ganglia, and submucosa. Different morphological types of nerve endings which innervate different anatomical layers of colon can arise from the same axon and sensory neuron in DRG. These findings suggest single peptidergic and nonpeptidergic sensory neurons in DRG are potentially capable of detecting sensory stimuli from different anatomical layers of the colon, via different types of nerve endings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Heterogeneous vestibulocerebellar mossy fiber projections revealed by single axon reconstruction in the mouse</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Heterogeneous vestibulocerebellar mossy fiber projections revealed by single axon reconstruction in the mouse&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/037f13bd-372e-4ef4-9c91-df83b7190309/cne24853-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we report the morphology of single vestibulocerebellar axons originating from the medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) in mice. Three identified groups (red, blue, and green) of axons which projected differently to the vestibular nuclei and to the nodulus (X) and flocculus (Fl) indicated functionally distinct heterogeneous populations of vestibulocerebellar neurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant population of neurons in the vestibular nuclei projects to the cerebellum as mossy fibers (MFs) which are involved in the control and adaptation of posture, eye‐head movements, and autonomic function. However, little is known about their axonal projection patterns. We studied the morphology of single axons of medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons as well as those originating from primary afferents, by labeling with biotinylated dextran amine (BDA). MVN axons (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 35) were classified into three types based on their major predominant termination patterns. The Cbm‐type terminated only in the cerebellum (15 axons), whereas others terminated in the cerebellum and contralateral vestibular nuclei (cVN/Cbm‐type, 13 axons), or in the cerebellum and ipsilateral vestibular nuclei (iVN/Cbm‐type, 7 axons). Cbm‐ and cVN/Cbm‐types mostly projected to the nodulus and uvula without any clear relationship with longitudinal stripes in these lobules. They were often bilateral, and sometimes sent branches to the flocculus and to other vermal lobules. Also, the iVN/Cbm‐type projected mainly to the ipsilateral nodulus. Neurons of these types of axons showed different distribution within the MVN. The number of MF terminals of some vestibulocerebellar axons, iVN/Cbm‐type axons in particular, and primary afferent axons were much smaller than observed in previously studied MF axons originating from major precerebellar nuclei and the spinal cord. The results demonstrated that a heterogeneous population of MVN neurons provided divergent MF inputs to the cerebellum. The cVN/Cbm‐ and iVN/Cbm‐types indicate that some excitatory neuronal circuits within the vestibular nuclei supply their collaterals to the vestibulocerebellum as MFs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The astrocyte network in the ventral nerve cord neuropil of the Drosophila third‐instar larva&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/911271db-26b1-4d82-b1ea-0b7891a52fff/cne24852-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have provided a detailed analysis of astrocyte morphology and territory in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; third‐instar ventral nerve cord where there already exists considerable understanding of the neuronal network. Astrocyte shape varies from globular to multi‐arbored; their arbors can extend across segments and into different neuronal domains. Our data are consistent with a model of a developmental growth process dominated by competitive or repulsive interactions between astrocytes, but should also include cell‐autonomous aspects, as well as use of structural features for growth. This study provides the foundation for a robust, functionally oriented connectome needed to understand neuron–glia interactions in this neuropil.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding neuronal function at the local and circuit level requires understanding astrocyte function. We have provided a detailed analysis of astrocyte morphology and territory in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; third‐instar ventral nerve cord where there already exists considerable understanding of the neuronal network. Astrocyte shape varies more than previously reported; many have bilaterally symmetrical partners, many have a high percentage of their arborization in adjacent segments, and many have branches that follow structural features. Taken together, our data are consistent with, but not fully explained by, a model of a developmental growth process dominated by competitive or repulsive interactions between astrocytes. Our data suggest that the model should also include cell‐autonomous aspects, as well as the use of structural features for growth. Variation in location of arborization territory for identified astrocytes was great enough that a standardized scheme of neuropil division among the six astrocytes that populate each hemi‐segment is not possible at the third instar. The arborizations of the astrocytes can extend across neuronal functional domains. The ventral astrocyte in particular, whose territory can extend well into the proprioceptive region of the neuropil, has no obvious branching pattern that correlates with domains of particular sensory modalities, suggesting that the astrocyte would respond to neuronal activity in any of the sensory modalities, perhaps integrating across them. This study sets the stage for future studies that will generate a robust, functionally oriented connectome that includes both partners in neuronal circuits—the neurons and the glial cells, providing the foundation necessary for studies to elucidate neuron–glia interactions in this neuropil.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Mild carotid stenosis creates gradual, progressive, lifelong brain, and eye damage: An experimental laboratory rat model&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9566fb6b-678c-41e2-b65f-24cf6fe2765f/cne24851-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mild occlusion affects behavior, brain, and eyes morphology. Diffusion‐tensor imaging revealed brain abnormalities in both groups, but only bilateral rats show effects in the optic nerve. Histology revealed for those areas changes in astrocytes, microglia, and number of apoptotic cells. Bilateral occlusion produced a severe damage to both eyes while in unilateral the damage was only in the occluded side.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans, carotid stenosis of 70% and above might be the cause of clinical symptoms such as transient ischemic attack and stroke. No clinical or animal studies have evaluated mild carotid occlusion, and few examined unilateral occlusion. Here, Westar rats underwent bilateral or unilateral carotid occlusion of 28–45%. Long‐term effects were evaluated 9–11 months later. We conducted cognitive evaluation using spatial learning in a water maze and exploration behavior in an open field. Morphology of the brain was examined by MRI using diffusion‐tensor imaging (DTI) and immunohistochemistry staining of the brain and eyes. Cognitive deficit was found in spatial memory and exploration behavior in both occluded groups. Brain and eyes histology presented severe damage in the bilateral group, compared to the unilateral one. DTI revealed an increase in mean diffusivity (MD) in the ventral thalamus and a decrease in fractional anisotropy in optic nerve and optic tract in bilateral rats, while unilateral rats showed only an increase in MD in the ventral pons. In those areas, a significant change in astrocytes, microglia, and number of apoptotic cells were found. Bilateral occlusion produced severe damage to both retinas, while unilateral occlusion produced damage mainly in the occluded side. We found that mild carotid stenosis, even in a unilateral occlusion, creates behavioral abnormalities presented by brain and eye histopathology. The results support our hypothesis that gradual formation of mild carotid stenosis along the life course leads to progressive damage that may create different degenerative diseases at a later age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Expression and distribution of trophoblast glycoprotein in the mouse retina</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Expression and distribution of trophoblast glycoprotein in the mouse retina&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/24d2bc5e-3809-408b-81b2-a71d1b01fa42/cne24850-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trophoblast glycoprotein (TPBG) is a leucine‐rich repeat glycoprotein with an intracellular PDZ‐binding motif that is localized to the dendrites and axon terminals of retinal rod bipolar cells and in the cell body and dendrites of an uncharacterized amacrine cell. Immunofluorescent labeling of TPBG in rod bipolar cells is significantly reduced in the TRPM1 knockout retina, yet total retinal TPBG is constant. This suggests that antibody access may be blocked in certain activity states, possibly by TPBG binding to a PDZ protein in a light‐ or phosphorylation‐dependent manner.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently identified the leucine‐rich repeat (LRR) adhesion protein, trophoblast glycoprotein (TPBG), as a novel PKCα‐dependent phosphoprotein in retinal rod bipolar cells (RBCs). Since TPBG has not been thoroughly examined in the retina, this study characterizes the localization and expression patterns of TPBG in the developing and adult mouse retina using two antibodies, one against the N‐terminal LRR domain and the other against the C‐terminal PDZ‐interacting motif. Both antibodies labeled RBC dendrites in the outer plexiform layer and axon terminals in the IPL, as well as a putative amacrine cell with their cell bodies in the inner nuclear layer (INL) and a dense layer in the middle of the inner plexiform layer (IPL). In live transfected HEK293 cells, TPBG was localized to the plasma membrane with the N‐terminal LRR domain facing the extracellular space. TPBG immunofluorescence in RBCs was strongly altered by the loss of TRPM1 in the adult retina, with significantly less dendritic and axon terminal labeling in TRPM1 knockout compared to wild type, despite no change in total TPBG detected by immunoblotting. During retinal development, TPBG expression increases dramatically just prior to eye opening with a time course closely correlated with that of TRPM1 expression. In the retina, LRR proteins have been implicated in the development and maintenance of functional bipolar cell synapses, and TPBG may play a similar role in RBCs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Reorganization of longitudinal compartments in the laterally protruding paraflocculus of the postnatal mouse cerebellum</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Reorganization of longitudinal compartments in the laterally protruding paraflocculus of the postnatal mouse cerebellum&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/75da3991-2bd1-4d49-ad7a-b00e4770c44c/cne24849-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paraflocculus (PFl), neighbored by the flocculus (Fl) and copula pyramidis (Cop), forms remarkable protrusion between postnatal Days 1 and 7 (P1, P7) in the mouse cerebellum. The paravermal compartment of &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+ Purkinje cells (arrowheads) migrate laterally to become accommodated within the laterally oriented striped compartmentalization in the bulb‐shaped paraflocculus.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paraflocculus and the neighboring smaller flocculus form a remarkable protrusion in the ventrolateral aspect of the mouse cerebellum, in which the longitudinal compartments are conspicuously oriented perpendicularly to the sagittal plane. The developmental process of such anatomical arrangements in these lobules has not been fully clarified. Here, we used the genetic tractability of &lt;i&gt;pcdh10‐lacZ&lt;/i&gt; knock‐in (OL‐KO), &lt;i&gt;IP&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;R1‐nls‐lacZ&lt;/i&gt; transgenic (1NM13) and Gpr26cre‐Ai9‐AldocV mice to track the development of compartments and examined local longitudinal orientation of Purkinje cells within the paraflocculus and flocculus. We observed a distinct &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;‐positive (&lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+) compartment in the flocculus, whereas the paraflocculus and other lobules had a continuous paravermal &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+ compartment, in the embryonic OL‐KO cerebellum. During the first postnatal week, the parafloccular &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+ compartment shifted laterally to the most lateral edge in the caudal part of the protruding paraflocculus. Although the most medial edge of the parafloccular &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+ compartment remained in the nonprotruding part of the paraflocculus, it was disrupted from the originally continuous &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+ compartment in the copula pyramidis. The local longitudinal orientation changed gradually along with the mediolateral extent of the copula pyramidis, almost becoming perpendicular to the sagittal plane in the laterally connected paraflocculus in the adult cerebellum. This rotational change in orientation was derived from the short U‐shaped embryonic cerebellum, in which the surfaces of the flocculus and paraflocculus were oriented laterally. These results indicated that the peculiar compartmental organization of the paraflocculus originates from the embryonic common hemispheric compartmental organization and shaped by the significant reorganization process in the first postnatal week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Spatial models of cell distribution in human lumbar dorsal root ganglia&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7f4667d4-6dde-4d84-adcc-b61710495e1a/cne24848-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are novel targets for neural interface technologies that treat neurological disorders, such as chronic pain and spinal cord injury. The three‐dimensional cellular anatomy of DRG are not well‐mapped, particularly in humans, limiting the effectiveness of neurotechnology. We developed a semi‐automated algorithm to quantify the three‐dimensional distribution of neural elements in histologically‐processed tissue. We applied this algorithm to sequential NF200‐stained histology slices obtained from human lumbar DRG and demonstrated that cell bodies typically congregate around the dorsal edge of the ganglia. These results are crucial to the development of safe and effective clinical neural interface technologies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which contain the somata of primary sensory neurons, have increasingly been considered as novel targets for clinical neural interfaces, both for neuroprosthetic and pain applications. Effective use of either neural recording or stimulation technologies requires an appropriate spatial position relative to the target neural element, whether axon or cell body. However, the internal three‐dimensional spatial organization of human DRG neural fibers and somata has not been quantitatively described. In this study, we analyzed 202 cross‐sectional images across the length of 31 human L4 and L5 DRG from 10 donors. We used a custom semi‐automated graphical user interface to identify the locations of neural elements in the images and normalize the output to a consistent spatial reference for direct comparison by spinal level. By applying a recursive partitioning algorithm, we found that the highest density of cell bodies at both spinal levels could be found in the inner 85% of DRG length, the outer‐most 25–30% radially, and the dorsal‐most 69–76%. While axonal density was fairly homogeneous across the DRG length, there was a distinct low density region in the outer 7–11% radially. These findings are consistent with previous qualitative reports of neural distribution in DRG. The quantitative measurements we provide will enable improved targeting of future neural interface technologies and DRG‐focused pharmaceutical therapies, and provide a rigorous anatomical description of the bridge between the central and peripheral nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estrogens underlie, at least in part, the greater pain sensitivity and chronic pain prevalence that women experience compared to men. Previous studies revealed populations of estrogen receptor‐expressing neurons in primary afferents and in superficial dorsal horn neurons, but there is limited information as to the contribution of these neurons to the generation of acute and chronic pain. Here we molecularly characterized neurons in the mouse superficial spinal cord dorsal horn that express estrogen receptor α (ERα) and explored the behavioral consequences of their ablation. The great majority of spinal ERα‐positive neurons are excitatory interneurons and many co‐express the neuropeptide, substance P. After viral, caspase‐mediated ablation of spinal ERα‐expressing cells, we did not observe changes in acute mechanical or heat pain processing, but recorded significant changes in the response to chemically‐evoked persistent pain behavior as well as pruritogen‐evoked itch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estrogens are presumed to underlie, at least in part, the greater pain sensitivity and chronic pain prevalence that women experience compared to men. Although previous studies revealed populations of estrogen receptor‐expressing neurons in primary afferents and in superficial dorsal horn neurons, there is little to no information as to the contribution of these neurons to the generation of acute and chronic pain. Here we molecularly characterized neurons in the mouse superficial spinal cord dorsal horn that express estrogen receptor α (ERα) and explored the behavioral consequences of their ablation. We found that spinal ERα‐positive neurons are largely excitatory interneurons and many coexpress substance P, a marker for a discrete subset of nociceptive, excitatory interneurons. After viral, caspase‐mediated ablation of spinal ERα‐expressing cells, we observed a significant decrease in the first phase of the formalin test, but in male mice only. ERα‐expressing neuron‐ablation also reduced pruritogen‐induced scratching in both male and female mice. There were no ablation‐related changes in mechanical or heat withdrawal thresholds or in capsaicin‐induced nocifensive behavior. In chronic pain models, we found no change in Complete Freund's adjuvant‐induced thermal or mechanical hypersensitivity, or in partial sciatic nerve injury‐induced mechanical allodynia. We conclude that ERα labels a subpopulation of excitatory interneurons that are specifically involved in chemically evoked persistent pain and pruritogen‐induced itch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Antibodies to the RNA binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 contribute to neuronal cell loss in an animal model of multiple sclerosis&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e1ebeb42-0341-416e-9652-453bc8908692/cne24845-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, in contrast to healthy controls make autoantibodies to the RNA binding protein heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1). Using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS, injections of anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies lead to increased neurodegeneration as shown by a loss of neuronal cell bodies in the ventral spinal cord (graph). We demonstrate that anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies localized within and surrounding neuronal cell bodies of the ventral spinal cord. In these areas we demonstrate that neurons display increased hnRNP A1 mislocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, increased stress granule formation while also expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Additionally, anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies were localized to CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; immune cells leading to an increase in iNOS in the surrounding tissue and subsequent neurodegeneration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurodegeneration, including loss of neurons and axons, is a feature of progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). The mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration are mostly unknown. Research implicates autoimmunity to nonmyelin self‐antigens as important contributors to disease pathogenesis. Data from our lab implicate autoimmunity to the RNA binding protein (RBP) heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) as a possible mechanism of neurodegeneration in MS. MS patients make antibodies to hnRNP A1, which have been shown to lead to neuronal dysfunction in vitro. Using an animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we show here that injection of anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies, in contrast to control antibodies, resulted in worsened disease and increased neurodegeneration. We found a reduction of NeuN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neuronal cell bodies in areas of the ventral gray matter of the spinal cord where anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies localized. Neurons displayed increased levels of hnRNP A1 nucleocytoplasmic mislocalization and stress granule formation, both markers of neuronal injury. Anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies were found to surround neuronal cell bodies and interact with CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; immune cells via Fc receptors. Additionally, anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies were found within neuronal cell bodies including those of the ventral spinocerebellar tract (VSCT), a tract previously shown to undergo neurodegeneration in anti‐hnRNP A1 antibody injected EAE mice. Finally, both immune cells and neurons showed increased levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase, another indicator of cell damage. These findings suggest that autoimmunity to RBPs, such as hnRNP A1, play a role in neurodegeneration in EAE with important implications for the pathogenesis of MS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Candidates for photic entrainment pathways to the circadian clock via optic lobe neuropils in the Madeira cockroach&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ebf9b454-6a80-484a-9ced-5a9659241f56/cne24844-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the nocturnal Madeira cockroach, parallel photic entrainment pathways from the compound eye to the circadian clock in the accessory medulla (AME) control circadian rest‐activity rhythms. We hypothesize that UV light promotes sleep via activation of ipsilateral pigment‐dispersing factor‐releasing morning clock cells (aPDFMEs/pPDFMEs) mediated via interneurons (CRZ MNe) between medulla layers 2 and 4. In contrast, green light directly activates contralateral PDF evening clock cells in the lamina, promoting activity at night. In addition, rest‐activity rhythms may be entrained via extraocular photoreceptors terminating in the accessory laminae (ALA).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compound eye of cockroaches is obligatory for entrainment of the Madeira cockroach's circadian clock, but the cellular nature of its entrainment pathways is enigmatic. Employing multiple‐label immunocytochemistry, histochemistry, and backfills, we searched for photic entrainment pathways to the accessory medulla (AME), the circadian clock of the Madeira cockroach. We wanted to know whether photoreceptor terminals could directly contact pigment‐dispersing factor‐immunoreactive (PDF‐ir) circadian pacemaker neurons with somata in the lamina (PDFLAs) or somata next to the AME (PDFMEs). Short green‐sensitive photoreceptor neurons of the compound eye terminated in lamina layers LA1 and LA2, adjacent to PDFLAs and PDFMEs that branched in LA3. Long UV‐sensitive compound eye photoreceptor neurons terminated in medulla layer ME2 without direct contact to ipsilateral PDFMEs that arborized in ME4. Multiple neuropeptide‐ir interneurons branched in ME4, connecting the AME to ME2. Before, extraocular photoreceptors of the lamina organ were suggested to send terminals to accessory laminae. There, they overlapped with PDFLAs that mostly colocalized PDF, FMRFamide, and 5‐HT immunoreactivities, and with terminals of ipsi‐ and contralateral PDFMEs. We hypothesize that during the day cholinergic activation of the largest PDFME via lamina organ photoreceptors maintains PDF release orchestrating phases of sleep–wake cycles. As ipsilateral PDFMEs express excitatory and contralateral PDFMEs inhibitory PDF autoreceptors, diurnal PDF release keeps both PDF‐dependent clock circuits in antiphase. Future experiments will test whether ipsilateral PDFMEs are sleep‐promoting morning cells, while contralateral PDFMEs are activity‐promoting evening cells, maintaining stable antiphase via the largest PDFME entrained by extraocular photoreceptors of the lamina organ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Genetically Elevated LDL Associates with Lower Risk of Intracerebral Hemorrhage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25740?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25740?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observational studies point to an inverse correlation between low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but it remains unclear whether this association is causal. We tested the hypothesis that genetically elevated LDL is associated with reduced risk of ICH.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We constructed one polygenic risk score (PRS) per lipid trait (total cholesterol, LDL, high‐density lipoprotein [HDL], and triglycerides) using independent genomewide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for each trait. We used data from 316,428 individuals enrolled in the UK Biobank to estimate the effect of each PRS on its corresponding trait, and data from 1,286 ICH cases and 1,261 matched controls to estimate the effect of each PRS on ICH risk. We used these estimates to conduct Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 410, 339, 393, and 317 lipid‐related SNPs for total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides, respectively. All four PRSs were strongly associated with their corresponding trait (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 1.00 × 10&lt;sup&gt;‐100&lt;/sup&gt;). While one SD increase in the PRSs for total cholesterol (odds ratio [OR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.85–0.99; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03) and LDL cholesterol (OR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.81–0.95; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002) were inversely associated with ICH risk, no significant associations were found for HDL and triglycerides (both &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). MR analyses indicated that 1mmol/L (38.67mg/dL) increase of genetically instrumented total and LDL cholesterol were associated with 23% (OR = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.65–0.98; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03) and 41% lower risks of ICH (OR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.42–0.82; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetically elevated LDL levels were associated with lower risk of ICH, providing support for a potential causal role of LDL cholesterol in ICH. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Systems Biology: Differential Expression of Plasma Exo-miRNA in Neurodegenerative Diseases by Next-Generation Sequencing</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00438</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a wide variety of pathological conditions caused by a loss of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and are severely debilitating. Exosome contains bio-signatures of great diagnostic and therapeutic value. There is proof that exosomal proteins can be biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). MicroRNAs in exosome has potential to be an important source of biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report exosomal microRNA performance of human plasma in neurodegenerative diseases by small RNA sequencing. A wide range of altered exo-miRNA expression levels were detected in both AD and PD patients. Down-regulated miRNAs in AD samples were enriched in ECM-receptor interaction pathway and both up-/down-regulated miRNAs in PD samples were enriched in fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. Compared to the control, 8 miRNAs were found to be significantly elevated/declined in AD and PD samples, of which 4 miRNAs were newly identified. Additionally, two exosome isolating methods were compared and the reproducibility of plasma exo-miRNA expression was confirmed, suggesting the feasibility of large-scale clinical application of this method. This study revealed exo-miRNA expression levels in neurodegenerative diseases, proposed new biomarkers and their potential functional pathway for AD and PD, confirmed the reproductivity of exo-miRNA profiles by using a different exosome isolating method, and compared the results with plasma miRNA expression. Therefore, this study also provides a precedent for identifying exosomal biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases in plasma by high-throughput sequencing and it could extend the therapeutic repertoire of exosomal biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Oxidative Stress-Induced Axon Fragmentation Is a Consequence of Reduced Axonal Transport in Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia SPAST Patient Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00401</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00401</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of inherited disorders characterized by progressive spasticity and paralysis of the lower limbs. Autosomal dominant mutations in SPAST gene account for ∼40% of adult-onset patients. We have previously shown that SPAST patient cells have reduced organelle transport and are therefore more sensitive to oxidative stress. To test whether these effects are present in neuronal cells, we first generated 11 induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines from fibroblasts of three healthy controls and three HSP patients with different SPAST mutations. These cells were differentiated into FOXG1-positive forebrain neurons and then evaluated for multiple aspects of axonal transport and fragmentation. Patient neurons exhibited reduced levels of SPAST encoded spastin, as well as a range of axonal deficits, including reduced levels of stabilized microtubules, lower peroxisome transport speed as a consequence of reduced microtubule-dependent transport, reduced number of peroxisomes, and higher density of axon swellings. Patient axons fragmented significantly more than controls following hydrogen peroxide exposure, suggesting for the first time that the SPAST patient axons are more sensitive than controls to the deleterious effects of oxidative stress. Treatment of patient neurons with tubulin-binding drugs epothilone D and noscapine rescued axon peroxisome transport and protected them against axon fragmentation induced by oxidative stress, showing that SPAST patient axons are vulnerable to oxidative stress-induced degeneration as a consequence of reduced axonal transport.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Sensory- and Action-Oriented Embodiment of Neurally-Interfaced Robotic Hand Prostheses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00389</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Embodiment is the percept that something not originally belonging to the self becomes part of the body. Feeling embodiment for a prosthesis may counteract amputees’ altered image of the body and increase prosthesis acceptability. Prosthesis embodiment has been studied longitudinally in an amputee receiving feedback through intraneural and perineural multichannel electrodes implanted in her stump. Three factors—invasive (vs non-invasive) stimulation, training, and anthropomorphism—have been tested through two multisensory integration tasks: visuo-tactile integration (VTI) and crossing-hand effect in temporal order judgment (TOJ), the former more sensible to an extension of a safe margin around the body and the latter to action-oriented remapping. Results from the amputee participant were compared with the ones from healthy controls. Testing the participant with intraneural stimulation produced an extension of peripersonal space, a sign of prosthesis embodiment. One-month training extended the peripersonal space selectively on the side wearing the prostheses. More and less-anthropomorphic prostheses benefited of intraneural feedback and extended the peripersonal space. However, the worsening of TOJ performance following arm crossing was present only wearing the more trained, despite less anthropomorphic, prosthesis, suggesting that training was critical for our participant to achieve operative tool-like embodiment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: EEG Functional Connectivity Underlying Emotional Valance and Arousal Using Minimum Spanning Trees</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00355</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00355</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, traditional methods such as power spectrum and amplitude analysis have been used to research the emotional electroencephalogram (EEG). The brain network method is also used in emotional EEG research, which can better reflect the activity of brains. A minimum spanning tree (MST) represents the key information flow in the weighted brain network, and it provides a sensitive method to capture subtle information in network organization while effectively avoiding the shortcomings of traditional brain networks. The DEAP dataset provides electroencephalogram (EEG) data for four categories of emotions: high arousal and high valence (HAHV), high arousal and low valence (HALV), low arousal and high valence (LAHV), and low arousal and low valence (LALV). Phase lag index (PLI) weighted matrices were calculated in five frequency bands. On this basis, the minimum spanning trees were constructed. At the same valence level in the gamma (γ) band, HAHV and HALV showed significant higher mean PLI (MPLI), maximum degree (Degree&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) and leaf fraction and significant lower diameter and eccentricity than LAHV and LALV. At the same arousal level in the γ band, HALV showed significant higher MPLI, Degree&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and leaf fraction and significant lower diameter and eccentricity than HAHV. These results indicate that the low-arousal showed more line-shaped configurations than the high-arousal. Additionally, in the high-arousal condition, a shift toward more star-shaped trees from high-valence to low-valence supports the trend toward randomness of the brain network with negative emotions and that the brain is more activated when faced with negative emotions. From a brain network perspective, this phenomenon provides a theoretical basis for negative bias.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Resting State EEG in Exercise Intervention Studies: A Systematic Review of Effects and Methods</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00155</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00155</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Exercise has been shown to alter brain plasticity and is explored as a therapeutic intervention in a wide variety of neurological diseases. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers an inexpensive method of studying brain electrocortical activity shortly after exercise and thus offers a way of exploring the influence of exercise on the brain. We conducted a systematic review to summarize the current body of evidence regarding methods of EEG analysis and the reported effects of exercise interventions on EEG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE were searched for studies investigating resting state EEG in exercise intervention studies carried out in participants &amp;gt;17 years of age and with no history of epilepsy. Further, studies solely investigating event-related potentials as an outcome measure were excluded. Relevant data were extracted, and a risk-of-bias assessment was carried out using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A qualitative synthesis of results was carried out. A protocol for the systematic review was uploaded to https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ (ID: CRD42019134570) and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) statement was followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Out of 1,993 records screened, 54 studies were included in a final qualitative synthesis with a total of 1,445 participants. Our synthesis showed that studies were mainly carried out using frequency analysis as an analytical method. Generally, findings across studies were inconsistent and few were adjusted for multiple comparisons. Studies were mainly of low quality and usually carried out in small populations, lowering the significance of results reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Changes in the EEG as a result of an exercise intervention are elusive and difficult to replicate. Future studies should provide biologically sound hypotheses underlying assumptions, include larger populations and use standardized EEG methods to increase replicability. EEG remains an interesting methodology to examine the effects of exercise on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Functional neurological disorders are characterized by neurological symptoms that have no identifiable pathology and little is known about their underlying pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;To analyze motor cortex excitability and intracortical inhibitory and excitatory circuits’ imbalance in patients with flaccid functional weakness.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one consecutive patients with acute onset of flaccid functional weakness were recruited. Single and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols were used to analyze resting motor thresholds (RMT) and intracortical inhibitory (short interval intracortical inhibition – SICI) and excitatory (intracortical facilitation – ICF) circuits’ imbalance between the affected and non-affected motor cortices.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We observed a significant increase in RMT and SICI in the affected motor cortex (p &amp;lt; 0.001), but not for ICF, compared to the contralateral unaffected side.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study extends current knowledge of functional weakness, arguing for a specific central nervous system abnormality which may be involved in the symptoms’ pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Plasticity of Persistent Activity and Its Constraints</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00015</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stimulus information is maintained in working memory by action potentials that persist after the stimulus is no longer physically present. The prefrontal cortex is a critical brain area that maintains such persistent activity due to an intrinsic network with unique synaptic connectivity, NMDA receptors, and interneuron types. Persistent activity can be highly plastic depending on task demands but it also appears in naïve subjects, not trained or required to perform a task at all. Here, we review what aspects of persistent activity remain constant and what factors can modify it, focusing primarily on neurophysiological results from non-human primate studies. Changes in persistent activity are constrained by anatomical location, with more ventral and more anterior prefrontal areas exhibiting the greatest capacity for plasticity, as opposed to posterior and dorsal areas, which change relatively little with training. Learning to perform a cognitive task for the first time, further practicing the task, and switching between learned tasks can modify persistent activity. The ability of the prefrontal cortex to generate persistent activity also depends on age, with changes noted between adolescence, adulthood, and old age. Mean firing rates, variability and correlation of persistent discharges, but also time-varying firing rate dynamics are altered by these factors. Plastic changes in the strength of intrinsic network connections can be revealed by the analysis of synchronous spiking between neurons. These results are essential for understanding how the prefrontal cortex mediates working memory and intelligent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown multiple mechanisms and pathophysiological changes after anesthesia, and genome-wide studies have been implemented in the studies of brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the genome-wide gene expression patterns and modulation networks after general anesthesia remains to be elucidated. Therefore, whole transcriptome microarray analysis was used to explore the coding gene expression patterns in the hippocampus of aged rats after sevoflurane anesthesia. Six hundred and thirty one upregulated and 183 downregulated genes were screened out, then 44 enriched terms of biological process, 16 of molecular function and 18 of the cellular components were identified by Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG analysis. Among them, oxidative stress, metabolism, aging, and neurodegeneration were the most enriched biological processes and changed functions. Thus, involved genes of these processes were selected for qPCR verification and a good consistency was confirmed. The potential signaling pathways were further constructed including mitochondrion and oxidative stress-related Hifs-Prkcd-Akt-Nfe2l2-Sod1 signaling, multiple metabolism signaling (Scd2, Scap-Hmgcs2, Aldh18a1-Glul and Igf1r), as well as aging and neurodegeneration related signaling (Spidr-Ercc4-Cdkn1a-Pmaip1 and Map1lc3b). These results provide potential therapeutic gene targets for brain function modulation and memory formation process after inhaled anesthesia in the elderly, which could be valuable for preventing postoperative brain disorders and diseases, such as perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND), from the genetic level in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Gender Differences in Neurodegeneration, Neuroinflammation and Na+-Ca2+ Exchangers in the Female A53T Transgenic Mouse Model of Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00118</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Twelve-month-old male mice expressing the human A53T variant of α-synuclein (A53T) develop dopamine neuron degeneration, neuroinflammation, and motor deficits, along with dysfunctions of the mitochondrial Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; exchanger (NCX) isoforms 1 (NCX1) and 3 (NCX3) in the nigrostriatal system. Since gender is thought to play a role in the etiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD), we characterized neurochemical and behavioral alterations in 12-month-old female A53T transgenic mice. We investigated the presence of dopaminergic degeneration, astrogliosis and microgliosis using immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (IBA-1) in both the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and striatum. In the same regions, we also evaluated the co-localization of NCX1 in cells positive for IBA-1 and the co-localization of NCX3 in TH-positive neurons and fibers. Furthermore, in both male and female mice, we performed motor (beam walking and pole tests) and memory [novel object recognition (NOR) and spontaneous alternation] tasks, together with tests to evaluate peripheral deficits (olfactory and stool collection tests). Female A53T transgenic mice displayed degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons, but neither microgliosis nor astrogliosis in the SNc and striatum. Moreover, female A53T transgenic mice displayed co-localization between NCX1 and IBA-1 positive cells in the striatum but not SNc, whereas NCX3 did not co-localize with either TH-positive terminals or neuronal bodies in the nigrostriatal system. Furthermore, female A53T transgenic mice showed increased crossing time in the beam walking test, but no impairments in the pole or memory tests, and in tests that evaluated peripheral deficits, whereas male A53T transgenic mice displayed motor, memory and peripheral deficits. Immunohistochemical and behavioral results obtained here in the female mice differ from those previously observed in males, and suggest a dissimilar influence of NCX1 and NCX3 on dopaminergic function in female and male A53T transgenic mice, strengthening the validity of these mice as a model for studying the etiological factors of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Related Changes in Pain Perception Are Associated With Altered Functional Connectivity During Resting State</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00116</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging affects pain experience and brain functioning. However, how aging leads to changes in pain perception and brain functional connectivity has not yet been completely understood. To investigate resting-state and pain perception changes in old and young participants, this study employed region of interest (ROI) to ROI resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis of imaging data by using regions implicated in sensory and affective dimensions of pain, descending pain modulation, and the default-mode networks (DMNs). Thirty-seven older (66.86 ± 4.04 years; 16 males) and 38 younger healthy participants (20.74 ± 4.15 years; 19 males) underwent 10 min’ eyes-closed resting-state scanning. We examined the relationship between rsFC parameters with pressure pain thresholds. Older participants showed higher pain thresholds than younger. Regarding rsFC, older adults displayed increased connectivity of pain-related sensory brain regions in comparison to younger participants: increased rsFC between bilateral primary somatosensory area (SI) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and between SI(L) and secondary somatosensory area (SII)-(R) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). Moreover, decreased connectivity in the older compared to the younger group was found among descending pain modulatory regions: between the amygdala(R) and bilateral insula(R), thalamus(R), ACC, and amygdala(L); between the amygdala(L) and insula(R) and bilateral thalamus; between ACC and bilateral insula, and between periaqueductal gray (PAG) and bilateral thalamus. Regarding the DMN, the posterior parietal cortex and lateral parietal (LP; R) were more strongly connected in the older group than in the younger group. Correlational analyses also showed that SI(L)-SII(R) rsFC was positively associated with pressure pain thresholds in older participants. In conclusion, these findings suggest a compensatory mechanism for the sensory changes that typically accompanies aging. Furthermore, older participants showed reduced functional connectivity between key nodes of the descending pain inhibitory pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Clinical and Genetic Aspects of CADASIL</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a hereditary cerebral small vessel disease caused by mutations in NOTCH3, is characterized by recurrent stroke without vascular risk factors, mood disturbances, and dementia. MRI imaging shows cerebral white matter (WM) hyperintensity, particularly in the external capsule and temporal pole. Missense mutations related to a cysteine residue in the 34 EGFr on the NOTCH3 extracellular domain (N3ECD) are a typical mutation of CADASIL. On the other hand, atypical mutations including cysteine sparing mutation, null mutation, homozygous mutation, and other associate genes are also reported. From the viewpoint of gain of function apart from Notch signaling or loss of function of Notch signaling, we review the research article about CADASIL and summarized the pathogenesis of small vessel, stroke, and dementia in this disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Genuine cross-frequency coupling networks in human resting-state electrophysiological recordings</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Felix Siebenhühner, Sheng H. Wang, Gabriele Arnulfo, Anna Lampinen, Lino Nobili, J. Matias Palva, Satu Palva&lt;/p&gt;

Phase synchronization of neuronal oscillations in specific frequency bands coordinates anatomically distributed neuronal processing and communication. Typically, oscillations and synchronization take place concurrently in many distinct frequencies, which serve separate computational roles in cognitive functions. While within-frequency phase synchronization has been studied extensively, less is known about the mechanisms that govern neuronal processing distributed across frequencies and brain regions. Such integration of processing between frequencies could be achieved via cross-frequency coupling (CFC), either by phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) or by &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-cross–frequency phase synchrony (CFS). So far, studies have mostly focused on local CFC in individual brain regions, whereas the presence and functional organization of CFC between brain areas have remained largely unknown. We posit that interareal CFC may be essential for large-scale coordination of neuronal activity and investigate here whether genuine CFC networks are present in human resting-state (RS) brain activity. To assess the functional organization of CFC networks, we identified brain-wide CFC networks at mesoscale resolution from stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) and at macroscale resolution from source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We developed a novel, to our knowledge, graph-theoretical method to distinguish genuine CFC from spurious CFC that may arise from nonsinusoidal signals ubiquitous in neuronal activity. We show that genuine interareal CFC is present in human RS activity in both SEEG and MEG data. Both CFS and PAC networks coupled theta and alpha oscillations with higher frequencies in large-scale networks connecting anterior and posterior brain regions. CFS and PAC networks had distinct spectral patterns and opposing distribution of low- and high-frequency network hubs, implying that they constitute distinct CFC mechanisms. The strength of CFS networks was also predictive of cognitive performance in a separate neuropsychological assessment. In conclusion, these results provide evidence for interareal CFS and PAC being 2 distinct mechanisms for coupling oscillations across frequencies in large-scale brain networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/iApG8yeSIYU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: In search of common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and subplate</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24922?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24922?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;In search of common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and subplate&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9d019221-95c1-430d-b14e-455e63f242d6/cne24922-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarities in gene expression patterns prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity, and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Almost all of the markers we examined that were expressed in the subplate/Layer 6b were also expressed in the claustral complex, but not all claustrum specific or enriched genes were expressed in subplate/Layer 6b, suggesting overall similarities, but also some differences. There are numerous similarities between the adult connectivity patters of Layer 6b and claustrum. In particular, both have extensive cortical connections. However, there are differences in the relative strength of their reciprocal connectivity with various other structures in the adult. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human claustrum, a major hub of widespread neocortical connections, is a thin, bilateral sheet of gray matter located between the insular cortex and the striatum. The subplate is a largely transient cortical structure that contains some of the earliest generated neurons of the cerebral cortex and has important developmental functions to establish intra‐ and extracortical connections. In human and macaque some subplate cells undergo regulated cell death, but some remain as interstitial white matter cells. In mouse and rat brains a compact layer is formed, Layer 6b, and it remains underneath the cortex, adjacent to the white matter. Whether Layer 6b in rodents is homologous to primate subplate or interstitial white matter cells is still debated. Gene expression patterns, such as those of &lt;i&gt;Nurr1/Nr4a2&lt;/i&gt;, have suggested that the rodent subplate and the persistent subplate cells in Layer 6b and the claustrum might have similar origins. Moreover, the birthdates of the claustrum and Layer 6b are similarly precocious in mice. These observations prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity, and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Nimodipine Reduces Dysfunction and Demyelination in Models of Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25749?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25749?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment of relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) has not advanced beyond steroid use, which reduces acute loss of function, but has little effect on residual disability. Acute loss of function in an MS model (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [EAE]) is partly due to central nervous system (CNS) hypoxia, and function can promptly improve upon breathing oxygen. Here, we investigate the cause of the hypoxia and whether it is due to a deficit in oxygen supply arising from impaired vascular perfusion. We also explore whether the CNS‐selective vasodilating agent, nimodipine, may provide a therapy to restore function, and protect from demyelination in 2 MS models.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of methods have been used to measure basic cardiovascular physiology, spinal oxygenation, mitochondrial function, and tissue perfusion in EAE.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report that the tissue hypoxia in EAE is associated with a profound hypoperfusion of the inflamed spinal cord. Treatment with nimodipine restores spinal oxygenation and can rapidly improve function. Nimodipine therapy also reduces demyelination in both EAE and a model of the early MS lesion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss of function in EAE, and demyelination in EAE, and the model of the early MS lesion, seem to be due, at least in part, to tissue hypoxia due to local spinal hypoperfusion. Therapy to improve blood flow not only protects neurological function but also reduces demyelination. We conclude that nimodipine could be repurposed to offer substantial clinical benefit in MS.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Longitudinal Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis with the Brain‐Age Paradigm</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25746?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25746?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the natural course of multiple sclerosis (MS), the brain is exposed to aging as well as disease effects. Brain aging can be modeled statistically; the so‐called “brain‐age” paradigm. Here, we evaluated whether brain‐predicted age difference (brain‐PAD) was sensitive to the presence of MS, clinical progression, and future outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a longitudinal, multicenter sample of 3,565 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, in 1,204 patients with MS and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and 150 healthy controls (mean follow‐up time: patients 3.41 years, healthy controls 1.97 years), we measured “brain‐predicted age” using T1‐weighted MRI. We compared brain‐PAD among patients with MS and patients with CIS and healthy controls, and between disease subtypes. Relationships between brain‐PAD and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) were explored.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with MS had markedly higher brain‐PAD than healthy controls (mean brain‐PAD +10.3 years; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.5–12.1] versus 4.3 years; 95% CI = 2.1 to 6.4; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). The highest brain‐PADs were in secondary‐progressive MS (+13.3 years; 95% CI = 11.3–15.3). Brain‐PAD at study entry predicted time‐to‐disability progression (hazard ratio 1.02; 95% CI = 1.01–1.03; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001); although normalized brain volume was a stronger predictor. Greater annualized brain‐PAD increases were associated with greater annualized EDSS score (r = 0.26; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain‐age paradigm is sensitive to MS‐related atrophy and clinical progression. A higher brain‐PAD at baseline was associated with more rapid disability progression and the rate of change in brain‐PAD related to worsening disability. Potentially, “brain‐age” could be used as a prognostic biomarker in early‐stage MS, to track disease progression or stratify patients for clinical trial enrollment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science and medicine aim to identify verifiable and replicable truths. However, the paths to such truths are frequently characterised by swinging pendulums of opposing perspectives. This is especially so in human neuroscience and the brain‐based clinical sciences, where the target of investigation is the most complex of all biological systems. This paper overviews a set of interrelated neuroscientific and clinical hypotheses, models, experiments and predictions with which I have been involved for the last two decades. Traversing visual neuroscience, consciousness science, genetics, chronobiology, and biological and clinical psychiatry, the work illustrates how developments in science and medicine can occur through a combination of synthesis, serendipity and experimentation. The paper also reflects on doing science with the inimitable John ‘Jack’ Pettigrew, and outlines how Pettigrew and I conceived, proposed, tested and developed two new scientific models — one on neural mechanisms of binocular rivalry, the other on the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. I also provide an update on various aspects of our models and data, and describe lessons learned from Pettigrew on how perspectives in science exhibit their own fluctuations, ironically like the very phenomena on which we worked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dorsal column nuclei complex (DCN‐complex) includes the dorsal column nuclei (DCN, referring to the gracile and cuneate nuclei collectively), external cuneate, X, and Z nuclei, and the median accessory nucleus. The DCN are organised by both somatotopy and modality, and have a diverse range of afferent inputs and projection targets. The functional organisation and connectivity of the DCN implicate them in a variety of sensorimotor functions, beyond their commonly accepted role in processing and transmitting somatosensory information to the thalamus, yet this is largely underappreciated in the literature. To consolidate insights into their sensorimotor functions, this review examines the morphology, organisation, and connectivity of the DCN and their associated nuclei. First, we briefly discuss the receptors, afferent fibres, and pathways involved in conveying tactile and proprioceptive information to the DCN. Next, we review the modality and somatotopic arrangements of the remaining constituents of the DCN‐complex. Finally, we examine and discuss the functional implications of the myriad of DCN‐complex projection targets throughout the diencephalon, midbrain, and hindbrain, in addition to their modulatory inputs from the cortex. The organisation and connectivity of the DCN‐complex suggest that these nuclei should be considered a complex integration and distribution hub for sensorimotor information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central complex (CX) in the insect brain is a higher order integration center that controls a number of behaviors, most prominently goal directed locomotion. The CX comprises the protocerebral bridge (PB), the upper division of the central body (CBU), the lower division of the central body (CBL), and the paired noduli (NO). Although spatial orientation has been extensively studied in honeybees at the behavioral level, most electrophysiological and anatomical analyses have been carried out in other insect species, leaving the morphology and physiology of neurons that constitute the CX in the honeybee mostly enigmatic. The goal of this study was to morphologically identify neuronal cell types of the CX in the honeybee &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt;. By performing iontophoretic dye injections into the CX, we traced 16 subtypes of neuron that connect a subdivision of the CX with other regions in the bee`s central brain, and eight subtypes that mainly interconnect different subdivisions of the CX. They establish extensive connections between the CX and the lateral complex, the superior protocerebrum and the posterior protocerebrum. Characterized neuron classes and subtypes are morphologically similar to those described in other insects, suggesting considerable conservation in the neural network relevant for orientation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The past decade has witnessed an explosion in applications for neural recording and stimulation in the treatment of clinical disorders. Neuromodulatory approaches are now a mainstay of care for essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease, and are expanding rapidly into a wide range of other neurological and psychiatric diseases. In parallel, advancements in endovascular approaches to cerebrovascular diseases have resulted in minimally invasive techniques that deliver devices to neural tissue in the central and peripheral nervous systems, with significantly improved safety and efficacy. In this review, we discuss the history of endovascular neural recording and stimulation, its current progress, and applications for neurological disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Deep Learning Provides Exceptional Accuracy to ECoG-Based Functional Language Mapping for Epilepsy Surgery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00409</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The success of surgical resection in epilepsy patients depends on preserving functionally critical brain regions, while removing pathological tissues. Being the gold standard, electro-cortical stimulation mapping (ESM) helps surgeons in localizing the function of eloquent cortex through electrical stimulation of electrodes placed directly on the cortical brain surface. Due to the potential hazards of ESM, including increased risk of provoked seizures, electrocorticography based functional mapping (ECoG-FM) was introduced as a safer alternative approach. However, ECoG-FM has a low success rate when compared to the ESM. In this study, we address this critical limitation by developing a new algorithm based on deep learning for ECoG-FM and thereby we achieve an accuracy comparable to ESM in identifying eloquent language cortex. In our experiments, with 11 epilepsy patients who underwent presurgical evaluation (through deep learning-based signal analysis on 637 electrodes), our proposed algorithm obtained an accuracy of 83.05% in identifying language regions, an exceptional 23% improvement with respect to the conventional ECoG-FM analysis (∼60%). Our findings have demonstrated, for the first time, that deep learning powered ECoG-FM can serve as a stand-alone modality and avoid likely hazards of the ESM in epilepsy surgery. Hence, reducing the potential for developing post-surgical morbidity in the language function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Harmonization of Brain Diffusion MRI: Concepts and Methods</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00396</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;MRI diffusion data suffers from significant inter- and intra-site variability, which hinders multi-site and/or longitudinal diffusion studies. This variability may arise from a range of factors, such as hardware, reconstruction algorithms and acquisition settings. To allow a reliable comparison and joint analysis of diffusion data across sites and over time, there is a clear need for robust data harmonization methods. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of diffusion data harmonization concepts and methods, and their limitations. Overall, the methods for the harmonization of multi-site diffusion images can be categorized in two main groups: diffusion parametric map harmonization (DPMH) and diffusion weighted image harmonization (DWIH). Whereas DPMH harmonizes the diffusion parametric maps (e.g., FA, MD, and MK), DWIH harmonizes the diffusion-weighted images. Defining a gold standard harmonization technique for dMRI data is still an ongoing challenge. Nevertheless, in this paper we provide two classification tools, namely a feature table and a flowchart, which aim to guide the readers in selecting an appropriate harmonization method for their study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Myriocin Effect on Tvrm4 Retina, an Autosomal Dominant Pattern of Retinitis Pigmentosa</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00372</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00372</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tvrm4 mice, a model of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP), carry a mutation of Rhodopsin gene that can be activated by brief exposure to very intense light. Here, we test the possibility of an anatomical, metabolic, and functional recovery by delivering to degenerating Tvrm4 animals, Myriocin, an inhibitor of ceramide de novo synthesis previously shown to effectively slow down retinal degeneration in rd10 mutants (Strettoi et al., 2010; Piano et al., 2013). Different routes and durations of Myriocin administration were attempted by using either single intravitreal (i.v.) or long-term, repeated intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections. The retinal function of treated and control animals was tested by ERG recordings. Retinas from ERG-recorded animals were studied histologically to reveal the extent of photoreceptor death. A correlation was observed between Myriocin administration, lowering of retinal ceramides, and preservation of ERG responses in i.v. injected cases. Noticeably, the i.p. treatment with Myriocin decreased the extension of the retinal-degenerating area, preserved the ERG response, and correlated with decreased levels of biochemical indicators of retinal oxidative damage. The results obtained in this study confirm the efficacy of Myriocin in slowing down retinal degeneration in genetic models of RP independently of the underlying mutation responsible for the disease, likely targeting ceramide-dependent, downstream pathways. Alleviation of retinal oxidative stress upon Myriocin treatment suggests that this molecule, or yet unidentified metabolites, act on cellular detoxification systems supporting cell survival. Altogether, the pharmacological approach chosen here meets the necessary pre-requisites for translation into human therapy to slow down RP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Analyzing Brain Connectivity in the Mutual Regulation of Emotion–Movement Using Bidirectional Granger Causality</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Body language and movement are important media of emotional expression. There is an interactive physiological relationship between emotion and movement. Thus, we hypothesize that the emotional cortex interacts with the motor cortex during the mutual regulation of emotion and movement. And this interaction can be revealed by brain connectivity analysis based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing. We proposed a brain connectivity analysis method: bidirectional long short-term memory Granger causality (bi-LSTM-GC). The theoretical basis of the proposed method was Granger causality estimation using a bidirectional LSTM recurrent neural network (RNN) for solving nonlinear parameters. Then, we compared the accuracy of the bi-LSTM-GC with other unidirectional connectivity methods. The results demonstrated that the information interaction existed among multiple brain regions (EEG 10-20 system) in the paradigm of emotion–movement regulation. The detected directional dependencies in EEG signals were mainly distributed from the frontal to the central region and from the prefrontal to the central–parietal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Crossing the Cleft: Communication Challenges Between Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Historically, neuroscience principles have heavily influenced artificial intelligence (AI), for example the influence of the perceptron model, essentially a simple model of a biological neuron, on artificial neural networks. More recently, notable recent AI advances, for example the growing popularity of reinforcement learning, often appear more aligned with cognitive neuroscience or psychology, focusing on function at a relatively abstract level. At the same time, neuroscience stands poised to enter a new era of large-scale high-resolution data and appears more focused on underlying neural mechanisms or architectures that can, at times, seem rather removed from functional descriptions. While this might seem to foretell a new generation of AI approaches arising from a deeper exploration of neuroscience specifically for AI, the most direct path for achieving this is unclear. Here we discuss cultural differences between the two fields, including divergent priorities that should be considered when leveraging modern-day neuroscience for AI. For example, the two fields feed two very different applications that at times require potentially conflicting perspectives. We highlight small but significant cultural shifts that we feel would greatly facilitate increased synergy between the two fields.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Neuroprotective Effects of Diabetes Drugs for the Treatment of Neonatal Hypoxia-Ischemia Encephalopathy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The perinatal period represents a time of great vulnerability for the developing brain. A variety of injuries can result in death or devastating injury causing profound neurocognitive deficits. Hypoxic-ischemic neonatal encephalopathy (HIE) remains the leading cause of brain injury in term infants during the perinatal period with limited options available to aid in recovery. It can result in long-term devastating consequences with neurologic complications varying from mild behavioral deficits to severe seizure, intellectual disability, and/or cerebral palsy in the newborn. Despite medical advances, the only viable option is therapeutic hypothermia which is classified as the gold standard but is not used, or may not be as effective in preterm cases, infection-associated cases or low resource settings. Therefore, alternatives or adjunct therapies are urgently needed. Ongoing research continues to advance our understanding of the mechanisms contributing to perinatal brain injury and identify new targets and treatments. Drugs used for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have demonstrated neuroprotective properties and therapeutic efficacy from neurological sequelae following HIE insults in preclinical models, both alone, or in combination with induced hypothermia. In this short review, we have focused on recent findings on the use of diabetes drugs that provide a neuroprotective effect using in vitro and in vivo models of HIE that could be considered for clinical translation as a promising treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Effectiveness and Safety of Acupuncture for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00098</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00098</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The effects of acupuncture on Alzheimer's disease (AD) outcomes remain controversial. The aim of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Chinese BioMedical Literature Database, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Data were searched to identify relevant randomized controlled trials from inception to January 19, 2019. Data were extracted and evaluated by two authors independently. The data analysis was conducted using R (version 3.6.0) and RStudio (version 1.2.1335) software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Thirty trials involving 2,045 patients were included. Acupuncture plus drug therapy may have been more beneficial for general cognitive function in AD patients than drug therapy alone (short-term treatment: MD, mean difference = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.11, 2.77; p &amp;lt; 0.01; medium-term treatment: MD = 4.41, 95% CI: 1.83, 7.00; p &amp;lt; 0.01). People who received acupuncture plus drug therapy attained higher ADL (Activities of Daily Living) scores than patients who received drug therapy alone for medium-term treatment duration (MD = −2.14; 95% CI: −3.69, −0.59; p &amp;lt; 0.01). However, there is no statistically significant difference in subgroup effect on MMSE (Mini-mental Status Examination) and ADLs (p &amp;gt; 0.05) when comparing acupuncture treatment with drug therapy (such as Donepezil hydrochloride, Nimodipine, or Yizhijiannao), or acupuncture plus drug therapy (such as Donepezil hydrochloride, Dangguishaoyaosan, or Jiannaosan) with drug therapy alone. There was also no significant difference in general cognitive function, ADLs, or incidence of adverse events between acupuncture treatment and drug therapy (p &amp;gt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This review indicates that acupuncture plus drug therapy may have a more beneficial effect for AD patients than drug therapy alone on general cognitive function in the short and medium term and on ADLs in the medium term. Acupuncture alone may not have superior effects compared with drug therapy on global cognitive function, ADLs, and incidence of adverse events. Duration of treatment may not modify the effect of acupuncture in comparison with drug therapy. Additional large-scale and high-quality clinical trials are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
