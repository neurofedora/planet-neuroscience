	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A thermodynamically consistent model of the post-translational Kai circadian clock</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Joris Paijmans, David K. Lubensky, Pieter Rein ten Wolde&lt;/p&gt;

The principal pacemaker of the circadian clock of the cyanobacterium &lt;i&gt;S. elongatus&lt;/i&gt; is a protein phosphorylation cycle consisting of three proteins, KaiA, KaiB and KaiC. KaiC forms a homohexamer, with each monomer consisting of two domains, CI and CII. Both domains can bind and hydrolyze ATP, but only the CII domain can be phosphorylated, at two residues, in a well-defined sequence. While this system has been studied extensively, how the clock is driven thermodynamically has remained elusive. Inspired by recent experimental observations and building on ideas from previous mathematical models, we present a new, thermodynamically consistent, statistical-mechanical model of the clock. At its heart are two main ideas: &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;) ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain provides the thermodynamic driving force for the clock, switching KaiC between an active conformational state in which its phosphorylation level tends to rise and an inactive one in which it tends to fall; &lt;i&gt;ii&lt;/i&gt;) phosphorylation of the CII domain provides the timer for the hydrolysis in the CI domain. The model also naturally explains how KaiA, by acting as a nucleotide exchange factor, can stimulate phosphorylation of KaiC, and how the differential affinity of KaiA for the different KaiC phosphoforms generates the characteristic temporal order of KaiC phosphorylation. As the phosphorylation level in the CII domain rises, the release of ADP from CI slows down, making the inactive conformational state of KaiC more stable. In the inactive state, KaiC binds KaiB, which not only stabilizes this state further, but also leads to the sequestration of KaiA, and hence to KaiC dephosphorylation. Using a dedicated kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm, which makes it possible to efficiently simulate this system consisting of more than a billion reactions, we show that the model can describe a wealth of experimental data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JMQbiPXARbg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Amygdalar Gating of Early Sensory Processing through Interactions with Locus Coeruleus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/11/3085?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fear- and stress-induced activity in the amygdala has been hypothesized to influence sensory brain regions through the influence of the amygdala on neuromodulatory centers. To directly examine this relationship, we used optical imaging to observe odor-evoked activity in populations of olfactory bulb inhibitory interneurons and of synaptic terminals of olfactory sensory neurons (the primary sensory neurons of the olfactory system, which provide the initial olfactory input to the brain) during pharmacological inactivation of amygdala and locus coeruleus (LC) in mice. Although the amygdala does not directly project to the olfactory bulb, joint pharmacological inactivation of the central, basolateral, and lateral nuclei of the amygdala nonetheless strongly suppressed odor-evoked activity in GABAergic inhibitory interneuron populations in the OB. This suppression was prevented by inactivation of LC or pretreatment of the olfactory bulb with a broad-spectrum noradrenergic receptor antagonist. Visualization of synaptic output from olfactory sensory neuron terminals into the olfactory bulb of the brain revealed that amygdalar inactivation preferentially strengthened the odor-evoked synaptic output of weakly activated populations of sensory afferents from the nose, thus demonstrating a change in sensory gating potentially mediated by local inhibition of olfactory sensory neuron terminals. We conclude that amygdalar activity influences olfactory processing as early as the primary sensory input to the brain by modulating norepinephrine release from the locus coeruleus into the olfactory bulb. These findings show that the amygdala and LC state actively determines which sensory signals are selected for processing in sensory brain regions. Similar local circuitry operates in the olfactory, visual, and auditory systems, suggesting a potentially shared mechanism across modalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The affective state is increasingly understood to influence early neural processing of sensory stimuli, not just the behavioral response to those stimuli. The present study elucidates one circuit by which the amygdala, a critical structure for emotional learning, valence coding, and stress, can shape sensory input to the brain and early sensory processing through its connections to the locus coeruleus. One function of this interaction appears to be sensory gating, because inactivating the central, basolateral, and lateral nuclei of the amygdala selectively strengthened the weakest olfactory inputs to the brain. This linkage of amygdalar and LC output to primary sensory signaling may have implications for affective disorders that include sensory dysfunctions like hypervigilance, attentional bias, and impaired sensory gating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distinct Effects of miR-210 Reduction on Neurogenesis: Increased Neuronal Survival of Inflammation But Reduced Proliferation Associated with Mitochondrial Enhancement</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/11/3072?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurogenesis is essential to brain development and plays a central role in the response to brain injury. Stroke and head trauma stimulate proliferation of endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs); however, the survival of young neurons is sharply reduced by postinjury inflammation. Cellular mitochondria are critical to successful neurogenesis and are a major target of inflammatory injury. Mitochondrial protection was shown to improve survival of young neurons. This study tested whether reducing cellular microRNA-210 (miR-210) would enhance mitochondrial function and improve survival of young murine neurons under inflammatory conditions. Several studies have demonstrated the potential of miR-210 inhibition to enhance and protect mitochondrial function through upregulation of mitochondrial proteins. Here, miR-210 inhibition significantly increased neuronal survival and protected the activity of mitochondrial enzymes cytochrome &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; oxidase and aconitase in differentiating NSC cultures exposed to inflammatory mediators. Unexpectedly, we found that reducing miR-210 significantly attenuated NSC proliferation upon induction of differentiation. Further investigation revealed that increased mitochondrial function suppressed the shift to primarily glycolytic metabolism and reduced mitochondrial length characteristic of dividing cells. Activation of AMP-regulated protein kinase–retinoblastoma signaling is important in NSC proliferation and the reduction of this activation observed by miR-210 inhibition is one mechanism contributing to the reduced proliferation. Postinjury neurogenesis occurs as a burst of proliferation that peaks in days, followed by migration and differentiation over weeks. Our studies suggest that mitochondrial protective miR-210 inhibition should be delayed until after the initial burst of proliferation, but could be beneficial during the prolonged differentiation stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Increasing the success of endogenous neurogenesis after brain injury holds therapeutic promise. Postinjury inflammation markedly reduces newborn neuron survival. This study found that enhancement of mitochondrial function by reducing microRNA-210 (miR-210) levels could improve survival of young neurons under inflammatory conditions. miR-210 inhibition protected the activity of mitochondrial enzymes cytochrome &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; oxidase and aconitase. Conversely, we observed decreased precursor cell proliferation likely due to suppression of the AMP-regulated protein kinase–retinoblastoma axis with miR-210 inhibition. Therefore, mitochondrial protection is a double-edged sword: early inhibition reduces proliferation, but inhibition later significantly increases neuroblast survival. This explains in part the contradictory published reports of the effects of miR-210 on neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Representations of Observed Actions Generalize across Static and Dynamic Visual Input</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/11/3056?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;People interact with entities in the environment in distinct and categorizable ways (e.g., &lt;i&gt;kicking&lt;/i&gt; is &lt;i&gt;making contact with foot&lt;/i&gt;). We can recognize these action categories across variations in actors, objects, and settings; moreover, we can recognize them from both dynamic and static visual input. However, the neural systems that support action recognition across these perceptual differences are unclear. Here, we used multivoxel pattern analysis of fMRI data to identify brain regions that support visual action categorization in a format-independent way. Human participants were scanned while viewing eight categories of interactions (e.g., &lt;i&gt;pulling&lt;/i&gt;) depicted in two visual formats: (1) visually controlled videos of two interacting actors and (2) visually varied photographs selected from the internet involving different actors, objects, and settings. Action category was decodable across visual formats in bilateral inferior parietal, bilateral occipitotemporal, left premotor, and left middle frontal cortex. In most of these regions, the representational similarity of action categories was consistent across subjects and visual formats, a property that can contribute to a common understanding of actions among individuals. These results suggest that the identified brain regions support action category codes that are important for action recognition and action understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Humans tend to interpret the observed actions of others in terms of categories that are invariant to incidental features: whether a girl pushes a boy or a button and whether we see it in real-time or in a single snapshot, it is still &lt;i&gt;pushing&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we investigated the brain systems that facilitate the visual recognition of these action categories across such differences. Using fMRI, we identified several areas of parietal, occipitotemporal, and frontal cortex that exhibit action category codes that are similar across viewing of dynamic videos and still photographs. Our results provide strong evidence for the involvement of these brain regions in recognizing the way that people interact physically with objects and other people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neurocomputational Consequences of Evolutionary Connectivity Changes in Perisylvian Language Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/11/3045?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain sets itself apart from that of its primate relatives by specific neuroanatomical features, especially the strong linkage of left perisylvian language areas (frontal and temporal cortex) by way of the arcuate fasciculus (AF). AF connectivity has been shown to correlate with verbal working memory—a specifically human trait providing the foundation for language abilities—but a mechanistic explanation of any related causal link between anatomical structure and cognitive function is still missing. Here, we provide a possible explanation and link, by using neurocomputational simulations in neuroanatomically structured models of the perisylvian language cortex. We compare networks mimicking key features of cortical connectivity in monkeys and humans, specifically the presence of relatively stronger higher-order &quot;jumping links&quot; between nonadjacent perisylvian cortical areas in the latter, and demonstrate that the emergence of working memory for syllables and word forms is a functional consequence of this structural evolutionary change. We also show that a mere increase of learning time is not sufficient, but that this specific structural feature, which entails higher connectivity degree of relevant areas and shorter sensorimotor path length, is crucial. These results offer a better understanding of specifically human anatomical features underlying the language faculty and their evolutionary selection advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Why do humans have superior language abilities compared to primates? Recently, a uniquely human neuroanatomical feature has been demonstrated in the strength of the arcuate fasciculus (AF), a fiber pathway interlinking the left-hemispheric language areas. Although AF anatomy has been related to linguistic skills, an explanation of how this fiber bundle may support language abilities is still missing. We use neuroanatomically structured computational models to investigate the consequences of evolutionary changes in language area connectivity and demonstrate that the human-specific higher connectivity degree and comparatively shorter sensorimotor path length implicated by the AF entail emergence of verbal working memory, a prerequisite for language learning. These results offer a better understanding of specifically human anatomical features for language and their evolutionary selection advantage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Epac-Phospholipase C{varepsilon} Pathway Regulates Endocannabinoid Signaling and Cocaine-Induced Disinhibition of Ventral Tegmental Area Dopamine Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/11/3030?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac) is a direct effector for the ubiquitous second messenger cAMP. Epac activates the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway. PLCβ has been linked to the synthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Here, we report that Epac facilitates endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde synaptic depression through activation of PLC. Intracellular loading of a selective Epac agonist 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP into ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons enabled previously ineffective stimuli to induce depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) and long-term depression of IPSCs (I-LTD) in the VTA. DSI and I-LTD are mediated by 2-AG since they were blocked by a diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor. The effects of 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP on DSI and I-LTD were absent in Epac2 and PLC knock-out mice, but remained intact in Epac1 knock-out mice. These results identify a novel mechanism for on-demand synthesis of retrograde signaling 2-AG by the Epac2-PLC pathway. We investigated the functional significance of Epac2-PLC-2-AG signaling in regulating inhibitory synaptic plasticity in VTA dopamine neurons induced by &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; cocaine exposure. We showed that cocaine place conditioning led to a decrease in the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous IPSCs and an increase in action potential firing in wild-type mice, but not in Epac2 or PLC knock-out mice. Together, these results indicate that the Epac2-PLC-2-AG signaling cascade contributes to cocaine-induced disinhibition of VTA dopamine neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is an endogenous cannabinoid that depresses synaptic transmission through stimulation of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. Among the six isoforms of phospholipase C (PLC; PLCβ, PLC, PLC, PLC, PLC, PLC), only PLCβ has been linked to 2-AG synthesis. Here we demonstrate that 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP, a selective agonist of the cAMP sensor protein Epac, enhances 2-AG-mediated synaptic depression in ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons via activation of PLC. These results identify a novel mechanism for 2-AG synthesis via activation of the Epac-PLC pathway. Furthermore, we show that cocaine-induced conditioned place preference and disinhibition of VTA dopamine neurons were impaired in mice lacking Epac or PLC. Thus, the Epac-PLC signaling pathway contributes to cocaine-induced disinhibition of VTA dopamine neurons and formation of drug-associated memories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Paraventricular Thalamus Balances Danger and Reward</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/11/3018?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Foraging animals balance the need to seek food and energy against the accompanying dangers of injury and predation. To do so, they rely on learning systems encoding reward and danger. Whereas much is known about these separate learning systems, little is known about how they interact to shape and guide behavior. Here we show a key role for the rat paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), a nucleus of the dorsal midline thalamus, in this interaction. First, we show behavioral competition between reward and danger: the opportunity to seek food reward negatively modulates expression of species-typical defensive behavior. Then, using a chemogenetic approach expressing the inhibitory hM4Di designer receptor exclusively activated by a designer drug in PVT neurons, we show that the PVT is central to this behavioral competition. Chemogenetic PVT silencing biases behavior toward either defense or reward depending on the experimental conditions, but does not consistently favor expression of one over the other. This bias could not be attributed to changes in fear memory retrieval, learned safety, or memory interference. Rather, our results demonstrate that the PVT is essential for balancing conflicting behavioral tendencies toward danger and reward, enabling adaptive responding under this basic selection pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Among the most basic survival problems faced by animals is balancing the need to seek food and energy against the accompanying dangers of injury and predation. Although much is known about the brain mechanisms that underpin learning about reward and danger, little is known about how these interact to solve basic survival problems. Here we show competition between defensive (to avoid predatory detection) and approach (to obtain food) behavior. We show that the paraventricular thalamus, a nucleus of the dorsal midline thalamus, is integral to this behavioral competition. The paraventricular thalamus balances the competing behavioral demands of danger and reward, enabling adaptive responding under this selection pressure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Goal-Directed and Habit-Like Modulations of Stimulus Processing during Reinforcement Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/11/3009?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/11/3009?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent research has shown that perceptual processing of stimuli previously associated with high-value rewards is automatically prioritized even when rewards are no longer available. It has been hypothesized that such reward-related modulation of stimulus salience is conceptually similar to an &quot;attentional habit.&quot; Recording event-related potentials in humans during a reinforcement learning task, we show strong evidence in favor of this hypothesis. Resistance to outcome devaluation (the defining feature of a habit) was shown by the stimulus-locked P1 component, reflecting activity in the extrastriate visual cortex. Analysis at longer latencies revealed a positive component (corresponding to the P3b, from 550–700 ms) sensitive to outcome devaluation. Therefore, distinct spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity were observed corresponding to habitual and goal-directed processes. These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning engages both attentional habits and goal-directed processes in parallel. Consequences for brain and computational models of reinforcement learning are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The human attentional network adapts to detect stimuli that predict important rewards. A recent hypothesis suggests that the visual cortex automatically prioritizes reward-related stimuli, driven by cached representations of reward value; that is, stimulus–response habits. Alternatively, the neural system may track the current value of the predicted outcome. Our results demonstrate for the first time that visual cortex activity is increased for reward-related stimuli even when the rewarding event is temporarily devalued. In contrast, longer-latency brain activity was specifically sensitive to transient changes in reward value. Therefore, we show that both habit-like attention and goal-directed processes occur in the same learning episode at different latencies. This result has important consequences for computational models of reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Optogenetic Low-Frequency Stimulation of Specific Neuronal Populations Abates Ictogenesis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite many advances made in understanding the pathophysiology of epileptic disorders, seizures remain poorly controlled in approximately one-third of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Here, we established the efficacy of cell type-specific low-frequency stimulation (LFS) in controlling ictogenesis in the mouse entorhinal cortex (EC) in an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; brain slice preparation. Specifically, we used 1 Hz optogenetic stimulation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-positive principal cells as well as of parvalbumin- or somatostatin-positive interneurons to study the effects of such repetitive activation on epileptiform discharges induced by 4-aminopyridine. We found that 1 Hz stimulation of any of these cell types reduced the frequency and duration of ictal discharges in some trials, while completely blocking them in others. The field responses evoked by the stimulation of each cell type revealed that their duration and amplitude were higher when principal cells were targeted. Furthermore, following a short period of silence ranging from 67 to 135 s, ictal discharges were re-established with similar duration and frequency as before stimulation; however, this period of silence was longer following principal cell stimulation compared with parvalbumin- or somatostatin-positive interneuron stimulation. Our results show that LFS of either excitatory or inhibitory cell networks in EC are effective in controlling ictogenesis. Although optogenetic stimulation of either cell type significantly reduced the occurrence of ictal discharges, principal cell stimulation resulted in a more prolonged suppression of ictogenesis, and, thus, it may constitute a better approach for controlling seizures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by an imbalance between excitation and inhibition leading to seizures. Many epileptic patients do not achieve adequate seizure control using antiepileptic drugs. Low-frequency stimulation (LFS) is an alternative tool for controlling epileptiform activity in these patients. However, despite the temporal and spatial control offered by LFS, such a procedure lacks cell specificity, which may limit its efficacy. Using an optogenetic approach, we report here that LFS of two interneuron subtypes and, even more so, of principal cells can reliably shorten or abolish seizures &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Our work suggests that targeted LFS may constitute a reliable means for controlling seizures in patients presenting with focal seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Transformed Neural Pattern Reinstatement during Episodic Memory Retrieval</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/11/2986?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/11/2986?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Contemporary models of episodic memory posit that remembering involves the reenactment of encoding processes. Although encoding-retrieval similarity has been consistently reported and linked to memory success, the nature of neural pattern reinstatement is poorly understood. Using high-resolution fMRI on human subjects, our results obtained clear evidence for item-specific pattern reinstatement in the frontoparietal cortex, even when the encoding-retrieval pairs shared no perceptual similarity. No item-specific pattern reinstatement was found in the ventral visual cortex. Importantly, the brain regions and voxels carrying item-specific representation differed significantly between encoding and retrieval, and the item specificity for encoding-retrieval similarity was smaller than that for encoding or retrieval, suggesting different nature of representations between encoding and retrieval. Moreover, cross-region representational similarity analysis suggests that the encoded representation in the ventral visual cortex was reinstated in the frontoparietal cortex during retrieval. Together, these results suggest that, in addition to reinstatement of the originally encoded pattern in the brain regions that perform encoding processes, retrieval may also involve the reinstatement of a transformed representation of the encoded information. These results emphasize the constructive nature of memory retrieval that helps to serve important adaptive functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Episodic memory enables humans to vividly reexperience past events, yet how this is achieved at the neural level is barely understood. A long-standing hypothesis posits that memory retrieval involves the faithful reinstatement of encoding-related activity. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the neural representations during encoding and retrieval. We found strong pattern reinstatement in the frontoparietal cortex, but not in the ventral visual cortex, that represents visual details. Critically, even within the same brain regions, the nature of representation during retrieval was qualitatively different from that during encoding. These results suggest that memory retrieval is not a faithful replay of past event but rather involves additional constructive processes to serve adaptive functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A brain network comprising the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and amygdala plays important roles in developmentally regulated cognitive and emotional processes. However, very little is known about the maturation of mPFC-amygdala circuitry. We conducted anatomical tracing of mPFC projections and optogenetic interrogation of their synaptic connections with neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) at neonatal to adult developmental stages in mice. Results indicate that mPFC-BLA projections exhibit delayed emergence relative to other mPFC pathways and establish synaptic transmission with BLA excitatory and inhibitory neurons in late infancy, events that coincide with a massive increase in overall synaptic drive. During subsequent adolescence, mPFC-BLA circuits are further modified by excitatory synaptic strengthening as well as a transient surge in feedforward inhibition. The latter was correlated with increased spontaneous inhibitory currents in excitatory neurons, suggesting that mPFC-BLA circuit maturation culminates in a period of exuberant GABAergic transmission. These findings establish a time course for the onset and refinement of mPFC-BLA transmission and point to potential sensitive periods in the development of this critical network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Human mPFC-amygdala functional connectivity is developmentally regulated and figures prominently in numerous psychiatric disorders with a high incidence of adolescent onset. However, it remains unclear when synaptic connections between these structures emerge or how their properties change with age. Our work establishes developmental windows and cellular substrates for synapse maturation in this pathway involving both excitatory and inhibitory circuits. The engagement of these substrates by early life experience may support the ontogeny of fundamental behaviors but could also lead to inappropriate circuit refinement and psychopathology in adverse situations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Different CaV1.3 Channel Isoforms Control Distinct Components of the Synaptic Vesicle Cycle in Auditory Inner Hair Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/11/2960?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms orchestrating transient and sustained exocytosis in auditory inner hair cells (IHCs) remain largely unknown. These exocytotic responses are believed to mobilize sequentially a readily releasable pool of vesicles (RRP) underneath the synaptic ribbons and a slowly releasable pool of vesicles (SRP) at farther distance from them. They are both governed by Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 channels and require otoferlin as Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor, but whether they use the same Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 isoforms is still unknown. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in posthearing mice, we show that only a proportion (~25%) of the total Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current in IHCs displaying fast inactivation and resistance to 20 μm nifedipine, a l-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel blocker, is sufficient to trigger RRP but not SRP exocytosis. This Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current is likely conducted by short C-terminal isoforms of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 channels, notably Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3&lt;sub&gt;42A&lt;/sub&gt; and Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3&lt;sub&gt;43S&lt;/sub&gt;, because their mRNA is highly expressed in wild-type IHCs but poorly expressed in &lt;i&gt;Otof&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; IHCs, the latter having Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; currents with considerably reduced inactivation. Nifedipine-resistant RRP exocytosis was poorly affected by 5 mm intracellular EGTA, suggesting that the Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 short isoforms are closely associated with the release site at the synaptic ribbons. Conversely, our results suggest that Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 long isoforms, which carry ~75% of the total IHC Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current with slow inactivation and confer high sensitivity to nifedipine and to internal EGTA, are essentially involved in recruiting SRP vesicles. Intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging showed that Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 long isoforms support a deep intracellular diffusion of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Auditory inner hair cells (IHCs) encode sounds into nerve impulses through fast and indefatigable Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent exocytosis at their ribbon synapses. We show that this synaptic process involves long and short C-terminal isoforms of the Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel that differ in the kinetics of their Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent inactivation and their relative sensitivity to the l-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel blocker nifedipine. The short C-terminal isoforms, having fast inactivation and low sensitivity to nifedipine, mainly control the fast fusion of the readily releasable pool (RRP); that is, they encode the phasic exocytotic component. The long isoforms, with slow inactivation and great sensitivity to nifedipine, mainly regulate the vesicular replenishment of the RRP; that is, the sustained or tonic exocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Unresponsive Choline Transporter as a Trait Neuromarker and a Causal Mediator of Bottom-Up Attentional Biases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/11/2947?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/11/2947?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Some rats [sign-trackers (STs)] are prone to attribute incentive salience to reward cues, which can manifest as a propensity to approach and contact pavlovian cues, and for addiction-like behavior. STs also exhibit poor attentional performance, relative to goal-trackers (GTs), which is associated with attenuated acetylcholine (ACh) levels in prefrontal cortex (Paolone et al., 2013). Here, we demonstrate a cellular mechanism, linked to ACh synthesis, that accounts for attenuated cholinergic capacity in STs. First, we found that electrical stimulation of the basal forebrain increased cortical choline transporter (CHT)-mediated choline transport in GTs, paralleled by a redistribution of CHTs to the synaptic plasma membrane. Neither increases in choline uptake nor translocation of CHTs occurred in STs. Second, and consistent with uptake/translocation alterations, STs demonstrated a reduced ability to support cortical ACh release &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; compared with GTs after reverse-dialysis to elevate extracellular potassium levels. Third, rats were significantly more likely to develop sign-tracking behavior if treated systemically before pavlovian conditioned approach training with the CHT inhibitor VU6001221. Consistent with its proposed mechanisms, administration of VU6001221 attenuated potassium-evoked ACh levels in prefrontal cortex measured with &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microdialysis. We propose that loss of CHT-dependent activation of cortical cholinergic activity in STs degrades top-down executive control over behavior, producing a bias for bottom-up or stimulus-driven attention. Such an attentional bias contributes to nonadaptive reward processing and thus identifies a novel mechanism that can support psychopathology, including addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The vulnerability for addiction-like behavior has been associated with psychological traits, such as the propensity to attribute incentive salience to reward cues that is modeled in rats by sign-tracking behavior. Sign-trackers tend to approach and contact cues associated with reward, whereas their counterparts, the goal-trackers, have a preference for approaching the location of the reward. Here, we show that the capacity of presynaptic cholinergic synapses to respond to stimulation by elevating presynaptic choline uptake and releasing acetylcholine is attenuated in sign-trackers. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of choline transport induced sign-tracking behavior. Our findings suggest that reduced levels of cholinergic neuromodulation can mediate an attentional bias toward reward-related cues, thereby allowing such cues to exert relatively greater control over behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Signaling by FGF Receptor 2, Not FGF Receptor 1, Regulates Myelin Thickness through Activation of ERK1/2-MAPK, Which Promotes mTORC1 Activity in an Akt-Independent Manner</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/11/2931?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/11/2931?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;FGF signaling has emerged as a significant &quot;late-stage&quot; regulator of myelin thickness in the CNS, independent of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Therefore, it is critically important to identify the specific FGF receptor type and its downstream signaling molecules in oligodendrocytes to obtain better insights into the regulatory mechanisms of myelin growth. Here, we show that FGF receptor type 2 (FGFR2) is highly enriched at the paranodal loops of myelin. Conditional ablation of this receptor-type, but not FGF receptor type 1 (FGFR1), resulted in attenuation of myelin growth, expression of major myelin genes, key transcription factor Myrf and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) activity. This was rescued by upregulating ERK1/2 activity in these mice, strongly suggesting that ERK1/2 are key transducers of FGFR2 signals for myelin growth. However, given that the PI3K/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is also known to regulate myelin thickness, we examined FGFR2-deficient mice for the expression of key signaling molecules in this pathway. A significant downregulation of p-mTOR, p-Raptor, and p-S6RP was observed, which was restored to normal by elevating ERK1/2 activity in these mice. Similar downregulation of these molecules was observed in ERK1/2 knock-out mice. Interestingly, since p-Akt levels remained largely unchanged in these mice, it suggests a mechanism of mTORC1 activation by ERK1/2 in an Akt-independent manner in oligodendrocytes. Taken together, these data support a model in which FGFs, possibly from axons, activate FGFR2 in the oligodendrocyte/myelin compartment to increase ERK1/2 activation, which ultimately targets Myrf, as well as converges with the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway at the level of mTORC1, working together to drive the growth of the myelin sheath, thus increasing myelin thickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It is well accepted that myelin is a biologically active membrane in active communication with the axons. However, the axonal signals, the receptors on myelin, and the integration of intracellular signaling pathways emanating downstream from these receptors that drive the growth of the myelin sheath remain poorly understood in the CNS. This study brings up the intriguing possibility that FGF receptor 2, in the oligodendrocyte/myelin compartment, may be one such signal. Importantly, it provides compelling evidence linking FGFR2 with the ERK1/2–MAPK pathway, which converges with the PI3K/Akt/mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) pathway at the level of mTORC1 and also regulates the transcription factor Myrf, together providing a mechanistic framework for regulating both the transcriptional and translational machinery required for the proper growth of the myelin sheath.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: An Agonist of the Protective Factor SIRT1 Improves Functional Recovery and Promotes Neuronal Survival by Attenuating Inflammation after Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/11/2916?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Targeting posttraumatic inflammation is crucial for improving locomotor function. SIRT1 has been shown to play a critical role in disease processes such as hepatic inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, and acute lung inflammation by regulating inflammation. However, the role of SIRT1 in spinal cord injury (SCI) is unknown. We hypothesized that SIRT1 plays an important role in improving locomotor function after SCI by regulating neuroinflammation. In this study, we investigate the effect of SIRT1 in SCI using pharmacological intervention (SRT1720) and the Mx1-Cre/loxP recombination system to knock out target genes. First, we found that SIRT1 expression at the injured lesion site of wild-type (WT) mice (C57BL/6) decreased 4 h after SCI and lasted for 3 d. Moreover, administration of SRT1720, an agonist of SIRT1, to WT mice significantly improved functional recovery for up to 28 d after injury by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, the number of M1 macrophages, the number of macrophages/microglia, and the accumulation of perivascular macrophages. In contrast, administration of SRT1720 to SIRT1 knock-out (KO) mice did not improve locomotor recovery or attenuate inflammation. Furthermore, SIRT1 KO mice exhibited worse locomotor recovery, increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, and more M1 macrophages and perivascular macrophages than those of WT mice after SCI. Together, these findings indicate that SRT1720, an SIRT1 agonist, can improve functional recovery by attenuating inflammation after SCI. Therefore, SIRT1 is not only a protective factor but also an anti-inflammatory molecule that exerts beneficial effects on locomotor function after SCI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Posttraumatic inflammation plays a central role in regulating the pathogenesis of spinal cord injury (SCI). Here, new data show that administration of SRT1720, an SIRT1 agonist, to wild-type (WT) mice significantly improved outcomes after SCI, most likely by reducing the levels of inflammatory cytokines, the number of macrophages/microglia, perivascular macrophages, and M1 macrophages. In contrast, SIRT1 KO mice exhibited worse locomotor recovery than that of WT mice due to aggravated inflammation. Taken together, the results of this study expand upon the previous understanding of the functions and mechanisms of SIRT1 in neuroinflammation following injury to the CNS, suggesting that SIRT1 plays a critical role in regulating neuroinflammation following CNS injury and may be a novel therapeutic target for post-SCI intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cortical Spreading Depression Closes Paravascular Space and Impairs Glymphatic Flow: Implications for Migraine Headache</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/11/2904?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/11/2904?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functioning of the glymphatic system, a network of paravascular tunnels through which cortical interstitial solutes are cleared from the brain, has recently been linked to sleep and traumatic brain injury, both of which can affect the progression of migraine. This led us to investigate the connection between migraine and the glymphatic system. Taking advantage of a novel &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; method we developed using two-photon microscopy to visualize the paravascular space (PVS) in naive uninjected mice, we show that a single wave of cortical spreading depression (CSD), an animal model of migraine aura, induces a rapid and nearly complete closure of the PVS around surface as well as penetrating cortical arteries and veins lasting several minutes, and gradually recovering over 30 min. A temporal mismatch between the constriction or dilation of the blood vessel lumen and the closure of the PVS suggests that this closure is not likely to result from changes in vessel diameter. We also show that CSD impairs glymphatic flow, as indicated by the reduced rate at which intraparenchymally injected dye was cleared from the cortex to the PVS. This is the first observation of a PVS closure in connection with an abnormal cortical event that underlies a neurological disorder. More specifically, the findings demonstrate a link between the glymphatic system and migraine, and suggest a novel mechanism for regulation of glymphatic flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Impairment of brain solute clearance through the recently described glymphatic system has been linked with traumatic brain injury, prolonged wakefulness, and aging. This paper shows that cortical spreading depression, the neural correlate of migraine aura, closes the paravascular space and impairs glymphatic flow. This closure holds the potential to define a novel mechanism for regulation of glymphatic flow. It also implicates the glymphatic system in the altered cortical and endothelial functioning of the migraine brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Error-Induced Blindness: Error Detection Leads to Impaired Sensory Processing and Lower Accuracy at Short Response-Stimulus Intervals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/11/2895?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Empirical evidence indicates that detecting one's own mistakes can serve as a signal to improve task performance. However, little work has focused on how task constraints, such as the response–stimulus interval (RSI), influence post-error adjustments. In the present study, event-related potential (ERP) and behavioral measures were used to investigate the time course of error-related processing while humans performed a difficult visual discrimination task. We found that error commission resulted in a marked reduction in both task performance and sensory processing on the following trial when RSIs were short, but that such impairments were not detectable at longer RSIs. Critically, diminished sensory processing at short RSIs, indexed by the stimulus-evoked P1 component, was predicted by an ERP measure of error processing, the Pe component. A control analysis ruled out a general lapse in attention or mind wandering as being predictive of subsequent reductions in sensory processing; instead, the data suggest that error detection causes an attentional bottleneck, which can diminish sensory processing on subsequent trials that occur in short succession. The findings demonstrate that the neural system dedicated to monitoring and improving behavior can, paradoxically, at times be the source of performance failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The performance-monitoring system is a network of brain regions dedicated to monitoring behavior to adjust task performance when necessary. Previous research has demonstrated that activation of the performance monitoring system following incorrect decisions serves to improve future task performance. However, the present study provides evidence that, when perceptual decisions must be made rapidly (within approximately half a second of each other), activation of the performance-monitoring system is predictive of impaired task-related attention on the subsequent trial. The data illustrate that the cognitive demands imposed by error processing can interfere with, rather than enhance, task-related attention when subsequent decisions need to be made quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Astrocytic Orosomucoid-2 Modulates Microglial Activation and Neuroinflammation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/11/2878?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/11/2878?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Orosomucoid (ORM) is an acute-phase protein that belongs to the immunocalin subfamily, a group of small-molecule-binding proteins with immunomodulatory functions. Little is known about the role of ORM proteins in the CNS. The aim of the present study was to investigate the brain expression of ORM and its role in neuroinflammation. Expression of Orm2, but not Orm1 or Orm3, was highly induced in the mouse brain after systemic injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Plasma levels of ORM2 were also significantly higher in patients with cognitive impairment than in normal subjects. RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that astrocytes are the major cellular sources of ORM2 in the inflamed mouse brain. Recombinant ORM2 protein treatment decreased microglial production of proinflammatory mediators and reduced microglia-mediated neurotoxicity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. LPS-induced microglial activation, proinflammatory cytokines in hippocampus, and neuroinflammation-associated cognitive deficits also decreased as a result of intracerebroventricular injection of recombinant ORM2 protein &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, lentiviral shRNA-mediated Orm2 knockdown enhanced LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine gene expression and microglial activation in the hippocampus. Mechanistically, ORM2 inhibited C-C chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4)-induced microglial migration and activation by blocking the interaction of CCL4 with C-C chemokine receptor type 5. Together, the results from our cultured glial cells, mouse neuroinflammation model, and patient studies suggest that ORM2 is a novel mediator of astrocyte–microglial interaction. We also report that ORM2 exerts anti-inflammatory effects by modulating microglial activation and migration during brain inflammation. ORM2 can be exploited therapeutically for the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neural cell interactions are important for brain physiology and pathology. Particularly, the interaction between non-neuronal cells plays a central role in regulating brain inflammation, which is closely linked to many brain disorders. Here, we newly identified orosomucoid-2 (ORM2) as an endogenous protein that mediates such non-neuronal glial cell interactions. Based on the critical role of astrocyte-derived ORM2 in modulating microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, ORM2 can be exploited for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of devastating brain disorders that have a strong neuroinflammatory component, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Electroencephalography (EEG) has been instrumental in making discoveries about cognition, brain function, and dysfunction. However, where do EEG signals come from and what do they mean? The purpose of this paper is to argue that we know shockingly little about the answer to this question, to highlight what we do know, how important the answers are, and how modern neuroscience technologies that allow us to measure and manipulate neural circuits with high spatiotemporal accuracy might finally bring us some answers.</description>

	<description>Supported by recent human neuroimaging studies, the insula is re-emerging as an important brain area not only in the physiological understanding of the brain, but also in pathological contexts in clinical research. In this opinion article, we briefly introduce the anatomical and histological features of the human insula. We then summarize the physiological functions of the insula and underscore its pathological roles in psychiatric and neurological disorders that have long been underestimated. We finally propose possible strategies through which the role of the insula may be further understood for both basic and clinical neuroscience.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Category-Selective Human Brain Processes Elicited In Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation Streams Are Immune To Temporal Predictability</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/117135v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Recording direct neural activity when periodically inserting exemplars of a particular category in a rapid visual stream of other objects offers an objective and efficient way to quantify perceptual categorization and characterize its spatiotemporal dynamics. However, since periodicity entails predictability, perceptual categorization processes identified within this framework may be partly generated or modulated by temporal expectations. Here we present a stringent test of the hypothesis that temporal predictability generates or modulates category-selective neural processes. In Experiment 1, we compare neurophysiological responses to periodic and nonperiodic (i.e., unpredictable) variable face stimuli in a fast (12 Hz) visual stream of nonface objects. In Experiment 2, we assess potential responses to rare (10%) omissions of periodic face events (i.e., violations of periodicity) in the same fast visual stream. Overall, our observations indicate that long duration category(face)-selective processes elicited in a fast periodic stream of visual objects are immune to temporal predictability. These observations do not support a predictive coding framework interpretation of category-change detection in the human brain and have important implications for understanding human perceptual categorization in a rapidly changing (i.e., dynamic) visual scene.</description>

	<description>Nervous systems use excitatory cell assemblies or &quot;perceptual engrams&quot; to encode and represent sensory percepts. Similarly, synaptically connected cell assemblies or &quot;memory engrams&quot; are thought to represent memories of past experience. Multiple lines of recent evidence indicate that brain systems also create inhibitory replicas of excitatory engrams with important cognitive functions. Such matched inhibitory engrams may form through homeostatic potentiation of inhibition onto postsynaptic cells that show increased levels of excitation. Inhibitory engrams can reduce behavioral responses to familiar stimuli thereby resulting in behavioral habituation. In addition, by preventing inappropriate activation of excitatory memory engrams, inhibitory engrams can make memories quiescent, stored in a latent form that is available for context-relevant activation. In neural networks with balanced excitatory and inhibitory engrams, the release of innate responses and recall of associative memories can occur through focussed disinhibition. Understanding mechanisms that regulate the formation and expression of inhibitory engrams in vivo may help not only to explain key features of cognition, but also to provide insight into transdiagnostic traits associated with psychiatric conditions such as autism, schizophrenia and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neuron Density Is A Fundamental Determinant Of Structural Connectivity In The Primate Cerebral Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/117051v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/117051v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Studies of structural brain connectivity have revealed many intriguing features of complex cortical networks. To advance integrative theories of cortical organisation, an understanding of how connectivity interrelates with other aspects of brain architecture is required. Recent studies have suggested that interareal connectivity may be related to macroscopic as well as microscopic features of cortical areas. However, it is unclear how these features are inter-dependent and which most strongly and closely relate to structural corticocortical connectivity. Here, we systematically investigated the relation of many microscopic and macroscopic architectonic features of cortical organization to cortical connectivity, using a comprehensive, up-to-date structural connectome of the primate brain. Importantly, relationships were investigated by multi-variate analyses to account for the interrelations of features. Of all considered factors, the classical architectonic parameter of neuron density was most strongly and consistently related to cortical connectivity, and in conjoint analyses largely abolished effects of other features. These results reveal neuron density as a central architectonic factor of the primate cerebral cortex that is closely related to essential aspects of brain connectivity and which determines further features of the architectonic organization of cortical areas. Our findings integrate several aspects of cortical organization, with implications for cortical development and function.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Human Episodic Memory Retrieval Is Accompanied By A Neural Jump Back In Time</title>

	<description>Cognitive psychologists have long hypothesized that experiences are encoded in a temporal context that changes gradually over time. When an episodic memory is retrieved, the state of context is recovered: a jump back in time. We recorded from single units in the MTL of epilepsy patients performing an item recognition task. The population vector changed gradually over minutes during presentation of the list. When a probe from the list was recollected, the population vector reset to the neighborhood of the original presentation of that probe during study: a neural &quot;jump back in time&quot;. Probes that were not recollected did not cause a jump back in time. These results constitute the first direct evidence that recollection of an episodic memory in humans is associated with recovery of a gradually-changing state of temporal context: a neural &quot;jump-back-in-time&quot; that parallels the act of remembering.</description>

	<description>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a well-established magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique used for studying microstructural changes in the white matter. As with many other imaging modalities, DTI images suffer from technical between-scanner variation that hinders comparisons of images across imaging sites, scanners and over time. Using fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps of 205 healthy participants acquired on two different scanners, we show that the DTI measurements are highly site-specific, highlighting the need of correcting for site effects before performing downstream statistical analyses. We first show evidence that combining DTI data from multiple sites, without harmonization, is counter-productive and negatively impacts the inference. Then, we propose and compare several harmonization approaches for DTI data, and show that ComBat, a popular batch-effect correction tool used in genomics, performs best at modeling and removing the unwanted inter-site variability in FA and MD maps. Using age as a biological phenotype of interest, we show that ComBat both preserves biological variability and removes the unwanted variation introduced by site. Finally, we assess the different harmonization methods in the presence of different levels of confounding between site and age, in addition to test robustness to small sample size studies.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Fast online deconvolution of calcium imaging data</title>

Fluorescent calcium indicators are a popular means for observing the spiking activity of large neuronal populations, but extracting the activity of each neuron from raw fluorescence calcium imaging data is a nontrivial problem. We present a fast online active set method to solve this sparse non-negative deconvolution problem. Importantly, the algorithm progresses through each time series sequentially from beginning to end, thus enabling real-time online estimation of neural activity during the imaging session. Our algorithm is a generalization of the pool adjacent violators algorithm (PAVA) for isotonic regression and inherits its linear-time computational complexity. We gain remarkable increases in processing speed: more than one order of magnitude compared to currently employed state of the art convex solvers relying on interior point methods. Unlike these approaches, our method can exploit warm starts; therefore optimizing model hyperparameters only requires a handful of passes through the data. A minor modification can further improve the quality of activity inference by imposing a constraint on the minimum spike size. The algorithm enables real-time simultaneous deconvolution of &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;(10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) traces of whole-brain larval zebrafish imaging data on a laptop.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9oEZC9r7VZ4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>DNA lesion bypass is mediated by DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathways and homologous recombination (HR). The DDT pathways, which involve translesion synthesis and template switching (TS), are activated by the ubiquitylation (ub) of PCNA through components of the RAD6-RAD18 pathway, whereas the HR pathway is independent of RAD18. However, it...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/k-zS2Img3NU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the intact brain receive a continuous and irregular synaptic
bombardment from excitatory and inhibitory pre-synaptic neurons, which
determines the firing activity of the stimulated neuron. In order to
investigate the influence of inhibitory stimulation on the firing time
statistics, we consider Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons subject to inhibitory
instantaneous post-synaptic potentials. In particular, we report exact results
for the firing rate, the coefficient of variation and the spike train spectrum
for various synaptic weight distributions. Our results are not limited to
stimulations of infinitesimal amplitude, but they apply as well to finite
amplitude post-synaptic potentials, thus being able to capture the effect of
rare and large spikes. The developed methods are able to reproduce also the
average firing properties of heterogeneous neuronal populations.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has led to remarkable advances when applied to problems where
the data distribution does not change over the course of learning. In stark
contrast, biological neural networks continually adapt to changing domains, and
solve a diversity of tasks simultaneously. Furthermore, synapses in biological
neurons are not simply real-valued scalars, but possess complex molecular
machinery enabling non-trivial learning dynamics. In this study, we take a
first step toward bringing this biological complexity into artificial neural
networks. We introduce a model of intelligent synapses that accumulate task
relevant information over time, and exploit this information to efficiently
consolidate memories of old tasks to protect them from being overwritten as new
tasks are learned. We apply our framework to learning sequences of related
classification problems, and show that it dramatically reduces catastrophic
forgetting while maintaining computational efficiency.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We study the problem of optimal oculomotor control during the execution of
visual search tasks. We introduce a computational model of human eye movements,
which takes into account various constraints of the human visual and oculomotor
systems. In the model, the choice of the subsequent fixation location is posed
as a problem of stochastic optimal control, which relies on reinforcement
learning methods. We show that if biological constraints are taken into
account, the trajectories simulated under learned policy share both basic
statistical properties and scaling behaviour with human eye movements. We
validated our model simulations with human psychophysical eye-tracking
experiments

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous, synchronous bursting of neural population is a widely observed
phenomenon in nervous networks, which is considered important for functions and
dysfunctions of the brain. However, how the global synchrony across a large
number of neurons emerges from an initially non-bursting network state is not
fully understood. In this study, we develop a new state-space reconstruction
method combined with high-resolution recordings of cultured neurons. This
method extracts deterministic signatures of upcoming global bursts in &quot;local&quot;
dynamics of individual neurons during non-bursting periods. We find that local
information within a single-cell time series can compare with or even
outperform the global mean field activity for predicting future global bursts.
Moreover, the inter-cell variability in the burst predictability is found to
reflect the network structure realized in the non-bursting periods. These
findings demonstrate the deterministic mechanisms underlying the locally
concentrated early-warnings of the global state transition in self-organized
networks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;How spiking networks are able to perform probabilistic inference is an
intriguing question, not only for understanding information processing in the
brain, but also for transferring these computational principles to neuromorphic
silicon circuits. A number of computationally powerful spiking network models
have been proposed, but most of them have only been tested, under ideal
conditions, in software simulations. Any implementation in an analog, physical
system, be it in vivo or in silico, will generally lead to distorted dynamics
due to the physical properties of the underlying substrate. In this paper, we
discuss several such distortive effects that are difficult or impossible to
remove by classical calibration routines or parameter training. We then argue
that hierarchical networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons can offer the
required robustness for physical implementation and demonstrate this with both
software simulations and emulation on an accelerated analog neuromorphic
device.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A stochastic model of excitatory and inhibitory interactions which bears
universality traits is introduced and studied. The endogenous component of
noise, stemming from finite size corrections, drives robust inter-nodes
correlations, that persist at large large distances. Anti-phase synchrony at
small frequencies is resolved on adjacent nodes and found to promote the
spontaneous generation of long-ranged stochastic patterns, that invade the
network as a whole. These patterns are lacking under the idealized
deterministic scenario, and could provide novel hints on how living systems
implement and handle a large gallery of delicate computational tasks.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Quantifying the strength of structural connectivity underlying functional brain networks. (arXiv:1703.04056v1 [stat.AP])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04056</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, there has been strong interest in neuroscience studies to
investigate brain organization through networks of brain regions that
demonstrate strong functional connectivity (FC). These networks are extracted
from observed fMRI using data-driven analytic methods such as independent
component analysis (ICA). A notable limitation of these FC methods is that they
do not provide any information on the underlying structural connectivity (SC),
which is believed to serve as the basis for interregional interactions in brain
activity. We propose a new statistical measure of the strength of SC (sSC)
underlying FC networks obtained from data-driven methods. The sSC measure is
developed using information from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, and can
be applied to compare the strength of SC across different FC networks.
Furthermore, we propose a reliability index for data-driven FC networks to
measure the reproducibility of the networks through re-sampling the observed
data. To perform statistical inference such as hypothesis testing on the sSC,
we develop a formal variance estimator of sSC based a spatial semivariogram
model with a novel distance metric. We demonstrate the performance of the sSC
measure and its estimation and inference methods with simulation studies. For
real data analysis, we apply our methods to a multimodal imaging study with
resting-state fMRI and DTI data from 20 healthy controls and 20 subjects with
major depressive disorder. Results show that well-known resting state networks
all demonstrate higher SC within the network as compared to the average
structural connections across the brain. We also found that sSC is positively
associated with the reliability index, indicating that the FC networks that
have stronger underlying SC are more reproducible across samples.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Death and rebirth of neural activity in sparse inhibitory networks. (arXiv:1610.07181v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07181</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we clarify the mechanisms underlying a general phenomenon
present in pulse-coupled heterogeneous inhibitory networks: inhibition can
induce not only suppression of the neural activity, as expected, but it can
also promote neural reactivation. In particular, for globally coupled systems,
the number of firing neurons monotonically reduces upon increasing the strength
of inhibition (neurons' death). However, the random pruning of the connections
is able to reverse the action of inhibition, i.e. in a sparse network a
sufficiently strong synaptic strength can surprisingly promote, rather than
depress, the activity of the neurons (neurons' rebirth). Thus the number of
firing neurons reveals a minimum at some intermediate synaptic strength. We
show that this minimum signals a transition from a regime dominated by the
neurons with higher firing activity to a phase where all neurons are
effectively sub-threshold and their irregular firing is driven by current
fluctuations. We explain the origin of the transition by deriving an analytic
mean field formulation of the problem able to provide the fraction of active
neurons as well as the first two moments of their firing statistics. The
introduction of a synaptic time scale does not modify the main aspects of the
reported phenomenon. However, for sufficiently slow synapses the transition
becomes dramatic, the system passes from a perfectly regular evolution to an
irregular bursting dynamics. In this latter regime the model provides
predictions consistent with experimental findings for a specific class of
neurons, namely the medium spiny neurons in the striatum.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Noise-Robust Modes of the Retinal Population Code have the Geometry of &quot;Ridges&quot; and Correspond with Neuronal Communities. (arXiv:1610.06886v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06886</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;An appealing new principle for neural population codes is that correlations
among neurons organize neural activity patterns into a discrete set of
clusters, which can each be viewed as a noise-robust population &quot;codeword&quot;.
Previous studies assumed that these codewords corresponded geometrically with
local peaks in the probability landscape of neural population responses. Here,
we analyze multiple datasets of the responses of ~150 retinal ganglion cells
and show that local probability peaks are absent under broad, non-repeated
stimulus ensembles, which are characteristic of natural behavior. However, we
find that neural activity still forms noise-robust clusters in this regime,
albeit clusters with a different geometry. We start by defining a soft local
maximum, which is a local probability maximum when constrained to a fixed spike
count. Next, we show that soft local maxima are robustly present, and can
moreover be linked across different spike count levels in the probability
landscape to form a &quot;ridge&quot;. We found that these ridges are comprised of
combinations of spiking and silence in the neural population such that all of
the spiking neurons are members of the same neuronal community, a notion from
network theory. We argue that a neuronal community shares many of the
properties of Donald Hebb's classic cell assembly, and show that a simple,
biologically plausible decoding algorithm can recognize the presence of a
specific neuronal community.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent experimental advances are producing an avalanche of data on both
neural connectivity and neural activity. To take full advantage of these two
emerging datasets we need a framework that links them, revealing how collective
neural activity arises from the structure of neural connectivity and intrinsic
neural dynamics. This problem of {\it structure-driven activity} has drawn
major interest in computational neuroscience. Existing methods for relating
activity and architecture in spiking networks rely on linearizing activity
around a central operating point and thus fail to capture the nonlinear
responses of individual neurons that are the hallmark of neural information
processing. Here, we overcome this limitation and present a new relationship
between connectivity and activity in networks of nonlinear spiking neurons by
developing a diagrammatic fluctuation expansion based on statistical field
theory. We explicitly show how recurrent network structure produces pairwise
and higher-order correlated activity, and how nonlinearities impact the
networks' spiking activity. Our findings open new avenues to investigating how
single-neuron nonlinearities---including those of different cell
types---combine with connectivity to shape population activity and function.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider a sparse random network of excitatory leaky integrate-and-fire
neurons with short-term synaptic depression. Furthermore to mimic the dynamics
of a brain circuit in its first stages of development we introduce for each
neuron correlations among in-degree and out-degree as well as among
excitability and the corresponding total degree, We analyze the influence of
single neuron stimulation and deletion on the collective dynamics of the
network. We show the existence of a small group of neurons capable of
controlling and even silencing the bursting activity of the network. These
neurons form a functional clique since only their activation in a precise order
and within specific time windows is capable to ignite population bursts.

	<description>The Clinical Brain Disorders Branch of the Intramural Research Program at the National Institutes of Health assembled a large collection of frozen post-mortem human brains from individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, or other psychiatric diagnoses as well as matched control individuals, collected Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 expression array data from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of those brains, and deposited the data at dbGaP (Study ID: phs000979). We report an analysis of the data from the 188 adult schizophrenics and 206 adult controls in that cohort. Transcripts from 635 genes are differentially expressed in the schizophrenics as compared to the controls at a level of statistical significance which survived Bonferroni correction. Seventeen of those genes are differentially expressed at a level of statistical significance less than 10-8 after Bonferroni correction. WGCNA analysis using gene module eigengenes divided the schizophrenics into two groups, &quot;type 1&quot; and &quot;type 2&quot;. There are 2,253 genes differentially expressed in the DLPFC of type 2 schizophrenics at a level of statistical significance which survives Bonferroni correction. Of them 160 have P-values less than 10-15 after Bonferroni correction. In the type 1 schizophrenics however, only 13 genes are differentially expressed in the DLPFC and of those 13, only one is also differentially expressed in the type 2 schizophrenics. This striking difference in their DLPFC transcriptomes emphasizes the fundamental biologic difference between these two groups of patients. The fact that only a few genes are differentially expressed in the DLPFC of type 1 schizophrenics while over two thousand are differentially expressed in the type 2 schizophrenics suggests a testable hypothesis. Although the DLPFC is clearly abnormal in the type 2 schizophrenics, for the type 1 schizophrenics the physiologically significant pathology may be elsewhere, perhaps in the superior temporal or cingulate gyri.</description>

	<description>Hebbian plasticity, a synaptic mechanism which detects and amplifies co-activity between neurons, is considered a key ingredient underlying learning and memory in the brain. However, Hebbian plasticity alone is unstable, leading to runaway neuronal activity, and therefore requires stabilization by additional compensatory processes. Traditionally, a diversity of homeostatic plasticity phenomena found in neural circuits are thought to play this role. However, recent modelling work suggests that the slow evolution of homeostatic plasticity, as observed in experiments, is insufficient to prevent instabilities originating from Hebbian plasticity. To remedy this situation, we suggest that homeostatic plasticity is complemented by additional rapid compensatory processes, which rapidly stabilize neuronal activity on short timescales.</description>

	<description>Proposals to increase research reproducibility frequently call for focusing on effect sizes instead of p values, as well as for increasing the statistical power of experiments. However, it is unclear to what extent these two concepts are indeed taken into account in basic biomedical science. To study this in a real-case scenario, we performed a systematic review of effect sizes and statistical power in studies using rodent fear conditioning, a widely used behavioral task to evaluate learning and memory. Our search criteria yielded 410 experiments comparing control and treated groups in 122 articles. Interventions with statistically significant differences had a mean effect size of 45.6%, and amnesia caused by memory-impairing interventions was nearly always partial. Mean statistical power to detect the average effect size observed in well-powered experiments (37.2%) was 65%, and was lower in studies with non-significant results. Only one article reported a sample size calculation, and our estimated sample size to achieve 80% power considering typical effect sizes and variances (15 animals per group) was reached in only 12.2% of experiments. Effect size correlated with textual descriptions of results only when findings were non-significant, and neither effect size nor power correlated with study quality indicators, number of citations or impact factor of articles. In summary, effect sizes and statistical power have a wide distribution in the rodent fear conditioning literature, but do not seem to have a large influence on how results are described or cited. Failure to take these concepts into consideration might limit attempts to improve reproducibility in this field of science.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Single-channel in-Ear-EEG detects the focus of auditory attention to concurrent tone streams and mixed speech [Revised]</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/094490v2?rss=1</link>
	<description>Objective: Conventional, multi-channel scalp electroencephalography (EEG) allows the identification of the attended speaker in concurrent-listening (''cocktail party'') scenarios. This implies that EEG might provide valuable information to complement hearing aids with some form of EEG and to install a level of neuro-feedback. Approach: To investigate whether a listener's attentional focus can be detected from single-channel hearing-aid-compatible EEG configurations, we recorded EEG from three electrodes inside the ear canal (''in-Ear-EEG'') and additionally from 64 electrodes on the scalp. In two different, concurrent listening tasks, participants (n = 7) were fitted with individualized in-Ear-EEG pieces and were either asked to attend to one of two dichotically-presented, concurrent tone streams or to one of two diotically-presented, concurrent audiobooks. A forward encoding model was trained to predict the EEG response at single EEG channels. Main results: Each individual participants' attentional focus could be detected from single-channel EEG response recorded from short-distance configurations consisting only of a single in-Ear-EEG electrode and an adjacent scalp-EEG electrode. The differences in neural responses to attended and ignored stimuli were consistent in morphology (i.e., polarity and latency of components) across subjects. Significance: In sum, our findings show that the EEG response from a single-channel, hearing-aid-compatible configuration provides valuable information to identify a listener's focus of attention.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Stimulus-specific adaptation in a recurrent network model of primary auditory cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Tohar S. Yarden, Israel Nelken&lt;/p&gt;

Stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) occurs when neurons decrease their responses to frequently-presented (standard) stimuli but not, or not as much, to other, rare (deviant) stimuli. SSA is present in all mammalian species in which it has been tested as well as in birds. SSA confers short-term memory to neuronal responses, and may lie upstream of the generation of mismatch negativity (MMN), an important human event-related potential. Previously published models of SSA mostly rely on synaptic depression of the feedforward, thalamocortical input. Here we study SSA in a recurrent neural network model of primary auditory cortex. When the recurrent, intracortical synapses display synaptic depression, the network generates population spikes (PSs). SSA occurs in this network when deviants elicit a PS but standards do not, and we demarcate the regions in parameter space that allow SSA. While SSA based on PSs does not require feedforward depression, we identify feedforward depression as a mechanism for expanding the range of parameters that support SSA. We provide predictions for experiments that could help differentiate between SSA due to synaptic depression of feedforward connections and SSA due to synaptic depression of recurrent connections. Similar to experimental data, the magnitude of SSA in the model depends on the frequency difference between deviant and standard, probability of the deviant, inter-stimulus interval and input amplitude. In contrast to models based on feedforward depression, our model shows true deviance sensitivity as found in experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AAr1KxHNwH4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Dynamics robustness of cascading systems</title>

A most important property of biochemical systems is robustness. Static robustness, e.g., homeostasis, is the insensitivity of a state against perturbations, whereas dynamics robustness, e.g., homeorhesis, is the insensitivity of a dynamic process. In contrast to the extensively studied static robustness, dynamics robustness, i.e., how a system creates an invariant temporal profile against perturbations, is little explored despite transient dynamics being crucial for cellular fates and are reported to be robust experimentally. For example, the duration of a stimulus elicits different phenotypic responses, and signaling networks process and encode temporal information. Hence, robustness in time courses will be necessary for functional biochemical networks. Based on dynamical systems theory, we uncovered a general mechanism to achieve dynamics robustness. Using a three-stage linear signaling cascade as an example, we found that the temporal profiles and response duration post-stimulus is robust to perturbations against certain parameters. Then analyzing the linearized model, we elucidated the criteria of when signaling cascades will display dynamics robustness. We found that changes in the upstream modules are masked in the cascade, and that the response duration is mainly controlled by the rate-limiting module and organization of the cascade’s kinetics. Specifically, we found two necessary conditions for dynamics robustness in signaling cascades: 1) Constraint on the rate-limiting process: The phosphatase activity in the perturbed module is not the slowest. 2) Constraints on the initial conditions: The kinase activity needs to be fast enough such that each module is saturated even with fast phosphatase activity and upstream changes are attenuated. We discussed the relevance of such robustness to several biological examples and the validity of the above conditions therein. Given the applicability of dynamics robustness to a variety of systems, it will provide a general basis for how biological systems function dynamically.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZHot13cYai4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Parameter estimation for multistage clonal expansion models from cancer incidence data: A practical identifiability analysis</title>

Many cancers are understood to be the product of multiple somatic mutations or other rate-limiting events. Multistage clonal expansion (MSCE) models are a class of continuous-time Markov chain models that capture the multi-hit initiation–promotion–malignant-conversion hypothesis of carcinogenesis. These models have been used broadly to investigate the epidemiology of many cancers, assess the impact of carcinogen exposures on cancer risk, and evaluate the potential impact of cancer prevention and control strategies on cancer rates. Structural identifiability (the analysis of the maximum parametric information available for a model given perfectly measured data) of certain MSCE models has been previously investigated. However, structural identifiability is a theoretical property and does not address the limitations of real data. In this study, we use pancreatic cancer as a case study to examine the practical identifiability of the two-, three-, and four-stage clonal expansion models given age-specific cancer incidence data using a numerical profile-likelihood approach. We demonstrate that, in the case of the three- and four-stage models, several parameters that are theoretically structurally identifiable, are, in practice, unidentifiable. This result means that key parameters such as the intermediate cell mutation rates are not individually identifiable from the data and that estimation of those parameters, even if structurally identifiable, will not be stable. We also show that products of these practically unidentifiable parameters are practically identifiable, and, based on this, we propose new reparameterizations of the model hazards that resolve the parameter estimation problems. Our results highlight the importance of identifiability to the interpretation of model parameter estimates.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-WkymaOjJqE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a highly complex genetic blood disorder in which red blood cells (RBC) exhibit heterogeneous morphology changes and decreased deformability. We employ a kinetic model for cell morphological sickling that invokes parameters derived from patient-specific data. This model is used to investigate the dynamics of individual sickle cells in a capillary-like microenvironment in order to address various mechanisms associated with SCD. We show that all RBCs, both hypoxia-unaffected and hypoxia-affected ones, regularly pass through microgates under oxygenated state. However, the hypoxia-affected cells undergo sickling which significantly alters cell dynamics. In particular, the dense and rigid sickle RBCs are obstructed thereby clogging blood flow while the less dense and deformable ones are capable of circumnavigating dead (trapped) cells ahead of them by choosing a serpentine path. Informed by recent experiments involving microfluidics that provide &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; quantitative information on cell dynamics under transient hypoxia conditions, we have performed detailed computational simulations of alterations to cell behavior in response to morphological changes and membrane stiffening. Our model reveals that SCD exhibits substantial heterogeneity even within a particular density-fractionated subpopulation. These findings provide unique insights into how individual sickle cells move through capillaries under transient hypoxic conditions, and offer novel possibilities for designing effective therapeutic interventions for SCD.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_xol0AcQjok&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modelling T cell proliferation: Dynamics heterogeneity depending on cell differentiation, age, and genetic background</title>

Cell proliferation is the common characteristic of all biological systems. The immune system insures the maintenance of body integrity on the basis of a continuous production of diversified T lymphocytes in the thymus. This involves processes of proliferation, differentiation, selection, death and migration of lymphocytes to peripheral tissues, where proliferation also occurs upon antigen recognition. Quantification of cell proliferation dynamics requires specific experimental methods and mathematical modelling. Here, we assess the impact of genetics and aging on the immune system by investigating the dynamics of proliferation of T lymphocytes across their differentiation through thymus and spleen in mice. Our investigation is based on single-cell multicolour flow cytometry analysis revealing the active incorporation of a thymidine analogue during S phase after pulse-chase-pulse experiments &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, versus cell DNA content. A generic mathematical model of state transition simulates through Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) the evolution of single cell behaviour during various durations of labelling. It allows us to fit our data, to deduce proliferation rates and estimate cell cycle durations in sub-populations. Our model is simple and flexible and is validated with other durations of pulse/chase experiments. Our results reveal that T cell proliferation is highly heterogeneous but with a specific “signature” that depends upon genetic origins, is specific to cell differentiation stages in thymus and spleen and is altered with age. In conclusion, our model allows us to infer proliferation rates and cell cycle phase durations from complex experimental 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) data, revealing T cell proliferation heterogeneity and specific signatures.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_LPcQaPmL2o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A key question in neuroscience is at which level functional meaning emerges
from biophysical phenomena. In most vertebrate systems, precise functions are
assigned at the level of neural populations, while single-neurons are deemed
unreliable and redundant. Here we challenge this view and show that many
single-neuron quantities, including voltages, firing thresholds, excitation,
inhibition, and spikes, acquire precise functional meaning whenever a network
learns to transmit information parsimoniously and precisely to the next layer.
Based on the hypothesis that neural circuits generate precise population codes
under severe constraints on metabolic costs, we derive synaptic plasticity
rules that allow a network to represent its time-varying inputs with maximal
accuracy. We provide exact solutions to the learnt optimal states, and we
predict the properties of an entire network from its input distribution and the
cost of activity. Single-neuron variability and tuning curves as typically
observed in cortex emerge over the course of learning, but paradoxically
coincide with a precise, non-redundant spike-based population code. Our work
suggests that neural circuits operate far more accurately than previously
thought, and that no spike is fired in vain.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal firing activities have attracted a lot of attention since a large
population of spatiotemporal patterns in the brain is the basis for adaptive
behavior and can also reveal the signs for various neurological disorders
including Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, epilepsy and others. Here, we study the
dynamics of a simple neuronal network using different sets of settings on a
neuromorphic chip. We observed three different types of collective neuronal
firing activities, which agree with the clinical data taken from the brain. We
constructed a brain phase diagram and showed that within the weak noise region,
the brain is operating in an expected noise-induced phase (N-phase) rather than
at a so-called self-organized critical boundary. The significance of this study
is twofold: first, the deviation of neuronal activities from the normal brain
could be symptomatic of diseases of the central nervous system, thus paving the
way for new diagnostics and treatments; second, the normal brain states in the
N-phase are optimal for computation and information processing. The latter may
provide a way to establish powerful new computing paradigm using collective
behavior of networks of spiking neurons.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03444</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Anticipated synchronization (AS) is a counter intuitive behavior that has
been observed in several systems. When AS establishes in a sender-receiver
configuration, the latter can predict the future dynamics of the former for
certain parameter values. In particular, in neuroscience AS was proposed to
explain the apparent discrepancy between information flow and time lag in the
cortical activity recorded in monkeys. Despite its success, a clear
understanding on the mechanisms yielding AS in neuronal circuits is still
missing. Here we use the well-known phase-resetting-curve (PRC) approach to
study the prototypical sender-receiver-interneuron neuronal motif. Our aim is
to better understand how the transitions between delayed to anticipated
synchronization and anticipated synchronization to phase-drift regimes occur.
We construct a map based on the PRC method to predict the phase-locking regimes
and their stability. We find that a PRC function of two variables, accounting
simultaneously for the inputs from sender and interneuron into the receiver, is
essential to reproduce the numerical results obtained using a Hodgkin-Huxley
model for the neurons. On the contrary, the typical approximation that
considers a sum of two independent single-variable PRCs fails for intermediate
to high values of the inhibitory connectivity between interneuron. In
particular, it looses the delayed-synchronization to
anticipated-synchronization transition.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03442</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Regularization occurs when the output a learner produces is less variable
than the linguistic data they observed. In an artificial language learning
experiment, we show that there exist at least two independent sources of
regularization bias in cognition: a domain-general source based on cognitive
load and a domain-specific source triggered by linguistic stimuli. Both of
these factors modulate how frequency information is encoded and produced, but
only the production-side modulations result in regularization (i.e. cause
learners to eliminate variation from the observed input). We formalize the
definition of regularization as the reduction of entropy and find that entropy
measures are better at identifying regularization behavior than frequency-based
analyses. We also use a model of cultural transmission to extrapolate from our
experimental data in order to predict the amount of regularization which would
develop in each experimental condition if the artificial language was
transmitted over several generations of learners. Here we find an interaction
between cognitive load and linguistic domain, suggesting that the effect of
cognitive constraints can become more complex when put into the context of
cultural evolution: although learning biases certainly carry information about
the course of language evolution, we should not expect a one-to-one
correspondence between the micro-level processes that regularize linguistic
datasets and the macro-level evolution of linguistic regularity.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: An Information-Theoretic Framework for Fast and Robust Unsupervised Learning via Neural Population Infomax. (arXiv:1611.01886v4 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01886</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A framework is presented for unsupervised learning of representations based
on infomax principle for large-scale neural populations. We use an asymptotic
approximation to the Shannon's mutual information for a large neural population
to demonstrate that a good initial approximation to the global
information-theoretic optimum can be obtained by a hierarchical infomax method.
Starting from the initial solution, an efficient algorithm based on gradient
descent of the final objective function is proposed to learn representations
from the input datasets, and the method works for complete, overcomplete, and
undercomplete bases. As confirmed by numerical experiments, our method is
robust and highly efficient for extracting salient features from input
datasets. Compared with the main existing methods, our algorithm has a distinct
advantage in both the training speed and the robustness of unsupervised
representation learning. Furthermore, the proposed method is easily extended to
the supervised or unsupervised model for training deep structure networks.

	<description>To make accurate perceptual estimates observers must take the reliability of sensory information into account. Despite many behavioural studies showing that subjects weight individual sensory cues in proportion to their reliabilities, it is still unclear when during a trial neuronal responses are modulated by the reliability of sensory information, or when they reflect the perceptual weights attributed to each sensory input during decision making. We investigated these questions using a combination of psychophysics, EEG based neuroimaging and single-trial decoding. Our results show that the weighted integration of sensory information in the brain is a dynamic process; effects of sensory reliability on task-relevant EEG components were evident around 84ms after stimulus onset, while neural correlates of perceptual weights emerged around 120ms after stimulus onset. These neural processes also had different underlying topographies, arising from areas consistent with sensory and parietal regions. Together these results reveal the temporal dynamics of perceptual and neural audio-visual integration and support the notion of temporally early and functionally specific multisensory processes in the brain.</description>

	<description>A major open challenge in neuroscience is the ability to measure and perturb neural activity in vivo from well-defined neural sub-populations at cellular resolution anywhere in the brain. However, limitations posed by scattering and absorption prohibit non-invasive (surface) multiphoton approaches for deep (&amp;gt;2mm) structures, while Gradient Refreactive Index (GRIN) endoscopes are thick and cause significant damage upon insertion. Here, we demonstrate a novel microendoscope to image neural activity at arbitrary depths via an ultrathin multimode optical fiber (MMF) probe that is 5-10X thinner than commercially available microendoscopes. We demonstrate micron-scale resolution, multispectral and volumetric imaging. In contrast to previous approaches1, we show that this method has an improved acquisition speed that is sufficient to capture rapid neuronal dynamics in-vivo in rodents expressing a genetically encoded calcium indicator. Our results emphasize the potential of this technology in neuroscience applications and open up possibilities for cellular resolution imaging in previously unreachable brain regions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: 3D Mapping Reveals Network-specific Amyloid Progression and Subcortical Susceptibility.</title>

	<description>Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative condition for which there is no cure. Prominent hypotheses posit that accumulation of beta-amyloid (A{beta}) peptides drives the neurodegeneration that underlies memory loss, however the spatial origins of the lesions remain elusive. Using SWITCH, we created a spatiotemporal map of A{beta} deposition in a mouse model of amyloidosis. We report that structures connected by the fornix show primary susceptibility to A{beta} accumulation and demonstrate that aggregates develop in increasingly complex networks with age. Notably, the densest early A{beta} aggregates occur in the mammillary body coincident with electrophysiological alterations. In later stages, the fornix itself also develops overt A{beta} burden. Finally, we confirm A{beta} in the mammillary body of postmortem patient specimens. Together, our data suggest that subcortical memory structures are particularly vulnerable to A{beta} deposition and that functional alterations within and physical propagation from these regions may underlie the affliction of increasingly complex networks.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Feeding Schedule And Proteolysis Regulate Autophagic Clearance Of Mutant Huntingtin</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/116178v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/116178v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The expression of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) causes Huntington disease (HD), and lowering its levels is therefore an attractive therapeutic strategy. Here we show that scheduled feeding significantly decreases mHTT protein levels through enhanced autophagy in the CNS of an HD mouse model, while short term fasting is sufficient to observe similar effects in peripheral tissue. Furthermore, preventing proteolysis at the caspase-6 cleavage site D586 (C6R) makes mHTT a better substrate for autophagy, additionally increasing its clearance. Mice expressing mutant C6R also exhibit increased autophagy at baseline compared to an HD model with cleavable mHTT, suggesting that the native function of HTT in promoting autophagy is disrupted upon cleavage and re-established by prevention of cleavage by caspase-6. In HD patients, mHTT clearance and autophagy may therefore become increasingly impaired as a function of age and disease stage by gradually increased activity of mHTT-processing enzymes.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Intrinsic Hippocampal-Caudate Interaction Correlates with Human Navigation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/116129v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/116129v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Spatial navigation is a crucial ability in daily life. Previous neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies suggested that two spatial representation systems with either the hippocampus or the caudate nucleus at the core play an important but distinct role underlying navigation. However, it remains unclear whether and how these two systems interact during rest, and how the intrinsic interactions support human navigation. Here we investigated the intrinsic hippocampal-caudate interactions using resting-state fMRI and functional connectivity analysis, and related the interactions to individual variability in navigation performance across a large group of healthy young adults (N = 190). We found that the hippocampus showed predominantly positive functional connectivity with the caudate (especially in good navigators), suggesting an efficient hippocampal-caudate cross talk during rest, which may facilitate stronger functional integration of two systems of spatial representations underlying navigation. As expected, we found positive correlations between the hippocampal-caudate interactions and better navigation ability as measured with the Santa Barbara sense of direction scale (SBSOD). Moreover, prediction analysis with machine learning algorithm and a cross-validation procedure showed that individual's behavioral performance in a virtual reality 3D pointing task were generally well predicted by the hippocampal-caudate interactions. Taken together, these results suggest a cooperative interaction between two representation systems underlying navigation, and further study on the dynamic interaction between the two core structures would help us identify previously ignored effects and advance our understanding of normal aging and psychiatric disorders.</description>

	<description>Integrating objects with their context is a key step in the interpretation of complex visual scenes. Humans can do this very quickly, yet the brain mechanisms that mediate this ability are not yet understood. Here, we used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity while participants viewed visual scenes depicting a person performing an action with an object that was either congruent or incongruent with the scene. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed different activity for congruent compared to incongruent scenes in the lateral occipital complex, inferior temporal cortex, parahippocampal cortex, and prefrontal cortex, in line with existing models of scene processing. Importantly, and in contrast to previous studies, these activations could not be explained by task-induced conflicts. A secondary goal of this study was to examine whether object-context integration could occur in the absence of awareness, by comparing brain activity elicited by congruent vs. incongruent scenes that were suppressed from awareness using visual masking. We found no evidence for brain activity differentiating between congruent and incongruent invisible scenes. Overall, our results provide novel support for the roles of PHC and PFC in conscious object-context integration which cannot be explained by either low-level differences or task demands. Yet they further suggest that activity in these regions is decreased by visual masking to the point of becoming undetectable with our fMRI protocol.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Combining theory, model and experiment to understand how theta rhythms are generated in thehippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/115949v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/115949v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Scientists have observed theta rhythms (3-12 Hz) in the hippocampus for decades, but we do not have a clear understanding of how they are generated. This is largely due to the complex, multi-scale and nonlinear nature of the brain. To obtain insight into mechanisms underlying the generation of theta rhythms, we develop cellular-based network models of the hippocampus based on a whole hippocampus in vitro preparation that spontaneously generates theta rhythms. Building on theoretical and computational analyses, we find that spike frequency adaptation and post-inhibitory rebound constitute a basis for theta generation in large, minimally connected CA1 pyramidal (PYR) cell network models with fast-firing parvalbumin-positive (PV+) inhibitory cells. The particular theta frequency is more controlled by PYR to PV+ cell interactions rather than PV+ to PYR cell ones. We identify two scenarios by which theta rhythms can emerge and they can be differentiated by the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory currents to PV+ cells, but not to PYR cells. Only one of the scenarios is consistent with data from the whole hippocampus preparation, which leads to the prediction that the connection probability from PV+ to PYR cells needs to be larger than from PYR to PV+ cells. Our models can serve as a platform on which to build and develop an understanding of in vivo theta generation, and of microcircuit dynamics in the hippocampus.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A human judgment approach to epidemiological forecasting</title>

Infectious diseases impose considerable burden on society, despite significant advances in technology and medicine over the past century. Advanced warning can be helpful in mitigating and preparing for an impending or ongoing epidemic. Historically, such a capability has lagged for many reasons, including in particular the uncertainty in the current state of the system and in the understanding of the processes that drive epidemic trajectories. Presently we have access to data, models, and computational resources that enable the development of epidemiological forecasting systems. Indeed, several recent challenges hosted by the U.S. government have fostered an open and collaborative environment for the development of these technologies. The primary focus of these challenges has been to develop statistical and computational methods for epidemiological forecasting, but here we consider a serious alternative based on collective human judgment. We created the web-based “Epicast” forecasting system which collects and aggregates epidemic predictions made in real-time by human participants, and with these forecasts we ask two questions: how accurate is human judgment, and how do these forecasts compare to their more computational, data-driven alternatives? To address the former, we assess by a variety of metrics how accurately humans are able to predict influenza and chikungunya trajectories. As for the latter, we show that real-time, combined human predictions of the 2014–2015 and 2015–2016 U.S. flu seasons are often more accurate than the same predictions made by several statistical systems, especially for short-term targets. We conclude that there is valuable predictive power in collective human judgment, and we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of this approach.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-Km_GyWoMTI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An essential step toward understanding neural circuits is linking their
structure and their dynamics. In general, this relationship can be almost
arbitrarily complex. Recent theoretical work has, however, begun to identify
some broad principles underlying collective spiking activity in neural
circuits. The first is that local features of network connectivity can be
surprisingly effective in predicting global statistics of activity across a
network. The second is that, for the important case of large networks with
excitatory-inhibitory balance, correlated spiking persists or vanishes
depending on the spatial scales of recurrent and feedforward connectivity. We
close by showing how these ideas, together with plasticity rules, can help to
close the loop between network structure and activity statistics.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Discrete modes of social information processing predict individual behavior of fish in a group. (arXiv:1703.03065v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03065</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03065</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Individual computations and social interactions underlying collective
behavior in groups of animals are of great ethological, behavioral, and
theoretical interest. While complex individual behaviors have successfully been
parsed into small dictionaries of stereotyped behavioral modes, studies of
collective behavior largely ignored these findings; instead, their focus was on
inferring single, mode-independent social interaction rules that reproduced
macroscopic and often qualitative features of group behavior. Here we bring
these two approaches together to predict individual swimming patterns of adult
zebrafish in a group. We show that fish alternate between an active mode in
which they are sensitive to the swimming patterns of conspecifics, and a
passive mode where they ignore them. Using a model that accounts for these two
modes explicitly, we predict behaviors of individual fish with high accuracy,
outperforming previous approaches that assumed a single continuous computation
by individuals and simple metric or topological weighing of neighbors behavior.
At the group level, switching between active and passive modes is uncorrelated
among fish, yet correlated directional swimming behavior still emerges. Our
quantitative approach for studying complex, multi-modal individual behavior
jointly with emergent group behavior is readily extensible to additional
behavioral modes and their neural correlates, as well as to other species.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Sustained sensorimotor control as intermittent decisions about prediction errors: Computational framework and application to ground vehicle steering. (arXiv:1703.03030v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03030</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03030</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A conceptual and computational framework is proposed for modelling of human
sensorimotor control, and is exemplified for the sensorimotor task of steering
a car. The framework emphasises control intermittency, and extends on existing
models by suggesting that the nervous system implements intermittent control
using a combination of (1) motor primitives, (2) prediction of sensory outcomes
of motor actions, and (3) evidence accumulation of prediction errors. It is
shown that approximate but useful sensory predictions in the intermittent
control context can be constructed without detailed forward models, as a
superposition of simple prediction primitives, resembling neurobiologically
observed corollary discharges. The proposed mathematical framework allows
straightforward extension to intermittent behaviour from existing
one-dimensional continuous models in the linear control and ecological
psychology traditions. Empirical observations from a driving simulator provide
support for some of the framework assumptions: It is shown that human steering
control, in routine lane-keeping and in a demanding near-limit task, is better
described as a sequence of discrete stepwise steering adjustments, than as
continuous control. Furthermore, the amplitudes of individual steering
adjustments are well predicted by a compound visual cue signalling steering
error, and even better so if also adjusting for predictions of how the same cue
is affected by previous control. Finally, evidence accumulation is shown to
explain observed covariability between inter-adjustment durations and
adjustment amplitudes, seemingly better so than the type of threshold
mechanisms that are typically assumed in existing models of intermittent
control.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Our desire and fascination with intelligent machines dates back to the
antiquity's mythical automaton Talos, Aristotle's mode of mechanical thought
(syllogism) and Heron of Alexandria's mechanical machines and automata.
However, the quest for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is troubled with
repeated failures of strategies and approaches throughout the history. This
decade has seen a shift in interest towards bio-inspired software and hardware,
with the assumption that such mimicry entails intelligence. Though these steps
are fruitful in certain directions and have advanced automation, their singular
design focus renders them highly inefficient in achieving AGI. Which set of
requirements have to be met in the design of AGI? What are the limits in the
design of the artificial? Here, a careful examination of computation in
biological systems hints that evolutionary tinkering of contextual processing
of information enabled by a hierarchical architecture is the key to build AGI.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Presynaptic LRP4 Promotes Synapse Number and Function of Excitatory CNS Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/115907v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/115907v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Precise coordination of synaptic connections ensures proper information flow within circuits. The activity of presynaptic organizing molecules signaling to downstream pathways is essential for such coordination, though such entities remain incompletely known. We show that LRP4, a conserved transmembrane protein known for its postsynaptic roles, functions presynaptically as an organizing molecule. In the Drosophila brain, LRP4 preferentially localizes to excitatory neuron terminals at or near active zones. Loss of presynaptic LRP4 reduces excitatory (not inhibitory) synapse number, impairs active zone architecture, and abolishes olfactory attraction - the latter of which can be suppressed by reducing presynaptic GABAB receptors. LRP4 overexpression increases synapse number in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, suggesting an instructive role and a common downstream synapse addition pathway. Mechanistically, LRP4 functions via the conserved kinase SRPK79D to ensure normal synapse number and behavior. This highlights a presynaptic function for LRP4, enabling deeper understanding of how synapse organization is coordinated.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neurons define non-myelinated axon segments by the regulation of galectin-4-containingaxon membrane domains</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/115758v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/115758v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The mechanism underlying selective myelination of axons versus dendrites or neuronal somata relies on the expression of somatodendritic membrane myelination inhibitors (i.e. JAM2). However, axons still present long unmyelinated segments proposed to contribute to axonal plasticity and higher order brain functions. Why these segments remain unmyelinated is still an unresolved issue. The bifunctional lectin galectin-4 (Gal-4) organizes the transport of axon glycoproteins by binding to N-acetyllactosamine (LacNac) termini of N-glycans. We have shown that Gal-4 is sorted to segmental domains (G4Ds) along the axon surface, reminiscent of these long unmyelinated axon segments in cortical neurons. We report here that oligodendrocytes (OLGs) do not deposit myelin on Gal-4 covered surfaces or myelinate axonal G4Ds. In addition, Gal-4 interacts and co-localizes in G4Ds with contactin-1, a marker of non-myelinated nodes of Ranvier. Neither Gal-4 expression nor G4D dimensions are affected by myelin extracts or myelinating OLGs, but are reduced with neuron maturation. As in vitro, Gal-4 is consistently segregated from myelinated structures in the brain. Our data shape the novel concept that neurons establish and regulate axon membrane domains expressing Gal-4, the first inhibitor of myelination identified in axons, whose boundaries delineate myelination-incompetent axon segments along neuron development.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Compensating for intersegmental dynamics across the shoulder, elbow and wrist joints during feedforward and feedback control</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/115675v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/115675v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Moving the arm is complicated by mechanical interactions that arise between limb segments. Such intersegmental dynamics cause torques applied at one joint to produce movement at multiple joints and, in turn, the only way to create single joint movement is by applying torques at multiple joints. Here, we investigated whether the nervous system accounts for intersegmental limb dynamics across the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints during self-initiated reaching and when countering external mechanical perturbations. Our first experiment tested whether the timing and amplitude of shoulder muscle activity accounts for interaction torques produced during single-joint elbow movements from different elbow initial orientations and over a range of movement speeds. We found that shoulder muscle activity reliably preceded movement onset and elbow agonist activity, and was scaled to compensate for the magnitude of interaction torques arising because of forearm rotation. Our second experiment tested whether elbow muscles compensate for interaction torques introduced by single-joint wrist movements. We found that elbow muscle activity preceded movement onset and wrist agonist muscle activity, and thus the nervous system predicted interaction torques arising because of hand rotation. Our third and fourth experiments tested whether shoulder muscles compensate for interaction torques introduced by different hand orientations during self-initiated elbow movements and when countering mechanical perturbations that caused pure elbow motion. We found that the nervous system predicted the amplitude and direction of interaction torques, appropriately scaling the amplitude of shoulder muscle activity during self-initiated elbow movements and rapid feedback control. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the nervous system robustly accounts for intersegmental dynamics, and that the process is similar across the proximal to distal musculature of the arm as well as between feedforward (i.e., self-initiated) and feedback (i.e., reflexive) control.</description>

Complex cognition and relatively large brains are distributed across various taxa, and many primarily verbal hypotheses exist to explain such diversity. Yet, mathematical approaches formalizing verbal hypotheses would help deepen the understanding of brain and cognition evolution. With this aim, we combine elements of life history and metabolic theories to formulate a metabolically explicit mathematical model for brain life history evolution. We assume that some of the brain’s energetic expense is due to production (learning) and maintenance (memory) of energy-extraction skills (or cognitive abilities, knowledge, information, etc.). We also assume that individuals use such skills to extract energy from the environment, and can allocate this energy to grow and maintain the body, including brain and reproductive tissues. The model can be used to ask what fraction of growth energy should be allocated at each age, given natural selection, to growing brain and other tissues under various biological settings. We apply the model to find uninvadable allocation strategies under a baseline setting (“me vs nature”), namely when energy-extraction challenges are environmentally determined and are overcome individually but possibly with maternal help, and use modern-human data to estimate model’s parameter values. The resulting uninvadable strategies yield predictions for brain and body mass throughout ontogeny and for the ages at maturity, adulthood, and brain growth arrest. We find that: (1) a me-vs-nature setting is enough to generate adult brain and body mass of ancient human scale and a sequence of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood stages; (2) large brains are favored by intermediately challenging environments, moderately effective skills, and metabolically expensive memory; and (3) adult skill is proportional to brain mass when metabolic costs of memory saturate the brain metabolic rate allocated to skills.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1K7EuImw5-Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The rate of progress in human neurosciences is limited by the inability to easily apply a wide range of analysis methods to the plethora of different datasets acquired in labs around the world. In this work, we introduce a framework for creating, testing, versioning and archiving portable applications for analyzing neuroimaging data organized and described in compliance with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). The portability of these applications (BIDS Apps) is achieved by using container technologies that encapsulate all binary and other dependencies in one convenient package. BIDS Apps run on all three major operating systems with no need for complex setup and configuration and thanks to the comprehensiveness of the BIDS standard they require little manual user input. Previous containerized data processing solutions were limited to single user environments and not compatible with most multi-tenant High Performance Computing systems. BIDS Apps overcome this limitation by taking advantage of the Singularity container technology. As a proof of concept, this work is accompanied by 22 ready to use BIDS Apps, packaging a diverse set of commonly used neuroimaging algorithms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xf1bOVpQTFM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Rashmi Priya, Guillermo A. Gomez, Srikanth Budnar, Bipul R. Acharya, Andras Czirok, Alpha S. Yap, Zoltan Neufeld&lt;/p&gt;

Mechanical coherence of cell layers is essential for epithelia to function as tissue barriers and to control active tissue dynamics during morphogenesis. RhoA signaling at adherens junctions plays a key role in this process by coupling cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion together with actomyosin contractility. Here we propose and analyze a mathematical model representing core interactions involved in the spatial localization of junctional RhoA signaling. We demonstrate how the interplay between biochemical signaling through positive feedback, combined with diffusion on the cell membrane and mechanical forces generated in the cortex, can determine the spatial distribution of RhoA signaling at cell-cell junctions. This dynamical mechanism relies on the balance between a propagating bistable signal that is opposed by an advective flow generated by an actomyosin stress gradient. Experimental observations on the behavior of the system when contractility is inhibited are in qualitative agreement with the predictions of the model.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PDKQs4TZv8Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aimed to assess the possibility of using a noninvasive screening method for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis by means of abdominal fat ultrasonography. Quantitative analysis of ultrasound B-mode images demonstrated a significant increase in mean echogenicity and a loss of the normal structure of the layers of fat tissue in patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (n = 19). The ultrasound features of the fat tissue and the degree of amyloid deposition seen histopathologically showed a significant correlation. These results suggest that abdominal fat ultrasonography may be a valuable method for screening for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. This article is protected by copyright.

	<description>Kaplan et al. describe a novel pharmacological strategy with a unique mechanism of action to enhance axon regeneration in the injured CNS. Fusicoccin-A stabilizes 14-3-3 protein complexes and stimulates nerve regeneration, in part through modulation of the stress response regulator GCN1.</description>

	<description>Fernández-Ruiz et al. provide evidence that the phase-precession phenomenon is part of a larger family of spike timing mechanisms and provide a common explanation for all of them. Cooperation of CA3 and entorhinal gamma inputs, together with local inhibition, determines spike timing.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Feedback between motion and sensation provides nonlinear boost in run-and-tumble navigation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005429</guid>

Many organisms navigate gradients by alternating straight motions (runs) with random reorientations (tumbles), transiently suppressing tumbles whenever attractant signal increases. This induces a functional coupling between movement and sensation, since tumbling probability is controlled by the internal state of the organism which, in turn, depends on previous signal levels. Although a negative feedback tends to maintain this internal state close to adapted levels, positive feedback can arise when motion up the gradient reduces tumbling probability, further boosting drift up the gradient. Importantly, such positive feedback can drive large fluctuations in the internal state, complicating analytical approaches. Previous studies focused on what happens when the negative feedback dominates the dynamics. By contrast, we show here that there is a large portion of physiologically-relevant parameter space where the positive feedback can dominate, even when gradients are relatively shallow. We demonstrate how large transients emerge because of non-normal dynamics (non-orthogonal eigenvectors near a stable fixed point) inherent in the positive feedback, and further identify a fundamental nonlinearity that strongly amplifies their effect. Most importantly, this amplification is asymmetric, elongating runs in favorable directions and abbreviating others. The result is a “ratchet-like” gradient climbing behavior with drift speeds that can approach half the maximum run speed of the organism. Our results thus show that the classical drawback of run-and-tumble navigation—wasteful runs in the wrong direction—can be mitigated by exploiting the non-normal dynamics implicit in the run-and-tumble strategy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Y8sgPKcGQSU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Biomarkers are used to predict quantitative metabolite concentration profiles in human red blood cells</title>

Deep-coverage metabolomic profiling has revealed a well-defined development of metabolic decay in human red blood cells (RBCs) under cold storage conditions. A set of extracellular biomarkers has been recently identified that reliably defines the qualitative state of the metabolic network throughout this metabolic decay process. Here, we extend the utility of these biomarkers by using them to quantitatively predict the concentrations of other metabolites in the red blood cell. We are able to accurately predict the concentration profile of 84 of the 91 (92%) measured metabolites (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) in RBC metabolism using only measurements of these five biomarkers. The median of prediction errors (symmetric mean absolute percent error) across all metabolites was 13%. The ability to predict numerous metabolite concentrations from a simple set of biomarkers offers the potential for the development of a powerful workflow that could be used to evaluate the metabolic state of a biological system using a minimal set of measurements.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Wz-AfqFKrbI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Inferring epidemiological parameters from phylogenies using regression-ABC: A comparative study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005416</guid>

Inferring epidemiological parameters such as the &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; from time-scaled phylogenies is a timely challenge. Most current approaches rely on likelihood functions, which raise specific issues that range from computing these functions to finding their maxima numerically. Here, we present a new regression-based Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach, which we base on a large variety of summary statistics intended to capture the information contained in the phylogeny and its corresponding lineage-through-time plot. The regression step involves the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method, which is a robust machine learning technique. It allows us to readily deal with the large number of summary statistics, while avoiding resorting to Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. To compare our approach to existing ones, we simulated target trees under a variety of epidemiological models and settings, and inferred parameters of interest using the same priors. We found that, for large phylogenies, the accuracy of our regression-ABC is comparable to that of likelihood-based approaches involving birth-death processes implemented in BEAST2. Our approach even outperformed these when inferring the host population size with a Susceptible-Infected-Removed epidemiological model. It also clearly outperformed a recent kernel-ABC approach when assuming a Susceptible-Infected epidemiological model with two host types. Lastly, by re-analyzing data from the early stages of the recent Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone, we showed that regression-ABC provides more realistic estimates for the duration parameters (latency and infectiousness) than the likelihood-based method. Overall, ABC based on a large variety of summary statistics and a regression method able to perform variable selection and avoid overfitting is a promising approach to analyze large phylogenies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1NOLnOyXUvs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Managing uncertainty in metabolic network structure and improving predictions using EnsembleFBA</title>

Genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) are repositories of knowledge about the metabolic processes that occur in an organism. GENREs have been used to discover and interpret metabolic functions, and to engineer novel network structures. A major barrier preventing more widespread use of GENREs, particularly to study non-model organisms, is the extensive time required to produce a high-quality GENRE. Many automated approaches have been developed which reduce this time requirement, but automatically-reconstructed draft GENREs still require curation before useful predictions can be made. We present a novel approach to the analysis of GENREs which improves the predictive capabilities of draft GENREs by representing many alternative network structures, all equally consistent with available data, and generating predictions from this ensemble. This ensemble approach is compatible with many reconstruction methods. We refer to this new approach as Ensemble Flux Balance Analysis (EnsembleFBA). We validate EnsembleFBA by predicting growth and gene essentiality in the model organism &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; UCBPP-PA14. We demonstrate how EnsembleFBA can be included in a systems biology workflow by predicting essential genes in six &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; species and mapping the essential genes to small molecule ligands from DrugBank. We found that some metabolic subsystems contributed disproportionately to the set of predicted essential reactions in a way that was unique to each &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; species, leading to species-specific outcomes from small molecule interactions. Through our analyses of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; and six &lt;i&gt;Streptococci&lt;/i&gt;, we show that ensembles increase the quality of predictions without drastically increasing reconstruction time, thus making GENRE approaches more practical for applications which require predictions for many non-model organisms. All of our functions and accompanying example code are available in an open online repository.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/W7ZjQjp635o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Amir Bitran, Wei-Yin Chiang, Erel Levine, Mara Prentiss&lt;/p&gt;

Self-organization in the cell relies on the rapid and specific binding of molecules to their cognate targets. Correct bindings must be stable enough to promote the desired function even in the crowded and fluctuating cellular environment. In systems with many nearly matched targets, rapid and stringent formation of stable products is challenging. Mechanisms that overcome this challenge have been previously proposed, including separating the process into multiple stages; however, how particular &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; systems overcome the challenge remains unclear. Here we consider a kinetic system, inspired by homology dependent pairing between double stranded DNA in bacteria. By considering a simplified tractable model, we identify different homology testing stages that naturally occur in the system. In particular, we first model dsDNA molecules as short rigid rods containing periodically spaced binding sites. The interaction begins when the centers of two rods collide at a random angle. For most collision angles, the interaction energy is weak because only a few binding sites near the collision point contribute significantly to the binding energy. We show that most incorrect pairings are rapidly rejected at this stage. In rare cases, the two rods enter a second stage by rotating into parallel alignment. While rotation increases the stability of matched and nearly matched pairings, subsequent rotational fluctuations reduce kinetic trapping. Finally, in vivo chromosome are much longer than the persistence length of dsDNA, so we extended the model to include multiple parallel collisions between long dsDNA molecules, and find that those additional interactions can greatly accelerate the searching.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OHNIgZ7jQgs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Stroke in right dorsal anterior insular cortex is related to myocardial injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24906</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Elevated levels of cardiac troponin and especially their relative changes over time indicate acute myocardial injury. They are also frequently observed after acute ischemic stroke (AIS), indicating poor functional outcome and increased mortality. However, recent evidence showed that in most AIS patients myocardial injury is not caused by coronary ischemia. Instead, stroke lesion location has been suggested to precipitate myocardial injury. &lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) was employed in 299 patients who had an MRI-confirmed acute ischemic stroke within the anterior circulation and a high-sensitivity cardiac Troponin T (hs-cTnT) acquired on the day of admission. Out of these, 228 had a second troponin measurement during the acute phase. The absolute hs-cTnT levels above the 99&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile of a healthy reference population (≥14 ng/L) as well as their relative temporal changes were used as continuous variables of interest in the VLSM model, including a multiple regression analysis adjusted for confounding variables. &lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: The anterior insular cortex of the right hemisphere, in particular its dorsal sub-region, was significantly associated with the relative temporal changes of hs-cTnT (p&amp;lt;0.01, corrected for multiple comparisons). In contrast, the baseline hs-cTnT levels on admission were not related to lesion location anywhere within the anterior circulation. &lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our results amplify recent evidence from functional neuroimaging, which suggests a prominent role of dorsal anterior insular cortex in the parasympathetic control of cardiac and autonomic function. Acute vascular damage of this insular sub-region might lead to autonomic dysbalance and an upregulation of sympathetic function, thereby resulting in myocardial injury.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The neurology of acutely failing respiratory mechanics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24908</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forces involved in breathing—which effectively pull in air—are the diaphragmatic, intercostal, spine, and neck muscles. Equally important are the bulbar musculature maintaining the architecture of a patent airway conduit and abdominal wall and internal intercostal muscles providing cough. Acute injury along a neural trajectory from brainstem to muscle will impair the coordinated interaction between these muscle groups. Acutely failing respiratory mechanics can be caused by central and peripheral lesions. In central lesions, the key lesion is in the nucleus ambiguus innervating the dilator muscles of the soft palate, pharynx, and larynx, but abnormal respiratory mechanics rarely coincide with abnormalities of the respiratory pattern generator. In peripheral lesions, diaphragmatic weakness is a main element, but in many neuromuscular disorders mechanical upper airway obstruction from oropharyngeal weakness contributes equally to an increased respiratory load. The neurology of breathing involves changes in respiratory drive, rhythm, mechanics and dynamics. This review focuses on the fundamentals of abnormal respiratory mechanics in acute neurologic conditions, bedside judgment, interpretation of additional laboratory tests, and initial stabilization with practical solutions provided. Many of these respiratory signs are relevant to neurologists, who, in acute situations, may see these patients first. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The immune response of the human brain to abdominal surgery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24909</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24909</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Surgery launches a systemic inflammatory reaction that reaches the brain and associates with immune activation and cognitive decline. While preclinical studies have in part described this systemic-to-brain signaling pathway, we lack information on how these changes appear in humans. This study examines the short- and long-term impact of abdominal surgery on the human brain immune system by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in relation to blood immune reactivity, plasma inflammatory biomarkers and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Eight males undergoing prostatectomy under general anesthesia were included. Prior to surgery (baseline), at postoperative day 3-4 and after 3 months, patients were examined using [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 brain PET imaging to assess brain immune cell activation. Concurrently, systemic inflammatory biomarkers, &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt; blood tests on immunoreactivity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation and cognitive function were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Patients showed a global down-regulation of GM [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 binding of 26±26% (mean±SD) at 3-4 days postoperatively compared to baseline (&lt;em&gt;p=&lt;/em&gt;0.023), recovering or even increasing after 3 months. LPS-induced release of the pro-inflammatory marker TNF-α in blood displayed a reduction (41±39%) on the 3-4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; postoperative day, corresponding to changes in [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 &lt;em&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;. Change in Stroop color word cognitive test performance between postoperative day 3-4 and 3 months correlated to change in [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 binding (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.027).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: This study translates preclinical data on changes in the brain immune system after surgery to humans, and suggests an interplay between the human brain and the inflammatory response of the peripheral innate immune system. These findings may be related to post-surgical impairments of cognitive function. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate in normal older adults and preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) the impact of amyloid and regional tauopathy on cerebral glucose metabolism and subsequent memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We acquired positron emission tomography using F18 Flortaucipir (tau), C11 Pittsburgh Compound B (amyloid) and F18 Fluorodeoxyglucose in 90 clinically normal elderly of the Harvard Aging Brain Study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posterior cingulate metabolism decreased when both amyloid and neocortical tau were high and predicted subsequent memory decline in a larger sample of normal elderly. In contrast, frontal hypometabolism related to the common age-related entorhinal tauopathy, but this dysfunction was independent of amyloid, and did not predict significant memory decline. Neocortical tauopathy was positively associated with metabolism in individuals with sub-threshold amyloid, suggesting that glucose metabolism increases before decreasing in the course of preclinical AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study identified a synergistic effect of amyloid and tau deposits and demonstrated for the first time in normal elderly its link to AD-like hypometabolism and to AD-like memory decline. The amyloid effect was seen with tau in neocortex, but not with tau in entorhinal cortex, which is the common site of age-related tauopathy. Entorhinal tau was associated with frontal hypometabolism, but this dysfunction was not associated with memory loss. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Olig1 is required for Noggin-induced neonatal myelin repair</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24907</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24907</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt; – Neonatal white matter injury (NWMI) is a lesion found in preterm infants that can lead to cerebral palsy. Although antagonists of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, such as Noggin, promote oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) production after hypoxic-ischemic injury, the downstream functional targets are poorly understood. The bHLH protein Olig1 promotes oligodendrocyte (OL) development and is essential during remyelination in adult mice. Here, we investigated whether &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt; function is required downstream of BMP antagonism for the response to injury in the neonatal brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt; – We used wild type and &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt; mutant mice subjected to neonatal stroke and postnatal neural progenitor cultures, and we analyzed Olig1 expression in human postmortem samples from neonates that suffered hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt;-null neonatal mice showed significant hypomyelination after moderate neonatal stroke. Surprisingly, damaged white matter tracts in &lt;em&gt;Olig1-/-&lt;/em&gt; mice lacked Olig2+ OPCs and instead proliferating neuronal precursors and GABAergic interneurons were present. We demonstrate that Noggin-induced OPC production requires &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt; function. In postnatal neural progenitors, Noggin governs production of OLs versus interneurons through &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt;-mediated repression of &lt;em&gt;Dlx1/2&lt;/em&gt; transcription factors. Additionally, we observed that Olig1 and the BMP signaling effector pSMAD1/5/8 are elevated in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of human infants with HIE compared to controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt; - These findings indicate that &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt; has a critical function in the regulation of the postnatal neural progenitor cell production in response to Noggin.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We report 2 families with undiagnosed recessive presynaptic congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). Whole exome or genome sequencing identified segregating homozygous variants in &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt;: c.51_64delAGGTGGGGGTCCCC in a Kuwaiti family and c.146G&amp;gt;C in an Israeli family. &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt; is required for vesicle fusion at presynaptic neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Electrodiagnostic examination showed severely low compound muscle action potentials and presynaptic impairment. We assessed the effect of the nonsense mutation on mRNA levels and evaluated the NMJ transmission in &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;sup&gt;lew/lew&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, observing neurophysiological features of presynaptic impairment, similar to the patients. Taken together, our findings highlight &lt;em&gt;VAMP1&lt;/em&gt; homozygous mutations as a cause of presynaptic CMS. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Scalable Design of Paired CRISPR Guide RNAs for Genomic Deletion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos Pulido-Quetglas, Estel Aparicio-Prat, Carme Arnan, Taisia Polidori, Toni Hermoso, Emilio Palumbo, Julia Ponomarenko, Roderic Guigo, Rory Johnson&lt;/p&gt;

CRISPR-Cas9 technology can be used to engineer precise genomic deletions with pairs of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). This approach has been widely adopted for diverse applications, from disease modelling of individual loci, to parallelized loss-of-function screens of thousands of regulatory elements. However, no solution has been presented for the unique bioinformatic design requirements of CRISPR deletion. We here present CRISPETa, a pipeline for flexible and scalable paired sgRNA design based on an empirical scoring model. Multiple sgRNA pairs are returned for each target, and any number of targets can be analyzed in parallel, making CRISPETa equally useful for focussed or high-throughput studies. Fast run-times are achieved using a pre-computed off-target database. sgRNA pair designs are output in a convenient format for visualisation and oligonucleotide ordering. We present pre-designed, high-coverage library designs for entire classes of protein-coding and non-coding elements in human, mouse, zebrafish, &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. In human cells, we reproducibly observe deletion efficiencies of ≥50% for CRISPETa designs targeting an enhancer and exonic fragment of the &lt;i&gt;MALAT1&lt;/i&gt; oncogene. In the latter case, deletion results in production of desired, truncated RNA. CRISPETa will be useful for researchers seeking to harness CRISPR for targeted genomic deletion, in a variety of model organisms, from single-target to high-throughput scales.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xEb1Yig42QE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Atrial tachy-arrhytmias, such as atrial fibrillation (AF), are characterised by irregular electrical activity in the atria, generally associated with erratic excitation underlain by re-entrant scroll waves, fibrillatory conduction of multiple wavelets or rapid focal activity. Epidemiological studies have shown an increase in AF prevalence in the developed world associated with an ageing society, highlighting the need for effective treatment options. Catheter ablation therapy, commonly used in the treatment of AF, requires spatial information on atrial electrical excitation. The standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) provides a method for non-invasive identification of the presence of arrhythmia, due to irregularity in the ECG signal associated with atrial activation compared to sinus rhythm, but has limitations in providing specific spatial information. There is therefore a pressing need to develop novel methods to identify and locate the origin of arrhythmic excitation. Invasive methods provide direct information on atrial activity, but may induce clinical complications. Non-invasive methods avoid such complications, but their development presents a greater challenge due to the non-direct nature of monitoring. Algorithms based on the ECG signals in multiple leads (e.g. a 64-lead vest) may provide a viable approach. In this study, we used a biophysically detailed model of the human atria and torso to investigate the correlation between the morphology of the ECG signals from a 64-lead vest and the location of the origin of rapid atrial excitation arising from rapid focal activity and/or re-entrant scroll waves. A focus-location algorithm was then constructed from this correlation. The algorithm had success rates of 93% and 76% for correctly identifying the origin of focal and re-entrant excitation with a spatial resolution of 40 mm, respectively. The general approach allows its application to any multi-lead ECG system. This represents a significant extension to our previously developed algorithms to predict the AF origins in association with focal activities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aQxhzqSSQ_s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Multiregional integration in the brain during resting-state fMRI activity</title>

Data-driven models of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity can elucidate dependencies that involve the combination of multiple brain regions. Activity in some regions during resting-state fMRI can be predicted with high accuracy from the activities of other regions. However, it remains unclear in which regions activity depends on unique integration of multiple predictor regions. To address this question, sparse (parsimonious) models could serve to better determine key interregional dependencies by reducing false positives. We used resting-state fMRI data from 46 subjects, and for each region of interest (ROI) per subject we performed whole-brain recursive feature elimination (RFE) to select the minimal set of ROIs that best predicted activity in the modeled ROI. We quantified the dependence of activity on multiple predictor ROIs, by measuring the gain in prediction accuracy of models that incorporated multiple predictor ROIs compared to models that used a single predictor ROI. We identified regions that showed considerable evidence of multiregional integration and determined the key regions that contributed to their observed activity. Our models reveal fronto-parietal integration networks, little integration in primary sensory regions, as well as redundancy between some regions. Our study demonstrates the utility of whole-brain RFE to generate data-driven models with minimal sets of ROIs that predict activity with high accuracy. By determining the extent to which activity in each ROI depended on integration of signals from multiple ROIs, we find cortical integration networks during resting-state activity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_quXv8wu9Yo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Quantitative muscle ultrasound detects disease progression in Duchenne muscular dystrophy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24904</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24904</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: We assessed changes in quantitative muscle ultrasound data in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and healthy controls to determine if ultrasound can serve as a biomarker of disease progression. Two approaches were used: grey scale level (GSL), measured from the ultrasound image, and quantitative backscatter analysis (QBA) measured directly from the received echoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: GSL and QBA were obtained from six unilateral arm/leg muscles in 36 boys with DMD and 28 healthy boys (age 2-14 years) for up to 2 years. We used a linear mixed-effects model with random intercept and slope terms to compare trajectories of GSL, QBA, and functional assessments. We analyzed separately a subset of boys who initiated corticosteroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Compared to healthy boys, increasing GSL in DMD boys &amp;gt;7.0 years was first identified at 6 months (e.g., anterior forearm slope difference of 1.16 arbitrary units/month p=0.004, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.38,1.94]); in boys ≤7 years, differences in GSL first appeared at 12 months (0.82 arbitrary units/month, p=0.04 95%CI [0.075,1.565] in rectus femoris). QBA performed similarly to GSL (e.g., DMD boys &amp;gt;7 years of 0.41dB/month, p=0.01, 95%CI [0.096,0.72] in anterior forearm at 6 months). US identified differences earlier than functional measures including 6-minute walk and supine-to-stand tests. However, neither QBA nor GSL showed an effect of corticosteroid initiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: QBA performs similarly to GSL and both appear more sensitive than functional assessments for detecting muscle deterioration in DMD. Additional studies will be required to determine if quantitative muscle ultrasound can detect therapeutic efficacy. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Serotonin transporter in Parkinson's disease: A meta-analysis of positron emission tomography studies</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful analytical tool for &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; molecular imaging of the human brain. Over the past years, a number of PET studies imaging the serotonin transporter (SERT) have been used and provided evidence for the key role of serotonergic pathology in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we review the role of SERT in the development of motor and nonmotor complications in patients with PD, and we performed a meta-analysis to identify the patterns of SERT pathology and the relevance to symptoms. Consistent SERT pathology in raphe nuclei, striatum, thalamus, and hypothalamus and associations with aging, PD progression, development of dyskinesias, and cognitive decline were observed.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24872-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To report the identification of microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 1B as the antigen of the previously described Purkinje cell cytoplasmic antibody type 2 (PCA-2) antibody, its frequency, and clinical, oncological, and serological associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24872-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archival serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens were available from 96 of 118 consecutive PCA-2-IgG–seropositive patients identified during 1993–2016. The autoantigen, defined in mouse brain lysate by Western blot and mass spectrometry, was confirmed by dual immunohistochemical staining using commercial antibodies. The major antigenic region was defined by Western blot using recombinant protein fragments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24872-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IgG in 95 of 96 patients’ serum or CSF (but in none of 98 healthy or disease control subjects’ serum specimens) bound to recombinant MAP1B. A minority (17.5%) of patients’ IgG also bound to MAP1A. PCA-2 was often accompanied by additional neural autoantibody markers of small-cell carcinoma, including collapsin response-mediated protein 5 (CRMP5) IgG (26%) or antineuronal nuclear antibody type 1 (ANNA-1) IgG (also known as anti-Hu; 13%). Neurological manifestations in 95 patients were (in decreasing frequency): peripheral neuropathy, 53%; cerebellar ataxia, dysmetria, or dysarthria, 38%; and encephalopathy, 27%. Cancer (majority small-cell lung carcinoma [SCLC]) was detected in 66 of 84 evaluated patients (79%). The MAP1B (PCA-2) autoantibody detection rate, among approximately 70,000 patients undergoing service neural autoantibody evaluation in 2015, was 0.024%, equaling amphiphysin IgG (0.026%) and more common than ANNA-2 (also known as anti-Ri; 0.016%) and PCA-Tr (also known as delta/notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor [DNER]; 0.006%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24872-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAP1B, the PCA-2 autoantigen, represents a novel target in paraneoplastic neurological disorders and has high predictive value for SCLC. Its relatively high prevalence, compared with other recognized paraneoplastic neural autoantibodies, justifies its testing in comprehensive paraneoplastic neural autoantibody evaluation. Ann Neurol 2017;81:266–277&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Eye-tracking–based assessment suggests preserved well-being in locked-in patients</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assessed quality of life (QoL) and psychological well-being in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis–induced locked-in state and their next of kin in a fully unbiased manner using eye-tracking computer systems. Eleven of 30 screened patients and 9 next of kin completed study procedures. Patients reported good QoL, which appeared to be at the cost of the QoL of their next of kin. Next of kin rated their own or patients’ QoL similarly, but they identified different areas as important as compared with patients. Our results are of importance for the discussion of end-of-life decisions and the evaluation of patients’ presumed wishes as well as for psychosocial interventions.

&lt;p&gt;Many people still associate brain glucose metabolism with neurons. A new report shows that stimulation of astrocytic glutamate uptake increases glucose utilization, suggesting that astrocytes play a major role in the glucose uptake signal. However, this still reflects synaptic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors: Jeffrey W. Dalley &amp;amp; Trevor W. Robbins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to make decisions and act quickly without hesitation can be advantageous in many settings. However, when persistently expressed, impulsive decisions and actions are considered risky, maladaptive and symptomatic of such diverse brain disorders as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, drug addiction and affective disorders. Over &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors: Laurence T. Hunt &amp;amp; Benjamin Y. Hayden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many accounts of reward-based choice argue for distinct component processes that are serial and functionally localized. In this Opinion article, we argue for an alternative viewpoint, in which choices emerge from repeated computations that are distributed across many brain regions. We emphasize how several features &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Reviews Neuroscience 18, 183 (2017).  
            &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrn.2017.6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrn.2017.6&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors: Carlo Sestieri, Gordon L. Shulman &amp;amp; Maurizio Corbetta&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is traditionally associated with attention, perceptual decision making and sensorimotor transformations, but more recent human neuroimaging studies support an additional role in episodic memory retrieval. In this Opinion article, we present a functional–anatomical model of the involvement of the PPC &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Generalizable knowledge outweighs incidental details in prefrontal ensemble code over time</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e22177</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Memories for recent experiences are rich in incidental detail, but with time the brain is thought to extract latent rules and structures common across past experiences. We show that over weeks following the acquisition of two distinct associative memories, neuron firing in the rat prelimbic prefrontal cortex (mPFC) became less selective for perceptual features unique to each association and, with an apparently different time-course, became more selective for common relational features. We further found that during exposure to a novel experimental context, memory expression and neuron selectivity for relational features immediately generalized to the new situation. These neural patterns offer a window into the network-level processes by which the mPFC develops a knowledge structure of the world that can be adaptively applied to new experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Speed and segmentation control mechanisms characterized in rhythmically-active circuits created from spinal neurons produced from genetically-tagged embryonic stem cells</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Flexible neural networks, such as the interconnected spinal neurons that control distinct motor actions, can switch their activity to produce different behaviors. Both excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) spinal neurons are necessary for motor behavior, but the influence of recruiting different ratios of E-to-I cells remains unclear. We constructed synthetic microphysical neural networks, called circuitoids, using precise combinations of spinal neuron subtypes derived from mouse stem cells. Circuitoids of purified excitatory interneurons were sufficient to generate oscillatory bursts with properties similar to in vivo central pattern generators. Inhibitory V1 neurons provided dual layers of regulation within excitatory rhythmogenic networks - they increased the rhythmic burst frequency of excitatory V3 neurons, and segmented excitatory motor neuron activity into sub-networks. Accordingly, the speed and pattern of spinal circuits that underlie complex motor behaviors may be regulated by quantitatively gating the intra-network cellular activity ratio of E-to-I neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: A conformational switch regulates the ubiquitin ligase HUWE1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21036</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21036</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 has key roles in tumorigenesis, yet it is unkown how its activity is regulated. We present the crystal structure of a C-terminal part of HUWE1, including the catalytic domain, and reveal an asymmetric auto-inhibited dimer. We show that HUWE1 dimerizes in solution and self-associates in cells, and that both occurs through the crystallographic dimer interface. We demonstrate that HUWE1 is inhibited in cells and that it can be activated by disruption of the dimer interface. We identify a conserved segment in HUWE1 that counteracts dimer formation by associating with the dimerization region intramolecularly. Our studies reveal, intriguingly, that the tumor suppressor p14ARF binds to this segment and may thus shift the conformational equilibrium of HUWE1 toward the inactive state. We propose a model, in which the activity of HUWE1 underlies conformational control in response to physiological cues—a mechanism that may be exploited for cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Transient inhibition and long-term facilitation of locomotion by phasic optogenetic activation of serotonin neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20975</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e20975</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5-HT) is associated with mood and motivation but the function of endogenous 5-HT remains controversial. Here, we studied the impact of phasic optogenetic activation of 5-HT neurons in mice over time scales from seconds to weeks. We found that activating dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-HT neurons induced a strong suppression of spontaneous locomotor behavior in the open field with rapid kinetics (onset ≤1 s). Inhibition of locomotion was independent of measures of anxiety or motor impairment and could be overcome by strong motivational drive. Repetitive place-contingent pairing of activation caused neither place preference nor aversion. However, repeated 15 min daily stimulation caused a persistent increase in spontaneous locomotion to emerge over three weeks. These results show that 5-HT transients have strong and opposing short and long-term effects on motor behavior that appear to arise from effects on the underlying factors that motivate actions.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Distinct modes of SMAD2 chromatin binding and remodeling shape the transcriptional response to NODAL/Activin signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22474</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e22474</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;NODAL/Activin signaling orchestrates key processes during embryonic development via SMAD2. How SMAD2 activates programs of gene expression that are modulated over time however, is not known. Here we delineate the sequence of events that occur from SMAD2 binding to transcriptional activation, and the mechanisms underlying them. NODAL/Activin signaling induces dramatic chromatin landscape changes, and a dynamic transcriptional network regulated by SMAD2, acting via multiple mechanisms. Crucially we have discovered two modes of SMAD2 binding. SMAD2 can bind pre-acetylated nucleosome-depleted sites. However, it also binds to unacetylated, closed chromatin, independently of pioneer factors, where it induces nucleosome displacement and histone acetylation. For a subset of genes, this requires SMARCA4. We find that long term modulation of the transcriptional responses requires continued NODAL/Activin signaling. Thus SMAD2 binding does not linearly equate with transcriptional kinetics, and our data suggest that SMAD2 recruits multiple co-factors during sustained signaling to shape the downstream transcriptional program.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Aberrant corticosteroid metabolism in tumor cells enables GR takeover in enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20183</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e20183</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer is driven by androgen stimulation of the androgen receptor (AR). The next-generation AR antagonist, enzalutamide, prolongs survival, but resistance and lethal disease eventually prevail. Emerging data suggest that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is upregulated in this context, stimulating expression of AR-target genes that permit continued growth despite AR blockade. However, countering this mechanism by administration of GR antagonists is problematic because GR is essential for life. We show that enzalutamide treatment in human models of prostate cancer and patient tissues is accompanied by a ubiquitin E3-ligase, AMFR, mediating loss of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11β-HSD2), which otherwise inactivates cortisol, sustaining tumor cortisol concentrations to stimulate GR and enzalutamide resistance. Remarkably, reinstatement of 11β-HSD2 expression, or AMFR loss, reverses enzalutamide resistance in mouse xenograft tumors. Together, these findings reveal a surprising metabolic mechanism of enzalutamide resistance that may be targeted with a strategy that circumvents a requirement for systemic GR ablation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Spontaneous activation of visual pigments in relation to openness/closedness of chromophore-binding pocket</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18492</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e18492</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual pigments can be spontaneously activated by internal thermal energy, generating noise that interferes with real-light detection. Recently, we developed a physicochemical theory that successfully predicts the rate of spontaneous activity of representative rod and cone pigments from their peak-absorption wavelength (λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;), with pigments having longer λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; being noisier. Interestingly, cone pigments may generally be ~25 fold noisier than rod pigments of the same λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, possibly ascribed to an ‘open’ chromophore-binding pocket in cone pigments defined by the capability of chromophore-exchange in darkness. Here, we show in mice that the λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;-dependence of pigment noise could be extended even to a mutant pigment, E122Q-rhodopsin. Moreover, although E122Q-rhodopsin shows some cone-pigment-like characteristics, its noise remained quantitatively predictable by the ‘non-open’ nature of its chromophore-binding pocket as in wild-type rhodopsin. The openness/closedness of the chromophore-binding pocket is potentially a useful indicator of whether a pigment is intended for detecting dim or bright light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cytokine IL-17 is expressed in the brain, but its function is not known. Chen et al. found that the Caenorhabditis elegans orthologue of IL-17 regulates the aggregation of worms following a rise in environmental oxygen and that it mediates this effect by &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronic use of opioid analgesics can cause analgesic tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH), contributing to dose escalation in patients. Corder et al. here provide evidence that, in mice, these unwanted effects, and the underlying altered circuit plasticity, are mediated by μ opioid receptors (MORs) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support neural circuit stability and memory function, new synapses must be selectively pruned or maintained. Li et al. used two-photon imaging of the dendritic spines of mouse primary motor cortex pyramidal neurons to demonstrate the role of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms that regulate synaptic vesicle recycling are unclear. Here, Li et al. show that Ca2+ sensors that drive vesicle fusion also influence vesicle endocytosis. High-resolution recordings of fluorescently tagged vesicles revealed a role of synaptotagmin 1 in the regulation of the &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuronal activity promotes glycolysis at terminals to sustain synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling; however, the underlying mechanisms are not known. Ashrafi et al. expressed a pHluorin-tagged variant of the glucose transporter GLUT4 in rat hippocampal neurons and showed that, with sustained firing of action potentials, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disruption of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) signalling in the prefrontal cortex has been suggested to underlie cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. In this study, mice expressing a variant of human nAChR subunit α5 implicated in schizophrenia showed impaired sociability and sensorimotor gating. Two-photon calcium imaging revealed &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Neurons affected in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) experience mitochondrial dysfunction and a bioenergetic deficit that occurs early and promotes the disease-defining amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) and Tau pathologies. Emerging findings suggest that the autophagy/lysosome pathway that removes damaged mitochondria (mitophagy) is also compromised in AD, resulting in the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. Results in animal and cellular models of AD and in patients with sporadic late-onset AD suggest that impaired mitophagy contributes to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits by triggering Aβ and Tau accumulation through increases in oxidative damage and cellular energy deficits; these, in turn, impair mitophagy.</description>

	<title>: Cap-proximal nucleotides via differential eIF4E binding and alternative promoter usage mediate translational response to energy stress</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcription start-site (TSS) selection and alternative promoter (AP) usage contribute to gene expression complexity but little is known about their impact on translation. Here we performed TSS mapping of the translatome following energy stress. Assessing the contribution of cap-proximal TSS nucleotides, we found dramatic effect on translation only upon stress. As eIF4E levels were reduced, we determined its binding to capped-RNAs with different initiating nucleotides and found the lowest affinity to 5'cytidine in correlation with the translational stress-response. In addition, the number of differentially translated APs was elevated following stress. These include novel glucose starvation-induced downstream transcripts for the translation regulators eIF4A and Pabp, which are also translationally-induced despite general translational inhibition. The resultant eIF4A protein is N-terminally truncated and acts as eIF4A inhibitor. The induced Pabp isoform has shorter 5'UTR removing an auto-inhibitory element. Our findings uncovered several levels of coordination of transcription and translation responses to energy stress.&lt;/p&gt;
