	<description>&lt;p&gt;Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence in neuroscience suggests that
organisms represent or model their environment by minimizing a variational
free-energy bound on the surprise associated with sensory signals from the
environment. In this paper, we study phase transitions in coupled dissipative
dynamical systems (complex Ginzburg-Landau equations) under a variety of
coupling conditions to model the exchange of a system (agent) with its
environment. We show that arbitrary coupling between sensory signals and the
internal state of a system -- or those between its action and external
(environmental) states -- do not guarantee synchronous dynamics between
external and internal states: the spatial structure and the temporal dynamics
of sensory signals and action (that comprise the system's Markov blanket) have
to be pruned to produce synchrony. This synchrony is necessary for an agent to
infer environmental states -- a pre-requisite for survival. Therefore, such
sentient dynamics, relies primarily on approximate synchronization between the
agent and its niche.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08261</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this work we challenge the main conclusions of Gu et al work
(Controllability of structural brain networks. Nature communications 6, 8414,
doi:10.1038/ncomms9414, 2015) on brain controllability. Using the same methods
and analyses on four datasets we find that the minimum set of nodes to control
brain networks is always larger than one. We also find that the relationships
between the average/modal controllability and weighted degrees also hold for
randomized data and the there are not specific roles played by Resting State
Networks in controlling the brain. In conclusion, we show that there is no
evidence that topology plays specific and unique roles in the controllability
of brain networks. Accordingly, Gu et al. interpretation of their results, in
particular in terms of translational applications (e.g. using single node
controllability properties to define target region(s) for neurostimulation)
should be revisited. Though theoretically intriguing, our understanding of the
relationship between controllability and structural brain network remains
elusive.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Connectivity patterns of relevance in neuroscience and systems biology can be
encoded in hierarchical modular networks (HMNs). Moreover, recent studies
highlight the role of hierarchical modular organization in shaping brain
activity patterns, providing an excellent substrate to promote both the
segregation and integration of neural information. Here we propose an extensive
numerical analysis of the critical spreading rate (or &quot;epidemic&quot; threshold)
--separating a phase with endemic persistent activity from one in which
activity ceases-- on diverse HMNs. By employing analytical and computational
techniques we determine the nature of such a threshold and scrutinize how it
depends on general structural features of the underlying HMN. We critically
discuss the extent to which current graph-spectral methods can be applied to
predict the onset of spreading in HMNs, and we propose the network topological
dimension as a relevant and unifying structural parameter, controlling the
epidemic threshold.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Quantum probability updating from zero prior (by-passing Cromwell's rule). (arXiv:1705.08128v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08128</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08128</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cromwell's rule (also known as the zero priors paradox) refers to the
constraint of classical probability theory that if one assigns a prior
probability of 0 or 1 to a hypothesis, then the posterior has to be 0 or 1 as
well (this is a straightforward implication of how Bayes's rule works).
Relatedly, hypotheses with a very low prior cannot be updated to have a very
high posterior without a tremendous amount of new evidence to support them (or
to make other possibilities highly improbable). Cromwell's rule appears at odds
with our intuition of how humans update probabilities. In this work, we report
two simple decision making experiments, which seem to be inconsistent with
Cromwell's rule. Quantum probability theory, the rules for how to assign
probabilities from the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, provides an
alternative framework for probabilistic inference. An advantage of quantum
probability theory is that it is not subject to Cromwell's rule and it can
accommodate changes from zero or very small priors to significant posteriors.
We outline a model of decision making, based on quantum theory, which can
accommodate the changes from priors to posteriors, observed in our experiments.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding how the brain learns to compute functions reliably, efficiently
and robustly with noisy spiking activity is a fundamental challenge in
neuroscience. Most sensory and motor tasks can be described as dynamical
systems and could presumably be learned by adjusting connection weights in a
recurrent biological neural network. However, this is greatly complicated by
the credit assignment problem for learning in recurrent network, e.g. the
contribution of each connection to the global output error cannot be determined
based only on locally accessible quantities to the synapse. Combining tools
from adaptive control theory and efficient coding theories, we propose that
neural circuits can indeed learn complex dynamic tasks with local synaptic
plasticity rules as long as they associate two experimentally established
neural mechanisms. First, they should receive top-down feedbacks driving both
their activity and their synaptic plasticity. Second, inhibitory interneurons
should maintain a tight balance between excitation and inhibition in the
circuit. The resulting networks could learn arbitrary dynamical systems and
produce irregular spike trains as variable as those observed experimentally.
Yet, this variability in single neurons may hide an extremely efficient and
robust computation at the population level.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08026</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding how recurrent neural circuits can learn to implement dynamical
systems is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. The credit assignment
problem, i.e. determining the local contribution of each synapse to the
network's global output error, is a major obstacle in deriving biologically
plausible local learning rules. Moreover, spiking recurrent networks
implementing such tasks should not be hugely costly in terms of number of
neurons and spikes, as they often are when adapted from rate models. Finally,
these networks should be robust to noise and neural deaths in order to sustain
these representations in the face of such naturally occurring perturbation. We
approach this problem by fusing the theory of efficient, balanced spiking
networks (EBN) with nonlinear adaptive control theory. Local learning rules are
ensured by feeding back into the network its own error, resulting in a synaptic
plasticity rule depending solely on presynaptic inputs and post-synaptic
feedback. The efficiency and robustness of the network are guaranteed by
maintaining a tight excitatory/inhibitory balance, ensuring that each spike
represents a local projection of the global output error and minimizes a loss
function. The resulting networks can learn to implement complex dynamics with
very small numbers of neurons and spikes, exhibit the same spike train
variability as observed experimentally, and are extremely robust to noise and
neuronal loss.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural time-series data contain a wide variety of prototypical signal
waveforms (atoms) that are of significant importance in clinical and cognitive
research. One of the goals for analyzing such data is hence to extract such
'shift-invariant' atoms. Even though some success has been reported with
existing algorithms, they are limited in applicability due to their heuristic
nature. Moreover, they are often vulnerable to artifacts and impulsive noise,
which are typically present in raw neural recordings. In this study, we address
these issues and propose a novel probabilistic convolutional sparse coding
(CSC) model for learning shift-invariant atoms from raw neural signals
containing potentially severe artifacts. In the core of our model, which we
call $\alpha$CSC, lies a family of heavy-tailed distributions called
$\alpha$-stable distributions. We develop a novel, computationally efficient
Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm for inference. The maximization
step boils down to a weighted CSC problem, for which we develop a
computationally efficient optimization algorithm. Our results show that the
proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art convergence speeds. Besides,
$\alpha$CSC is significantly more robust to artifacts when compared to three
competing algorithms: it can extract spike bursts, oscillations, and even
reveal more subtle phenomena such as cross-frequency coupling when applied to
noisy neural time series.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Avalanches with power-law distributed size parameters have been observed in
neuronal networks. This observation might be a manifestation of the
self-organized criticality (SOC). Yet, the physiological mechanicsm of this
behavior is currently unknown. Describing synaptic noise as transmission
failures mainly originating from the probabilistic nature of neurotransmitter
release, this study investigates the potential of this noise as a mechanism for
driving the functional architecture of the neuronal networks towards SOC. To
this end, a simple finite state neuron model, with activity dependent and
synapse specific failure probabilities, was built based on the known anatomical
connectivity data of the nematode Ceanorhabditis elegans. Beginning from random
values, it was observed that synaptic noise levels picked out a set of synapses
and consequently an active subnetwork which generates power-law distributed
neuronal avalanches. The findings of this study brings up the possibility that
synaptic failures might be a component of physiological processes underlying
SOC in neuronal networks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A key problem with neuroprostheses and brain monitoring interfaces is that
they need extreme energy efficiency. One way of lowering energy is to use the
low power modes avail- able on the processors embedded in these devices. We
present a technique to predict when neuronal activity of interest is likely to
occur, so that the processor can run at nominal operating frequency at those
times, and be placed in low power modes otherwise. To achieve this, we discover
that branch predictors can also predict brain activity. By performing brain
surgeries on awake and anesthetized mice, we evaluate several branch predictors
and find that perceptron branch predictors can predict cerebellar activity with
accuracies as high as 85%. Consequently, we co-opt branch predictors to dictate
when to transition between low power and normal operating modes, saving as much
as 59% of processor energy.

	<description>Some images stick in your mind for days or even years, while others seem to vanish quickly from memory. We tested whether differences in image memorability 1) are already evident immediately after encoding, 2) produce different rates of forgetting, and 3) whether the retrieval of images with different memorability scores affords differential degrees of cognitive load, mirrored by graded pupillary and blink rate responses. We monitored participants' eye activity while they viewed a sequence of &amp;gt;1200 images in a repetition detection paradigm. 240 target images from 3 non-overlapping memorability classes were repeated at 4 different lags. Overall, performance decreased log-linearly with time. Differences in memorability were already visible at the shortest lag (~20 sec) and became more pronounced as time passed on. The rate of forgetting was steepest for low memorable images. We found that pupils dilated significantly more to correctly identified targets than correctly rejected distractors. Importantly, this &quot;pupil old/new effect&quot; increased with increasing number of lags and decreasing image memorability. A similar modulation of blink rates corroborated these findings. These results suggest that during memory retrieval of scenes, image inherent characteristics pose differential degrees of cognitive load on observers as seen in their eyes.</description>

Chromosomal organization in 3D plays a central role in regulating cell-type specific transcriptional and DNA replication timing programs. Yet it remains unclear to what extent the resulting long-range contacts depend on specific molecular drivers. Here we propose a model that comprehensively assesses the influence on contacts of DNA-binding proteins, cis-regulatory elements and DNA consensus motifs. Using real data, we validate a large number of predictions for long-range contacts involving known architectural proteins and DNA motifs. Our model outperforms existing approaches including enrichment test, random forests and correlation, and it uncovers numerous novel long-range contacts in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; and human. The model uncovers the orientation-dependent specificity for long-range contacts between CTCF motifs in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, highlighting its conserved property in 3D organization of metazoan genomes. Our model further unravels long-range contacts depending on co-factors recruited to DNA indirectly, as illustrated by the influence of cohesin in stabilizing long-range contacts between CTCF sites. It also reveals asymmetric contacts such as enhancer-promoter contacts that highlight opposite influences of the transcription factors EBF1, EGR1 or MEF2C depending on RNA Polymerase II pausing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oZ3iZ-1Rv7Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24936-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Apolipoprotein-related MOrtality RISk study, we enrolled 636,132 men and women during 1985–1996 in Stockholm, Sweden, with measurements of serum glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B (apoB), and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were either directly measured or calculated from total cholesterol, triglycerides, and apoA-I. The cohort was followed until the end of 2011. We used Cox models and mixed-effects models to, first, estimate the associations between these biomarkers and ALS incidence and, second, to assess the changes of these biomarkers during the 20 years before ALS diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24936-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One-unit increase of LDL-C (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02–1.27), apoB (HR = 1.68; 95% CI = 1.17–2.42), and apoB/apoA-I ratio (HR = 1.90; 95% CI = 1.29–2.78) was associated with a higher incidence of ALS. High glucose level (≥6.11mmol/L) was associated with a lower incidence (HR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.42–0.93), whereas high LDL-C/HDL-C (≥3.50; HR = 1.50; 95% CI = 1.15–1.96) and high apoB/apoA-I (≥0.90 for men, ≥0.8 for women; HR = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.04–1.90) ratios were associated with a higher incidence. During the 10 years before diagnosis, ALS patients had increasing levels of LDL-C, HDL-C, apoB, and apoA-I, whereas gradually decreasing levels of LDL-C/HDL-C and apoB/apoA-I ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24936-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alterations in the carbohydrate, lipid, and apolipoprotein metabolisms are associated with ALS risk and may serve as prodromal symptoms decades before ALS diagnosis. The imbalance between apoB and apoA-I as well as between LDL-C and HDL-C may be an etiological mechanism for ALS and needs to be further studied.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Are midsagittal tissue bridges predictive of outcome after cervical spinal cord injury?</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted scans provided data on the extent and dynamics of neuronal tissue damage and midsagittal tissue bridges at the epicenter of traumatic cervical spinal cord lesions in 24 subacute tetraplegic patients. At 1 month postinjury, smaller lesion area and midsagittal tissue bridges identified those patients with lower extremity evoked potentials and better clinical recovery. Wider midsagittal tissue bridges and smaller lesions at 1 month post-injury were associated with neurological and functional recovery at 1-year follow-up. Neuroimaging biomarkers of lesion size and midsagittal tissue bridges are potential outcome predictors and patient stratifiers in both subacute and chronic clinical trials.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Global exosome transcriptome profiling reveals biomarkers for multiple sclerosis</title>

In this study, we investigated the total circulating exosome transcriptome in relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients and healthy controls (HC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24931-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to define the global RNA profile of serum exosomes in 19 RRMS patients (9 in relapse, 10 in remission) and 10 HC. We analyzed 5 million reads and &amp;gt;50,000 transcripts per sample, including a detailed analysis of microRNAs (miRNAs) differentially expressed in RRMS. The discovery set data were validated by quantification using digital quantitative polymerase chain reaction with an independent cohort of 63 RRMS patients (33 in relapse, 30 in remission) and 32 HC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24931-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exosomal RNA NGS revealed that of 15 different classes of transcripts detected, 4 circulating exosomal sequences within the miRNA category were differentially expressed in RRMS patients versus HC: hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-196b-5p, hsa-miR-301a-3p, and hsa-miR-532-5p. Serum exosomal expression of these miRNAs was significantly decreased during relapse in RRMS. These miRNAs were also decreased in patients with a gadolinium enhancement on brain magnetic resonance imaging. In vitro secretion of these miRNAs by peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also significantly impaired in RRMS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24931-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data show that circulating exosomes have a distinct RNA profile in RRMS. Because putative targets for these miRNAs include the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and the cell cycle regulator aryl hydrocarbon receptor, the data suggest a disturbed cell-to-cell communication in this disease. Thus, exosomal miRNAs might represent a useful biomarker to distinguish multiple sclerosis relapse. Ann Neurol 2017;81:703–717&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Tailoring epilepsy surgery with fast ripples in the intraoperative electrocorticogram</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24928-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) can be used to delineate the resection area in epilepsy surgery. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs; 80–500 Hz) seem better biomarkers for epileptogenic tissue than spikes. We studied how HFOs and spikes in combined pre- and postresection ECoG predict surgical outcome in different tailoring approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24928-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We, retrospectively, marked HFOs, divided into fast ripples (FRs; 250–500 Hz) and ripples (80–250 Hz), and spikes in pre- and postresection ECoG sampled at 2,048 Hz in people with refractory focal epilepsy. We defined four groups of electroencephalography (EEG) event occurrence: pre+post− (+/−), pre+post+ (+/+), pre−post+ (−/+) and pre−post− (−/−). We subcategorized three tailoring approaches: hippocampectomy with tailoring for neocortical involvement; lesionectomy of temporal lesions with tailoring for mesiotemporal involvement; and lesionectomy with tailoring for surrounding neocortical involvement. We compared the percentage of resected pre-EEG events, time to recurrence, and the different tailoring approaches to outcome (seizure-free vs recurrence).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24928-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We included 54 patients (median age, 15.5 years; 25 months of follow-up; 30 seizure free). The percentage of resected FRs, ripples, or spikes in pre-ECoG did not predict outcome. The occurrence of FRs in post-ECoG, given FRs in pre-ECoG (+/−, +/+), predicted outcome (hazard ratio, 3.13; confidence interval = 1.22–6.25; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01). Seven of 8 patients without spikes in pre-ECoG were seizure free. The highest predictive value for seizure recurrence was presence of FRs in post-ECoG for all tailoring approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24928-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRs that persist before and after resection predict poor postsurgical outcome. These findings hold for different tailoring approaches. FRs can thus be used for tailoring epilepsy surgery with repeated intraoperative ECoG measurements.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Randomized clinical trial of deep brain stimulation for poststroke pain</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24927-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience with deep brain stimulation (DBS) for pain is largely based on uncontrolled studies targeting the somatosensory pathways, with mixed results. We hypothesized that targeting limbic neural pathways would modulate the affective sphere of pain and alleviate suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24927-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study of DBS targeting the ventral striatum/anterior limb of the internal capsule (VS/ALIC) in 10 patients with poststroke pain syndrome. One month after bilateral DBS, patients were randomized to active DBS or sham for 3 months, followed by crossover for another 3-month period. The primary endpoint was a ≥50% improvement on the Pain Disability Index in 50% of patients with active DBS compared to sham. This 6-month blinded phase was followed by an 18-month open stimulation phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24927-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine participants completed randomization. Although this trial was negative for its primary and secondary endpoints, we did observe significant differences in multiple outcome measures related to the affective sphere of pain (eg, Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Affective Pain Rating Index of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire). Fourteen serious adverse events were recorded and resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24927-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;VS/ALIC DBS to modulate the affective sphere of pain represents a paradigm shift in chronic pain management. Although this exploratory study was negative for its primary endpoint, VS/ALIC DBS demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and statistically significant improvements on multiple outcome measures related to the affective sphere of pain. Therefore, we believe these results justify further work on neuromodulation therapies targeting the affective sphere of pain.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24938-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess prognostic factors for a second clinical attack and a first disability-worsening event in pediatric clinically isolated syndrome (pCIS) suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24938-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cohort of 770 pCIS patients was followed up for at least 10 years. Cox proportional hazard models and Recursive Partitioning and Amalgamation (RECPAM) tree-regression were used to analyze data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24938-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In pCIS, female sex and a multifocal onset were risk factors for a second clinical attack (hazard ratio [HR], 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.28, 1.06–1.55; 1.42, 1.10–1.84, respectively), whereas disease-modifying drug (DMD) exposure reduced this risk (HR, 95% CI = 0.75, 0.60–0.95). After pediatric onset MS (POMS) diagnosis, age at onset younger than 15 years and DMD exposure decreased the risk of a first Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)-worsening event (HR, 95% CI = 0.59, 0.42–0.83; 0.75, 0.71–0.80, respectively), whereas the occurrence of relapse increased this risk (HR, 95% CI = 5.08, 3.46–7.46). An exploratory RECPAM analysis highlighted a significantly higher incidence of a first EDSS-worsening event in patients with multifocal or isolated spinal cord or optic neuritis involvement at onset in comparison to those with an isolated supratentorial or brainstem syndrome. A Cox regression model including RECPAM classes confirmed DMD exposure as the most protective factor against EDSS-worsening events and relapses as the most important risk factor for attaining EDSS worsening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24938-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work represents a step forward in identifying predictors of unfavorable course in pCIS and POMS and supports a protective effect of early DMD treatment in preventing MS development and disability accumulation in this population.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Myoclonus epilepsy and ataxia due to KCNC1 mutation: Analysis of 20 cases and K+ channel properties</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24929</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24929</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24929-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To comprehensively describe the new syndrome of myoclonus epilepsy and ataxia due to potassium channel mutation (MEAK), including cellular electrophysiological characterization of observed clinical improvement with fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24929-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed clinical, electroclinical, and neuroimaging data for 20 patients with MEAK due to recurrent &lt;em&gt;KCNC1&lt;/em&gt; p.R320H mutation. In vitro electrophysiological studies were conducted using whole cell patch-clamp to explore biophysical properties of wild-type and mutant K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.1 channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24929-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms began at between 3 and 15 years of age (median = 9.5), with progressively severe myoclonus and rare tonic–clonic seizures. Ataxia was present early, but quickly became overshadowed by myoclonus; 10 patients were wheelchair-bound by their late teenage years. Mild cognitive decline occurred in half. Early death was not observed. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed generalized spike and polyspike wave discharges, with documented photosensitivity in most. Polygraphic EEG–electromyographic studies demonstrated a cortical origin for myoclonus and striking coactivation of agonist and antagonist muscles. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed symmetrical cerebellar atrophy, which appeared progressive, and a prominent corpus callosum. Unexpectedly, transient clinical improvement with fever was noted in 6 patients. To explore this, we performed high-temperature in vitro recordings. At elevated temperatures, there was a robust leftward shift in activation of wild-type K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.1, increasing channel availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24929-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEAK has a relatively homogeneous presentation, resembling Unverricht–Lundborg disease, despite the genetic and biological basis being quite different. A remarkable improvement with fever may be explained by the temperature-dependent leftward shift in activation of wild-type K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.1 subunit–containing channels, which would counter the loss of function observed for mutant channels, highlighting &lt;em&gt;KCNC1&lt;/em&gt; as a potential target for precision therapeutics. Ann Neurol 2017;81:677–689&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Feedback inhibition shapes emergent computational properties of cortical microcircuit motifs. (arXiv:1705.07614v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical microcircuits are very complex networks, but they are composed of a
relatively small number of stereotypical motifs. Hence one strategy for
throwing light on the computational function of cortical microcircuits is to
analyze emergent computational properties of these stereotypical microcircuit
motifs. We are addressing here the question how spike-timing dependent
plasticity (STDP) shapes the computational properties of one motif that has
frequently been studied experimentally: interconnected populations of pyramidal
cells and parvalbumin-positive inhibitory cells in layer 2/3. Experimental
studies suggest that these inhibitory neurons exert some form of divisive
inhibition on the pyramidal cells. We show that this data-based form of
feedback inhibition, which is softer than that of winner-take-all models that
are commonly considered in theoretical analyses, contributes to the emergence
of an important computational function through STDP: The capability to
disentangle superimposed firing patterns in upstream networks, and to represent
their information content through a sparse assembly code.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Exponential Capacity in an Autoencoder Neural Network with a Hidden Layer. (arXiv:1705.07441v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07441</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07441</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental aspect of limitations in learning any computation in neural
architectures is characterizing their optimal capacities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important, widely-used neural architecture is known as autoencoders where
the network reconstructs the input at the output layer via a representation at
a hidden layer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though capacities of several neural architectures have been addressed
using statistical physics methods, the capacity of autoencoder neural networks
is not well-explored.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we analytically show that an autoencoder network of binary neurons with
a hidden layer can achieve a capacity that grows exponentially with network
size.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network has fixed random weights encoding a set of dense input patterns
into a dense, expanded (or \emph{overcomplete}) hidden layer representation. A
set of learnable weights decodes the input patters at the output layer. We
perform a mean-field approximation of the model to reduce the model to a
perceptron problem with an input-output dependency. Carrying out Gardner's
\emph{replica} calculation, we show that as the expansion ratio, defined as the
number of hidden units over the number of input units, increases, the
autoencoding capacity grows exponentially even when the sparseness or the
coding level of the hidden layer representation is changed. The
replica-symmetric solution is locally stable and is in good agreement with
simulation results obtained using a local learning rule. In addition, the
degree of symmetry between the encoding and decoding weights monotonically
increases with the expansion ratio.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Self-adjoint eigenvalue problems with low rank perturbations. (arXiv:1705.07360v1 [math.SP])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07360</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider the problem of finding the spectrum of an operator taking the
form of a low-rank (rank one or two) non-normal perturbation of a self-adjoint
operator, motivated by a number of problems of applied interest which take this
form. We use the fact that the system is a low rank perturbation of a symmetric
problem, together with a simple idea of classical differential geometry (the
envelope of a family of curves) to completely analyze the spectrum of this type
of operator. We use these techniques to analyze three problems of this form: a
model of the oculomotor integrator due to Anastasio and Gad (2007), a continuum
integrator model, and a nonlocal model of phase separation due to Rubinstein
and Sternberg (1992).

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Drosophila CaV2 Channels Harboring Human Migraine Mutations Cause Synapse Hyperexcitability That Can Be Suppressed By Inhibition Of A Ca2+ Store Release Pathway</title>

	<description>Gain-of-function mutations in the human CaV2.1 gene CACNA1A cause familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1). To characterize cellular problems potentially triggered by CaV2.1 gains of function, we engineered mutations encoding well-known FHM1 amino-acid substitutions S218L (SL) and R192Q (RQ) into transgenes of Drosophila melanogaster CaV2/cacophony. We expressed the transgenes pan-neuronally. Phenotypes were mild for RQ-expressing animals. By contrast, single mutant SL- and double mutant (DM) SL, RQ-expressing animals showed severe phenotypes, including sharply decreased viability. By electrophysiology, SL- and DM-expressing neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) exhibited enhanced evoked discharges, epileptiform supernumerary discharges when single electrical pulses were applied to the motor nerves, and a dramatic increase in the amplitudes and frequencies of spontaneous miniature events. Some spontaneous events were gigantic (10-40 mV), multi-quantal events. Gigantic spontaneous events were eliminated by application of TTX, or by lowered or chelated Ca2+, suggesting that giant events were elicited by spontaneous presynaptic firing. Interestingly, gain-of-function electrophysiological phenotypes were markedly lessened after genetic knockdown or mutation of Drosophila homologs of phospholipase C{beta} (PLC{beta}), IP3 receptor, or ryanodine receptor (RyR), all factors known to mediate Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Pharmacological inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ store release produced similar effects. Our data suggest inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ signaling could counteract hyperexcitability induced by gain-of-function CaV2.1 amino-acid substitutions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Extended Synaptotagmin Is A Presynaptic ER Ca2+ Sensor That Promotes Neurotransmission And Synaptic Growth In Drosophila</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/141333v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/141333v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an extensive presynaptic organelle, exerting important influences at synapses by responding to Ca2+ and modulating transmission, growth, lipid metabolism, and membrane trafficking. Despite intriguing evidence for these crucial functions, how presynaptic ER influences synaptic physiology remains enigmatic. To gain insight into this question, we have generated and characterized mutations in the single Extended Synaptotagmin (Esyt) ortholog in Drosophila. Esyts are evolutionarily conserved ER proteins with Ca2+ sensing domains that have recently been shown to orchestrate membrane tethering and lipid exchange between the ER and plasma membrane. We first demonstrate that Esyt localizes to an extensive ER structure that invades presynaptic terminals at the neuromuscular junction. Next, we show that synaptic growth, structure, function, and plasticity are surprisingly unperturbed at synapses lacking Esyt expression. However, presynaptic overexpression of Esyt leads to enhanced synaptic growth, neurotransmission, and sustainment of the vesicle pool during intense levels of activity, suggesting that elevated Esyt at the ER promotes constitutive membrane trafficking or lipid exchange with the plasma membrane. Finally, we find that Esyt mutants fail to maintain basal neurotransmission and short term plasticity at elevated extracellular Ca2+, consistent with Esyt functioning as an ER Ca2+ sensor that modulates synaptic activity. Thus, we identify Esyt as a presynaptic ER Ca2+ sensor that can promote neurotransmission and synaptic growth, revealing the first in vivo neuronal functions of this conserved gene family.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Multisite Generalizability Of Schizophrenia Diagnosis Classification Based On Functional Brain Connectivity</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/141192v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Our objective was to assess the generalizability, across sites and cognitive contexts, of schizophrenia classification based on functional brain connectivity. We tested different training-test scenarios combining fMRI data from 191 schizophrenia patients and 191 matched healthy controls obtained at 6 scanning sites and under different task conditions. Diagnosis classification accuracy generalized well to a novel site and cognitive context provided data from multiple sites were used for classifier training. By contrast, lower classification accuracy was achieved when data from a single distinct site was used for training. These findings indicate that it is beneficial to use multisite data to train fMRI-based classifiers intended for large-scale use in the clinical realm.</description>

	<description>Recent progress in neuro-prosthetic technology gives rise to the hope that in the future blind people might regain some degree of visual perception. It was shown that electrically stimulating the brain can be used to produce simple visual impressions of light blobs (phosphenes). However, this perception is very far away from natural sight. For developing the next generation of visual prostheses, real-time closed-loop stimulators which measure the actual neuronal activities and on this basis determine the required stimulation pattern. This leads to the challenge to design a system that can produce arbitrary stimulation-patterns with up to {+/-} 70V and with up to 25mA while measuring neuronal signals with amplitudes in the order of mV. Furthermore, the interruption of the measurement by stimulation must be as short as possible and the system needs to scale to hundreds of electrodes. We discuss how such a system and especially its current pumps and input protection need to be designed and which problems arise. We condense our findings into an example design for which we provide all design files (boards, firmwares and software) as open-source. This is a first step in taking the existing open-source www.open-ephys.org recording system and converting it into a closed-loop experimental setup for neuro-prosthetic research.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Low-Level Carbon Monoxide Exposure Affects BOLD FMRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/141093v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/141093v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) FMRI is a common technique for measuring brain activation that could be affected by low-level carbon monoxide (CO) exposure from e.g. smoking. This study aimed to probe the vulnerability of BOLD FMRI to CO and determine whether it constitutes a significant confound in neuroimaging and clinical trials. Low-level (6ppm exhaled) CO effects on BOLD signal were assessed in 12 healthy never-smokers on two separate experimental days (CO and air control). FMRI tasks were breath-holds (hypercapnia), visual stimulation and fingertapping. CO significantly dampened global BOLD FMRI signal during hypercapnia and visual cortex activation during visual stimulation. During fingertapping, CO reduced visual cortex activation but increased premotor cortex activation. Behavioural and physiological measures remained unchanged. We conclude that BOLD FMRI is vulnerable to CO, possibly through baseline increases in CBF, and suggest exercising caution when imaging populations exposed to elevated CO levels, e.g. with high smoking prevalence.</description>

	<description>Revealing the membrane current source distribution of neurons is a key step on the way to understanding neural computations, however, the experimental and theoretical tools to achieve sufficient spatiotemporal resolution for the estimation remain to be established. Here we address this problem using extracellularly recorded potentials with arbitrarily distributed electrodes in a neuron of known morphology. We use simulations of models with varying complexity to validate the proposed method and to give recommendations for experimental applications. The method is applied to in vitro data from rat hippocampus.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Loss Of lrrk2 Impairs Cell Proliferation And Neuronal Regeneration In The Zebrafish Brain</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/140608v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>LRRK2 mutations are a major cause of Parkinson's disease. Pathogenicity of LRRK2 loss-of-function is controversial, as knockout in rodents induces no brain-specific effects and knockdown studies in zebrafish are conflicting. Here we show that deletion of the ~60-kbp-long zebrafish lrrk2 locus elicits a pleomorphic, albeit transient brain phenotype in maternal-zygotic mutants (mzLrrk2). Intriguingly, 11-month-old mzLrrk2 adults display increased amine catabolism. Additionally, we find decreased mitosis in the larval brain and reduced stab injury-induced neuronal regeneration in the adult telencephalon. Finally, hypokinesia associates with loss of lrrk2 in larvae. Our results demonstrate that lrrk2 knockout has an early neurodevelopmental effect. We report for the first time perturbed amine catabolism in a LRRK2 knockout. We propose mzLrrk2 zebrafish as a valuable tool to study LRRK2 loss-of-function in vivo, and provide a link between LRRK2 and the control of basal cell proliferation in the brain, potentially critical upon challenges like brain injury.</description>

	<description>Sound stimuli are characterized by their rich spectral and temporal dynamic properties. Individual neurons in auditory cortex (ACX) encode both spectral and temporal aspects of sounds e.g. sound onset and/or offset. While the different fields of the ACX show gradients of frequency selectivity the large-scale organization of sound dynamics is unknown. We used widefield imaging of GCaMP6s in awake mouse ACX combined with a novel unsupervised image segmentation technique to investigate the spatiotemporal representation of sound onset and offset. Using this technique, we identified known auditory fields but also detected novel ACX areas. Furthermore, we found that ACX areas differed in their responses to tone onset and offset. Multiple areas were preferentially activated by tone offset, and on-response areas were more spatially localized than off-response areas. We also found tonotopy in off-responses. Together our results demonstrate a different spatial distribution of neurons across ACX for processing sound onsets versus offsets.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The repetition of behavioral assessments in diagnosis of disorders of consciousness</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24962</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To determine whether repeated examinations using the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised have an impact on diagnostic accuracy of patients with disorders of consciousness and to provide guidelines regarding the number of assessments required for obtaining a reliable diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: 123 adult patients with chronic disorders of consciousness were referred to our tertiary center. They were assessed at least 6 times with the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised within a 10-day period. Clinical diagnoses based on 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 Coma Recovery Scale-Revised assessments were compared with a reference diagnosis (i.e., the highest behavioral diagnosis obtained after 6 evaluations) using non-parametric statistics. Results were considered significant at &lt;em&gt;P&amp;lt;&lt;/em&gt;0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: The number of assessments had a significant effect on the clinical diagnosis. Up to the fourth examination, the diagnosis was still statistically different from the reference diagnosis based on 6 CRS-R assessments. Compared to this reference diagnosis, the first evaluation led to 36% of misdiagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: The number of Coma Recovery Scale-Revised assessments has an impact on the clinical diagnosis of patients with chronic disorders of consciousness. Up to the fourth examinations, behavioral fluctuations may still impact the diagnostic accuracy. We here suggest performing at least 5 assessments in each patient with disorders of consciousness within a short time interval (e.g., 2 weeks) to reduce misdiagnosis.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: There is a need for inexpensive non-invasive tests to identify older healthy persons at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) for enrollment in AD prevention trials. Our objective was to examine whether abnormalities in neuroimaging measures of amyloid and neurodegeneration are correlated with odor identification (OI) in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Cognitively normal (CN) participants had olfactory function assessed using the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT), underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; n=829) to assess a composite Alzheimer's disease (AD) signature cortical thickness and hippocampal volume (HVa), and, &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C-Pittsburgh compound B (&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C-PiB; n=306) and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;fluorodeoxyglucose (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG; n=305) positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to assess amyloid accumulation and brain hypometabolism, respectively. The association of neuroimaging biomarkers with OI was examined using multinomial logistic regression and simple linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Among 829 CN participants (mean age 79.2 years; 51.5% men), 248 (29.9%) were normosmic and 78 (9.4%) had anosmia (B-SIT score &amp;lt;6). Abnormal AD signature cortical thickness and reduced HVa were associated with decreased OI as a continuous measure (slope=-.43; (95%CI -.77, -.09); p=.01 and slope=-.72; (95%CI -1.15, -.28); &amp;lt;.01, respectively). Reduced HVa, decreased AD signature cortical thickness and increased amyloid accumulation were significantly associated with increased odds of anosmia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our findings suggest that OI may be a non-invasive, inexpensive marker for risk stratification, for identifying participants at the preclinical stage of AD who may be at risk for cognitive impairment, and eligible for inclusion in AD prevention clinical trials. These cross-sectional findings remain to be validated prospectively. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We attempt to correlate the clinical pharmacology of dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) in Parkinson Disease with known features of striatal dopamine actions. Despite its obvious impact, DRT does not normalize motor function, likely due to disrupted phasic dopaminergic signaling. The DRT Short Duration Response is likely a permissive-paracrine effect, possibly resulting from dopaminergic support of corticostriate synaptic plasticity. The DRT Long Duration Response may result from mimicry of tonic dopamine signaling regulation of movement vigor. Our understanding of dopamine actions does not explain important aspects of DRT clinical pharmacology. Reducing these knowledge gaps provides opportunities to improve understanding of dopamine actions and symptomatic treatment of Parkinson disease. This article is protected by copyright.

As proteins are synthesized, the nascent polypeptide must pass through a negatively charged exit tunnel. During this stage, positively charged stretches can interact with the ribosome walls and slow the translation. Therefore, charged polypeptides may be important factors that affect protein expression. To determine the frequency and distribution of positively and negatively charged stretches in different proteomes, the net charge was calculated for every 30 consecutive amino acid residues, which corresponds to the length of the ribosome exit tunnel. The following annotated and reviewed proteins in the UniProt database (Swiss-Prot) were analyzed: 551,705 proteins from different organisms and a total of 180 million protein segments. We observed that there were more negative than positive stretches and that super-charged positive sequences (i.e., net charges ≥ 14) were underrepresented in the proteomes. Overall, the proteins were more positively charged at their N-termini and C-termini, and this feature was present in most organisms and subcellular localizations. To investigate whether the N-terminal charges affect the elongation rates, previously published ribosomal profiling data obtained from &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, without translation-interfering drugs, were analyzed. We observed a nonlinear effect of the charge on the ribosome occupancy in which values ≥ +5 and ≤ -6 showed increased and reduced ribosome densities, respectively. These groups also showed different distributions across 80S monosomes and polysomes. Basic polypeptides are more common within short proteins that are translated by monosomes, whereas negative stretches are more abundant in polysome-translated proteins. These findings suggest that the nascent peptide charge impacts translation and can be one of the factors that regulate translation efficiency and protein expression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Kxt6p83cHKs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Recent advances focusing on the metabolic interactions within and between cellular populations have emphasized the importance of microbial communities for human health. Constraint-based modeling, with flux balance analysis in particular, has been established as a key approach for studying microbial metabolism, whereas individual-based modeling has been commonly used to study complex dynamics between interacting organisms. In this study, we combine both techniques into the R package BacArena (https://cran.r-project.org/package=BacArena) to generate novel biological insights into &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; biofilm formation as well as a seven species model community of the human gut. For our &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; model, we found that cross-feeding of fermentation products cause a spatial differentiation of emerging metabolic phenotypes in the biofilm over time. In the human gut model community, we found that spatial gradients of mucus glycans are important for niche formations which shape the overall community structure. Additionally, we could provide novel hypothesis concerning the metabolic interactions between the microbes. These results demonstrate the importance of spatial and temporal multi-scale modeling approaches such as BacArena.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eHxdBudYIgU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Multi-scale computational study of the mechanical regulation of cell mitotic rounding in epithelia</title>

Mitotic rounding during cell division is critical for preventing daughter cells from inheriting an abnormal number of chromosomes, a condition that occurs frequently in cancer cells. Cells must significantly expand their apical area and transition from a polygonal to circular apical shape to achieve robust mitotic rounding in epithelial tissues, which is where most cancers initiate. However, how cells mechanically regulate robust mitotic rounding within packed tissues is unknown. Here, we analyze mitotic rounding using a newly developed multi-scale subcellular element computational model that is calibrated using experimental data. Novel biologically relevant features of the model include separate representations of the sub-cellular components including the apical membrane and cytoplasm of the cell at the tissue scale level as well as detailed description of cell properties during mitotic rounding. Regression analysis of predictive model simulation results reveals the relative contributions of osmotic pressure, cell-cell adhesion and cortical stiffness to mitotic rounding. Mitotic area expansion is largely driven by regulation of cytoplasmic pressure. Surprisingly, mitotic shape roundness within physiological ranges is most sensitive to variation in cell-cell adhesivity and stiffness. An understanding of how perturbed mechanical properties impact mitotic rounding has important potential implications on, amongst others, how tumors progressively become more genetically unstable due to increased chromosomal aneuploidy and more aggressive.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x6-F3T8uB38&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: PyLDM - An open source package for lifetime density analysis of time-resolved spectroscopic data</title>

Ultrafast spectroscopy offers temporal resolution for probing processes in the femto- and picosecond regimes. This has allowed for investigation of energy and charge transfer in numerous photoactive compounds and complexes. However, analysis of the resultant data can be complicated, particularly in more complex biological systems, such as photosystems. Historically, the dual approach of global analysis and target modelling has been used to elucidate kinetic descriptions of the system, and the identity of transient species respectively. With regards to the former, the technique of lifetime density analysis (LDA) offers an appealing alternative. While global analysis approximates the data to the sum of a small number of exponential decays, typically on the order of 2-4, LDA uses a semi-continuous distribution of 100 lifetimes. This allows for the elucidation of lifetime distributions, which may be expected from investigation of complex systems with many chromophores, as opposed to averages. Furthermore, the inherent assumption of linear combinations of decays in global analysis means the technique is unable to describe dynamic motion, a process which is resolvable with LDA. The technique was introduced to the field of photosynthesis over a decade ago by the Holzwarth group. The analysis has been demonstrated to be an important tool to evaluate complex dynamics such as photosynthetic energy transfer, and complements traditional global and target analysis techniques. Although theory has been well described, no open source code has so far been available to perform lifetime density analysis. Therefore, we introduce a python (2.7) based package, PyLDM, to address this need. We furthermore provide a direct comparison of the capabilities of LDA with those of the more familiar global analysis, as well as providing a number of statistical techniques for dealing with the regularization of noisy data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dEpjjfoGzDo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Here, we present a novel approach to solve the problem of reconstructing
perceived stimuli from brain responses by combining probabilistic inference
with deep learning. Our approach first inverts the linear transformation from
latent features to brain responses with maximum a posteriori estimation and
then inverts the nonlinear transformation from perceived stimuli to latent
features with adversarial training of convolutional neural networks. We test
our approach with a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment and show
that it can generate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perceived faces from
brain activations.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Collective behavior among coupled dynamical units can emerge in various forms
as a result of different coupling topologies as well as different types of
coupling functions. Chimera states have recently received ample attention as a
fascinating manifestation of collective behavior, in particular describing a
symmetry breaking spatiotemporal pattern where synchronized and desynchronized
states coexist in a network of coupled oscillators. In this perspective, we
review the emergence of different chimera states, focusing on the effects of
different coupling topologies that describe the interaction network connecting
the oscillators. We cover chimera states that emerge in local, nonlocal and
global coupling topologies, as well as in modular, temporal and multilayer
networks. We also provide an outline of challenges and directions for future
research.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chimera states, namely complex spatiotemporal patterns that consist of
coexisting domains of spatially coherent and incoherent dynamics, are
investigated in a network of coupled identical oscillators. These intriguing
spatiotemporal patterns were first reported in nonlocally coupled phase
oscillators, and it was shown that such mixed type behavior occurs only for
specific initial conditions in nonlocally and globally coupled networks. The
influence of initial conditions on chimera states has remained a fundamental
problem since their discovery. In this report, we investigate the robustness of
chimera states together with incoherent and coherent states in dependence on
the initial conditions. For this, we use the basin stability method which is
related to the volume of the basin of attraction, and we consider nonlocally
and globally coupled time-delayed Mackey-Glass oscillators as example.
Previously, it was shown that the existence of chimera states can be
characterized by mean phase velocity and a statistical measure, such as the
strength of incoherence, by using well prepared initial conditions. Here we
show further how the coexistence of different dynamical states can be
identified and quantified by means of the basin stability measure over a wide
range of the parameter space.

	<description>Measuring synaptic connectivity in large neuronal populations remains a major goal of modern neuroscience. While anatomical methods are advancing, computational techniques for inferring functional connectivity from recordings of neural activity represent a promising avenue of analysis. Here, we report significant improvements to a deep learning method for functional connectomics, as assayed on synthetic ChaLearn Connectomics data. The method, which integrates recent advances in convolutional neural network architecture and model-free partial correlation coefficients, outperforms published methods on competition data and can achieve over 90% precision at 1% recall on validation datasets. This suggests that future application of the model to in vivo whole-brain imaging data in larval zebrafish could reliably recover on the order of 106 synaptic connections with a 10% false discovery rate. The model also generalizes to networks with different underlying connection probabilities and should scale well when parallelized across multiple GPUs. The method offers real potential as a statistical complement to existing experiments and circuit hypotheses in neuroscience.</description>

	<description>Drosophila melanogaster has a rich repertoire of innate and learned behaviors. Its 100,000-neuron brain is a large but tractable target for comprehensive neural circuit mapping. Only electron microscopy (EM) enables complete, unbiased mapping of synaptic connectivity; however, the fly brain is too large for conventional EM. We developed a custom high-throughput EM platform and imaged the entire brain of an adult female fly. We validated the dataset by tracing brain-spanning circuitry involving the mushroom body (MB), intensively studied for its role in learning. Here we describe the complete set of olfactory inputs to the MB; find a new cell type providing driving input to Kenyon cells (the intrinsic MB neurons); identify neurons postsynaptic to Kenyon cell dendrites; and find that axonal arbors providing input to the MB calyx are more tightly clustered than previously indicated by light-level data. This freely available EM dataset will significantly accelerate Drosophila neuroscience.</description>

	<description>Although the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains anchored around the cardinal motor symptoms of bradykinesia, rest tremor, rigidity and postural instability, it is becoming increasingly clear that the clinical phase of the disease is preceded by a long period of neurodegeneration, which is not readily evident in terms of motor dysfunction. The neurobiological mechanisms that underpin this prodromal phase of PD remain poorly understood. Based on converging evidence of basal ganglia (BG) dysfunction in early PD, we set out to establish whether the prodromal phase of the disease is characterized by alterations in functional communication within the input and output structures of the BG. We analyzed resting-state functional MRI data collected from patients with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and/or hyposmia, two of the strongest markers of prodromal PD, in comparison to age-matched controls. Relative to controls, subjects in the prodromal group showed reduced interhemispheric functional connectivity in each of the tested BG nuclei (putamen, caudate, pallidum) as well as reduced striato-pallidal inter- and intrahemshpric connectivity. The data suggest that local interactions between input and output BG structures may be disrupted already in the prodromal phase of PD.</description>

	<description>The neocortex comprises multiple information processing streams mediated by subsets of glutamatergic pyramidal cells (PCs) that receive diverse inputs and project to distinct targets. How GABAergic interneurons regulate the segregation and communication among intermingled PC subsets that contribute to separate brain networks remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that a subset of GABAergic chandelier cells (ChCs) in the prelimbic cortex (PL), which innervate PCs at spike initiation site, selectively control PCs projecting to the basolateral amygdala (BLAPC) compared to those projecting to contralateral cortex (CCPC). These ChCs in turn receive preferential input from local and contralateral CCPCs as opposed to BLAPCs and BLA neurons (the PL-BLA network). Accordingly, optogenetic activation of ChCs rapidly suppresses BLAPCs and BLA activity in freely behaving mice. Thus, the exquisite connectivity of ChCs not only mediates directional inhibition between local PC ensembles but may also shape communication hierarchies between global networks.</description>

	<description>Cebranopadol is a novel agonist of nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide (NOP) and opioid receptors with analgesic properties that is being evaluated in clinical Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials for the treatment of chronic and acute pain. Recent evidence indicates that the combination of opioid and NOP receptor agonism may be a new treatment strategy for cocaine addiction. We sought to extend these findings by examining the effects of cebranopadol on cocaine self-administration (0.5 mg/kg/infusion) and cocaine conditioned reinstatement in rats with extended access to cocaine. Oral administration of cebranopadol (0, 25, and 50 g/kg) reversed the escalation of cocaine self-administration in rats that were given extended (6 h) access to cocaine, whereas it did not affect the self-administration of sweetened condensed milk (SCM). Cebranopadol induced conditioned place preference but did not affect locomotor activity during the conditioning sessions. Finally, cebranopadol blocked the conditioned reinstatement of cocaine seeking. These results show that oral cebranopadol treatment prevented addiction-like behaviors (i.e., the escalation of intake and reinstatement), suggesting that it may be a novel strategy for the treatment of cocaine use disorder. However, the conditioned place preference that was observed after cebranopadol administration suggests that this compound may have some intrinsic rewarding effects.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Correlated Individual Differences Suggest A Common Mechanism Underlying Metacognition In Visual Perception And Visual Short-Term Memory</title>

	<description>Adaptive behavior depends on the ability to accurately introspect about one's own performance. Whether this metacognitive ability is supported by the same mechanisms across different tasks is an open question that has thus far been investigated with a focus on correlating metacognitive accuracy between perceptual and long-term memory paradigms. Here, we investigated the relationship between metacognition of visual perception and metacognition of visual short-term memory (VSTM), a cognitive function thought to be more intimately related to visual processing. Across two experiments that required subjects to estimate the perceived or remembered orientation of a grating stimulus and rate their confidence, we observed strong positive correlations between individual differences in metacognitive accuracy between the two tasks. This relationship was not accounted for by individual differences in task performance or average confidence, and was present across two different metrics of metacognition and in both experiments. In contrast to previous results comparing perception and long-term memory, which have largely provided evidence for domain-specific metacognitive processes, the current findings suggest that metacognition of visual perception and VSTM is supported by a domain-general metacognitive architecture.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Exact Topological Inference For Paired Brain Networks Via Persistent Homology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/140533v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>We present a novel framework for characterizing paired brain networks using techniques in hyper-networks, sparse learning and persistent homology. The framework is general enough for dealing with any type of paired images such as twins, multimodal and longitudinal images. The exact nonparametric statistical inference procedure is derived on testing monotonic graph theory features that do not rely on time consuming permutation tests. The proposed method computes the exact probability in quadratic time while the permutation tests require exponential time. As illustrations, we apply the method to simulated networks and a twin fMRI study. In case of the latter, we determine the statistical significance of the heritability index of the large-scale reward network where every voxel is a network node.</description>

	<description>Diffusion weighted imaging has further pushed the boundaries of neuroscience by allowing us to peer farther into the white matter microstructure of the living human brain. By doing so, it has provided answers to fundamental neuroscientific questions, launching a new field of research that had been largely inaccessible. We will briefly summarise key questions, that have historically been raised in neuroscience, concerning the brain's white matter. We will then expand on the benefits of diffusion weighted imaging and its contribution to the fields of brain anatomy, functional models and plasticity. In doing so, this review will highlight the invaluable contribution of diffusion weighted imaging in neuroscience, present its limitations and put forth new challenges for the future generations who may wish to exploit this powerful technology to gain novel insights.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A robust dissociation among the language, multiple demand, and default mode networks: evidence from inter-region correlations in effect size</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/140384v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Complex cognitive processes, including language, rely on multiple mental operations that are carried out by several large-scale functional networks in the frontal, temporal, and parietal association cortices of the human brain. The central division of cognitive labor is between two fronto-parietal bilateral networks: (a) the multiple demand (MD) network, which supports executive processes, such as working memory and cognitive control, and is engaged by diverse task domains, including language, especially when comprehension gets difficult; and (b) the default mode network (DMN), which supports introspective processes, such as mind wandering, and is active when we are not engaged in processing external stimuli. These two networks are strongly dissociated in both their functional profiles and their patterns of activity fluctuations during naturalistic cognition. Here, we focus on the functional relationship between these two networks and a third network: (c) the fronto-temporal left-lateralized &quot;core&quot; language network, which is selectively recruited by linguistic processing. Is the language network distinct and dissociated from both the MD network and the DMN, or is it synchronized and integrated with one or both of them? Recent work has provided evidence for a dissociation between the language network and the MD network. However, the relationship between the language network and the DMN is less clear, with some evidence for coordinated activity patterns and similar response profiles, perhaps due to the role of both in semantic processing. Here we use a novel fMRI approach to examine the relationship among the three networks: we measure the strength of activations in different language, MD, and DMN regions to functional contrasts typically used to identify each network, and then test which regions co-vary in their contrast effect sizes across 60 individuals. We find that effect sizes correlate strongly within each network (e.g., one language region and another language region, or one DMN region and another DMN region), but show little or no correlation for region pairs across networks (e.g., a language region and a DMN region). Thus, we replicate the language/MD network dissociation discovered previously with other methods, and also show that the language network is robustly dissociated from the DMN, overall suggesting that these three networks support distinct computations and contribute to high-level cognition in different ways. Inter-individual differences in effect sizes therefore do not simply reflect general differences in vascularization or attention, but exhibit sensitivity to the functional architecture of the brain. The strength of activation in each network can thus be probed separately in studies that attempt to link neural variability to behavioral or genetic variability.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Oscillatory Default Mode Network Coupling In Concussion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/140368v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/140368v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Concussion is a common form of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Despite the descriptor &quot;mild&quot;, a single injury can leave long-lasting and sustained alterations to brain function, including changes to localised activity and large-scale interregional communication. Cognitive complaints are thought to arise from such functional deficits. We investigated the impact of injury on neurophysiological and functionally-specialised resting networks, known as intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), using MEG. Methods: We assessed neurophysiological connectivity in 40 males, 20 with concussion, 20 without, using MEG. Regions-of-interest that comprise nodes of ICNs were defined, and their time courses derived using a beamformer approach. Pairwise fluctuations and covariations in band-limited amplitude envelopes were computed reflecting measures of functional connectivity. Intra-network connectivity was compared between groups using permutation testing, and correlated with symptoms. Results: We observed increased resting spectral connectivity in the default mode and motor networks in our concussion group when compared with controls, across alpha through gamma ranges. Moreover, these differences were not explained by power spectrum density (absolute changes in the spectral profiles within the ICNs). Furthermore, this increased coupling was significantly associated with symptoms in the DMN and MOT networks - but once accounting for comorbid symptoms (including, depression, anxiety, and ADHD) only the DMN continued to be associated with symptoms. Conclusion: The DMN network plays a critical role in shifting between cognitive tasks. These data suggest even a single concussion can perturb the intrinsic coupling of functionally-specialised networks in the brain and may explain persistent and wide-ranging symptomatology.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Consequences Of NMDA Receptor Deficiency Can Be Rescued In The Adult Brain</title>

	<description>NMDA receptors (NMDAR) are important in the formation of activity-dependent connections in the brain. In sensory pathways, NMDAR disruption during discrete developmental periods has enduring effects on wiring and function. Yet, it is not clear whether NMDAR-limited critical periods exist for higher-order circuits governing mood and cognition. This question is urgent for neurodevelopmental disorders, like schizophrenia, that have NMDAR hypofunction and treatment-resistant cognitive symptoms. As proof of concept, we developed a novel mouse model where developmental NMDAR deficits can be ameliorated by inducible Cre recombinase. Rescue of NMDARs in either adolescence or adulthood yields surprisingly strong improvements in higher-order behavior. Similar levels of behavioral plasticity are observed regardless of intervention age, with degree of plasticity dependent on the specific behavioral circuit. These results reveal higher-order brain function as amenable to treatment in adulthood and identify NMDAR as a key target for cognitive dysfunction.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In a published paper \cite{Sengupta2016}, we have proposed that the brain
(and other self-organized biological and artificial systems) can be
characterized via the mathematical apparatus of a gauge theory. The picture
that emerges from this approach suggests that any biological system (from a
neuron to an organism) can be cast as resolving uncertainty about its external
milieu, either by changing its internal states or its relationship to the
environment. Using formal arguments, we have shown that a gauge theory for
neuronal dynamics -- based on approximate Bayesian inference -- has the
potential to shed new light on phenomena that have thus far eluded a formal
description, such as attention and the link between action and perception.
Here, we describe the technical apparatus that enables such a variational
inference on manifolds.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Multi-Scale Factor Analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Signals. (arXiv:1705.06502v1 [stat.AP])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we develop an approach to modeling high-dimensional networks
with a large number of nodes arranged in a hierarchical and modular structure.
We propose a novel multi-scale factor analysis (MSFA) model which partitions
the massive spatio-temporal data defined over the complex networks into a
finite set of regional clusters. To achieve further dimension reduction, we
represent the signals in each cluster by a small number of latent factors. The
correlation matrix for all nodes in the network are approximated by
lower-dimensional sub-structures derived from the cluster-specific factors. To
estimate regional connectivity between numerous nodes (within each cluster), we
apply principal components analysis (PCA) to produce factors which are derived
as the optimal reconstruction of the observed signals under the squared loss.
Then, we estimate global connectivity (between clusters or sub-networks) based
on the factors across regions using the RV-coefficient as the cross-dependence
measure. This gives a reliable and computationally efficient multi-scale
analysis of both regional and global dependencies of the large networks. The
proposed novel approach is applied to estimate brain connectivity networks
using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Results on
resting-state fMRI reveal interesting modular and hierarchical organization of
human brain networks during rest.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Graph analysis and modularity of brain functional connectivity networks: searching for the optimal threshold. (arXiv:1705.06481v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging data can be represented as networks of nodes and edges that
capture the topological organization of the brain connectivity. Graph theory
provides a general and powerful framework to study these networks and their
structure at various scales. By way of example, community detection methods
have been widely applied to investigate the modular structure of many natural
networks, including brain functional connectivity networks. Sparsification
procedures are often applied to remove the weakest edges, which are the most
affected by experimental noise, and to reduce the density of the graph, thus
making it theoretically and computationally more tractable. However, weak links
may also contain significant structural information, and procedures to identify
the optimal tradeoff are the subject of active research. Here, we explore the
use of percolation analysis, a method grounded in statistical physics, to
identify the optimal sparsification threshold for community detection in brain
connectivity networks. By using synthetic networks endowed with a ground-truth
modular structure and realistic topological features typical of human brain
functional connectivity networks, we show that percolation analysis can be
applied to identify the optimal sparsification threshold that maximizes
information on the networks' community structure. We validate this approach
using three different community detection methods widely applied to the
analysis of brain connectivity networks: Newman's modularity, InfoMap and
Asymptotical Surprise. Importantly, we test the effects of noise and data
variability, which are critical factors to determine the optimal threshold.
This data-driven method should prove particularly useful in the analysis of the
community structure of brain networks in populations characterized by different
connectivity strengths, such as patients and controls.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Stochastic lattice model of synaptic membrane protein domains. (arXiv:1705.06354v1 [q-bio.SC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurotransmitter receptor molecules, concentrated in synaptic membrane
domains along with scaffolds and other kinds of proteins, are crucial for
signal transmission across chemical synapses. In common with other membrane
protein domains, synaptic domains are characterized by low protein copy numbers
and protein crowding, with rapid stochastic turnover of individual molecules.
We study here in detail a stochastic lattice model of the receptor-scaffold
reaction-diffusion dynamics at synaptic domains that was found previously to
capture, at the mean-field level, the self-assembly, stability, and
characteristic size of synaptic domains observed in experiments. We show that
our stochastic lattice model yields quantitative agreement with mean-field
models of nonlinear diffusion in crowded membranes. Through a combination of
analytic and numerical solutions of the master equation governing the reaction
dynamics at synaptic domains, together with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we
find substantial discrepancies between mean-field and stochastic models for the
reaction dynamics at synaptic domains. Based on the reaction and diffusion
properties of synaptic receptors and scaffolds suggested by previous
experiments and mean-field calculations, we show that the stochastic
reaction-diffusion dynamics of synaptic receptors and scaffolds provide a
simple physical mechanism for collective fluctuations in synaptic domains, the
molecular turnover observed at synaptic domains, key features of the observed
single-molecule trajectories, and spatial heterogeneity in the effective rates
at which receptors and scaffolds are recycled at the cell membrane. Our work
sheds light on the physical mechanisms and principles linking the collective
properties of membrane protein domains to the stochastic dynamics that rule
their molecular~components.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Automatically tracking neurons in a moving and deforming brain</title>

Advances in optical neuroimaging techniques now allow neural activity to be recorded with cellular resolution in awake and behaving animals. Brain motion in these recordings pose a unique challenge. The location of individual neurons must be tracked in 3D over time to accurately extract single neuron activity traces. Recordings from small invertebrates like &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; are especially challenging because they undergo very large brain motion and deformation during animal movement. Here we present an automated computer vision pipeline to reliably track populations of neurons with single neuron resolution in the brain of a freely moving &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; undergoing large motion and deformation. 3D volumetric fluorescent images of the animal’s brain are straightened, aligned and registered, and the locations of neurons in the images are found via segmentation. Each neuron is then assigned an identity using a new time-independent machine-learning approach we call Neuron Registration Vector Encoding. In this approach, non-rigid point-set registration is used to match each segmented neuron in each volume with a set of reference volumes taken from throughout the recording. The way each neuron matches with the references defines a feature vector which is clustered to assign an identity to each neuron in each volume. Finally, thin-plate spline interpolation is used to correct errors in segmentation and check consistency of assigned identities. The Neuron Registration Vector Encoding approach proposed here is uniquely well suited for tracking neurons in brains undergoing large deformations. When applied to whole-brain calcium imaging recordings in freely moving &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;, this analysis pipeline located 156 neurons for the duration of an 8 minute recording and consistently found more neurons more quickly than manual or semi-automated approaches.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zRAXjBpewI8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Simultaneous inference of phylogenetic and transmission trees in infectious disease outbreaks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005495</guid>

Whole-genome sequencing of pathogens from host samples becomes more and more routine during infectious disease outbreaks. These data provide information on possible transmission events which can be used for further epidemiologic analyses, such as identification of risk factors for infectivity and transmission. However, the relationship between transmission events and sequence data is obscured by uncertainty arising from four largely unobserved processes: transmission, case observation, within-host pathogen dynamics and mutation. To properly resolve transmission events, these processes need to be taken into account. Recent years have seen much progress in theory and method development, but existing applications make simplifying assumptions that often break up the dependency between the four processes, or are tailored to specific datasets with matching model assumptions and code. To obtain a method with wider applicability, we have developed a novel approach to reconstruct transmission trees with sequence data. Our approach combines elementary models for transmission, case observation, within-host pathogen dynamics, and mutation, under the assumption that the outbreak is over and all cases have been observed. We use Bayesian inference with MCMC for which we have designed novel proposal steps to efficiently traverse the posterior distribution, taking account of all unobserved processes at once. This allows for efficient sampling of transmission trees from the posterior distribution, and robust estimation of consensus transmission trees. We implemented the proposed method in a new R package &lt;i&gt;phybreak&lt;/i&gt;. The method performs well in tests of both new and published simulated data. We apply the model to five datasets on densely sampled infectious disease outbreaks, covering a wide range of epidemiological settings. Using only sampling times and sequences as data, our analyses confirmed the original results or improved on them: the more realistic infection times place more confidence in the inferred transmission trees.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UKIrSUeOxbk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Transcriptomics technologies</title>

Transcriptomics technologies are the techniques used to study an organism’s transcriptome, the sum of all of its RNA transcripts. The information content of an organism is recorded in the DNA of its genome and expressed through transcription. Here, mRNA serves as a transient intermediary molecule in the information network, whilst noncoding RNAs perform additional diverse functions. A transcriptome captures a snapshot in time of the total transcripts present in a cell.
The first attempts to study the whole transcriptome began in the early 1990s, and technological advances since the late 1990s have made transcriptomics a widespread discipline. Transcriptomics has been defined by repeated technological innovations that transform the field. There are two key contemporary techniques in the field: microarrays, which quantify a set of predetermined sequences, and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), which uses high-throughput sequencing to capture all sequences.
Measuring the expression of an organism’s genes in different tissues, conditions, or time points gives information on how genes are regulated and reveals details of an organism’s biology. It can also help to infer the functions of previously unannotated genes. Transcriptomic analysis has enabled the study of how gene expression changes in different organisms and has been instrumental in the understanding of human disease. An analysis of gene expression in its entirety allows detection of broad coordinated trends which cannot be discerned by more targeted assays.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2WsdgJiNTtE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Rise of the humanbot. (arXiv:1705.05935v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The accelerated path of technological development, particularly at the
interface between hardware and biology has been suggested as evidence for
future major technological breakthroughs associated to our potential to
overcome biological constraints. This includes the potential of becoming
immortal, having expanded cognitive capacities thanks to hardware implants or
the creation of intelligent machines. Here I argue that several relevant
evolutionary and structural constraints might prevent achieving most (if not
all) these innovations. Instead, the coming future will bring novelties that
will challenge many other aspects of our life and that can be seen as other
feasible singularities. One particularly important one has to do with the
evolving interactions between humans and non-intelligent robots capable of
learning and communication. Here I argue that a long term interaction can lead
to a new class of &quot;agent&quot; (the humanbot). The way shared memories get tangled
over time will inevitably have important consequences for both sides of the
pair, whose identity as separated entities might become blurred and ultimately
vanish. Understanding such hybrid systems requires a second-order neuroscience
approach while posing serious conceptual challenges, including the definition
of consciousness.

&lt;p&gt;Dreaming was thought to be confined to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which occurs during periods of high-frequency electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, but, more recently, dreaming has been observed during periods of non-REM sleep, which is characterized by low-frequency EEG activity.

&lt;p&gt;During embryonic development, spinal commissural axons extend towards the floor plate (FP), guided by the axon guidance molecule netrin 1, but the source of netrin 1 is a matter of debate. In the developing spinal cord, netrin 1 is expressed by FP cells and progenitor &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory formation requires representations of new information to be efficiently encoded by the brain memory network. Here, the authors used multivariate classification to determine encoding states that were predictive of later recall and those that were likely to lead to forgetting.

&lt;p&gt;Epigenetic mechanisms — including DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications and changes in nucleosome positioning — regulate gene expression, cellular differentiation and development in almost all tissues, including the brain.

Gene regulatory and metabolic network models have been used successfully in many organisms, but inherent differences between them make networks difficult to integrate. Probabilistic Regulation Of Metabolism (PROM) provides a partial solution, but it does not incorporate network inference and underperforms in eukaryotes. We present an Integrated Deduced And Metabolism (IDREAM) method that combines statistically inferred Environment and Gene Regulatory Influence Network (EGRIN) models with the PROM framework to create enhanced metabolic-regulatory network models. We used IDREAM to predict phenotypes and genetic interactions between transcription factors and genes encoding metabolic activities in the eukaryote, &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;. IDREAM models contain many fewer interactions than PROM and yet produce significantly more accurate growth predictions. IDREAM consistently outperformed PROM using any of three popular yeast metabolic models and across three experimental growth conditions. Importantly, IDREAM’s enhanced accuracy makes it possible to identify subtle synthetic growth defects. With experimental validation, these novel genetic interactions involving the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex suggested a new role for fatty acid-responsive factor Oaf1 in regulating acetyl-CoA production in glucose grown cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9DmSJoTlfGg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sodium Channel Nav1.8 Underlies TTX-Resistant Axonal Action Potential Conduction in Somatosensory C-Fibers of Distal Cutaneous Nerves</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5204?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Voltage-gated sodium (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) channels are responsible for the initiation and conduction of action potentials within primary afferents. The nine Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channel isoforms recognized in mammals are often functionally divided into tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive (TTX-s) channels (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1–Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.4, Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.6–Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7) that are blocked by nanomolar concentrations and TTX-resistant (TTX-r) channels (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 and Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.9) inhibited by millimolar concentrations, with Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.5 having an intermediate toxin sensitivity. For small-diameter primary afferent neurons, it is unclear to what extent different Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channel isoforms are distributed along the peripheral and central branches of their bifurcated axons. To determine the relative contribution of TTX-s and TTX-r channels to action potential conduction in different axonal compartments, we investigated the effects of TTX on C-fiber-mediated compound action potentials (C-CAPs) of proximal and distal peripheral nerve segments and dorsal roots from mice and pigtail monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca nemestrina&lt;/i&gt;). In the dorsal roots and proximal peripheral nerves of mice and nonhuman primates, TTX reduced the C-CAP amplitude to 16% of the baseline. In contrast, &amp;gt;30% of the C-CAP was resistant to TTX in distal peripheral branches of monkeys and WT and Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.9&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. In nerves from Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, TTX-r C-CAPs could not be detected. These data indicate that Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 is the primary isoform underlying TTX-r conduction in distal axons of somatosensory C-fibers. Furthermore, there is a differential spatial distribution of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 within C-fiber axons, being functionally more prominent in the most distal axons and terminal regions. The enrichment of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 in distal axons may provide a useful target in the treatment of pain of peripheral origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It is unclear whether individual sodium channel isoforms exert differential roles in action potential conduction along the axonal membrane of nociceptive, unmyelinated peripheral nerve fibers, but clarifying the role of sodium channel subtypes in different axonal segments may be useful for the development of novel analgesic strategies. Here, we provide evidence from mice and nonhuman primates that a substantial portion of the C-fiber compound action potential in distal peripheral nerves, but not proximal nerves or dorsal roots, is resistant to tetrodotoxin and that, in mice, this effect is mediated solely by voltage-gated sodium channel 1.8 (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8). The functional prominence of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 within the axonal compartment immediately proximal to its termination may affect strategies targeting pain of peripheral origin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dissociation of Choice Formation and Choice-Correlated Activity in Macaque Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5195?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Responses of individual task-relevant sensory neurons can predict monkeys' trial-by-trial choices in perceptual decision-making tasks. Choice-correlated activity has been interpreted as evidence that the responses of these neurons are causally linked to perceptual judgments. To further test this hypothesis, we studied responses of orientation-selective neurons in V1 and V2 while two macaque monkeys performed a fine orientation discrimination task. Although both animals exhibited a high level of neuronal and behavioral sensitivity, only one exhibited choice-correlated activity. Surprisingly, this correlation was negative: when a neuron fired more vigorously, the animal was less likely to choose the orientation preferred by that neuron. Moreover, choice-correlated activity emerged late in the trial, earlier in V2 than in V1, and was correlated with anticipatory signals. Together, these results suggest that choice-correlated activity in task-relevant sensory neurons can reflect postdecision modulatory signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When observers perform a difficult sensory discrimination, repeated presentations of the same stimulus can elicit different perceptual judgments. This behavioral variability often correlates with variability in the activity of sensory neurons driven by the stimulus. Traditionally, this correlation has been interpreted as suggesting a causal link between the activity of sensory neurons and perceptual judgments. More recently, it has been argued that the correlation instead may originate in recurrent input from other brain areas involved in the interpretation of sensory signals. Here, we call both hypotheses into question. We show that choice-related activity in sensory neurons can be highly variable across observers and can reflect modulatory processes that are dissociated from perceptual decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Multisensory Integration Uses a Real-Time Unisensory-Multisensory Transform</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5183?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The manner in which the brain integrates different sensory inputs to facilitate perception and behavior has been the subject of numerous speculations. By examining multisensory neurons in cat superior colliculus, the present study demonstrated that two operational principles are sufficient to understand how this remarkable result is achieved: (1) unisensory signals are integrated continuously and in real time as soon as they arrive at their common target neuron and (2) the resultant multisensory computation is modified in shape and timing by a delayed, calibrating inhibition. These principles were tested for descriptive sufficiency by embedding them in a neurocomputational model and using it to predict a neuron's moment-by-moment multisensory response given only knowledge of its responses to the individual modality-specific component cues. The predictions proved to be highly accurate, reliable, and unbiased and were, in most cases, not statistically distinguishable from the neuron's actual instantaneous multisensory response at any phase throughout its entire duration. The model was also able to explain why different multisensory products are often observed in different neurons at different time points, as well as the higher-order properties of multisensory integration, such as the dependency of multisensory products on the temporal alignment of crossmodal cues. These observations not only reveal this fundamental integrative operation, but also identify quantitatively the multisensory transform used by each neuron. As a result, they provide a means of comparing the integrative profiles among neurons and evaluating how they are affected by changes in intrinsic or extrinsic factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Multisensory integration is the process by which the brain combines information from multiple sensory sources (e.g., vision and audition) to maximize an organism's ability to identify and respond to environmental stimuli. The actual transformative process by which the neural products of multisensory integration are achieved is poorly understood. By focusing on the millisecond-by-millisecond differences between a neuron's unisensory component responses and its integrated multisensory response, it was found that this multisensory transform can be described by two basic principles: unisensory information is integrated in real time and the multisensory response is shaped by calibrating inhibition. It is now possible to use these principles to predict a neuron's multisensory response accurately armed only with knowledge of its unisensory responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Age-Related Reversals in Neural Recruitment across Memory Retrieval Phases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5172?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5172?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last several decades, neuroimaging research has identified age-related neural changes that occur during cognitive tasks. These changes are used to help researchers identify functional changes that contribute to age-related impairments in cognitive performance. One commonly reported example of such a change is an age-related decrease in the recruitment of posterior sensory regions coupled with an increased recruitment of prefrontal regions across multiple cognitive tasks. This shift is often described as a compensatory recruitment of prefrontal regions due to age-related sensory-processing deficits in posterior regions. However, age is not only associated with spatial shifts in recruitment, but also with temporal shifts, in which younger and older adults recruit the same neural region at different points in a task trial. The current study examines the possible contribution of temporal modifications in the often-reported posterior–anterior shift. Participants, ages 19–85, took part in a memory retrieval task with a protracted retrieval trial consisting of an initial memory search phase and a subsequent detail elaboration phase. Age-related neural patterns during search replicated prior reports of age-related decreases in posterior recruitment and increases in prefrontal recruitment. However, during the later elaboration phase, the same posterior regions were associated with age-related increases in activation. Further, ROI and functional connectivity results suggest that these posterior regions function similarly during search and elaboration. These results suggest that the often-reported posterior–anterior shift may not reflect the inability of older adults to engage in sensory processing, but rather a change in when they recruit this processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The current study provides evidence that the often-reported posterior–anterior shift in aging may not reflect a global sensory-processing deficit, as has often been reported, but rather a temporal modification in this processing in which older adults engage the same neural regions during a detail elaboration phase that younger adults engage during memory search. In other words, older adults may ultimately be able to engage the same processes as younger adults during some cognitive tasks when given the time to do so. Future research should examine the generalizability of this effect and the importance of encouraging older adults to engage in these processes through task instruction or questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Peripheral Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-{alpha}) Modulates Amyloid Pathology by Regulating Blood-Derived Immune Cells and Glial Response in the Brain of AD/TNF Transgenic Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence has suggested that systemic inflammation along with local brain inflammation can play a significant role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Identifying key molecules that regulate the crosstalk between the immune and the CNS can provide potential therapeutic targets. TNF-α is a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and AD. Recent studies have reported that anti-TNF-α therapy or RA itself can modulate AD pathology, although the underlying mechanism is unclear. To investigate the role of peripheral TNF-α as a mediator of RA in the pathogenesis of AD, we generated double-transgenic 5XFAD/Tg197 AD/TNF mice that develop amyloid deposits and inflammatory arthritis induced by human TNF-α (huTNF-α) expression. We found that 5XFAD/Tg197 mice display decreased amyloid deposition, compromised neuronal integrity, and robust brain inflammation characterized by extensive gliosis and elevated blood-derived immune cell populations, including phagocytic macrophages and microglia. To evaluate the contribution of peripheral huTNF-α in the observed brain phenotype, we treated 5XFAD/Tg197 mice systemically with infliximab, an anti-huTNF-α antibody that does not penetrate the blood–brain barrier and prevents arthritis. Peripheral inhibition of huTNF-α increases amyloid deposition, rescues neuronal impairment, and suppresses gliosis and recruitment of blood-derived immune cells, without affecting brain huTNF-α levels. Our data report, for the first time, a distinctive role for peripheral TNF-α in the modulation of the amyloid phenotype in mice by regulating blood-derived and local brain inflammatory cell populations involved in β-amyloid clearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Mounting evidence supports the active involvement of systemic inflammation, in addition to local brain inflammation, in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. TNF-α is a pluripotent cytokine that has been independently involved in the pathogenesis of systemic inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and AD. Here we first demonstrate that manipulation of peripheral TNF-α in the context of arthritis modulates the amyloid phenotype by regulating immune cell trafficking in the mouse brain. Our study suggests that additionally to its local actions in the AD brain, TNF-α can also indirectly modulate amyloid pathology as a regulator of peripheral inflammation. Our findings may have significant implications in the treatment of RA patients with anti-TNF-α drugs and in the potential use of TNF-targeted therapies for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Severity of Vestibular Dysfunction in Deafness as a Determinant of Comorbid Hyperactivity or Anxiety</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety-related disorders occur at rates 2–3 times higher in deaf compared with hearing children. Potential explanations for these elevated rates and the heterogeneity of behavioral disorders associated with deafness have usually focused on socio-environmental rather than biological effects. Children with the 22q11.2 deletion or duplication syndromes often display hearing loss and behavioral disorders, including ADHD and anxiety-related disorders. Here, we show that mouse mutants with either a gain or loss of function of the T-Box transcription factor gene, &lt;i&gt;Tbx1&lt;/i&gt;, which lies within the 22q11.2 region and is responsible for most of the syndromic defects, exhibit inner ear defects and hyperactivity. Furthermore, we show that (1) inner ear dysfunction due to the tissue-specific loss of &lt;i&gt;Tbx1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Slc12a2&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes a sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter and is also necessary for inner ear function, causes hyperactivity; (2) vestibular rather than auditory failure causes hyperactivity; and (3) the severity rather than the age of onset of vestibular dysfunction differentiates whether hyperactivity or anxiety co-occurs with inner ear dysfunction. Together, these findings highlight a biological link between inner ear dysfunction and behavioral disorders and how sensory abnormalities can contribute to the etiology of disorders traditionally considered of cerebral origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study examines the biological rather than socio-environmental reasons why hyperactivity and anxiety disorders occur at higher rates in deaf individuals. Using conditional genetic approaches in mice, the authors show that (1) inner ear dysfunction due to either &lt;i&gt;Tbx1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Slc12a2&lt;/i&gt; mutations cause hyperactivity; (2) it is vestibular dysfunction, which frequently co-occurs with deafness but often remains undiagnosed, rather than auditory dysfunction that causes hyperactivity and anxiety-related symptoms; and (3) the severity of vestibular dysfunction can predict whether hyperactivity or anxiety coexist with inner ear dysfunction. These findings suggest a need to evaluate vestibular function in hearing impaired individuals, especially those who exhibit hyperactive and anxiety-related symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To probe monosynaptic thalamic activation of cortical postsynaptic target cells, so called spike-trigger-averaged LFP (stLFP) signatures have been measured. In these experiments, the cortical LFP is measured by multielectrodes covering several cortical lamina and averaged on spontaneous spikes of thalamocortical (TC) cells. Using a well established forward-modeling scheme, we investigated the biophysical origin of this stLFP signature with simultaneous synaptic activation of cortical layer-4 neurons, mimicking the effect of a single afferent spike from a single TC neuron. Constrained by previously measured intracellular responses of the main postsynaptic target cell types and with biologically plausible assumptions regarding the spatial distribution of thalamic synaptic inputs into layer 4, the model predicted characteristic contributions to monosynaptic stLFP signatures both for the regular-spiking (RS) excitatory neurons and the fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons. In particular, the FS cells generated stLFP signatures of shorter temporal duration than the RS cells. Added together, a sum of the stLFP signatures of these two principal synaptic targets of TC cells were observed to resemble experimentally measured stLFP signatures. Outside the volume targeted by TC afferents, the resulting postsynaptic LFP signals were found to be sharply attenuated. This implies that such stLFP signatures provide a very local measure of TC synaptic activation, and that newly developed inverse current-source density (CSD)-estimation methods are needed for precise assessment of the underlying spatiotemporal CSD profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite its long history and prevalent use, the proper interpretation of the extracellularly recorded local field potential (LFP) is still not fully established. Here we investigate by biophysical modeling the origin of the focal LFP signature of the single-axon monosynaptic thalamocortical connection as measured by spike-trigger-averaging of cortical LFPs on spontaneous spikes of thalamocortical neurons. We find that this LFP signature is well accounted for by a model assuming thalamic projections to two cortical layer-4 cell populations: one excitatory (putatively regular-spiking cells) and one inhibitory (putatively fast-spiking cells). The LFP signature is observed to decay sharply outside the cortical region receiving the thalamocortical projection, implying that it indeed provides a very local measure of thalamocortical synaptic activation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mediation of Movement-Induced Breakthrough Cancer Pain by IB4-Binding Nociceptors in Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5111?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cancer-induced bone pain is characterized by moderate to severe ongoing pain that commonly requires the use of opiates. Even when ongoing pain is well controlled, patients can suffer breakthrough pain (BTP), episodic severe pain that &quot;breaks through&quot; the medication. We developed a novel model of cancer-induced BTP using female rats with mammary adenocarcinoma cells sealed within the tibia. We demonstrated previously that rats with bone cancer learn to prefer a context paired with saphenous nerve block to elicit pain relief (i.e., conditioned place preference, CPP), revealing the presence of ongoing pain. Treatment with systemic morphine abolished CPP to saphenous nerve block, demonstrating control of ongoing pain. Here, we show that pairing BTP induced by experimenter-induced movement of the tumor-bearing hindlimb with a context produces conditioned place avoidance (CPA) in rats treated with morphine to control ongoing pain, consistent with clinical observation of BTP. Preventing movement-induced afferent input by saphenous nerve block before, but not after, hindlimb movement blocked movement-induced BTP. Ablation of isolectin B4 (IB4)-binding, but not TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, sensory afferents eliminated movement-induced BTP, suggesting that input from IB4-binding fibers mediates BTP. Identification of potential molecular targets specific to this population of fibers may allow for the development of peripherally restricted analgesics that control BTP and improve quality of life in patients with skeletal metastases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We present a novel preclinical measure of movement-induced breakthrough pain (BTP) that is observed in the presence of morphine controlling ongoing pain. Blockade of sensory input before movement prevented BTP, whereas nerve block after movement failed to reverse BTP. These observations indicate that blocking peripheral sensory input may prevent BTP and targeting central sites may be required for pain relief once BTP has been initiated. Preventing sensory input from TRPV1-expressing fibers failed to alter movement-induced BTP. In contrast, preventing sensory input from isolectin B4 (IB4)-binding fibers blocked movement-induced BTP. Therefore, examining molecular targets on this population of nociceptive fibers may prove useful for developing an improved strategy for preventing BTP in cancer patients with skeletal metastases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Inhibition of Drp1 Ameliorates Synaptic Depression, A{beta} Deposition, and Cognitive Impairment in an Alzheimer's Disease Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Excessive mitochondrial fission is a prominent early event and contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic failure, and neuronal cell death in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains to be determined whether inhibition of excessive mitochondrial fission is beneficial in mammal models of AD. To determine whether dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a key regulator of mitochondrial fragmentation, can be a disease-modifying therapeutic target for AD, we examined the effects of Drp1 inhibitor on mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunctions induced by oligomeric amyloid-β (Aβ) in neurons and neuropathology and cognitive functions in Aβ precursor protein/presenilin 1 double-transgenic AD mice. Inhibition of Drp1 alleviates mitochondrial fragmentation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species production, ATP reduction, and synaptic depression in Aβ-treated neurons. Furthermore, Drp1 inhibition significantly improves learning and memory and prevents mitochondrial fragmentation, lipid peroxidation, BACE1 expression, and Aβ deposition in the brain in the AD model. These results provide evidence that Drp1 plays an important role in Aβ-mediated and AD-related neuropathology and in cognitive decline in an AD animal model. Therefore, inhibiting excessive Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission may be an efficient therapeutic avenue for AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Mitochondrial fission relies on the evolutionary conserved dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). Drp1 activity and mitochondria fragmentation are significantly elevated in the brains of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases. In the present study, we first demonstrated that the inhibition of Drp1 restored amyloid-β (Aβ)-mediated mitochondrial dysfunctions and synaptic depression in neurons and significantly reduced lipid peroxidation, BACE1 expression, and Aβ deposition in the brain of AD mice. As a result, memory deficits in AD mice were rescued by Drp1 inhibition. These results suggest that neuropathology and combined cognitive decline can be attributed to hyperactivation of Drp1 in the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, inhibitors of excessive mitochondrial fission, such as Drp1 inhibitors, may be a new strategy for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Visually Evoked 3-5 Hz Membrane Potential Oscillations Reduce the Responsiveness of Visual Cortex Neurons in Awake Behaving Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5084?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Low-frequency membrane potential (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) oscillations were once thought to only occur in sleeping and anesthetized states. Recently, low-frequency &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations have been described in inactive awake animals, but it is unclear whether they shape sensory processing in neurons and whether they occur during active awake behavioral states. To answer these questions, we performed two-photon guided whole-cell &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; recordings from primary visual cortex layer 2/3 excitatory and inhibitory neurons in awake mice during passive visual stimulation and performance of visual and auditory discrimination tasks. We recorded stereotyped 3–5 Hz &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations where the &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; baseline hyperpolarized as the &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; underwent high amplitude rhythmic fluctuations lasting 1–2 s in duration. When 3–5 Hz &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations coincided with visual cues, excitatory neuron responses to preferred cues were significantly reduced. Despite this disruption to sensory processing, visual cues were critical for evoking 3–5 Hz &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations when animals performed discrimination tasks and passively viewed drifting grating stimuli. Using pupillometry and animal locomotive speed as indicators of arousal, we found that 3–5 Hz oscillations were not restricted to unaroused states and that they occurred equally in aroused and unaroused states. Therefore, low-frequency &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations play a role in shaping sensory processing in visual cortical neurons, even during active wakefulness and decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A neuron's membrane potential (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) strongly shapes how information is processed in sensory cortices of awake animals. Yet, very little is known about how low-frequency &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations influence sensory processing and whether they occur in aroused awake animals. By performing two-photon guided whole-cell recordings from layer 2/3 excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex of awake behaving animals, we found visually evoked stereotyped 3–5 Hz &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations that disrupt excitatory responsiveness to visual stimuli. Moreover, these oscillations occurred when animals were in high and low arousal states as measured by animal speed and pupillometry. These findings show, for the first time, that low-frequency &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations can significantly modulate sensory signal processing, even in awake active animals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Mechanisms of Cognitive Dissonance (Revised): An EEG Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5074?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5074?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive dissonance theory suggests that our preferences are modulated by the mere act of choosing. A choice between two similarly valued alternatives creates psychological tension (cognitive dissonance) that is reduced by a postdecisional reevaluation of the alternatives. We measured EEG of human subjects during rest and free-choice paradigm. Our study demonstrates that choices associated with stronger cognitive dissonance trigger a larger negative frontocentral evoked response similar to error-related negativity, which has in turn been implicated in general performance monitoring. Furthermore, the amplitude of the evoked response is correlated with the reevaluation of the alternatives. We also found a link between individual neural dynamics (long-range temporal correlations) of the frontocentral cortices during rest and follow-up neural and behavioral effects of cognitive dissonance. Individuals with stronger resting-state long-range temporal correlations demonstrated a greater postdecisional reevaluation of the alternatives and larger evoked brain responses associated with stronger cognitive dissonance. Thus, our results suggest that cognitive dissonance is reflected in both resting-state and choice-related activity of the prefrontal cortex as part of the general performance-monitoring circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Contrary to traditional decision theory, behavioral studies repeatedly demonstrate that our preferences are modulated by the mere act of choosing. Difficult choices generate psychological (cognitive) dissonance, which is reduced by the postdecisional devaluation of unchosen options. We found that decisions associated with a higher level of cognitive dissonance elicited a stronger negative frontocentral deflection that peaked ~60 ms after the response. This activity shares similar spatial and temporal features as error-related negativity, the electrophysiological correlate of performance monitoring. Furthermore, the frontocentral resting-state activity predicted the individual magnitude of preference change and the strength of cognitive dissonance-related neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Age-Related Effects and Sex Differences in Gray Matter Density, Volume, Mass, and Cortical Thickness from Childhood to Young Adulthood</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5065?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5065?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Developmental structural neuroimaging studies in humans have long described decreases in gray matter volume (GMV) and cortical thickness (CT) during adolescence. Gray matter density (GMD), a measure often assumed to be highly related to volume, has not been systematically investigated in development. We used T1 imaging data collected on the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort to study age-related effects and sex differences in four regional gray matter measures in 1189 youths ranging in age from 8 to 23 years. Custom T1 segmentation and a novel high-resolution gray matter parcellation were used to extract GMD, GMV, gray matter mass (GMM; defined as GMD &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; GMV), and CT from 1625 brain regions. Nonlinear models revealed that each modality exhibits unique age-related effects and sex differences. While GMV and CT generally decrease with age, GMD increases and shows the strongest age-related effects, while GMM shows a slight decline overall. Females have lower GMV but higher GMD than males throughout the brain. Our findings suggest that GMD is a prime phenotype for the assessment of brain development and likely cognition and that periadolescent gray matter loss may be less pronounced than previously thought. This work highlights the need for combined quantitative histological MRI studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study demonstrates that different MRI-derived gray matter measures show distinct age and sex effects and should not be considered equivalent but complementary. It is shown for the first time that gray matter density increases from childhood to young adulthood, in contrast with gray matter volume and cortical thickness, and that females, who are known to have lower gray matter volume than males, have higher density throughout the brain. A custom preprocessing pipeline and a novel high-resolution parcellation were created to analyze brain scans of 1189 youths collected as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. A clear understanding of normal structural brain development is essential for the examination of brain–behavior relationships, the study of brain disease, and, ultimately, clinical applications of neuroimaging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Posterior Orbitofrontal and Anterior Cingulate Pathways to the Amygdala Target Inhibitory and Excitatory Systems with Opposite Functions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5051?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5051?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The bidirectional dialogue of the primate posterior orbitofrontal cortex (pOFC) with the amygdala is essential in cognitive–emotional functions. The pOFC also sends a uniquely one-way excitatory pathway to the amygdalar inhibitory intercalated masses (IM), which inhibit the medial part of the central amygdalar nucleus (CeM). Inhibition of IM has the opposite effect, allowing amygdalar activation of autonomic structures and emotional arousal. Using multiple labeling approaches to identify pathways and their postsynaptic sites in the amygdala in rhesus monkeys, we found that the anterior cingulate cortex innervated mostly the basolateral and CeM amygdalar nuclei, poised to activate CeM for autonomic arousal. By contrast, a pathway from pOFC to IM exceeded all other pathways to the amygdala by density and size and proportion of large and efficient terminals. Moreover, whereas pOFC terminals in IM innervated each of the three distinct classes of inhibitory neurons, most targeted neurons expressing dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32+), known to be modulated by dopamine. The predominant pOFC innervation of DARPP-32+ neurons suggests activation of IM and inhibition of CeM, resulting in modulated autonomic function. By contrast, inhibition of DARPP-32 neurons in IM by high dopamine levels disinhibits CeM and triggers autonomic arousal. The findings provide a mechanism to help explain how a strong pOFC pathway, which is poised to moderate activity of CeM, through IM, can be undermined by the high level of dopamine during stress, resulting in collapse of potent inhibitory mechanisms in the amygdala and heightened autonomic drive, as seen in chronic anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The dialogue between prefrontal cortex and amygdala allows thoughts and emotions to influence actions. The posterior orbitofrontal cortex sends a powerful pathway that targets a special class of amygdalar intercalated mass (IM) inhibitory neurons, whose wiring may help modulate autonomic function. By contrast, the anterior cingulate cortex innervates other amygdalar parts, activating circuits to help avoid danger. Most IM neurons in primates label for the protein DARPP-32, known to be activated or inhibited based on the level of dopamine. Stress markedly increases dopamine release and inhibits IM neurons, compromises prefrontal control of the amygdala, and sets off a general alarm system as seen in affective disorders, such as chronic anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/span&gt;: Neurofilament light chains (NfL) are unique to neuronal cells, are shed to the CSF and are detectable at low concentrations in peripheral blood. Various diseases causing neuronal damage have resulted in elevated CSF concentrations. We explored the value of an ultrasensitive single-molecule array (Simoa) serum NfL (sNfL) assay in MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/span&gt;: sNfL levels were measured in healthy controls (HC, n=254) and two independent MS cohorts: (1) cross-sectional with paired serum and CSF samples (n=142); (2) longitudinal with repeated serum sampling (n=246, median (IQR) follow-up 3.1 (2.0-4.0) years). We assessed their relation to concurrent clinical, imaging and treatment parameters and to future clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Results&lt;/span&gt;: sNfL levels were higher in both MS cohorts than in HC (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). We found a strong association between CSF NfL and sNfL (β=0.589, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). Patients with either brain or spinal (43.4 (25.2-65.3) pg/ml) or both brain and spinal gadolinium enhancing lesions (62.5 (42.7-71.4) pg/ml) had higher sNfL than those without (29.6 (20.9-41.8) pg/ml; β=1.461, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.005 and β=1.902, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.002 respectively). sNfL was independently associated with EDSS assessments (β=1.105, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001) and presence of relapses (β=1.430, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). sNfL levels were lower under disease modifying treatment (β=0.818, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.003). Patients with sNfL levels above the 80&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 90&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 95&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 97.5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 99&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; HC based percentiles had higher risk of relapses (97.5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile: IRR=1.94, 95%CI=1.21-3.10, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.006) and EDSS worsening (97.5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile: OR=2.41, 95%CI=1.07-5.42, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.034).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Interpretation&lt;/span&gt;: These results support the value of sNfL as a sensitive and clinically meaningful blood biomarker to monitor tissue damage and the effects of therapies in MS.

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: The Role of Astrocyte Dysfunction in Parkinson’s Disease Pathogenesis</title>

	<description>Astrocytes are the most populous glial subtype and are critical for brain function. Despite this, historically there have been few studies into the role that they may have in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). Recently, however, several studies have determined that genes known to have a causative role in the development of PD are expressed in astrocytes and have important roles in astrocyte function. Here, we review these recent developments and discuss their impact on our understanding of the pathophysiology of PD, and the implications that this might have for its treatment.</description>

	<description>Synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7) was originally identified as a slow Ca2+ sensor for lysosome fusion, but its function at fast synapses is controversial. The paper by Luo and Südhof (2017) in this issue of Neuron shows that at the calyx of Held in the auditory brainstem Syt7 triggers asynchronous release during stimulus trains, resulting in reliable and temporally precise high-frequency transmission. Thus, a slow Ca2+ sensor contributes to the fast signaling properties of the calyx synapse.</description>

	<description>In the early 1960s, few neuroscientists attempted to model brain function using mathematics. Computers were slow and expensive, so numerical approximations of complex phenomena were out of reach in most cases, and scientists resorted primarily to analytical representations of simpler processes. The study of circuits was not new to Walter J. Freeman. He had started his education studying engineering at MIT (transferring later to the University of Chicago to study English) and was a radio operator in WWII.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: High-order epistasis shapes evolutionary trajectories</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Zachary R. Sailer, Michael J. Harms&lt;/p&gt;

High-order epistasis—where the effect of a mutation is determined by interactions with two or more other mutations—makes small, but detectable, contributions to genotype-fitness maps. While epistasis between pairs of mutations is known to be an important determinant of evolutionary trajectories, the evolutionary consequences of high-order epistasis remain poorly understood. To determine the effect of high-order epistasis on evolutionary trajectories, we computationally removed high-order epistasis from experimental genotype-fitness maps containing all binary combinations of five mutations. We then compared trajectories through maps both with and without high-order epistasis. We found that high-order epistasis strongly shapes the accessibility and probability of evolutionary trajectories. A closer analysis revealed that the magnitude of epistasis, not its order, predicts is effects on evolutionary trajectories. We further find that high-order epistasis makes it impossible to predict evolutionary trajectories from the individual and paired effects of mutations. We therefore conclude that high-order epistasis profoundly shapes evolutionary trajectories through genotype-fitness maps.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NtwkDDZsJfQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: SteadyCom: Predicting microbial abundances while ensuring community stability</title>

Genome-scale metabolic modeling has become widespread for analyzing microbial metabolism. Extending this established paradigm to more complex microbial communities is emerging as a promising way to unravel the interactions and biochemical repertoire of these omnipresent systems. While several modeling techniques have been developed for microbial communities, little emphasis has been placed on the need to impose a time-averaged constant growth rate across all members for a community to ensure co-existence and stability. In the absence of this constraint, the faster growing organism will ultimately displace all other microbes in the community. This is particularly important for predicting steady-state microbiota composition as it imposes significant restrictions on the allowable community membership, composition and phenotypes. In this study, we introduce the SteadyCom optimization framework for predicting metabolic flux distributions consistent with the steady-state requirement. SteadyCom can be rapidly converged by iteratively solving linear programming (LP) problem and the number of iterations is independent of the number of organisms. A significant advantage of SteadyCom is compatibility with flux variability analysis. SteadyCom is first demonstrated for a community of four &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; double auxotrophic mutants and is then applied to a gut microbiota model consisting of nine species, with representatives from the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. In contrast to the direct use of FBA, SteadyCom is able to predict the change in species abundance in response to changes in diets with minimal additional imposed constraints on the model. By randomizing the uptake rates of microbes, an abundance profile with a good agreement to experimental gut microbiota is inferred. SteadyCom provides an important step towards the cross-cutting task of predicting the composition of a microbial community in a given environment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aaCKYVh0KtY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: An independent component analysis confounding factor correction framework for identifying broad impact expression quantitative trait loci</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005537</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jin Hyun Ju, Sushila A. Shenoy, Ronald G. Crystal, Jason G. Mezey&lt;/p&gt;

Genome-wide expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) studies in humans have provided numerous insights into the genetics of both gene expression and complex diseases. While the majority of eQTL identified in genome-wide analyses impact a single gene, eQTL that impact many genes are particularly valuable for network modeling and disease analysis. To enable the identification of such broad impact eQTL, we introduce CONFETI: Confounding Factor Estimation Through Independent component analysis. CONFETI is designed to address two conflicting issues when searching for broad impact eQTL: the need to account for non-genetic confounding factors that can lower the power of the analysis or produce broad impact eQTL false positives, and the tendency of methods that account for confounding factors to model broad impact eQTL as non-genetic variation. The key advance of the CONFETI framework is the use of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to identify variation likely caused by broad impact eQTL when constructing the sample covariance matrix used for the random effect in a mixed model. We show that CONFETI has better performance than other mixed model confounding factor methods when considering broad impact eQTL recovery from synthetic data. We also used the CONFETI framework and these same confounding factor methods to identify eQTL that replicate between matched twin pair datasets in the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource (MuTHER), the Depression Genes Networks study (DGN), the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), and multiple tissue types in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium. These analyses identified both &lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt;eQTL and &lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt;eQTL impacting individual genes, and CONFETI had better or comparable performance to other mixed model confounding factor analysis methods when identifying such eQTL. In these analyses, we were able to identify and replicate a few broad impact eQTL although the overall number was small even when applying CONFETI. In light of these results, we discuss the broad impact eQTL that have been previously reported from the analysis of human data and suggest that considerable caution should be exercised when making biological inferences based on these reported eQTL.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZIqMhY0aoqQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A predictive coding account of bistable perception - a model-based fMRI study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Veith Weilnhammer, Heiner Stuke, Guido Hesselmann, Philipp Sterzer, Katharina Schmack&lt;/p&gt;

In bistable vision, subjective perception wavers between two interpretations of a constant ambiguous stimulus. This dissociation between conscious perception and sensory stimulation has motivated various empirical studies on the neural correlates of bistable perception, but the neurocomputational mechanism behind endogenous perceptual transitions has remained elusive. Here, we recurred to a generic Bayesian framework of predictive coding and devised a model that casts endogenous perceptual transitions as a consequence of prediction errors emerging from residual evidence for the suppressed percept. Data simulations revealed close similarities between the model’s predictions and key temporal characteristics of perceptual bistability, indicating that the model was able to reproduce bistable perception. Fitting the predictive coding model to behavioural data from an fMRI-experiment on bistable perception, we found a correlation across participants between the model parameter encoding perceptual stabilization and the behaviourally measured frequency of perceptual transitions, corroborating that the model successfully accounted for participants’ perception. Formal model comparison with established models of bistable perception based on mutual inhibition and adaptation, noise or a combination of adaptation and noise was used for the validation of the predictive coding model against the established models. Most importantly, model-based analyses of the fMRI data revealed that prediction error time-courses derived from the predictive coding model correlated with neural signal time-courses in bilateral inferior frontal gyri and anterior insulae. Voxel-wise model selection indicated a superiority of the predictive coding model over conventional analysis approaches in explaining neural activity in these frontal areas, suggesting that frontal cortex encodes prediction errors that mediate endogenous perceptual transitions in bistable perception. Taken together, our current work provides a theoretical framework that allows for the analysis of behavioural and neural data using a predictive coding perspective on bistable perception. In this, our approach posits a crucial role of prediction error signalling for the resolution of perceptual ambiguities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/X6E3z9L-p5o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mixture models reveal multiple positional bias types in RNA-Seq data and lead to accurate transcript concentration estimates</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Andreas Tuerk, Gregor Wiktorin, Serhat Güler&lt;/p&gt;

Accuracy of transcript quantification with RNA-Seq is negatively affected by positional fragment bias. This article introduces Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (rd. “mixquare”), a transcript quantification method which uses a mixture of probability distributions to model and thereby neutralize the effects of positional fragment bias. The parameters of Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are trained by Expectation Maximization resulting in simultaneous transcript abundance and bias estimates. We compare Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to Cufflinks, RSEM, eXpress and PennSeq; state-of-the-art quantification methods implementing some form of bias correction. On four synthetic biases we show that the accuracy of Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; overall exceeds the accuracy of the other methods and that its bias estimates converge to the correct solution. We further evaluate Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on real RNA-Seq data from the Microarray and Sequencing Quality Control (MAQC, SEQC) Consortia. On MAQC data, Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; achieves improved correlation to qPCR measurements with a relative increase in R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; between 4% and 50%. Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; also yields repeatable concentration estimates across technical replicates with a relative increase in R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; between 8% and 47% and reduced standard deviation across the full concentration range. We further observe more accurate detection of differential expression with a relative increase in true positives between 74% and 378% for 5% false positives. In addition, Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; reveals 5 dominant biases in MAQC data deviating from the common assumption of a uniform fragment distribution. On SEQC data, Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; yields higher consistency between measured and predicted concentration ratios. A relative error of 20% or less is obtained for 51% of transcripts by Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 40% of transcripts by Cufflinks and RSEM and 30% by eXpress. Titration order consistency is correct for 47% of transcripts for Mix&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 41% for Cufflinks and RSEM and 34% for eXpress. We, further, observe improved repeatability across laboratory sites with a relative increase in R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; between 8% and 44% and reduced standard deviation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/E8FD3x2evB0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Working memory (WM) is the ability to remember and manipulate information for short time intervals. Recent studies have proposed that sustained firing encoding the contents of WM is ubiquitous across cortical neurons. We review here the collective evidence supporting this claim. A variety of studies report that neurons in prefrontal, parietal, and inferotemporal association cortices show robust sustained activity encoding the location and features of memoranda during WM tasks. However, reports of WM-related sustained activity in early sensory areas are rare, and typically lack stimulus specificity.</description>

	<description>Brain dynamic changes associated with schizophrenia are largely equivocal, with interpretation complicated by many factors, such as the presence of therapeutic agents and the complex nature of the syndrome itself. Evidence for a brain-wide change in individual network oscillations, shared by all patients, is largely equivocal, but stronger for lower (delta) than for higher (gamma) bands. However, region-specific changes in rhythms across multiple, interdependent, nested frequencies may correlate better with pathology.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: FIMTrack: An open source tracking and locomotion analysis software for small animals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005530</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/RnKp9roQszY/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Risse, Dimitri Berh, Nils Otto, Christian Klämbt, Xiaoyi Jiang&lt;/p&gt;

Imaging and analyzing the locomotion behavior of small animals such as Drosophila larvae or C. elegans worms has become an integral subject of biological research. In the past we have introduced FIM, a novel imaging system feasible to extract high contrast images. This system in combination with the associated tracking software FIMTrack is already used by many groups all over the world. However, so far there has not been an in-depth discussion of the technical aspects. Here we elaborate on the implementation details of FIMTrack and give an in-depth explanation of the used algorithms. Among others, the software offers several tracking strategies to cover a wide range of different model organisms, locomotion types, and camera properties. Furthermore, the software facilitates stimuli-based analysis in combination with built-in manual tracking and correction functionalities. All features are integrated in an easy-to-use graphical user interface. To demonstrate the potential of FIMTrack we provide an evaluation of its accuracy using manually labeled data. The source code is available under the GNU GPLv3 at https://github.com/i-git/FIMTrack and pre-compiled binaries for Windows and Mac are available at http://fim.uni-muenster.de.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RnKp9roQszY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Identifying stochastic oscillations in single-cell live imaging time series using Gaussian processes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005479</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/-1OSdE0Uj50/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Nick E. Phillips, Cerys Manning, Nancy Papalopulu, Magnus Rattray&lt;/p&gt;

Multiple biological processes are driven by oscillatory gene expression at different time scales. Pulsatile dynamics are thought to be widespread, and single-cell live imaging of gene expression has lead to a surge of dynamic, possibly oscillatory, data for different gene networks. However, the regulation of gene expression at the level of an individual cell involves reactions between finite numbers of molecules, and this can result in inherent randomness in expression dynamics, which blurs the boundaries between aperiodic fluctuations and noisy oscillators. This underlies a new challenge to the experimentalist because neither intuition nor pre-existing methods work well for identifying oscillatory activity in noisy biological time series. Thus, there is an acute need for an objective statistical method for classifying whether an experimentally derived noisy time series is periodic. Here, we present a new data analysis method that combines mechanistic stochastic modelling with the powerful methods of non-parametric regression with Gaussian processes. Our method can distinguish oscillatory gene expression from random fluctuations of non-oscillatory expression in single-cell time series, despite peak-to-peak variability in period and amplitude of single-cell oscillations. We show that our method outperforms the Lomb-Scargle periodogram in successfully classifying cells as oscillatory or non-oscillatory in data simulated from a simple genetic oscillator model and in experimental data. Analysis of bioluminescent live-cell imaging shows a significantly greater number of oscillatory cells when luciferase is driven by a &lt;i&gt;Hes1&lt;/i&gt; promoter (10/19), which has previously been reported to oscillate, than the constitutive MoMuLV 5’ LTR (MMLV) promoter (0/25). The method can be applied to data from any gene network to both quantify the proportion of oscillating cells within a population and to measure the period and quality of oscillations. It is publicly available as a MATLAB package.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-1OSdE0Uj50&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Rhythmical activity patterns are ubiquitous in nature. We study an oscillatory biological system: collective activity cycles in ant colonies. Ant colonies have become model systems for research on biological networks because the interactions between the component parts are visible to the naked eye, and because the time-ordered contact network formed by these interactions serves as the substrate for the distribution of information and other resources throughout the colony. To understand how the collective activity cycles influence the contact network transport properties, we used an automated tracking system to record the movement of all the individuals within nine different ant colonies. From these trajectories we extracted over two million ant-to-ant interactions. Time-series analysis of the temporal fluctuations of the overall colony interaction and movement rates revealed that both the period and amplitude of the activity cycles exhibit a diurnal cycle, in which daytime cycles are faster and of greater amplitude than night cycles. Using epidemiology-derived models of transmission over networks, we compared the transmission properties of the observed periodic contact networks with those of synthetic aperiodic networks. These simulations revealed that contrary to some predictions, regularly-oscillating contact networks should impede information transmission. Further, we provide a mechanistic explanation for this effect, and present evidence in support of it.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5hhqdumyrcA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Immune-Induced Fever Is Dependent on Local But Not Generalized Prostaglandin E2 Synthesis in the Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fever occurs upon binding of prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to EP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the median preoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus, but the origin of the pyrogenic PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has not been clearly determined. Here, using mice of both sexes, we examined the role of local versus generalized PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production in the brain for the febrile response. In wild-type mice and in mice with genetic deletion of the prostaglandin synthesizing enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 in the brain endothelium, generated with an inducible CreER&lt;sup&gt;T2&lt;/sup&gt; under the &lt;i&gt;Slco1c1&lt;/i&gt; promoter, PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels in the CSF were only weakly related to the magnitude of the febrile response, whereas the PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesizing capacity in the hypothalamus, as reflected in the levels of cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA, showed strong correlation with the immune-induced fever. Histological analysis showed that the deletion of cyclooxygenase-2 in brain endothelial cells occurred preferentially in small- and medium-sized vessels deep in the brain parenchyma, such as in the hypothalamus, whereas larger vessels, and particularly those close to the neocortical surface and in the meninges, were left unaffected, hence leaving PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis largely intact in major parts of the brain while significantly reducing it in the region critical for the febrile response. Furthermore, injection of a virus vector expressing microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) into the median preoptic nucleus of fever-refractive mPGES-1 knock-out mice, resulted in a temperature elevation in response to LPS. We conclude that the febrile response is dependent on local release of PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; onto its target neurons and not on the overall PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; By using mice with selective deletion of prostaglandin synthesis in brain endothelial cells, we demonstrate that local prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) production in deep brain areas, such as the hypothalamus, which is the site of thermoregulatory neurons, is critical for the febrile response to peripheral inflammation. In contrast, PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production in other brain areas and the overall PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; level in the brain do not influence the febrile response. Furthermore, partly restoring the PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesizing capacity in the anterior hypothalamus of mice lacking such capacity with a lentiviral vector resulted in a temperature elevation in response to LPS. These data imply that the febrile response is dependent on the local release of PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; onto its target neurons, possibly by a paracrine mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Posterior Inferotemporal Cortex Cells Use Multiple Input Pathways for Shape Encoding</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/19/5019?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the macaque monkey brain, posterior inferior temporal (PIT) cortex cells contribute to visual object recognition. They receive concurrent inputs from visual areas V4, V3, and V2. We asked how these different anatomical pathways shape PIT response properties by deactivating them while monitoring PIT activity in two male macaques. We found that cooling of V4 or V2|3 did not lead to consistent changes in population excitatory drive; however, population pattern analyses showed that V4-based pathways were more important than V2|3-based pathways. We did not find any image features that predicted decoding accuracy differences between both interventions. Using the HMAX hierarchical model of visual recognition, we found that different groups of simulated &quot;PIT&quot; units with different input histories (lacking &quot;V2|3&quot; or &quot;V4&quot; input) allowed for comparable levels of object-decoding performance and that removing a large fraction of &quot;PIT&quot; activity resulted in similar drops in performance as in the cooling experiments. We conclude that distinct input pathways to PIT relay similar types of shape information, with V1-dependent V4 cells providing more quantitatively useful information for overall encoding than cells in V2 projecting directly to PIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Convolutional neural networks are the best models of the visual system, but most emphasize input transformations across a serial hierarchy akin to the primary &quot;ventral stream&quot; (V1 -&amp;gt; V2 -&amp;gt; V4 -&amp;gt; IT). However, the ventral stream also comprises parallel &quot;bypass&quot; pathways: V1 also connects to V4, and V2 to IT. To explore the advantages of mixing long and short pathways in the macaque brain, we used cortical cooling to silence inputs to posterior IT and compared the findings with an HMAX model with parallel pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Selective Modulation of the Pupil Light Reflex by Microstimulation of Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/19/5008?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to flexibly regulate sensorimotor responses, perhaps through modulating activity in other circuits. However, the scope of that control remains unknown: it remains unclear whether the PFC can modulate basic reflexes. One canonical example of a central reflex is the pupil light reflex (PLR): the automatic constriction of the pupil in response to luminance increments. Unlike pupil size, which depends on the interaction of multiple physiological and neuromodulatory influences, the PLR reflects the action of a simple brainstem circuit. However, emerging behavioral evidence suggests that the PLR may be modulated by cognitive processes. Although the neural basis of these modulations remains unknown, one possible source is the PFC, particularly the frontal eye field (FEF), an area of the PFC implicated in the control of attention. We show that microstimulation of the rhesus macaque FEF alters the magnitude of the PLR in a spatially specific manner. FEF microstimulation enhanced the PLR to probes presented within the stimulated visual field, but suppressed the PLR to probes at nonoverlapping locations. The spatial specificity of this effect parallels the effect of FEF stimulation on attention and suggests that FEF is capable of modulating visuomotor transformations performed at a lower level than was previously known. These results provide evidence of the selective regulation of a basic brainstem reflex by the PFC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The pupil light reflex (PLR) is our brain's first and most fundamental mechanism for light adaptation. Although it is often described in textbooks as being an immutable reflex, converging evidence suggests that the magnitude of the PLR is modulated by cognitive factors. The neural bases of these modulations are unknown. Here, we report that microstimulation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) modulates the gain of the PLR, changing how a simple reflex circuit responds to physically identical stimuli. These results suggest that control structures such as the PFC can add complexity and flexibility to even a basic brainstem circuit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Spacing Effect for Structural Synaptic Plasticity Provides Specificity and Precision in Plastic Changes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/19/4992?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In contrast to trials of training without intervals (massed training), training trials spaced over time (spaced training) induce a more persistent memory identified as long-term memory (LTM). This phenomenon, known as the spacing effect for memory, is poorly understood. LTM is supported by structural synaptic plasticity; however, how synapses integrate spaced stimuli remains elusive. Here, we analyzed events of structural synaptic plasticity at the single-synapse level after distinct patterns of stimulation in motoneurons of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. We found that the spacing effect is a phenomenon detected at synaptic level, which determines the specificity and the precision in structural synaptic plasticity. Whereas a single pulse of stimulation (massed) induced structural synaptic plasticity, the same amount of stimulation divided in three spaced stimuli completely prevented it. This inhibitory effect was determined by the length of the interstimulus intervals. The inhibitory effect of the spacing was lost by suppressing the activity of Ras or mitogen-activated protein kinase, whereas the overexpression of Ras-WT enhanced it. Moreover, dividing the same total time of stimulation into five or more stimuli produced a higher precision in the number of events of plasticity. Ras mutations associated with intellectual disability abolished the spacing effect and led neurons to decode distinct stimulation patterns as massed stimulation. This evidence suggests that the spacing effect for memory may result from the effect of the spacing in synaptic plasticity, which appears to be a property not limited to neurons involved in learning and memory. We propose a model of spacing-dependent structural synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Long-term memory (LTM) induced by repeated trials spaced over time is known as the spacing effect, a common property in the animal kingdom. Altered mechanisms in the spacing effect have been found in animal models of disorders with intellectual disability, such as Noonan syndrome. Although LTM is sustained by structural synaptic plasticity, how synapses integrate spaced stimuli and decode them into specific plastic changes remains elusive. Here, we show that the spacing effect is a phenomenon detected at the synaptic level, which determines the properties of the response in structural plasticity, including precision of such response. Whereas suppressing or enhancing Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling changed how synapses decode a pattern of stimuli, a disease-related Ras allele abolished the spacing effect for plastic changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To assess the utility of CT perfusion for selection of patients for endovascular therapy up to 18 hours after symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We conducted a multicenter cohort study of consecutive acute stroke patients scheduled to undergo endovascular therapy within 90 min after a baseline CTP. Patients were classified as ‘target mismatch' if they had a small ischemic core and a large penumbra on their baseline CT perfusion. Reperfusion was defined as &amp;gt;50% reduction in critical hypoperfusion between the baseline CT perfusion and the 36-hour follow-up MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Of the 201 patients enrolled, 190 patients with an adequate baseline CT perfusion study who underwent angiography were included; mean age 66 years, median NIHSS 16, median time from symptom onset to endovascular therapy 5.2 hours. Rate of reperfusion was 89%. In patients with target mismatch (n=131), reperfusion was associated with higher odds of favorable clinical response, defined as an improvement of ≥8 points on the NIH Stroke Scale (83% vs 44%, p=0.002; adjusted OR=6.6; 95% CI 2.1-20.9). This association did not differ between patients treated within 6 hrs (OR = 6.4; 95% CI 1.5-27.8) and those treated beyond 6 hrs after symptom onset (OR = 13.7; 95% CI 1.4-140).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: The robust association between endovascular reperfusion and good outcome among patients with the CT perfusion target mismatch profile treated up to 18 hours after symptom onset supports a randomized trial of endovascular therapy in this patient population.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To evaluate nonpublication rates among trials of new successful and unsuccessful neurological drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: ‘Licensed' drugs consisted of all novel agents receiving FDA licensure 2005 to 2012 inclusive in seven neurological disorders. ‘Stalled' drugs included all experimental agents tested in the same domains that had at least one completed phase III trial in the same timeframe but failed to receive FDA approval. Trials of these drugs were included in our sample if their primary outcome collection occurred before October 1, 2010. We determined the publication status of eligible trials using searches of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clinicaltrials.gov&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov&quot;&gt;clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/a&gt;, Google Scholar, PubMed, Embase, sponsor websites, and direct electronic query of trial contacts and sponsors. The primary outcome was time to journal publication (or results reporting in other media) after study completion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: The adjusted hazard ratio for publication was 1.79 (95% confidence interval 1.20 to 2.67) in favour of licensed drugs. Based on the criteria for nonpublication in this report, 14,092 and 33,882 volunteers participated in unpublished trials of licensed and stalled neurological drugs, respectively. Result data were not publicly available in any form for 10% (16/163) and 46% (94/203) of trials of licensed and stalled drugs, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Results of trials for stalled drugs are heavily underreported. This deprives research and care communities of evidence about pathophysiology, drug class effects, and the value of surrogate endpoints in trials. This article is protected by copyright.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common dose-limiting side effect experienced by patients receiving treatment for cancer. Approximately 30-40% of patients treated with neurotoxic chemotherapy will develop CIPN and there is considerable variability in its severity between patients. It is often sensory-predominant with pain and can lead to long-term morbidity in survivors. The prevalence and burden of CIPN late effects will likely increase as cancer survival rates continue to improve. In this review, we discuss the approach to peripheral neuropathy in patients with cancer and address the clinical phenotypes and pathomechanisms of specific neurotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.

Normative models of human cognition often appeal to Bayesian filtering, which provides optimal online estimates of unknown or hidden states of the world, based on previous observations. However, in many cases it is necessary to optimise beliefs about sequences of states rather than just the current state. Importantly, Bayesian filtering and sequential inference strategies make different predictions about beliefs and subsequent choices, rendering them behaviourally dissociable. Taking data from a probabilistic reversal task we show that subjects’ choices provide strong evidence that they are representing short sequences of states. Between-subject measures of this implicit sequential inference strategy had a neurobiological underpinning and correlated with grey matter density in prefrontal and parietal cortex, as well as the hippocampus. Our findings provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence for sequential inference in human cognition, and by exploiting between-subject variation in this measure we provide pointers to its neuronal substrates.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XLtyEDtEW7A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Single-molecule protein identification by sub-nanopore sensors</title>

Recent advances in top-down mass spectrometry enabled identification of intact proteins, but this technology still faces challenges. For example, top-down mass spectrometry suffers from a lack of sensitivity since the ion counts for a single fragmentation event are often low. In contrast, nanopore technology is exquisitely sensitive to single intact molecules, but it has only been successfully applied to DNA sequencing, so far. Here, we explore the potential of sub-nanopores for single-molecule protein identification (SMPI) and describe an algorithm for identification of the electrical current blockade signal (nanospectrum) resulting from the translocation of a denaturated, linearly charged protein through a sub-nanopore. The analysis of identification p-values suggests that the current technology is already sufficient for matching nanospectra against small protein databases, e.g., protein identification in bacterial proteomes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tWPCIZAkdQ4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and devastating neurodegeneration, not only as a result of the extracellular accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ) and intracellular accumulation of tau, but also as a consequence of the dysfunction and loss of synapses. Although significant advances have been made in our understanding of the relationship of the pathological role of Aβ and tau in synapse dysfunction, several questions remain as to how Aβ and tau interdependently cause impairments in synaptic function in AD.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in cognitive processes, such as pattern separation, and in the behavioural effects of stress and antidepressants. Young adult-born neurons have been shown to inhibit the overall activity of the dentate gyrus by recruiting local interneurons, which may result in &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Guy A Orban&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study combines monkey behavioral testing with electrical stimulation of face patches, located with functional MRI and studied electrophysiologically, to probe the behavioral relevance of the face patches' selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authors: Matthew I Becker &amp;amp; Abigail L Person&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical advances in calcium imaging enable the first tests of classic theories of cerebellar learning. Two independent groups reveal dense representation of surprising modalities in cerebellar granule cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Dennis J Selkoe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;α-Synuclein is present at high levels in all neurons and their synapses. We now learn that this protein helps dilate the fusion pore, which forms transiently during vesicle exocytosis, promoting release of certain neurotransmitters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capillary endothelial cells sense neuronal activity-evoked increases in extracellular K+ via KIR2.1 inwardly rectifying K+ channels. The ensuing hyperpolarization travels upstream along the vascular network, reaching arterioles and evoking vasodilation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authors: Aimee W. Kao, Andrew McKay, Param Priya Singh, Anne Brunet &amp;amp; Eric J. Huang&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery that heterozygous and homozygous mutations in the gene encoding progranulin are causally linked to frontotemporal dementia and lysosomal storage disease, respectively, reveals previously unrecognized roles of the progranulin protein in regulating lysosome biogenesis and function. Given the importance of lysosomes in cellular homeostasis, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Darran Yates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new studies provide new tools for examining mechanisms of plasticity in dendrites. Tang and Yasuda developed new fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensors for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase A (PKA), which are implicated in synaptic plasticity, primarily by replacing the fluorophore &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans exhibit socially contagious behaviours, including contagious itching, but studying the underlying mechanisms has been difficult. Yu et al. found that they could socially transmit scratching to mice by allowing them to watch mice with chronic itch. The observer mice showed upregulated neuronal activity &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Darran Yates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axonal injuries can trigger a process of axonal disintegration known as Wallerian degeneration, which is thought to be largely driven by intrinsic mechanisms in the axon. Here, knocking out the death receptor 6 (Dr6) gene in cultured mouse sympathetic or dorsal root ganglion &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Pharmacoresistant seizures and cytotoxic cerebral edema are serious complications of ischemic and traumatic brain injury. Intraneuronal Cl− concentration ([Cl−]i) regulation impacts on both cell volume homeostasis and Cl−-permeable GABAA receptor-dependent membrane excitability. Understanding the pleiotropic molecular determinants of neuronal [Cl−]i − cytoplasmic impermeant anions, polyanionic extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins, and plasmalemmal Cl− transporters − could help the identification of novel anticonvulsive and neuroprotective targets.</description>

	<description>We sleep almost one-third of our lives and sleep plays an important role in critical brain functions like memory formation and consolidation. The role of sleep in cerebellar processing, however, constitutes an enigma in the field of neuroscience; we know little about cerebellar sleep-physiology, cerebro–cerebellar interactions during sleep, or the contributions of sleep to cerebellum-dependent memory consolidation. Likewise, we do not understand why cerebellar malfunction can lead to changes in the sleep–wake cycle and sleep disorders.</description>
