	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Machine learning of neuroimaging to diagnose cognitive impairment and dementia: a systematic review and comparative analysis. (arXiv:1804.01961v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01961</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01961</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION: Advanced machine learning methods might help to identify
dementia risk from neuroimaging, but their accuracy to date is unclear.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;METHODS: We systematically reviewed the literature, 2006 to late 2016, for
machine learning studies differentiating healthy ageing through to dementia of
various types, assessing study quality, and comparing accuracy at different
disease boundaries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RESULTS: Of 111 relevant studies, most assessed Alzheimer's disease (AD) vs
healthy controls, used ADNI data, support vector machines and only T1-weighted
sequences. Accuracy was highest for differentiating AD from healthy controls,
and poor for differentiating healthy controls vs MCI vs AD, or MCI converters
vs non-converters. Accuracy increased using combined data types, but not by
data source, sample size or machine learning method.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION: Machine learning does not differentiate clinically-relevant
disease categories yet. More diverse datasets, combinations of different types
of data, and close clinical integration of machine learning would help to
advance the field.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01958</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many neurodegenerative diseases are related to the propagation and
accumulation of toxic proteins throughout the brain. The lesions created by
aggregates of these toxic proteins further lead to cell death and accelerated
tissue atrophy. A striking feature of some of these diseases is their
characteristic pattern and evolution, leading to well-codified disease stages
visible to neuropathology and associated with various cognitive deficits and
pathologies. Here, we simulate the anisotropic propagation and accumulation of
toxic proteins in full brain geometry. We show that the same model with
different initial seeding zones reproduces the characteristic evolution of
different prion-like diseases. We also recover the expected evolution of the
total toxic protein load. Finally, we couple our transport model to a
mechanical atrophy model to obtain the typical degeneration patterns found in
neurodegenerative diseases.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: An Accelerated LIF Neuronal Network Array for a Large Scale Mixed-Signal Neuromorphic Architecture. (arXiv:1804.01906v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01906</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01906</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Here we present an array of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron circuits
designed for the second-generation BrainScaleS mixed-signal 65-nm CMOS
neuromorphic hardware. The neuronal array is embedded in the analog network
core of a scaled-down prototype HICANN-DLS chip. Designed as continuous-time
circuits, the neurons are highly tunable and reconfigurable elements with
accelerated dynamics. Each neuron integrates input current from a multitude of
incoming synapses and evokes a digital spike event output. The circuit offers a
wide tuning range for synaptic and membrane time constants, as well as for
refractory periods to cover a number of computational models. We elucidate our
design methodology, underlying circuit design, calibration and measurement
results from individual sub-circuits across multiple dies. The circuit dynamics
match with the behavior of the LIF mathematical model. We further demonstrate a
winner-take-all network on the prototype chip as a typical element of cortical
processing.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01840</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01840</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Here we describe a multi-compartment neuron circuit based on the
Adaptive-Exponential I&amp;amp;F (AdEx) model, developed for the second-generation
BrainScaleS hardware. Based on an existing modular Leaky Integrate-and-Fire
(LIF) architecture designed in 65 nm CMOS, the circuit features exponential
spike generation, neuronal adaptation, inter-compartmental connections as well
as a conductance-based reset. The design reproduces a diverse set of firing
patterns observed in cortical pyramidal neurons. Further, it enables the
emulation of sodium and calcium spikes, as well as N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA)
plateau potentials known from apical and thin dendrites. We characterize the
AdEx circuit extensions and exemplify how the interplay between passive and
non-linear active signal processing enhances the computational capabilities of
single (but structured) on-chip neurons.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01704</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the last century, it has been known that neural stem cells
(NSCs) play a key role in regenerative medicine to cure the neurodegenerative
disease. This review article covers about the introduction to neural stem cell
biology and the isolation, differentiation and transplantation
methods/techniques of neural stem cells. The neural stem cells can be
transplanted into the human brain in the future to replace the damaged and dead
neurons. The highly limited access to embryonic stem cells and ethical issues
have escalated the search for other NSC sources. The developing technologies
are indicating that it can be achieved before the end of this century. In
addition, the differentiation and the maturation of NSCs can artificially
accelerate by modern methods.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial neural networks (ANNs), while exceptionally useful for
classification, are vulnerable to misdirection. Small amounts of noise can
significantly affect their ability to correctly complete a task. Instead of
generalizing concepts, ANNs seem to focus on surface statistical regularities
in a given task. Here we compare how recurrent artificial neural networks, long
short-term memory units, and Markov Brains sense and remember their
environments. We show that information in Markov Brains is localized and
sparsely distributed, while the other neural network substrates &quot;smear&quot;
information about the environment across all nodes, which makes them vulnerable
to noise.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Community structure and modularity index determination of signed graphs: Pre- and post-ictal hippocampal depth recordings. (arXiv:1804.01568v1 [cs.SI])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01568</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01568</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, there is an increased interest in the role of static
properties of and dynamics on signed graphs in physical, biological, and social
networks. In particular, community structures of signed graphs and their
modularity indices have drawn special attention, and there are numerous methods
to identify them. Here we provide the technical details of implementing four
important methods that in their nature are very different from one another; two
spectral methods, one using the adjacency matrix and one using the Laplacian
matrix, a heuristic graph theoretic method using a concept of edge centrality,
and finally, a stochastic combinatorial optimization method. Because of the
novel nature of the methods, we focus on an interesting problem of community
structures in brain network of the CA1 region of the hippocampus of
anesthetized rats to study the pre-ictal and post-ictal states. We use recent
electroenecephalograph (EEG) depth recordings for a period of 117 minutes at a
sampling rate of 1000Hz. Since the electrode used has 16-contact points, we
construct non-overlapping but sliding 100,000 sample-windowed correlation
matrices or functional connectivity (FC) matrices over the recorded time,
yielding signed graphs. Our results from the clustering methods both at the
pre-ictal and post-ictal periods of the depth recording reported here for the
first time yield convincing answers to differing community structures.

Current rates of species loss triggered numerous attempts to protect and conserve biodiversity. Species conservation, however, requires species identification skills, a competence obtained through intensive training and experience. Field researchers, land managers, educators, civil servants, and the interested public would greatly benefit from accessible, up-to-date tools automating the process of species identification. Currently, relevant technologies, such as digital cameras, mobile devices, and remote access to databases, are ubiquitously available, accompanied by significant advances in image processing and pattern recognition. The idea of automated species identification is approaching reality. We review the technical status quo on computer vision approaches for plant species identification, highlight the main research challenges to overcome in providing applicable tools, and conclude with a discussion of open and future research thrusts.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bfmDpVYKmqI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cytoskeletal components, such as tubulins and actins, have the remarkable ability to organize themselves into filaments and networks to support specialized and compartmentalized functions. Alterations in cytoskeletal proteins have long been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on recent findings, primarily from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans that illustrate how different tubulin protein isotypes can play distinct roles in neuronal development and function. Additionally, we discuss studies revealing new regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and highlight recent technological advances in in vivo imaging and functional dissection of the neuronal cytoskeleton. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

By probing how activity patterns in different types of neurons and circuits contribute to behavior, these tools can help inform mechanistic models of brain function and explain the roles of distinct circuit elements. However, in systems where functions are distributed over large networks, interpreting causality experiments can be challenging. Here we review common assumptions underlying circuit manipulations in behaving animals and discuss the strengths and limitations of different approaches. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

To be effective, these systems must be able to simultaneously record and stimulate neural activity, a task made difficult by persistent stimulation artifacts that distort and obscure underlying biomarkers. To enable simultaneous stimulation and recording, several techniques have been proposed. These techniques involve artifact-preventing system configurations, resilient recording front-ends, and back-end signal processing for removing recorded artifacts. Co-designing and integrating these artifact cancellation techniques will be key to enabling neuromodulation systems to stimulate and record at the same time. Here, we review the state-of-the-art for these techniques and their role in achieving artifact-free neuromodulation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

With the development of sensitive genetically encoded calcium indicators, this has extended to the whole-brain imaging of neural activity with cellular resolution. This technique has been used to study brain-wide population dynamics accompanying sensory processing and sensorimotor transformations, and has spurred the development of innovative closed-loop behavioral paradigms in which stimulus–response relationships can be studied. More recently, microscopes have been developed that allow whole-brain calcium imaging in freely swimming and behaving larvae. In this review, we highlight the technologies underlying whole-brain functional imaging in zebrafish, provide examples of the sensory and motor processes that have been studied with this technique, and discuss the need to merge data from whole-brain functional imaging studies with neurochemical and anatomical information to develop holistic models of functional neural circuits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Nicholas A   Steinmetz, Christof   Koch, Kenneth D   Harris, Matteo   Carandini&lt;br /&gt; Electrophysiological methods are the gold standard in neuroscience because they reveal the activity of individual neurons at high temporal resolution and in arbitrary brain locations. Microelectrode arrays based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, such as Neuropixels probes, look set to transform these methods. Neuropixels probes provide ∼1000 recording sites on an extremely narrow shank, with on-board amplification, digitization, and multiplexing. They deliver low-noise recordings from hundreds of neurons, providing a step change in the type of data available to neuroscientists. Here we discuss the opportunities afforded by these probes for large-scale electrophysiology, the challenges associated with data processing and anatomical localization, and avenues for further improvements of the technology. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Miao   He, Z Josh   Huang&lt;br /&gt; Understanding brain circuit organization and function requires systematic dissection of its cellular components. With vast cell number and diversity, mammalian nervous systems present a daunting challenge for achieving specific and comprehensive cell type access—prerequisite to circuit analysis. Genetic approaches in the mouse have relied on germline engineering to access marker-defined cell populations. Combinatorial strategies that engage marker intersection, anatomy and projection pattern (e.g. antero-grade and retro-grade viral vectors), and developmental lineage substantially increase the specificity of cell type targeting. While increasing number of mouse cell types are becoming experimentally accessible, comprehensive coverage requires larger coordinated efforts with strategic infrastructural and fiscal planning. CRISPR-based genome editing may enable cell type access in other species, but issues of time, cost and ethics remain, especially for primates. Novel approaches that bypass the germline, such as somatic cell engineering and cell surface-based gene delivery, may reduce the barrier of genetic access to mammalian cell types. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Designing behavioral paradigms that provide a solid foundation to ask questions about decision-making computations and mechanisms is a difficult and often underestimated challenge. Here, we propose three dimensions on which we can consider rodent decision-making tasks: ethological validity, task complexity, and stimulus-response compatibility. We review recent research through this lens, and provide practical guidance for researchers in the decision-making field. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: August 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Natali L   Chanaday, Ege T   Kavalali&lt;br /&gt; Presynaptic nerve terminals release neurotransmitter synchronously, asynchronously or spontaneously. During synchronous neurotransmission release is precisely coupled to action potentials, in contrast, asynchronous release events show only loose temporal coupling to presynaptic activity whereas spontaneous neurotransmission occurs independent of presynaptic activity. The mechanisms that give rise to this diversity in neurotransmitter release modes are poorly understood. Recent studies have described several presynaptic molecular pathways controlling synaptic vesicle pool segregation and recycling, which in turn may dictate distinct modes of neurotransmitter release. In this article, we review this recent work regarding neurotransmitter release modes and their relationship to synaptic vesicle pool dynamics as well as the molecular machinery that establishes synaptic vesicle pool identity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Denis   Scaini, Laura   Ballerini&lt;br /&gt; Interfacing the nervous system with devices able to efficiently record or modulate the electrical activity of neuronal cells represents the underlying foundation of future theranostic applications in neurology and of current openings in neuroscience research. These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural network models in neuroscience allow one to study how the connections
between neurons shape the activity of neural circuits in the brain. In this
chapter, we study Combinatorial Threshold-Linear Networks (CTLNs) in order to
understand how the pattern of connectivity, as encoded by a directed graph,
shapes the emergent nonlinear dynamics of the corresponding network. Important
aspects of these dynamics are controlled by the stable and unstable fixed
points of the network, and we show how these fixed points can be determined via
graph-based rules. We also present an algorithm for predicting sequences of
neural activation from the underlying directed graph, and examine the effect of
graph symmetries on a network's set of attractors.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Gaussian Process Uncertainty in Age Estimation as a Measure of Brain Abnormality. (arXiv:1804.01296v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01296</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01296</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multivariate regression models for age estimation are a powerful tool for
assessing abnormal brain morphology associated to neuropathology. Age
prediction models are built on cohorts of healthy subjects and are built to
reflect normal aging patterns. The application of these multivariate models to
diseased subjects usually results in high prediction errors, under the
hypothesis that neuropathology presents a similar degenerative pattern as that
of accelerated aging. In this work, we propose an alternative to the idea that
pathology follows a similar trajectory than normal aging. Instead, we propose
the use of metrics which measure deviations from the mean aging trajectory. We
propose to measure these deviations using two different metrics: uncertainty in
a Gaussian process regression model and a newly proposed age weighted
uncertainty measure. Consequently, our approach assumes that pathologic brain
patterns are different to those of normal aging. We present results for
subjects with autism, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease to
highlight the versatility of the approach to different diseases and age ranges.
We evaluate volume, thickness, and VBM features for quantifying brain
morphology. Our evaluations are performed on a large number of images obtained
from a variety of publicly available neuroimaging databases. Across all
features, our uncertainty based measurements yield a better separation between
diseased subjects and healthy individuals than the prediction error. Finally,
we illustrate differences in the disease pattern to normal aging, supporting
the application of uncertainty as a measure of neuropathology.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Formin 2 Regulates Lysosomal Degradation of Wnt-Associated β-Catenin in Neural Progenitors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy073</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy073/4962184?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Although neural progenitor proliferation along the ventricular zone is regulated by β-catenin through Wnt signaling, the cytoskeletal mechanisms that regulate expression and localization of these proteins are not well understood. Our prior studies have shown that loss of the actin-binding Filamin A (FlnA) and actin-nucleating protein Formin 2 (Fmn2) impairs endocytosis of low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-related protein 6 (Lrp6), thereby disrupting β-catenin activation, resulting in decreased brain size. Here, we report that activated RhoA-GTPase disengages Fmn2 N- to C-terminal binding to promote Fmn2 activation and redistribution into lysosomal vesicles. Fmn2 colocalizes with β-catenin in lysosomes and promotes its degradation. Further, Fmn2 binds the E3 ligase Smurf2, enhances Smurf2-dependent ubiquitination, and degradation of Dishevelled-2 (Dvl2), thereby initiates β-catenin degradation. Finally, Fmn2 overexpression disrupts neuroepithelial integrity, neuronal migration, and proliferation-phenotypes in E13 mouse embryos, as seen with loss of Fmn2+FlnA function. Conversely, co-expression of Dvl2 with Fmn2 rescues the proliferation defect due to Fmn2 overexpression in mouse embryos. These findings suggest that there is a homeostatic feedback mechanism in the cytoskeletal-dependent regulation of neural proliferation within the cerebral cortex. Upstream, Fmn2 promotes proliferation by stabilizing the Lrp6 receptor, leading to β-catenin activation. Downstream, RhoA-activated Fmn2 promotes lysosomal degradation of Dvl2, leading to β-catenin degradation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Slow-wave activity (SWA), and its coupling with other sleep features, reorganizes cortical circuitry, supporting cognition. This raises the question: can cognition be improved through SWA enhancement? SWA enhancement techniques range from behavioral interventions (such as exercise), which have high feasibility but low specificity, to laboratory-based techniques (such as transcranial stimulation), which have high specificity but are less feasible for widespread use. In this review we describe the pathways through which SWA is enhanced.</description>

	<description>Collins, Anastasiades et al. show that prefrontal cortex (PFC) engages multiple thalamic nuclei. Dorsal and ventral thalamus in turn target distinct networks within the PFC. Finally, local connectivity in the PFC completes a loop connecting thalamic input with cortico-thalamic output.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Phospholipid membranes promote the early stage assembly of {alpha}-synuclein aggregates</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/295782v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/295782v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Development of Parkinson's disease is associated with spontaneous self-assembly of -synuclein (-syn). Efforts aimed at understanding this process have produced little clarity and the mechanism remains elusive. We report a novel effect of phospholipid bilayers on the catalysis of -syn aggregation from monomers. We directly visualized -syn aggregation on supported lipid bilayers using time-lapse atomic force microscopy. We discovered that -syn assemble in aggregates on bilayer surfaces even at the nanomolar concentration of monomers in solution. The efficiency of the aggregation process depends on the membrane composition, being highest for a negatively charged bilayer. Furthermore, assembled aggregates can dissociate from the surface, suggesting that on-surface aggregation can be a mechanism by which pathological aggregates are produced. Computational modeling revealed that interaction of -syn with bilayer surface changes the protein conformation and its affinity to assemble into dimers, and these properties depend on the bilayer composition. A model of the membrane-mediated aggregation triggering the assembly of neurotoxic aggregates is proposed.</description>

	<description>Listeners engaged in an auditory selective attention task are better able to report brief deviants in a target auditory stream when a task-irrelevant visual stimulus is coherently modulated with the target stream, than when it is coherent with the distractor stream (Maddox et al., 2015). Here, we demonstrate that learning to better discriminate auditory-visual temporal coherence, but not simple exposure to temporally coherent AV stimuli, enhances the ability of listeners to exploit visual information in this task. After 5 short training sessions listeners were able to benefit from auditory-visual temporal coherence both when the visual stimulus is temporally coherent with the target or with the distractor stream, relative to an independently modulated condition. These findings indicate that training to discriminate cross-modal temporal coherence fundamentally changes how listeners exploit visual information for auditory scene analysis.</description>

	<description>Schizophrenia is a debilitating disorder with complex and unclarified etiological factors. Sex differences have been observed in humans but animal models have only focused on male subjects. In this study, we report the establishment of the neurodevelopmental MAM model of schizophrenia in mice and compare the schizotypic-like characteristics and cognitive function in both sexes. Pregnant mice were injected with 26mg/kg(i.p.) of Methylazoxy-methanol acetate (MAM) or saline (5ml/kg) on gestational day (GD) 16 (MAM-16) or 17 (MAM-17). Behavioral, histological and electrophysiological and mass spectrometry-based comparative proteomic techniques were employed to assess the schizotypic-like characteristics and cognitive function of adult male and female offspring (MAM- or saline-treated). Female MAM-16, but not MAM-17 treated mice exhibited enhanced hyperlocomotion after acute administration of the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, compared to saline treated mice. Male MAM-16, but not MAM-17 treated mice showed decreased pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex. Both male and female MAM-16 and MAM-17 treated mice exhibited reduced hippocampal (HPC) size and thinning of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), but only male MAM-16 treated mice showed decreased parvalbumin expression in HPC and PFC. Similarly, both male and female MAM-16 treated mice displayed impaired contextual fear memory, while only male MAM-16 treated mice exhibited deficits in the delayed alternation task. The neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie these cognitive functions were further investigated. Both male and female MAM-16 treated mice had significantly reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the HPC CA1 synapses, while only male MAM-16 treated mice exhibited decreased LTP in the PFC. Proteomic analyses of PFC lysates further showed significant MAM- and sex-dependent differences in regulation of protein expression. Our results demonstrate that while both male and female mice, prenatally exposed to MAM on GD16, display several core schizophrenia-like deficits and impairments in the hippocampus, only male MAM-treated mice have PFC-dependent cognitive deficits.</description>

	<description>Our understanding of learning difficulties largely comes from children with specific diagnoses or individuals selected from community/clinical samples according to strict inclusion criteria. Applying strict exclusionary criteria overemphasizes within-group homogeneity and between-group differences, and fails to capture comorbidity. Here we identify cognitive profiles in a large heterogeneous sample of struggling learners, using unsupervised machine learning in the form of an artificial neural network. Children were referred to the Centre for Attention Learning and Memory (CALM) by health and education professionals, irrespective of diagnosis or comorbidity, for problems in attention, memory, language, or poor school progress (n=530). Children completed a battery of cognitive and learning assessments, underwent a structural MRI scan, and their parents completed behaviour questionnaires. Within the network, we could identify four groups of children: i) children with broad cognitive difficulties, and severe reading, spelling and maths problems; ii) children with age-typical cognitive abilities and learning profiles; iii) children with working memory problems; and iv) children with phonological difficulties. Despite their contrasting cognitive profiles, the learning profiles for the latter two groups did not differ: both were around 1 SD below age-expected levels on all learning measures. Importantly a child's cognitive profile was not predicted by diagnosis or referral reason. We also constructed whole-brain structural connectomes for children from these four groupings (n=184), alongside an additional group of typically developing children (n=36), and identified distinct patterns of brain organisation for each group. This study represents a novel move towards identifying data-driven neurocognitive dimensions underlying learning-related difficulties in a representative sample of poor learners.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The cholinergic pesticide imidacloprid impairs contrast and direction sensitivity in motion detecting neurons of an insect pollinator</title>

	<description>Cholinergic pesticides such as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid are the most important insecticides used for plant protection worldwide. In recent decades concerns have been raised about side effects on non-target insect species, including altered foraging behaviour and navigation. Although pollinators rely on visual cues to forage and navigate their environment, the effect of neonicotinoids on visual processing have been largely overlooked. Here we describe a modified electrophysiological setup that allowed recordings of visually evoked responses while perfusing the brain in vivo. Long-lasting recordings from wide-field motion sensitive neurons of the hoverfly pollinator, Eristalis tenax, revealed that sub-lethal exposure to imidacloprid alters their physiological response to motion stimuli. We observed substantially increased spontaneous firing rate, reduced contrast sensitivity and weaker directional tuning to wide-field moving stimuli. This approach reveals sub-lethal effects of imidacloprid in the visual motion detecting system of an important pollinator with likely implications for flight control, hovering and routing.</description>

	<description>Studies of amnesic patients and animal models support a systems consolidation model, which posits that explicit memories formed in hippocampus are transferred to cortex over time1-6. Prelimbic cortex (PL), a subregion of the medial prefrontal cortex, is required for the expression of learned fear memories from hours after learning until weeks later7-12. While some studies suggested that prefrontal cortical neurons active during learning are required for memory retrieval13-15, others provided evidence for ongoing cortical circuit reorganization during memory consolidation10,16,17. It has been difficult to causally relate the activity of cortical neurons during learning or recent memory retrieval to their function in remote memory, in part due to a lack of tools18. Here we show that a new version of 'targeted recombination in active populations', TRAP2, has enhanced efficiency over the past version, providing brain-wide access to neurons activated by a particular experience. Using TRAP2, we accessed PL neurons activated during fear conditioning or 1-, 7-, or 14-day memory retrieval, and assessed their contributions to 28-day remote memory. We found that PL neurons TRAPed at later retrieval times were more likely to be reactivated during remote memory retrieval, and more effectively promoted remote memory retrieval. Furthermore, reducing PL activity during learning blunted the ability of TRAPed PL neurons to promote remote memory retrieval. Finally, a series of whole-brain analyses identified a set of cortical regions that were densely innervated by memory-TRAPed PL neurons and preferentially activated by PL neurons TRAPed during 14-day retrieval, and whose activity co-varied with PL and correlated with memory specificity. These findings support a model in which PL ensembles underlying remote memory undergo dynamic changes during the first two weeks after learning, which manifest as increased functional recruitment of cortical targets.</description>

	<description>The mammalian nervous system executes complex behaviors controlled by specialised, precisely positioned and interacting cell types. Here, we used RNA sequencing of half a million single cells to create a detailed census of cell types in the mouse nervous system. We mapped cell types spatially and derived a hierarchical, data-driven taxonomy. Neurons were the most diverse, and were grouped by developmental anatomical units, and by the expression of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Neuronal diversity was driven by genes encoding cell identity, synaptic connectivity, neurotransmission and membrane conductance. We discovered several distinct, regionally restricted, astrocytes types, which obeyed developmental boundaries and correlated with the spatial distribution of key glutamate and glycine neurotransmitters. In contrast, oligodendrocytes showed a loss of regional identity, followed by a secondary diversi cation. The resource presented here lays a solid foundation for understanding the molecular architecture of the mammalian nervous system, and enables genetic manipulation of specific cell types.</description>

	<description>Recognition of familiar as compared to unfamiliar faces is robust and resistant to marked image distortion or degradation. Here we tested the flexibility of familiar face recognition with a morphing paradigm where the appearance of a personally familiar face was mixed with the appearance of a stranger. The aim was to assess how categorical boundaries for recognition of identity are affected by familiarity. We found a narrower categorical boundary for the identity of personally familiar faces when they were mixed with unfamiliar identities as compared to the control condition, in which the appearance of two unfamiliar faces were mixed. Our results suggest that familiarity warps the representational geometry of face space, amplifying perceptual distances for small changes in the appearance of familiar faces that are inconsistent with the structural features that define their identities.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Spontaneous activity emerging from an inferred network model captures complex temporal dynamics of spiking data</title>

	<description>The combination of new recording techniques in neuroscience and powerful inference methods recently held the promise to recover useful effective models, at the single neuron or network level, directly from observed data. The value of a model of course should critically depend on its ability to reproduce the dynamical behavior of the modeled system; however, few attempts have been made to inquire into the dynamics of inferred models in neuroscience, and none, to our knowledge, at the network level. Here we introduce a principled modification of a widely used generalized linear model (GLM), and learn its structural and dynamic parameters from ex-vivo spiking data. We show that the new model is able to capture the most prominent features of the highly non-stationary and non-linear dynamics displayed by the biological network, where the reference GLM largely fails. Two ingredients turn out to be key for success. The first one is a bounded transfer function that makes the single neuron able to respond to its input in a saturating fashion; beyond its biological plausibility such property, by limiting the capacity of the neuron to transfer information, makes the coding more robust in the face of the highly variable network activity, and noise. The second ingredient is a super-Poisson spikes generative probabilistic mechanism; this feature, that accounts for the fact that observations largely undersample the network, allows the model neuron to more flexibly incorporate the observed activity fluctuations. Taken together, the two ingredients, without increasing complexity, allow the model to capture the key dynamic elements. When left free to generate its spontaneous activity, the inferred model proved able to reproduce not only the non-stationary population dynamics of the network, but also part of the fine-grained structure of the dynamics at the single neuron level.</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Common Sense in Choice: The Effect of Sensory Modality on Neural Value Representations</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Although it is well established that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) represents value using a common currency across categories of rewards, it is unknown whether the vmPFC represents value irrespective of the sensory modality in which alternatives are presented. In the current study, male and female human subjects completed a decision-making task while their neural activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging. On each trial, subjects chose between a safe alternative and a lottery, which was presented visually or aurally. A univariate conjunction analysis revealed that the anterior portion of the vmPFC tracks subjective value (SV) irrespective of the sensory modality. Using a novel cross-modality multivariate classifier, we were able to decode auditory value based on visual trials and vice versa. In addition, we found that the visual and auditory sensory cortices, which were identified using functional localizers, are also sensitive to the value of stimuli, albeit in a modality-specific manner. Whereas both primary and higher-order auditory cortices represented auditory SV (aSV), only a higher-order visual area represented visual SV (vSV). These findings expand our understanding of the common currency network of the brain and shed a new light on the interplay between sensory and value information processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Role of the 5-HT2A Receptor in Self- and Other-Initiated Social Interaction in Lysergic Acid Diethylamide-Induced States: A Pharmacological fMRI Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Distortions of self-experience are critical symptoms of psychiatric disorders and have detrimental effects on social interactions. In light of the immense need for improved and targeted interventions for social impairments, it is important to better understand the neurochemical substrates of social interaction abilities. We therefore investigated the pharmacological and neural correlates of self- and other-initiated social interaction. In a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, crossover study 24 healthy human participants (18 males and 6 females) received either (1) placebo + placebo, (2) placebo + lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD; 100 μg, p.o.), or (3) ketanserin (40 mg, p.o.) + LSD (100 μg, p.o.) on three different occasions. Participants took part in an interactive task using eye-tracking and functional magnetic resonance imaging completing trials of self- and other-initiated joint and non-joint attention. Results demonstrate first, that LSD reduced activity in brain areas important for self-processing, but also social cognition; second, that change in brain activity was linked to subjective experience; and third, that LSD decreased the efficiency of establishing joint attention. Furthermore, LSD-induced effects were blocked by the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R) antagonist ketanserin, indicating that effects of LSD are attributable to 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R stimulation. The current results demonstrate that activity in areas of the &quot;social brain&quot; can be modulated via the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R thereby pointing toward this system as a potential target for the treatment of social impairments associated with psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Distortions of self-representation and, potentially related to this, dysfunctional social cognition are central hallmarks of various psychiatric disorders and critically impact disease development, progression, treatment, as well as real-world functioning. However, these deficits are insufficiently targeted by current treatment approaches. The administration of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging and real-time eye-tracking offers the unique opportunity to study alterations in self-experience, their relation to social cognition, and the underlying neuropharmacology. Results demonstrate that LSD alters self-experience as well as basic social cognition processing in areas of the &quot;social brain&quot;. Furthermore, these alterations are attributable to 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor stimulation, thereby pinpointing toward this receptor system in the development of pharmacotherapies for sociocognitive deficits in psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Role of Rostral Fastigial Neurons in Encoding a Body-Centered Representation of Translation in Three Dimensions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many daily behaviors rely critically on estimates of our body motion. Such estimates must be computed by combining neck proprioceptive signals with vestibular signals that have been transformed from a head- to a body-centered reference frame. Recent studies showed that deep cerebellar neurons in the rostral fastigial nucleus (rFN) reflect these computations, but whether they explicitly encode estimates of body motion remains unclear. A key limitation in addressing this question is that, to date, cell tuning properties have only been characterized for a restricted set of motions across head-re-body orientations in the horizontal plane. Here we examined, for the first time, how 3D spatiotemporal tuning for translational motion varies with head-re-body orientation in both horizontal and vertical planes in the rFN of male macaques. While vestibular coding was profoundly influenced by head-re-body position in both planes, neurons typically reflected at most a partial transformation. However, their tuning shifts were not random but followed the specific spatial trajectories predicted for a 3D transformation. We show that these properties facilitate the linear decoding of fully body-centered motion representations in 3D with a broad range of temporal characteristics from small groups of 5–7 cells. These results demonstrate that the vestibular reference frame transformation required to compute body motion is indeed encoded by cerebellar neurons. We propose that maintaining partially transformed rFN responses with different spatiotemporal properties facilitates the creation of downstream body motion representations with a range of dynamic characteristics, consistent with the functional requirements for tasks such as postural control and reaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Estimates of body motion are essential for many daily activities. Vestibular signals are important contributors to such estimates but must be transformed from a head- to a body-centered reference frame. Here, we provide the first direct demonstration that the cerebellum computes this transformation fully in 3D. We show that the output of these computations is reflected in the tuning properties of deep cerebellar rostral fastigial nucleus neurons in a specific distributed fashion that facilitates the efficient creation of body-centered translation estimates with a broad range of temporal properties (i.e., from acceleration to position). These findings support an important role for the rostral fastigial nucleus as a source of body translation estimates functionally relevant for behaviors ranging from postural control to perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in the &lt;i&gt;cereblon&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;CRBN&lt;/i&gt;) gene cause human intellectual disability, one of the most common cognitive disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms of &lt;i&gt;CRBN&lt;/i&gt;-related intellectual disability remain poorly understood. We investigated the role of &lt;i&gt;CRBN&lt;/i&gt; in synaptic function and animal behavior using male mouse and &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; models. &lt;i&gt;Crbn&lt;/i&gt; knock-out (KO) mice showed normal brain and spine morphology as well as intact synaptic plasticity; however, they also exhibited decreases in synaptic transmission and presynaptic release probability exclusively in excitatory synapses. Presynaptic function was impaired not only by loss of CRBN expression, but also by expression of pathogenic CRBN mutants (human R419X mutant and &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; G552X mutant). We found that the BK channel blockers paxilline and iberiotoxin reversed this decrease in presynaptic release probability in &lt;i&gt;Crbn&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. In addition, paxilline treatment also restored normal cognitive behavior in &lt;i&gt;Crbn&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. These results strongly suggest that increased BK channel activity is the pathological mechanism of intellectual disability in &lt;i&gt;CRBN&lt;/i&gt; mutations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Cereblon&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;CRBN&lt;/i&gt;), a well known target of the immunomodulatory drug thalidomide, was originally identified as a gene that causes human intellectual disability when mutated. However, the molecular mechanisms of CRBN-related intellectual disability remain poorly understood. Based on the idea that synaptic abnormalities are the most common factor in cognitive dysfunction, we monitored the synaptic structure and function of &lt;i&gt;Crbn&lt;/i&gt; knock-out (KO) animals to identify the molecular mechanisms of intellectual disability. Here, we found that &lt;i&gt;Crbn&lt;/i&gt; KO animals showed cognitive deficits caused by enhanced BK channel activity and reduced presynaptic glutamate release. Our findings suggest a physiological pathomechanism of the intellectual disability-related gene &lt;i&gt;CRBN&lt;/i&gt; and will contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies for &lt;i&gt;CRBN&lt;/i&gt;-related intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Integration of Functional Brain Activity from Adolescence to Adulthood</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/14/3559?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Age-related changes in human functional neuroanatomy are poorly understood. This is partly due to the limits of interpretation of standard fMRI. These limits relate to age-related variation in noise levels in data from different subjects, and the common use of standard adult brain parcellations for developmental studies. Here we used an emerging MRI approach called multiecho (ME)-fMRI to characterize functional brain changes with age. ME-fMRI acquires blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals while also quantifying susceptibility-weighted transverse relaxation time (T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*) signal decay. This approach newly enables reliable detection of BOLD signal components at the subject level as opposed to solely at the group-average level. In turn, it supports more robust characterization of the variability in functional brain organization across individuals. We hypothesized that BOLD components in the resting state are not stable with age, and would decrease in number from adolescence to adulthood. This runs counter to the current assumptions in neurodevelopmental analyses of brain connectivity that the number of BOLD signal components is a random effect. From resting-state ME-fMRI of 51 healthy subjects of both sexes, between 8.3 and 46.2 years of age, we found a highly significant (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = –0.55, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 0.001) exponential decrease in the number of BOLD components with age. The number of BOLD components were halved from adolescence to the fifth decade of life, stabilizing in middle adulthood. The regions driving this change were dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, parietal cortex, and cerebellum. The functional network of these regions centered on the cerebellum. We conclude that an age-related decrease in BOLD component number concurs with the hypothesis of neurodevelopmental integration of functional brain activity. We show evidence that the cerebellum may play a key role in this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Human brain development is ongoing from childhood to at least 30 years of age. Functional MRI (fMRI) is key for characterizing changes in brain function that accompany development. However, developmental fMRI studies have relied on reference maps of adult brain organization in the analysis of data from younger subjects. This approach may limit the characterization of functional activity patterns that are particular to children and adolescents. Here we used an emerging fMRI approach called multi-echo fMRI that is not susceptible to such biases when analyzing the variation in functional brain organization over development. We hypothesized an integration of the components of brain activity over development, and found that the number of components decreases exponentially, halving from 8 to 35 years of age. The brain regions most affected underlie executive function and coordination. In summary, we show major changes in the organization and integration of functional networks over development into adulthood, with both methodological and neurobiological implications for future lifespan and disease studies on brain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Coordinated Ramping of Dorsal Striatal Pathways preceding Food Approach and Consumption</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The striatum controls food-related actions and consumption and is linked to feeding disorders, including obesity and anorexia nervosa. Two populations of neurons project from the striatum: direct pathway medium spiny neurons and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons. The selective contribution of direct pathway medium spiny neurons and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons to food-related actions and consumption remains unknown. Here, we used &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiology and fiber photometry in mice (of both sexes) to record both spiking activity and pathway-specific calcium activity of dorsal striatal neurons during approach to and consumption of food pellets. While electrophysiology revealed complex task-related dynamics across neurons, population calcium was enhanced during approach and inhibited during consumption in both pathways. We also observed ramping changes in activity that preceded both pellet-directed actions and spontaneous movements. These signals were heterogeneous in the spiking units, with neurons exhibiting either increasing or decreasing ramps. In contrast, the population calcium signals were homogeneous, with both pathways having increasing ramps of activity for several seconds before actions were initiated. An analysis comparing population firing rates to population calcium signals also revealed stronger ramping dynamics in the calcium signals than in the spiking data. In a second experiment, we trained the mice to perform an action sequence to evaluate when the ramping signals terminated. We found that the ramping signals terminated at the beginning of the action sequence, suggesting they may reflect upcoming actions and not preconsumption activity. Plasticity of such mechanisms may underlie disorders that alter action selection, such as drug addiction or obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Alterations in striatal function have been linked to pathological consumption in disorders, such as obesity and drug addiction. We recorded spiking and population calcium activity from the dorsal striatum during &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; feeding and an operant task that resulted in mice obtaining food pellets. Dorsal striatal neurons exhibited long ramps in activity that preceded actions by several seconds, and may reflect upcoming actions. Understanding how the striatum controls the preparation and generation of actions may lead to improved therapies for disorders, such as drug addiction or obesity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Metacognition is the capacity to evaluate the success of one's own cognitive processes in various domains; for example, memory and perception. It remains controversial whether metacognition relies on a domain-general resource that is applied to different tasks or if self-evaluative processes are domain specific. Here, we investigated this issue directly by examining the neural substrates engaged when metacognitive judgments were made by human participants of both sexes during perceptual and memory tasks matched for stimulus and performance characteristics. By comparing patterns of fMRI activity while subjects evaluated their performance, we revealed both domain-specific and domain-general metacognitive representations. Multivoxel activity patterns in anterior prefrontal cortex predicted levels of confidence in a domain-specific fashion, whereas domain-general signals predicting confidence and accuracy were found in a widespread network in the frontal and posterior midline. The demonstration of domain-specific metacognitive representations suggests the presence of a content-rich mechanism available to introspection and cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We used human neuroimaging to investigate processes supporting memory and perceptual metacognition. It remains controversial whether metacognition relies on a global resource that is applied to different tasks or if self-evaluative processes are specific to particular tasks. Using multivariate decoding methods, we provide evidence that perceptual- and memory-specific metacognitive representations coexist with generic confidence signals. Our findings reconcile previously conflicting results on the domain specificity/generality of metacognition and lay the groundwork for a mechanistic understanding of metacognitive judgments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: TRPM2 Channel Aggravates CNS Inflammation and Cognitive Impairment via Activation of Microglia in Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/14/3520?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion is a characteristic seen in widespread CNS diseases, including neurodegenerative and mental disorders, and is commonly accompanied by cognitive impairment. Recently, several studies demonstrated that chronic cerebral hypoperfusion can induce the excessive inflammatory responses that precede neuronal dysfunction; however, the precise mechanism of cognitive impairment due to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion remains unknown. Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable channel that is abundantly expressed in immune cells and is involved in aggravation of inflammatory responses. Therefore, we investigated the pathophysiological role of TRPM2 in a mouse chronic cerebral hypoperfusion model with bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS). When male mice were subjected to BCAS, cognitive dysfunction and white matter injury at day 28 were significantly improved in TRPM2 knock-out (TRPM2-KO) mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice, whereas hippocampal damage was not observed. There were no differences in blood–brain barrier breakdown and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production between the two genotypes at 14 and 28 d after BCAS. Cytokine production was significantly suppressed in BCAS-operated TRPM2-KO mice compared with WT mice at day 28. In addition, the number of Iba1-positive cells gradually decreased from day 14. Moreover, daily treatment with minocycline significantly improved cognitive perturbation. Surgical techniques using bone marrow chimeric mice revealed that activated Iba1-positive cells in white matter could be brain-resident microglia, not peripheral macrophages. Together, these findings suggest that microglia contribute to the aggravation of cognitive impairment by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, and that TRPM2 may be a potential target for chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion is manifested in a wide variety of CNS diseases, including neurodegenerative and mental disorders that are accompanied by cognitive impairment; however, the underlying mechanisms require clarification. Here, we used a chronic cerebral hypoperfusion mouse model to investigate whether TRPM2, a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable cation channel highly expressed in immune cells, plays a destructive role in the development of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-induced cognitive impairment, and propose a new hypothesis in which TRPM2-mediated activation of microglia, not macrophages, specifically contributes to the pathology through the aggravation of inflammatory responses. These findings shed light on the understanding of the mechanisms of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-related inflammation, and are expected to provide a novel therapeutic molecule for cognitive impairment in CNS diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Choice for Drug or Natural Reward Engages Largely Overlapping Neuronal Ensembles in the Infralimbic Prefrontal Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cue-reward associations form distinct memories that can drive appetitive behaviors and are involved in craving for both drugs and natural rewards. Distinct sets of neurons, so-called neuronal ensembles, in the infralimbic area (IL) of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) play a key role in alcohol seeking. Whether this ensemble is specific for alcohol or controls reward seeking in general remains unclear. Here, we compared IL ensembles formed upon recall of drug (alcohol) or natural reward (saccharin) memories in male Wistar rats. Using an experimental framework that allows identification of two distinct reward-associated ensembles within the same animal, we found that cue-induced seeking of either alcohol or saccharin activated ensembles of similar size and organization, whereby these ensembles consist of largely overlapping neuronal populations. Thus, the IL seems to act as a general integration hub for reward seeking behavior, but also contains subsets of neurons that encode for the different rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cue-reward associations form distinct memories that can act as drivers of appetitive behaviors and are involved in craving for natural rewards as well as for drugs. Distinct sets of neurons, so-called neuronal ensembles, in the infralimbic area of the mPFC play a key role in cue-triggered reward seeking. However, it is unclear whether these ensembles act as broadly tuned controllers of approach behavior or represent the learned associations between specific cues and rewards. Using an experimental framework that allows identification of two distinct reward-associated ensembles within the same animal we find largely overlapping neuronal populations. Repeated activation by two distinct events could reflect the linking of the two memory traces within the same neuron.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Can Serial Dependencies in Choices and Neural Activity Explain Choice Probabilities?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/14/3495?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/14/3495?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;During perceptual decisions the activity of sensory neurons covaries with choice, a covariation often quantified as &quot;choice-probability&quot;. Moreover, choices are influenced by a subject's previous choice (serial dependence) and neuronal activity often shows temporal correlations on long (seconds) timescales. Here, we test whether these findings are linked. Using generalized linear models, we analyze simultaneous measurements of behavior and V2 neural activity in macaques performing a visual discrimination task. Both, decisions and spiking activity show substantial temporal correlations and cross-correlations but seem to reflect two mostly separate processes. Indeed, removing history effects using semipartial correlation analysis leaves choice probabilities largely unchanged. The serial dependencies in choices and neural activity therefore cannot explain the observed choice probability. Rather, serial dependencies in choices and spiking activity reflect two predominantly separate but parallel processes, which are coupled on each trial by covariations between choices and activity. These findings provide important constraints for computational models of perceptual decision-making that include feedback signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Correlations, unexplained by the sensory input, between the activity of sensory neurons and an animal's perceptual choice (&quot;choice probabilities&quot;) have received attention from both a systems and computational neuroscience perspective. Conversely, whereas temporal correlations for both spiking activity (&quot;non-stationarities&quot;) and for a subject's choices in perceptual tasks (&quot;serial dependencies&quot;) have long been established, they have typically been ignored when measuring choice probabilities. Some accounts of choice probabilities incorporating feedback predict that these observations are linked. Here, we explore the extent to which this is the case. We find that, contrasting with these predictions, choice probabilities are largely independent of serial dependencies, which adds new constraints to accounts of choice probabilities that include feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: {beta}-Secretase BACE1 Promotes Surface Expression and Function of Kv3.4 at Hippocampal Mossy Fiber Synapses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/14/3480?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/14/3480?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The β-secretase β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is deemed a major culprit in Alzheimer's disease, but accumulating evidence indicates that there is more to the enzyme than driving the amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein. For example, BACE1 has emerged as an important regulator of neuronal activity through proteolytic and, most unexpectedly, also through nonproteolytic interactions with several ion channels. Here, we identify and characterize the voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel 3.4 (Kv3.4) as a new and functionally relevant interaction partner of BACE1. Kv3.4 gives rise to A-type current with fast activating and inactivating kinetics and serves to repolarize the presynaptic action potential. We found that BACE1 and Kv3.4 are highly enriched and remarkably colocalized in hippocampal mossy fibers (MFs). In BACE1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice of either sex, Kv3.4 surface expression was significantly reduced in the hippocampus and, in synaptic fractions thereof, Kv3.4 was specifically diminished, whereas protein levels of other presynaptic K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels such as K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 and K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2.3 remained unchanged. The apparent loss of presynaptic Kv3.4 affected the strength of excitatory transmission at the MF–CA3 synapse in hippocampal slices of BACE1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice when probed with the Kv3 channel blocker BDS-I. The effect of BACE1 on Kv3.4 expression and function should be bidirectional, as predicted from a heterologous expression system, in which BACE1 cotransfection produced a concomitant upregulation of Kv3.4 surface level and current based on a physical interaction between the two proteins. Our data show that, by targeting Kv3.4 to presynaptic sites, BACE1 endows the terminal with a powerful means to regulate the strength of transmitter release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The β-secretase β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is infamous for its crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, but its physiological functions in the intact nervous system are only gradually being unveiled. Here, we extend previous work implicating BACE1 in the expression and function of voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. Specifically, we characterize voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel 3.4 (Kv3.4), a presynaptic K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel required for action potential repolarization, as a novel interaction partner of BACE1 at the mossy fiber (MF)–CA3 synapse of the hippocampus. BACE1 promotes surface expression of Kv3.4 at MF terminals, most likely by physically associating with the channel protein in a nonenzymatic fashion. We advance the BACE1–Kv3.4 interaction as a mechanism to strengthen the temporal control over transmitter release from MF terminals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Glutathione Conjugation at the Blood-CSF Barrier Efficiently Prevents Exposure of the Developing Brain Fluid Environment to Blood-Borne Reactive Electrophilic Substances</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Exposure of the developing brain to toxins, drugs, or deleterious endogenous compounds during the perinatal period can trigger alterations in cell division, migration, differentiation, and synaptogenesis, leading to lifelong neurological impairment. The brain is protected by cellular barriers acting through multiple mechanisms, some of which are still poorly explored. We used a combination of enzymatic assays, live tissue fluorescence microscopy, and an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cellular model of the blood–CSF barrier to investigate an enzymatic detoxification pathway in the developing male and female rat brain. We show that during the early postnatal period the choroid plexus epithelium forming the blood–CSF barrier and the ependymal cell layer bordering the ventricles harbor a high detoxifying capacity that involves glutathione &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-transferases. Using a functional knock-down rat model for choroidal glutathione conjugation, we demonstrate that already in neonates, this metabolic pathway efficiently prevents the penetration of blood-borne reactive compounds into CSF. The versatility of the protective mechanism results from the multiplicity of the glutathione &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-transferase isoenzymes, which are differently expressed between the choroidal epithelium and the ependyma. The various isoenzymes display differential substrate specificities, which greatly widen the spectrum of molecules that can be inactivated by this pathway. In conclusion, the blood–CSF barrier and the ependyma are identified as key cellular structures in the CNS to protect the brain fluid environment from different chemical classes of potentially toxic compounds during the postnatal period. This metabolic neuroprotective function of brain interfaces ought to compensate for the liver postnatal immaturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Brain homeostasis requires a stable and controlled internal environment. Defective brain protection during the perinatal period can lead to lifelong neurological impairment. We demonstrate that the choroid plexus forming the blood–CSF barrier is a key player in the protection of the developing brain. Glutathione-dependent enzymatic metabolism in the choroidal epithelium inactivates a broad spectrum of noxious compounds, efficiently preventing their penetration into the CSF. A second line of detoxification is located in the ependyma separating the CSF from brain tissue. Our study reveals a novel facet of the mechanisms by which the brain is protected at a period of high vulnerability, at a time when the astrocytic network is still immature and liver xenobiotic metabolism is limited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Development of the Mechanisms Governing Midbrain Multisensory Integration</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to integrate information across multiple senses enhances the brain's ability to detect, localize, and identify external events. This process has been well documented in single neurons in the superior colliculus (SC), which synthesize concordant combinations of visual, auditory, and/or somatosensory signals to enhance the vigor of their responses. This increases the physiological salience of crossmodal events and, in turn, the speed and accuracy of SC-mediated behavioral responses to them. However, this capability is not an innate feature of the circuit and only develops postnatally after the animal acquires sufficient experience with covariant crossmodal events to form links between their modality-specific components. Of critical importance in this process are tectopetal influences from association cortex. Recent findings suggest that, despite its intuitive appeal, a simple generic associative rule cannot explain how this circuit develops its ability to integrate those crossmodal inputs to produce enhanced multisensory responses. The present neurocomputational model explains how this development can be understood as a transition from a default state in which crossmodal SC inputs interact competitively to one in which they interact cooperatively. Crucial to this transition is the operation of a learning rule requiring coactivation among tectopetal afferents for engagement. The model successfully replicates findings of multisensory development in normal cats and cats of either sex reared with special experience. In doing so, it explains how the cortico–SC projections can use crossmodal experience to craft the multisensory integration capabilities of the SC and adapt them to the environment in which they will be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The brain's remarkable ability to integrate information across the senses is not present at birth, but typically develops in early life as experience with crossmodal cues is acquired. Recent empirical findings suggest that the mechanisms supporting this development must be more complex than previously believed. The present work integrates these data with what is already known about the underlying circuit in the midbrain to create and test a mechanistic model of multisensory development. This model represents a novel and comprehensive framework that explains how midbrain circuits acquire multisensory experience and reveals how disruptions in this neurotypic developmental trajectory yield divergent outcomes that will affect the multisensory processing capabilities of the mature brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Attention Selectively Gates Afferent Signal Transmission to Area V4</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/14/3441?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/14/3441?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Selective attention allows focusing on only part of the incoming sensory information. Neurons in the extrastriate visual cortex reflect such selective processing when different stimuli are simultaneously present in their large receptive fields. Their spiking response then resembles the response to the attended stimulus when presented in isolation. Unclear is where in the neuronal pathway attention intervenes to achieve such selective signal routing and processing. To investigate this question, we tagged two equivalent visual stimuli by independent broadband luminance noise and used the spectral coherence of these behaviorally irrelevant signals with the field potential of a local neuronal population in male macaque monkeys' area V4 as a measure for their respective causal influences. This new experimental paradigm revealed that signal transmission was considerably weaker for the not-attended stimulus. Furthermore, our results show that attention does not need to modulate responses in the input populations sending signals to V4 to selectively represent a stimulus, nor do they suggest a change of the V4 neurons' output gain depending on their feature similarity with the stimuli. Our results rather imply that selective attention uses a gating mechanism comprising the synaptic &quot;inputs&quot; that transmit signals from upstream areas into the V4 neurons. A minimal model implementing attention-dependent routing by gamma-band synchrony replicated the attentional gating effect and the signals' spectral transfer characteristics. It supports the proposal that selective interareal gamma-band synchrony subserves signal routing and explains our experimental finding that attention selectively gates signals already at the level of afferent synaptic input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Depending on the behavioral context, the brain needs to channel the flow of information through its networks of massively interconnected neurons. We designed an experiment that allows to causally assess routing of information originating from an attended object. We found that attention &quot;gates&quot; signals at the interplay between afferent fibers and the local neurons. A minimal model demonstrated that coherent gamma-rhythmic activity (~60 Hz) between local neurons and their afferent-providing input neurons can realize the gating. Importantly, the attended signals did not need to be amplified already in an earlier processing stage, nor did they get amplified by a simple output response modulation. The method provides a useful tool to study mechanisms of dynamic network configuration underlying cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Sync/deSync Model: How a Synchronized Hippocampus and a Desynchronized Neocortex Code Memories</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/14/3428?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural oscillations are important for memory formation in the brain. The desynchronization of alpha (10 Hz) oscillations in the neocortex has been shown to predict successful memory encoding and retrieval. However, when engaging in learning, it has been found that the hippocampus synchronizes in theta (4 Hz) oscillations, and that learning is dependent on the phase of theta. This inconsistency as to whether synchronization is &quot;good&quot; for memory formation leads to confusion over which oscillations we should expect to see and where during learning paradigm experiments. This paper seeks to respond to this inconsistency by presenting a neural network model of how a well functioning learning system could exhibit both of these phenomena, i.e., desynchronization of alpha and synchronization of theta during successful memory encoding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a spiking neural network (the Sync/deSync model) of the neocortical and hippocampal system. The simulated hippocampus learns through an adapted spike-time dependent plasticity rule, in which weight change is modulated by the phase of an extrinsically generated theta oscillation. Additionally, a global passive weight decay is incorporated, which is also modulated by theta phase. In this way, the Sync/deSync model exhibits theta phase-dependent long-term potentiation and long-term depression. We simulated a learning paradigm experiment and compared the oscillatory dynamics of our model with those observed in single-cell and scalp-EEG studies of the medial temporal lobe. Our Sync/deSync model suggests that both the desynchronization of neocortical alpha and the synchronization of hippocampal theta are necessary for successful memory encoding and retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A fundamental question is the role of rhythmic activation of neurons, i.e., how and why their firing oscillates between high and low rates. A particularly important question is how oscillatory dynamics between the neocortex and hippocampus support memory formation. We present a spiking neural-network model of such memory formation, with the central ideas that (1) in neocortex, neurons need to break out of an alpha oscillation to represent a stimulus (i.e., alpha desynchronizes), whereas (2) in hippocampus, the firing of neurons at theta facilitates formation of memories (i.e., theta synchronizes). Accordingly, successful memory formation is marked by reduced neocortical alpha and increased hippocampal theta. This pattern has been observed experimentally and gives our model its name—the Sync/deSync model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Silent voltage-gated potassium channel subunits (K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;S) interact selectively with members of the K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2 channel family to modify their functional properties. The localization and functional roles of these silent subunits remain poorly understood. Mutations in the K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;S subunit, K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;8.2 (&lt;i&gt;KCNV2&lt;/i&gt;), lead to severe visual impairment in humans, but the basis of these deficits remains unclear. Here, we examined the localization, native interactions, and functional properties of K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;8.2-containing channels in mouse, macaque, and human photoreceptors of either sex. In human retina, K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;8.2 colocalized with K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 and K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.2 in cone inner segments and with K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 in rod inner segments. K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 and K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.2 could be coimmunoprecipitated with K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;8.2 in retinal lysates indicating that these subunits likely interact directly. Retinal K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 was less phosphorylated than cortical K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1, a difference expected to alter the biophysical properties of these channels. Using voltage-clamp recordings and pharmacology, we provide functional evidence for Kv2-containing channels in primate rods and cones. We propose that the presence of K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;8.2, and low levels of K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 phosphorylation shift the activation range of K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2 channels to align with the operating range of rod and cone photoreceptors. Our data indicate a role for K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2/K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;8.2 channels in human photoreceptor function and suggest that the visual deficits in patients with &lt;i&gt;KCNV2&lt;/i&gt; mutations arise from inadequate resting activation of K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channels in rod and cone inner segments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Mutations in a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit, K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;8.2, underlie a blinding inherited photoreceptor dystrophy, indicating an important role for these channels in human vision. Here, we have defined the localization and subunit interactions of K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;8.2 channels in primate photoreceptors. We show that the K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;8.2 subunit interacts with different Kv2 channels in rods and cones, giving rise to potassium currents with distinct functional properties. Our results provide a molecular basis for retinal dysfunction in patients with mutations in the &lt;i&gt;KCNV2&lt;/i&gt; gene encoding K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;8.2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Swedish Nerve Growth Factor Mutation (NGFR100W) Defines a Role for TrkA and p75NTR in Nociception</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/14/3394?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nerve growth factor (NGF) exerts multiple functions on target neurons throughout development. The recent discovery of a point mutation leading to a change from arginine to tryptophan at residue 100 in the mature NGFβ sequence (NGF&lt;sup&gt;R100W&lt;/sup&gt;) in patients with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type V (HSAN V) made it possible to distinguish the signaling mechanisms that lead to two functionally different outcomes of NGF: trophic versus nociceptive. We performed extensive biochemical, cellular, and live-imaging experiments to examine the binding and signaling properties of NGF&lt;sup&gt;R100W&lt;/sup&gt;. Our results show that, similar to the wild-type NGF (wtNGF), the naturally occurring NGF&lt;sup&gt;R100W&lt;/sup&gt; mutant was capable of binding to and activating the TrkA receptor and its downstream signaling pathways to support neuronal survival and differentiation. However, NGF&lt;sup&gt;R100W&lt;/sup&gt; failed to bind and stimulate the 75 kDa neurotrophic factor receptor (p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt;)-mediated signaling cascades (i.e., the RhoA-Cofilin pathway). Intraplantar injection of NGF&lt;sup&gt;R100W&lt;/sup&gt; into adult rats induced neither TrkA-mediated thermal nor mechanical acute hyperalgesia, but retained the ability to induce chronic hyperalgesia based on agonism for TrkA signaling. Together, our studies provide evidence that NGF&lt;sup&gt;R100W&lt;/sup&gt; retains trophic support capability through TrkA and one aspect of its nociceptive signaling, but fails to engage p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; signaling pathways. Our findings suggest that wtNGF acts via TrkA to regulate the delayed priming of nociceptive responses. The integration of both TrkA and p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; signaling thus appears to regulate neuroplastic effects of NGF in peripheral nociception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In the present study, we characterized the naturally occurring nerve growth factor NGF&lt;sup&gt;R100W&lt;/sup&gt; mutant that is associated with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type V. We have demonstrated for the first time that NGF&lt;sup&gt;R100W&lt;/sup&gt; retains trophic support capability through TrkA, but fails to engage p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; signaling pathways. Furthermore, after intraplantar injection into adult rats, NGF&lt;sup&gt;R100W&lt;/sup&gt; induced neither thermal nor mechanical acute hyperalgesia, but retained the ability to induce chronic hyperalgesia. We have also provided evidence that the integration of both TrkA- and p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated signaling appears to regulate neuroplastic effects of NGF in peripheral nociception. Our study with NGF&lt;sup&gt;R100W&lt;/sup&gt; suggests that it is possible to uncouple trophic effect from nociceptive function, both induced by wild-type NGF.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Excreted Steroids in Vertebrate Social Communication</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/14/3377?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/14/3377?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Steroids play vital roles in animal physiology across species, and the production of specific steroids is associated with particular internal biological functions. The internal functions of steroids are, in most cases, quite clear. However, an important feature of many steroids (their chemical stability) allows these molecules to play secondary, external roles as chemical messengers after their excretion via urine, feces, or other shed substances. The presence of steroids in animal excretions has long been appreciated, but their capacity to serve as chemosignals has not received as much attention. In theory, the blend of steroids excreted by an animal contains a readout of its own biological state. Initial mechanistic evidence for external steroid chemosensation arose from studies of many species of fish. In sea lampreys and ray-finned fishes, bile salts were identified as potent olfactory cues and later found to serve as pheromones. Recently, we and others have discovered that neurons in amphibian and mammalian olfactory systems are also highly sensitive to excreted glucocorticoids, sex steroids, and bile acids, and some of these molecules have been confirmed as mammalian pheromones. Steroid chemosensation in olfactory systems, unlike steroid detection in most tissues, is performed by plasma membrane receptors, but the details remain largely unclear. In this review, we present a broad view of steroid detection by vertebrate olfactory systems, focusing on recent research in fishes, amphibians, and mammals. We review confirmed and hypothesized mechanisms of steroid chemosensation in each group and discuss potential impacts on vertebrate social communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Eye movements hold information about human perception, intention and
cognitive state. Various algorithms have been proposed to identify and
distinguish eye movements, particularly fixations, saccades, and smooth
pursuits. A major drawback of existing algorithms is that they rely on accurate
and constant sampling rates, impeding straightforward adaptation to new
movements such as micro saccades. We propose a novel eye movement simulator
that i) probabilistically simulates saccade movements as gamma distributions
considering different peak velocities and ii) models smooth pursuit onsets with
the sigmoid function. This simulator is combined with a machine learning
approach to create detectors for general and specific velocity profiles.
Additionally, our approach is capable of using any sampling rate, even with
fluctuations. The machine learning approach consists of different binary
patterns combined using conditional distributions. The simulation is evaluated
against publicly available real data using a squared error, and the detectors
are evaluated against state-of-the-art algorithms.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fixed points of competitive threshold-linear networks. (arXiv:1804.00794v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00794</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00794</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Threshold-linear networks (TLNs) are models of neural networks that consist
of simple, perceptron-like neurons and exhibit nonlinear dynamics that are
determined by the network's connectivity. The set of fixed points of a TLN,
including both stable and unstable equilibria, plays a critical role in shaping
its emergent dynamics. In this work, we provide two novel characterizations for
the set of fixed points of competitive TLNs: the first is in terms of a simple
sign condition corresponding to each fixed point support; while the second
introduces the concept of domination. We then apply these results to a special
family of TLNs, called combinatorial threshold-linear networks (CTLNs), whose
connectivity matrix is defined from just two continuous parameters and a
directed graph. This leads us to a set of graph rules that enable us to
determine fixed points for a CTLN that are independent of the parameters, and
can be inferred directly from the underlying graph. Our results thus provide
the foundation for a kind of &quot;graphical calculus&quot; to infer features of the
dynamics from a network's connectivity.

	<description>Hu et al. demonstrate that action potentials in parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic interneuron axons are energetically efficient, which is highly unexpected given their brief duration. High energy efficiency emerges from the combination of fast inactivation of voltage-gated Na+ channels and delayed activation of Kv3 channels in the axon.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: From head to tail: A neuromechanical model of forward locomotion in C. elegans</title>

	<description>With 302 neurons and a near complete reconstruction of the neural and muscle anatomy at the cellular level, C. elegans is an ideal candidate organism to study the neuromechanical basis of behavior. Yet, despite the breadth of knowledge about the neurobiology, anatomy and physics of C. elegans, there are still a number of unanswered questions about one of its most basic and fundamental behaviors: forward locomotion. How the rhythmic pattern is generated and propagated along the body is not yet well understood. We report on the development and analysis of a model of forward locomotion that integrates the neuroanatomy, neurophysiology and body mechanics of the worm. Our model is motivated by recent experimental analysis of the structure of the ventral cord circuitry and the effect of local body curvature on nearby motorneurons, as well as by the lack of consideration of the role of the head motorneurons in current models of locomotion. We developed a neuroanatomically-grounded model of the head and ventral nerve cord subcircuits, using a neural model capable of reproducing the full range of electrophysiology observed in C. elegans neurons. We integrated the neural model with an existing biomechanical model of the worm's body, with updated musculature and stretch receptors. Unknown parameters were evolved using a evolutionary algorithm to match the speed of the worm on agar. We performed 100 evolutionary runs and consistently found electrophysiological configurations that reproduced realistic control of forward movement. The ensemble of successful solutions reproduced key experimental observations that they were not designed to fit, including the wavelength and frequency of the propagating wave. Analysis of the ensemble revealed that SMD and RMD are sufficient to drive dorsoventral undulations in the head and neck and that short-range posteriorly-directed proprioceptive feedback is sufficient to propagate the wave along the rest of the body.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Functional repair after ischemic injury through high efficiency in situ astrocyte-to-neuron conversion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294967v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294967v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Mammalian brains have largely lost internal neural regeneration capability except for a few discrete neurogenic niches. After brain injury, the cerebral cortex is especially difficult to repair due to its extremely low rate of adult neurogenesis. Previous studies have converted glial cells into neurons, but the total number of neurons generated is rather limited, casting doubt about its therapeutic potential. Here, we demonstrate that high-efficiency neuroregeneration can be achieved in adult mammalian brains by making use of an engineered AAV Cre-FLEX system to convert a large number of reactive astrocytes into functional neurons. Specifically, using a combination of GFAP::Cre and FLEX-NeuroD1 AAV system, we were able to regenerate enough new neurons from astrocytes to cover about 40% of the neurons lost from an ischemic injury (400 NeuN+ new neurons/mm2), compared to previously reported an average of &amp;lt;1% of cortical neurons (2-8 NeuN+ neurons/mm2) in an ischemic-injured adult mammalian cortex. Importantly, this in situ astrocyte-to-neuron conversion process also improved survival of injured pre-existing neurons, (additional 400 neurons/mm2), leading to a repaired motor cortex with layered cortical structures. Moreover, NeuroD1-converted neurons not only form functional neural circuits but also rescue motor and memory deficits after ischemic injury. Our results establish the proof-of-principle that a highly efficient in situ astrocyte-to-neuron conversion approach provides a novel treatment for neurological disorders that are in need of new neurons.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Functional selectivity and specific connectivity of inhibitory neurons in primary visual cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294835v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294835v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In the cerebral cortex, the interaction of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs shapes the responses of neurons to sensory stimuli, stabilizes network dynamics, and improves the efficiency and robustness of the neural code. Excitatory neurons receive inhibitory inputs that track excitation. However, how this co-tuning of excitation and inhibition is achieved by cortical circuits is unclear, since inhibitory interneurons are thought to pool the inputs of nearby excitatory cells and provide them with non-specific inhibition proportional to the activity of the local network. Here we show that although parvalbumin-expressing (PV) inhibitory cells in mouse primary visual cortex make connections with the majority of nearby pyramidal cells, the strength of their synaptic connections is structured according to the similarity of the cells' responses. Individual PV cells strongly inhibit those pyramidal cells that provide them with strong excitation and share their visual selectivity. This fine-tuning of synaptic weights supports co-tuning of inhibitory and excitatory inputs onto individual pyramidal cells despite dense connectivity between inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Our results indicate that individual PV cells are preferentially integrated into subnetworks of inter-connected, co-tuned pyramidal cells, stabilising their recurrent dynamics. Conversely, weak but dense inhibitory connectivity between subnetworks is sufficient to support competition between them, de-correlating their output. We suggest that the history and structure of correlated firing adjusts the weights of both inhibitory and excitatory connections, supporting stable amplification and selective recruitment of cortical subnetworks.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Robo1 and 2 repellent receptors cooperate to guide facial neuron cell migration and axon projections in the embryonic mouse hindbrain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294702v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294702v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: The facial nerve is necessary for our ability to eat, speak, and make facial expressions. Both the axons and cell bodies of the facial nerve undergo a complex embryonic migration pattern involving migration of the cell bodies caudally and tangentially through rhombomeres, and simultaneously the axons projecting to exit the hindbrain to form the facial nerve. Results: Our goal in this study was to test the functions of the chemorepulsive receptors Robo1 and Robo2 in facial neuron and axon migration by analyzing genetically marked motor neurons in double mutant mouse embryos through the migration time course, E10.0-E13.5. In Robo1/2 double mutants, axon and cell body migration errors were more severe than in single mutants. Most axons did not make it to their motor exit point, and instead projected into and longitudinally within the floor plate. Surprisingly, some facial neurons had bifurcated axons that either exited or projected into the floor plate. At the same time, a subset of mutant facial cell bodies failed to migrate caudally, and instead shifted into the floor plate. Conclusions: Robo1 and Robo2 have redundant functions to guide multiple aspects of the complex cell migration of the facial nucleus, as well as regulating axon trajectories and suppressing formation of ectopic axons.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294132v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Animals rely on olfaction to find food, attract mates and avoid predators. To support these behaviors, animals must reliably identify odors across different odorant concentrations. The neural circuit operations that implement this concentration invariance remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that, despite concentration-dependence in olfactory bulb (OB), representations of odor identity are preserved downstream, in piriform cortex (PCx). The OB cells responding earliest after inhalation drive robust responses in a sparse subset of PCx neurons. Recurrent collateral connections broadcast their activation across PCx, recruiting strong, global feedback inhibition that rapidly suppresses cortical activity for the remainder of the sniff, thereby discounting the impact of slower, concentration-dependent OB inputs. Eliminating recurrent collateral output dramatically amplifies PCx odor responses, renders cortex steeply concentration-dependent, and abolishes concentration-invariant identity decoding.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Pre-saccadic remapping relies on dynamics of spatial attention</title>

	<description>Each eye movement shifts the projections of the visual scene on the retina. It has been proposed that the receptive fields of neurons in oculomotor areas are remapped pre-saccadically to account for these shifts. While remapping of the whole visual scene seems prohibitively complex, selection by visual attention may limit these processes to a subset of attended locations. Because attentional selection consumes time, remapping of attended locations should evolve in time, too. In our study, we cued a spatial location by presenting an attention capturing cue at different times before a saccade and constructed detailed maps of attentional allocation across the visual field. We observed no remapping when the cue appeared shortly before saccade. In contrast, when the cue appeared sufficiently early before saccade, attentional resources were reallocated to the remapped location. Our results suggest that pre-saccadic remapping is an attentional process relying on the spatial and temporal dynamics of visual attention.</description>

	<description>Circadian (~24 h) rhythms influence nearly all aspects of physiology, including sleep/wake, metabolism, and hormone release. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) synchronizes these daily rhythms to the external light cycle, but the mechanisms by which this occurs is unclear. The neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is the predominant contributor to synchrony within the SCN and is important for circadian light responses, but the role of VIP neurons themselves is unclear. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that rhythmic SCN VIP neurons mediate circadian light responses. Using in vivo fiber photometry recording of SCN VIP neurons we found daily rhythms in spontaneous calcium events that peaked during the subjective day and in light-evoked calcium events that exhibited the greatest response around subjective dusk. These rhythms were correlated with spontaneous and NMDA-evoked VIP release from SCN VIP neurons in vitro. Finally, in vivo hyperpolarization of VIP neurons attenuated light-induced shifts of daily rhythms in locomotion. We conclude that SCN VIP neurons are circadian and depolarize to light to modulate entrainment of daily rhythms in the SCN and behavior.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Effect of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; on the promiscuous target-protein binding of calmodulin</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006072</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Annie M. Westerlund, Lucie Delemotte&lt;/p&gt;

Calmodulin (CaM) is a calcium sensing protein that regulates the function of a large number of proteins, thus playing a crucial part in many cell signaling pathways. CaM has the ability to bind more than 300 different target peptides in a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent manner, mainly through the exposure of hydrophobic residues. How CaM can bind a large number of targets while retaining some selectivity is a fascinating open question. Here, we explore the mechanism of CaM selective promiscuity for selected target proteins. Analyzing enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-bound and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free CaM via spectral clustering has allowed us to identify distinct conformational states, characterized by interhelical angles, secondary structure determinants and the solvent exposure of specific residues. We searched for indicators of conformational selection by mapping solvent exposure of residues in these conformational states to contacts in structures of CaM/target peptide complexes. We thereby identified CaM states involved in various binding classes arranged along a depth binding gradient. Binding Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; modifies the accessible hydrophobic surface of the two lobes and allows for deeper binding. Apo CaM indeed shows shallow binding involving predominantly polar and charged residues. Furthermore, binding to the C-terminal lobe of CaM appears selective and involves specific conformational states that can facilitate deep binding to target proteins, while binding to the N-terminal lobe appears to happen through a more flexible mechanism. Thus the long-ranged electrostatic interactions of the charged residues of the N-terminal lobe of CaM may initiate binding, while the short-ranged interactions of hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal lobe of CaM may account for selectivity. This work furthers our understanding of the mechanism of CaM binding and selectivity to different target proteins and paves the way towards a comprehensive model of CaM selectivity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nnr4XNya7Zs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Spatial regularity control of phyllotaxis pattern generated by the mutual interaction between auxin and PIN1</title>

Phyllotaxis, the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem, is well known because of its beautiful geometric configuration, which is derived from the constant spacing between leaf primordia. This phyllotaxis is established by mutual interaction between a diffusible plant hormone auxin and its efflux carrier PIN1, which cooperatively generate a regular pattern of auxin maxima, small regions with high auxin concentrations, leading to leaf primordia. However, the molecular mechanism of the regular pattern of auxin maxima is still largely unknown. To better understand how the phyllotaxis pattern is controlled, we investigated mathematical models based on the auxin–PIN1 interaction through linear stability analysis and numerical simulations, focusing on the spatial regularity control of auxin maxima. As in previous reports, we first confirmed that this spatial regularity can be reproduced by a highly simplified and abstract model. However, this model lacks the extracellular region and is not appropriate for considering the molecular mechanism. Thus, we investigated how auxin maxima patterns are affected under more realistic conditions. We found that the spatial regularity is eliminated by introducing the extracellular region, even in the presence of direct diffusion between cells or between extracellular spaces, and this strongly suggests the existence of an unknown molecular mechanism. To unravel this mechanism, we assumed a diffusible molecule to verify various feedback interactions with auxin–PIN1 dynamics. We revealed that regular patterns can be restored by a diffusible molecule that mediates the signaling from auxin to PIN1 polarization. Furthermore, as in the one-dimensional case, similar results are observed in the two-dimensional space. These results provide a great insight into the theoretical and molecular basis for understanding the phyllotaxis pattern. Our theoretical analysis strongly predicts a diffusible molecule that is pivotal for the phyllotaxis pattern but is yet to be determined experimentally.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1PcJThDi81k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Recent studies have demonstrated how the competition for the finite pool of available gene expression factors has important effect on fundamental gene expression aspects. In this study, based on a whole-cell model simulation of translation in &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, we evaluate for the first time the expected effect of mRNA levels fluctuations on translation due to the finite pool of ribosomes. We show that fluctuations of a single gene or a group of genes mRNA levels induce periodic behavior in all &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; translation factors and aspects: the ribosomal densities and the translation rates of all &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; mRNAs oscillate. We numerically measure the oscillation amplitudes demonstrating that fluctuations of endogenous and heterologous genes can cause a significant fluctuation of up to 50% in the steady-state translation rates of the rest of the genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate by synonymous mutations that oscillating the levels of mRNAs that experience high ribosomal occupancy (e.g. ribosomal “traffic jam”) induces the largest impact on the translation of the &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; genome.
The results reported here should provide novel insights and principles related to the design of synthetic gene expression circuits and related to the evolutionary constraints shaping gene expression of endogenous genes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EeyF-2L0x-k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Decision formation recruits many brain regions, but the procedure they jointly execute is unknown. Here we characterize its essential composition, using as a framework a novel recursive Bayesian algorithm that makes decisions based on spike-trains with the statistics of those in sensory cortex (MT). Using it to simulate the random-dot-motion task, we demonstrate it quantitatively replicates the choice behaviour of monkeys, whilst predicting losses of otherwise usable information from MT. Its architecture maps to the recurrent cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops, whose components are all implicated in decision-making. We show that the dynamics of its mapped computations match those of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum during decisions, and forecast those of basal ganglia output and thalamus. This also predicts which aspects of neural dynamics are and are not part of inference. Our single-equation algorithm is probabilistic, distributed, recursive, and parallel. Its success at capturing anatomy, behaviour, and electrophysiology suggests that the mechanism implemented by the brain has these same characteristics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/47MpyGKP0b0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Frontal Eye Field Inactivation Reduces Saccade Preparation in the Superior Colliculus, but Does Not Alter How Preparatory Activity Relates to Saccades of a Given Latency</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A neural correlate for saccadic reaction times (SRTs) in the gap saccade task is the level of low-frequency activity in the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (iSC) just before visual target onset: greater levels of such &lt;i&gt;preparatory&lt;/i&gt; iSC low-frequency activity precede shorter SRTs. The frontal eye fields (FEF) are one likely source of iSC preparatory activity, since FEF preparatory activity is also inversely related to SRT. To better understand the FEF’s role in saccade preparation, and the way in which such preparation relates to SRT, in two male rhesus monkeys we compared iSC preparatory activity across unilateral reversible cryogenic inactivation of the FEF. FEF inactivation increased contralesional SRTs, and lowered ipsilesional iSC preparatory activity. FEF inactivation also reduced rostral iSC activity during the gap period. Importantly, the distributions of SRTs generated with or without FEF inactivation overlapped, enabling us to conduct a novel population-level analyses examining iSC preparatory activity just before generation of SRT-matched saccades. When matched for SRTs, we observed no change during FEF inactivation in the relationship between iSC preparatory activity and SRT-matched saccades across a range of SRTs, even for the occasional express saccade. Thus, while our results emphasize that the FEF has an overall excitatory influence on preparatory activity in the iSC, the communication between the iSC and downstream oculomotor brainstem is unaltered for SRT-matched saccades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; How does the brain decide when to move? Here, we investigate the role of two oculomotor structures, the superior colliculus (SC) and frontal eye fields (FEF), in dictating visually-guided saccadic reaction times (SRTs). In both structures, higher levels of pretarget preparatory activity precede shorter SRTs. Here, we show that FEF inactivation increases SRTs and decreases SC preparatory activity. Surprisingly, providing one examines SRT-matched saccades, a population-level analysis of SC preparatory activity showed a negligible impact of FEF inactivation. Thus, while the FEF is one important source of preparatory input to the SC, it does not alter the dynamics of how iSC preparatory activity relates to a given SRT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Combining STDP and Reward-Modulated STDP in Deep Convolutional Spiking Neural Networks for Digit Recognition. (arXiv:1804.00227v1 [cs.CV])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The primate visual system has inspired the development of deep artificial
neural networks, which have revolutionized the computer vision domain. Yet
these networks are much less energy-efficient than their biological
counterparts, and they are typically trained with backpropagation, which is
extremely data-hungry. To address these limitations, we used a deep
convolutional spiking neural network (DCSNN) and a latency-coding scheme. We
trained it using a combination of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) for
the lowest layers and reward-modulated STDP (R-STDP) for the highest ones. In
short, with R-STDP a correct (resp. incorrect) decision leads to STDP (resp.
anti-STDP). This approach led to an accuracy of 97.2% on MNIST, without
requiring an external classifier. In addition, we demonstrated that R-STDP
extracts features that are diagnostic for the task at hand, and discards the
other ones, whereas STDP extracts any feature that repeats. Finally, our
approach is biologically plausible, hardware friendly, and energy-efficient.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Spontaneous activity emerging from an inferred network model captures complex temporal dynamics of spiking data. (arXiv:1804.00153v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The combination of new recording techniques in neuroscience and powerful
inference methods recently held the promise to recover useful effective models,
at the single neuron or network level, directly from observed data. The value
of a model of course should critically depend on its ability to reproduce the
dynamical behavior of the modeled system; however, few attempts have been made
to inquire into the dynamics of inferred models in neuroscience, and none, to
our knowledge, at the network level. Here we introduce a principled
modification of a widely used generalized linear model (GLM), and learn its
structural and dynamic parameters from ex-vivo spiking data. We show that the
new model is able to capture the most prominent features of the highly
non-stationary and non-linear dynamics displayed by the biological network,
where the reference GLM largely fails. Two ingredients turn out to be key for
success. The first one is a bounded transfer function that makes the single
neuron able to respond to its input in a saturating fashion; beyond its
biological plausibility such property, by limiting the capacity of the neuron
to transfer information, makes the coding more robust in the face of the highly
variable network activity, and noise. The second ingredient is a super-Poisson
spikes generative probabilistic mechanism; this feature, that accounts for the
fact that observations largely undersample the network, allows the model neuron
to more flexibly incorporate the observed activity fluctuations. Taken
together, the two ingredients, without increasing complexity, allow the model
to capture the key dynamic elements. When left free to generate its spontaneous
activity, the inferred model proved able to reproduce not only the
non-stationary population dynamics of the network, but also part of the
fine-grained structure of the dynamics at the single neuron level.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Assessing inter-modal and inter-regional dependencies in prodromal Alzheimer's disease using multimodal MRI/PET and Gaussian graphical models. (arXiv:1804.00049v1 [stat.AP])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Several neuroimaging markers have been established for the early diagnosis of
Alzheimer's disease, among them amyloid-beta deposition, glucose metabolism,
and gray matter volume. Up to now, these imaging modalities were mostly
analyzed separately from each other, and little is known about the regional
interrelation and dependency of these markers. Gaussian graphical models (GGMs)
are able to estimate the conditional dependency between many individual random
variables. We applied GGMs for studying the inter-regional associations and
dependencies between multimodal imaging markers in prodromal Alzheimer's
disease. Data from N=667 subjects with mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and
cognitively healthy controls were obtained from the ADNI. Mean amyloid load,
glucose metabolism, and gray matter volume was calculated for each brain
region. GGMs were estimated using a Bayesian framework and for each individual
diagnosis, graph-theoretical statistics were calculated to determine structural
changes associated with disease severity. Highly inter-correlated regions, e.g.
adjacent regions in the same lobes, formed distinct clusters but included only
regions within the same imaging modality. Hardly any associations were found
between different modalities, indicating almost no conditional dependency of
brain regions across modalities when considering the covariance explained by
all other regions. Network measures clustering coefficient and path length were
significantly altered across diagnostic groups, with a biphasic u-shape
trajectory. GGMs showed almost no conditional dependencies between modalities
when at the same time considering various other regions within the same
modalities. However, this approach could be used as a clustering method to
derive graph statistics in future studies omitting the need to binarize the
network as currently being done for connections based on Pearson correlation.

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: ‘Surface Transplantation’ for Nerve Injury and Repair: The Quest for Minimally Invasive Cell Delivery</title>

	<description>Cell transplantation is an ambitious, but arguably realistic, therapy for repair of the nervous system. Cell delivery is a major challenge for clinical translation, especially given the apparently inhibitory astrogliotic environment in degenerated tissue. However, astrogliotic tissue also contains endogenous structural and biochemical cues that can be harnessed for functional repair. Minimizing damage to these cues during cell delivery could enhance cell integration. This theory is supported by studies with an auditory astrocyte scar model, in which cells delivered onto the surface of the damaged nerve were more successfully integrated in the host than those injected into the tissue.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Spatial organization of projection neurons in the mouse auditory cortex identified by in situ barcode sequencing</title>

	<description>Understanding neural circuits requires deciphering the interactions of myriad cell types defined by anatomy, spatial organization, gene expression, and functional properties. Resolving these cell types requires both single neuron resolution and high-throughput, a combination that is challenging to achieve with conventional anatomical methods. Here we introduce BARseq, a method for mapping the projections of thousands of spatially resolved neurons by combining the high throughput of DNA sequencing with the high spatial resolution of microscopy. We used BARseq to determine the projections of 1309 neurons in mouse auditory cortex to 11 targets. We observed 264 distinct projection patterns. Hierarchical clustering confirmed the major classical classes of projection neurons, segregated across cortical laminae. Further analysis revealed 25 subclasses, largely intermingled across laminae. Unlike cell types defined by gene expression, projection subclasses beyond the major classes were rarely enriched in specific laminae, raising the possibility that the organization of projection patterns in mature neurons is orthogonal to that of gene expression. In this way, downstream brain areas could receive information from multiple cell types through parallel pathways. By sequencing in situ, BARseq has the potential to bridge anatomical, transcriptomic, functional, and other approaches at single neuron resolution with high throughput, and thereby offer unprecedented insight of the structure and function of a neural circuit.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294454v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Although the cerebellum has been traditionally considered to be exclusively involved in motor control and learning, recent anatomical and clinical studies suggest that it may also have a role in cognition. However, no electrophysiological evidence exists to support this claim. Here we studied the activity of simple spikes of hand-movement related Purkinje cells in the mid-lateral cerebellum when monkeys learned to associate a well-learned right or left-hand movement with one of two visual symbolic cues. The cells had distinctly different discharge patterns between an overtrained symbol-hand association and a novel symbol-hand association although the kinematics of the movement did not change between the two conditions. The activity change was not related to the pattern of the visual symbols, the hand making the movement, the monkeys' reaction times or the novelty of the visual symbols. We suggest that mid-lateral cerebellum is involved in higher-order cognitive processing related to learning a new visuomotor association.</description>

	<description>Breakthroughs in understanding the neural basis of natural behavior require neural recording and intervention to be paired with high-fidelity multimodal behavioral monitoring. An extensive genetic toolkit for neural circuit dissection, and well-developed neural recording technology, make the mouse a powerful model organism for systems neuroscience. However, methods for high-bandwidth acquisition of behavioral signals in mice remain limited to fixed-position cameras and other off-animal devices, complicating the monitoring of animals freely engaged in natural behaviors. Here, we report the development of an ultralight head-mounted camera system combined with head-movement sensors to simultaneously monitor eye position, pupil dilation, whisking, and pinna movements along with head motion in unrestrained, freely behaving mice. The power of the combined technology is demonstrated by observations linking eye position to head orientation; whisking to non-tactile stimulation; and, in electrophysiological experiments, visual cortical activity to volitional head movements.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neuronal population mechanisms of lightness perception</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294280v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The way that humans and animals perceive the lightness of an object depends on its physical luminance as well as its surrounding context. While neuronal responses throughout the visual pathway are modulated by context, the relationship between neuronal responses and lightness perception is poorly understood. We searched for a neuronal mechanism of lightness by recording responses of neuronal populations in monkey primary visual cortex (V1) and area V4 to stimuli that produce a lightness illusion in humans, in which the lightness of a disk depends on the context in which it is embedded. We found that the way individual neurons encode the luminance (or equivalently for our stimuli, contrast) of the disk and its context is extremely heterogeneous. This motivated us to ask whether the population representation in either V1 or V4 satisfies three criteria: 1) disk luminance is represented with high fidelity, 2) the context surrounding the disk is also represented, and 3) the representations of disk luminance and context interact to create a representation of lightness that depends on these factors in a manner consistent with human psychophysical judgments of disk lightness. We found that populations of neurons in both V1 and V4 fulfill the first two criteria, but that we cannot conclude that the two types of information in either interact in a manner that clearly predicts human psychophysical measurements: the interpretation of our population measurements depends on how subsequent areas read out lightness from the population responses.</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Sensorimotor Representation of Speech Perception. Cross-Decoding of Place of Articulation Features during Selective Attention to Syllables in 7T fMRI</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Sensorimotor integration, the translation between acoustic signals and motoric programs, may constitute a crucial mechanism for speech. During speech perception, the acoustic-motoric translations include the recruitment of cortical areas for the representation of speech articulatory features, such as place of articulation. Selective attention can shape the processing and performance of speech perception tasks. Whether and where sensorimotor integration takes place during attentive speech perception remains to be explored. Here, we investigate articulatory feature representations of spoken consonant-vowel (CV) syllables during two distinct tasks. Fourteen healthy humans attended to either the vowel or the consonant within a syllable in separate delayed-match-to-sample tasks. Single-trial fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses from perception periods were analyzed using multivariate pattern classification and a searchlight approach to reveal neural activation patterns sensitive to the processing of place of articulation (i.e., bilabial/labiodental vs. alveolar). To isolate place of articulation representation from acoustic covariation, we applied a cross-decoding (generalization) procedure across distinct features of manner of articulation (i.e., stop, fricative, and nasal). We found evidence for the representation of place of articulation across tasks and in both tasks separately: for attention to vowels, generalization maps included bilateral clusters of superior and posterior temporal, insular, and frontal regions; for attention to consonants, generalization maps encompassed clusters in temporoparietal, insular, and frontal regions within the right hemisphere only. Our results specify the cortical representation of place of articulation features generalized across manner of articulation during attentive syllable perception, thus supporting sensorimotor integration during attentive speech perception and demonstrating the value of generalization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: A Dynamic Connectome Supports the Emergence of Stable Computational Function of Neural Circuits through Reward-Based Learning</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Synaptic connections between neurons in the brain are dynamic because of continuously ongoing spine dynamics, axonal sprouting, and other processes. In fact, it was recently shown that the spontaneous synapse-autonomous component of spine dynamics is at least as large as the component that depends on the history of pre- and postsynaptic neural activity. These data are inconsistent with common models for network plasticity, and raise the questions how neural circuits can maintain a stable computational function in spite of these continuously ongoing processes, and what functional uses these ongoing processes might have. Here, we present a rigorous theoretical framework for these seemingly stochastic spine dynamics and rewiring processes in the context of reward-based learning tasks. We show that spontaneous synapse-autonomous processes, in combination with reward signals such as dopamine, can explain the capability of networks of neurons in the brain to configure themselves for specific computational tasks, and to compensate automatically for later changes in the network or task. Furthermore we show theoretically and through computer simulations that stable computational performance is compatible with continuously ongoing synapse-autonomous changes. After reaching good computational performance it causes primarily a slow drift of network architecture and dynamics in task-irrelevant dimensions, as observed for neural activity in motor cortex and other areas. On the more abstract level of reinforcement learning the resulting model gives rise to an understanding of reward-driven network plasticity as continuous sampling of network configurations. (240 words)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Networks of neurons in the brain do not have a fixed connectivity. We address the question how stable computational performance can be achieved by continuously changing neural circuits, and how these networks could even benefit from these changes. We show that the stationary distribution of network configurations provides a level of analysis where these issues can be addressed in a perspicuous manner. In particular, this theoretical framework allows us to address analytically the questions which rules for reward-gated synaptic rewiring and plasticity would work best in this context, and what impact different levels of activity-independent synaptic processes are likely to have. We demonstrate the viability of this approach through computer simulations and links to experimental data. (116 words)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Given an intersection pattern of arbitrary sets in Euclidean space, is there
an arrangement of convex open sets in Euclidean space that exhibits the same
intersections? This question is combinatorial and topological in nature, but is
motivated by neuroscience. Specifically, we are interested in a type of neuron
called a place cell, which fires precisely when an organism is in a certain
region, usually convex, called a place field. The earlier question, therefore,
can be rephrased as follows: Which neural codes, that is, patterns of neural
activity, can arise from a collection of convex open sets? To address this
question, Giusti and Itskov proved that convex neural codes have no &quot;local
obstructions,&quot; which are defined via the topology of a code's simplicial
complex. Codes without local obstructions are called locally good, because the
obstruction precludes the code from arising from open sets that form a good
cover. In other words, every good-cover code is locally good. Here we prove the
converse: Every locally good code is a good-cover code. We also prove that the
good-cover decision problem is undecidable. Finally, we reveal a stronger type
of local obstruction that prevents a code from being convex, and prove that the
corresponding decision problem is NP-hard. Our proofs use combinatorial and
topological methods.

	<description>Deafness causes speech to deteriorate, but whether this deterioration reflects an active or passive process is unclear. Birdsong – a learned vocal behavior that resembles speech in its dependence on auditory feedback – also deteriorates following deafening. In their 2000 paper, Brainard and Doupe showed that, following deafening, birdsong deteriorates through an active process mediated by a cortex–basal ganglia (BG) circuit.</description>

	<description>In the late 1970s, key discoveries in neurophysiology, psychophysics, computer vision, and image processing had reached a tipping point that would shape visual science for decades to come. David Marr and Ellen Hildreth’s ‘Theory of edge detection’, published in 1980, set out to integrate the newly available wealth of data from behavioral, physiological, and computational approaches in a unifying theory. Although their work had wide and enduring ramifications, their most important contribution may have been to consolidate the foundations of the ongoing dialogue between theoretical and empirical vision science.</description>

	<description>How are different neural cell types generated from progenitor cells? In 1990, Turner et al. used new lineage tracing techniques to show that different cells in the mammalian retina share their progenitor origin. The findings established a key step toward our understanding of how multipotent progenitor cells give rise to complex circuitry in the retina.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: An open source tool for automatic spatiotemporal assessment of calcium transients and local ‘signal-close-to-noise’ activity in calcium imaging data</title>

Local and spontaneous calcium signals play important roles in neurons and neuronal networks. Spontaneous or cell-autonomous calcium signals may be difficult to assess because they appear in an unpredictable spatiotemporal pattern and in very small neuronal loci of axons or dendrites. We developed an open source bioinformatics tool for an unbiased assessment of calcium signals in x,y-t imaging series. The tool bases its algorithm on a continuous wavelet transform-guided peak detection to identify calcium signal candidates. The highly sensitive calcium event definition is based on identification of peaks in 1D data through analysis of a 2D wavelet transform surface. For spatial analysis, the tool uses a grid to separate the x,y-image field in independently analyzed grid windows. A document containing a graphical summary of the data is automatically created and displays the loci of activity for a wide range of signal intensities. Furthermore, the number of activity events is summed up to create an estimated total activity value, which can be used to compare different experimental situations, such as calcium activity before or after an experimental treatment. All traces and data of active loci become documented. The tool can also compute the signal variance in a sliding window to visualize activity-dependent signal fluctuations. We applied the calcium signal detector to monitor activity states of cultured mouse neurons. Our data show that both the total activity value and the variance area created by a sliding window can distinguish experimental manipulations of neuronal activity states. Notably, the tool is powerful enough to compute local calcium events and ‘signal-close-to-noise’ activity in small loci of distal neurites of neurons, which remain during pharmacological blockade of neuronal activity with inhibitors such as tetrodotoxin, to block action potential firing, or inhibitors of ionotropic glutamate receptors. The tool can also offer information about local homeostatic calcium activity events in neurites.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8fH_ykpqpmQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Differences in the Electrophysiological Properties of Mouse Somatosensory Layer 2/3 Neurons in Vivo and Slice Stem from Intrinsic Sources Rather than a Network-Generated High Conductance State</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Synaptic activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; can potentially alter the integration properties of neurons. Using recordings in awake mice, we targeted somatosensory layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons and compared neuronal properties with those from slices. Pyramidal cells &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; had lower resistance and gain values, as well as broader spikes and increased spike frequency adaptation compared to the same cells in slices. Increasing conductance in neurons using dynamic clamp to levels observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, however, did not lessen the differences between &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and slice conditions. Further, local application of tetrodotoxin &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; blocked synaptic-mediated membrane voltage fluctuations, but had little impact on pyramidal cell membrane input resistance and time constant values. Differences in electrophysiological properties of layer 2/3 neurons in mouse somatosensory cortex, therefore, stem from intrinsic sources separate from synaptic-mediated membrane voltage fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; are often modeled as being in a high conductance state arising from intense synaptic activity in awake conditions. Outside of the expected reduction in membrane time constant, it remains unclear if other features are altered &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here we show that cellular properties between mouse somatosensory neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and slices differ substantially in terms of spike shape, input-output responses, and subthreshold membrane resistance. Increasing the membrane conductance of neurons in slices to match values observed at rest &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, however, does not generate properties consistent with those observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Differences in the properties of mouse somatosensory layer 2/3 pyramidal cells &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and slices, therefore, are not the product of a network-generated high conductance state.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: SARNAclust: Semi-automatic detection of RNA protein binding motifs from immunoprecipitation data</title>

RNA-protein binding is critical to gene regulation, controlling fundamental processes including splicing, translation, localization and stability, and aberrant RNA-protein interactions are known to play a role in a wide variety of diseases. However, molecular understanding of RNA-protein interactions remains limited; in particular, identification of RNA motifs that bind proteins has long been challenging, especially when such motifs depend on both sequence and structure. Moreover, although RNA binding proteins (RBPs) often contain more than one binding domain, algorithms capable of identifying more than one binding motif simultaneously have not been developed. In this paper we present a novel pipeline to determine binding peaks in crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) data, to discover multiple possible RNA sequence/structure motifs among them, and to experimentally validate such motifs. At the core is a new semi-automatic algorithm SARNAclust, the first unsupervised method to identify and deconvolve multiple sequence/structure motifs simultaneously. SARNAclust computes similarity between sequence/structure objects using a graph kernel, providing the ability to isolate the impact of specific features through the bulge graph formalism. Application of SARNAclust to synthetic data shows its capability of clustering 5 motifs at once with a V-measure value of over 0.95, while GraphClust achieves only a V-measure of 0.083 and RNAcontext cannot detect any of the motifs. When applied to existing eCLIP sets, SARNAclust finds known motifs for SLBP and HNRNPC and novel motifs for several other RBPs such as AGGF1, AKAP8L and ILF3. We demonstrate an experimental validation protocol, a targeted Bind-n-Seq-like high-throughput sequencing approach that relies on RNA inverse folding for oligo pool design, that can validate the components within the SLBP motif. Finally, we use this protocol to experimentally interrogate the SARNAclust motif predictions for protein ILF3. Our results support a newly identified partially double-stranded UUUUUGAGA motif similar to that known for the splicing factor HNRNPC.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Sk4-TYwKrLk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Quantitative reasoning and techniques are increasingly ubiquitous across the life sciences. However, new graduate researchers with a biology background are often not equipped with the skills that are required to utilize such techniques correctly and efficiently. In parallel, there are increasing numbers of engineers, mathematicians, and physical scientists interested in studying problems in biology with only basic knowledge of this field. Students from such varied backgrounds can struggle to engage proactively together to tackle problems in biology. There is therefore a need to establish bridges between those disciplines. It is our proposal that the beginning of graduate school is the appropriate time to initiate those bridges through an interdisciplinary short course. We have instigated an intensive 10-day course that brought together new graduate students in the life sciences from across departments within the National University of Singapore. The course aimed at introducing biological problems as well as some of the quantitative approaches commonly used when tackling those problems. We have run the course for three years with over 100 students attending. Building on this experience, we share 11 quick tips on how to run such an effective, interdisciplinary short course for new graduate students in the biosciences.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lgYLCd2q9tA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cloud computing has revolutionized the development and operations of hardware and software across diverse technological arenas, yet academic biomedical research has lagged behind despite the numerous and weighty advantages that cloud computing offers. Biomedical researchers who embrace cloud computing can reap rewards in cost reduction, decreased development and maintenance workload, increased reproducibility, ease of sharing data and software, enhanced security, horizontal and vertical scalability, high availability, a thriving technology partner ecosystem, and much more. Despite these advantages that cloud-based workflows offer, the majority of scientific software developed in academia does not utilize cloud computing and must be migrated to the cloud by the user. In this article, we present 11 quick tips for architecting biomedical informatics workflows on compute clouds, distilling knowledge gained from experience developing, operating, maintaining, and distributing software and virtualized appliances on the world’s largest cloud. Researchers who follow these tips stand to benefit immediately by migrating their workflows to cloud computing and embracing the paradigm of abstraction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C7tl3DiTInM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Reduced Orexin System Function Contributes to Resilience to Repeated Social Stress</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Exposure to stress increases the risk of developing affective disorders such as depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). However, these disorders only occur in a subset of individuals, those that are more vulnerable to the effects of stress, whereas others remain resilient. The coping style adopted to deal with the stressor, either passive or active coping, is related to vulnerability or resilience, respectively. Important neural substrates that mediate responses to a stressor are the orexins. These neuropeptides are altered in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with stress-related illnesses such as depression and PTSD. The present experiments used a rodent social defeat model that generates actively coping rats and passively coping rats, which we have previously shown exhibit resilient and vulnerable profiles, respectively, to examine if orexins play a role in these stress-induced phenotypes. &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt; radiolabeling and qPCR revealed that actively coping rats expressed significantly lower prepro-orexin mRNA compared with passively coping rats. This led to the hypothesis that lower levels of orexins contribute to resilience to repeated social stress. To test this hypothesis, rats first underwent five days of social defeat to establish active and passive coping phenotypes. Then, orexin neurons were inhibited prior to each social defeat for three additional days using Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs). Inhibition of orexins increased social interaction behavior and decreased depressive-like behavior in the vulnerable population of rats. Indeed, this suggests that lowering orexins promoted resilience to social defeat, and may be an important target for treatment of stress-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Stress-related mental illnesses only occur in a subset of individuals, whereas others are resilient to the effects of stress. Our work used an animal model of social stress to identify a substrate of resilience, the neuropeptides orexins, which are known to be altered in patients with MDD and PTSD. We found that orexins are decreased in rats resilient to social stress. To test whether low orexins contribute to resilience, orexins were inhibited during three days of a social defeat stress paradigm, which increased subsequent social interaction behavior and decreased depressive-like behaviors in a previously vulnerable population of rats. This suggests that lowering orexins is important in promoting resilience to stress, and are an important target for treatments of stress-related illness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Cortical Measures of Phoneme-Level Speech Encoding Correlate with the Perceived Clarity of Natural Speech</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0084-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In real-world environments, humans comprehend speech by actively integrating prior knowledge and expectations with sensory input. Recent studies have revealed effects of prior information in temporal and frontal cortical areas, and have suggested that these effects are underpinned by enhanced encoding of speech-specific features, rather than a broad enhancement or suppression of cortical activity. However, in terms of the specific hierarchical stages of processing involved in speech comprehension, the effects of integrating bottom-up sensory responses and top-down predictions are still unclear. In addition, it is unclear whether the predictability that comes with prior information may differentially affect speech encoding relative to the perceptual enhancement that comes with that prediction. One way to investigate these issues is through examining the impact of prior knowledge on indices of cortical tracking of continuous speech features. Here, we did this by presenting participants with degraded speech sentences that either were or were not preceded by a clear recording of the same sentences while recording non-invasive electroencephalography. We assessed the impact of prior information on an isolated index of cortical tracking that reflected phoneme-level processing. Our findings suggests the possibility that prior information affects the early encoding of natural speech in a dual manner. Firstly, the availability of prior information, as hypothesized, enhanced the perceived clarity of degraded speech, which was positively correlated with changes in phoneme-level encoding across subjects. In addition, prior knowledge induced an overall reduction of this cortical measure, which we interpret as resulting from the increase in predictability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The human ability to comprehend speech despite challenges such as loud noise and competing speech derives in large part from the use of prior knowledge of the upcoming speech. Here, we examine the cortical underpinnings of this process by using prior knowledge to modulate the perceived intelligibility of degraded stimuli. We find two distinct effects of prior knowledge: A positive correlation between perceptual enhancement and phoneme-level encoding and an overall suppression of this cortical encoding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The aim of the study was to examine how the complexity of surface
electromyogram (sEMG) signal, estimated by Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD) and
Sample Entropy (SampEn), change depending on muscle contraction intensity and
external perturbation of the corticospinal activity during muscle contraction
induced by single-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (spTMS). HFD and
SampEn were computed from sEMG signal recorded at three various levels of
voluntary contraction before and after spTMS. After spTMS, both HFD and SampEn
decreased at medium compared to the mild contraction. SampEn increased, while
HFD did not change significantly at strong compared to medium contraction.
spTMS significantly decreased both parameters at all contraction levels. When
same parameters were computed from the mathematically generated sine-wave
calibration curves, the results show that SampEn has better accuracy at lower
(0-40 Hz) and HFD at higher (60-120 Hz) frequencies. Changes in the sEMG
complexity associated with increased muscle contraction intensity cannot be
accurately depicted by a single complexity measure. Examination of sEMG should
entail both SampEn and HFD as they provide complementary information about
different frequency components of sEMG. Further studies are needed to explain
the implication of changes in nonlinear parameters and their relation to
underlying sEMG physiological processes.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Theoretical Study of Process Dependence for Critical Statistics in Standard Serial Models and Standard Parallel Models. (arXiv:1803.10597v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Long before the mathematical developments that led inexorably to the
development of systems factorial technology, the somewhat arduous, but arguably
requisite labors which precisely defined parallel and serial architectures had
begun (e.g., Townsend, 1969, 1972). Both then and now, what are now referred to
as standard serial models and standard parallel models not only play an
important role in psychological science, they are often what non-mathematical
psychologists are (sometimes in an unschooled fashion) referring to when they
up architectural concepts. Interestingly, two strategic and critical
properties, and therefore implicit predictions of the canonical serial and
parallel models have witnessed little analysis. Thus, standard parallel models
predict stochastically independent actual processing times and therefore total
completion times. What do standard serial models predict about this statistic?
Similarly, standard serial models predict independent actual processing times
and therefore intercompletion times. What do standard parallel models predict
about this statistic? Finally, are there psychological questions that pertain
to these distinctions and are there any experiments that have emerged to assess
the latter. All these matters are targeted for our exposition.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Can deep learning (DL) guide our understanding of computations happening in
biological brain? We will first briefly consider how DL has contributed to the
research on visual object recognition. In the main part we will assess whether
DL could also help us to clarify the computations underlying higher cognitive
functions such as Theory of Mind. In addition, we will compare the objectives
and learning signals of brains and machines, leading us to conclude that simply
scaling up the current DL algorithms will not lead to human level mindreading
skills. We then provide some insights about how to fairly compare human and DL
performance. In the end we find that DL can contribute to our understanding of
biological computations by providing an example of an end-to-end algorithm that
solves the same problems the biological agents face.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Re-thinking EEG-based non-invasive brain interfaces: modeling and analysis. (arXiv:1803.10318v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10318</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain interfaces are cyber-physical systems that aim to harvest information
from the (physical) brain through sensing mechanisms, extract information about
the underlying processes, and decide/actuate accordingly. Nonetheless, the
brain interfaces are still in their infancy, but reaching to their maturity
quickly as several initiatives are released to push forward their development
(e.g., NeuraLink by Elon Musk and `typing-by-brain' by Facebook). This has
motivated us to revisit the design of EEG-based non-invasive brain interfaces.
Specifically, current methodologies entail a highly skilled neuro-functional
approach and evidence-based \emph{a priori} knowledge about specific signal
features and their interpretation from a neuro-physiological point of view.
Hereafter, we propose to demystify such approaches, as we propose to leverage
new time-varying complex network models that equip us with a fractal dynamical
characterization of the underlying processes. Subsequently, the parameters of
the proposed complex network models can be explained from a system's
perspective, and, consecutively, used for classification using machine learning
algorithms and/or actuation laws determined using control system's theory.
Besides, the proposed system identification methods and techniques have
computational complexities comparable with those currently used in EEG-based
brain interfaces, which enable comparable online performances. Furthermore, we
foresee that the proposed models and approaches are also valid using other
invasive and non-invasive technologies. Finally, we illustrate and
experimentally evaluate this approach on real EEG-datasets to assess and
validate the proposed methodology. The classification accuracies are high even
on having less number of training samples.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Quantum Cognition has delivered a number of models for semantic memory, but
to date these have tended to assume pure states and projective measurement.
Here we relax these assumptions. A quantum inspired model of human word
association experiments will be extended using a density matrix representation
of human memory and a POVM based upon non-ideal measurements. Our formulation
allows for a consideration of key terms like measurement and contextuality
within a rigorous modern approach. This approach both provides new conceptual
advances and suggests new experimental protocols.

	<description>Complement activation products have long been associated with roles in the innate immune system, linking the humoral and cellular responses. However, among their recently described non-inflammatory roles, complement proteins also have multiple emerging novel functions in brain development. Within this context, separate proteins and pathways of complement have carved out physiological niches in the formation, development, and refinement of neurons. They demonstrate actions that are both reminiscent of peripheral immune actions and removed from them.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Bamgineer: Introduction of simulated allele-specific copy number variants into exome and targeted sequence data sets</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Soroush Samadian, Jeff P. Bruce, Trevor J. Pugh&lt;/p&gt;

Somatic copy number variations (CNVs) play a crucial role in development of many human cancers. The broad availability of next-generation sequencing data has enabled the development of algorithms to computationally infer CNV profiles from a variety of data types including exome and targeted sequence data; currently the most prevalent types of cancer genomics data. However, systemic evaluation and comparison of these tools remains challenging due to a lack of ground truth reference sets. To address this need, we have developed Bamgineer, a tool written in Python to introduce user-defined haplotype-phased allele-specific copy number events into an existing Binary Alignment Mapping (BAM) file, with a focus on targeted and exome sequencing experiments. As input, this tool requires a read alignment file (BAM format), lists of non-overlapping genome coordinates for introduction of gains and losses (bed file), and an optional file defining known haplotypes (vcf format). To improve runtime performance, Bamgineer introduces the desired CNVs in parallel using queuing and parallel processing on a local machine or on a high-performance computing cluster. As proof-of-principle, we applied Bamgineer to a single high-coverage (mean: 220X) exome sequence file from a blood sample to simulate copy number profiles of 3 exemplar tumors from each of 10 tumor types at 5 tumor cellularity levels (20–100%, 150 BAM files in total). To demonstrate feasibility beyond exome data, we introduced read alignments to a targeted 5-gene cell-free DNA sequencing library to simulate &lt;i&gt;EGFR&lt;/i&gt; amplifications at frequencies consistent with circulating tumor DNA (10, 1, 0.1 and 0.01%) while retaining the multimodal insert size distribution of the original data. We expect Bamgineer to be of use for development and systematic benchmarking of CNV calling algorithms by users using locally-generated data for a variety of applications.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling the dynamics of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and the genesis of gliomas</title>

Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) have remarkable properties: they represent the most abundant cycling cell population in the adult normal brain and they manage to achieve a uniform and constant density throughout the adult brain. This equilibrium is obtained by the interplay of four processes: division, differentiation or death, migration and active self-repulsion. They are also strongly suspected to be at the origin of gliomas, when their equilibrium is disrupted. In this article, we present a model of the dynamics of OPCs, first in a normal tissue. This model is based on a cellular automaton and its rules are mimicking the ones that regulate the dynamics of real OPCs. The model is able to reproduce the homeostasis of the cell population, with the maintenance of a constant and uniform cell density and the healing of a lesion. We show that there exists a fair quantitative agreement between the simulated and experimental parameters, such as the cell velocity, the time taken to close a lesion, and the duration of the cell cycle. We present three possible scenarios of disruption of the equilibrium: the appearance of an over-proliferating cell, of a deadless/non-differentiating cell, or of a cell that lost any contact-inhibition. We show that the appearance of an over-proliferating cell is sufficient to trigger the growth of a tumor that has low-grade glioma features: an invasive behaviour, a linear radial growth of the tumor with a corresponding growth velocity of less than 2 mm per year, as well a cell density at the center which exceeds the one in normal tissue by a factor of less than two. The loss of contact inhibition leads to a more high-grade-like glioma. The results of our model contribute to the body of evidence that identify OPCs as possible cells of origin of gliomas.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4yhFdqGpIbo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Experimental recordings in hippocampal slices indicate that astrocytic dysfunction may cause neuronal hyper-excitation or seizures. Considering that astrocytes play important roles in mediating local uptake and spatial buffering of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the extracellular space of the cortical circuit, we constructed a novel model of an astrocyte-neuron network module consisting of a single compartment neuron and 4 surrounding connected astrocytes and including extracellular potassium dynamics. Next, we developed a new model function for the astrocyte gap junctions, connecting two astrocyte-neuron network modules. The function form and parameters of the gap junction were based on nonlinear regression fitting of a set of experimental data published in previous studies. Moreover, we have created numerical simulations using the above single astrocyte-neuron network module and the coupled astrocyte-neuron network modules. Our model validates previous experimental observations that both Kir4.1 channels and gap junctions play important roles in regulating the concentration of extracellular potassium. In addition, we also observe that changes in Kir4.1 channel conductance and gap junction strength induce spontaneous epileptic activity in the absence of external stimuli.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fOtr0tevqZs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Prefrontal Oxytocin is Involved in Impairments in Prefrontal Plasticity and Social Memory Following Acute Exposure to High Fat Diet in Juvenile Animals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy070</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy070/4955783?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Juvenility represents a critical developmental phase during which exposure to a high fat diet (HFD) can severely modify cognitive and emotional functioning. The purpose of this study was to address how short and acute exposure to a HFD during juvenility affects social memory recognition and prefrontal long-term potentiation (LTP). As LTP and social memory depend on the neuromodulator oxytocin (OXY) and due to its role in metabolism, we also examined the effects of OXY in mediating HFD-induced alterations in social memory and LTP. Our results show that short exposure to a HFD during juvenility impairs social preference memory and prefrontal LTP. Interestingly, whereas systemic injections of OXY reversed the impairments in HFD-fed animals and impaired LTP and memory in control animals; prefrontal injections of the OXY agonist TGOT reversed the effects in HFD animals without affecting control animals. Exposure to HFD was associated with a reduction in the levels of OXY in the prefrontal compared to control animals. Interestingly, the restoration of social memory by TGOT in HFD animals was also associated with normalization of OXY in the prefrontal. These results point to a role that prefrontal OXY has in mediating the effects of HFD on memory and plasticity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Working Memory Load Modulates Neuronal Coupling</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;There is a severe limitation in the number of items that can be held in working memory. However, the neurophysiological limits remain unknown. We asked whether the capacity limit might be explained by differences in neuronal coupling. We developed a theoretical model based on Predictive Coding and used it to analyze Cross Spectral Density data from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), frontal eye fields (FEF), and lateral intraparietal area (LIP). Monkeys performed a change detection task. The number of objects that had to be remembered (memory load) was varied (1–3 objects in the same visual hemifield). Changes in memory load changed the connectivity in the PFC–FEF–LIP network. Feedback (top-down) coupling broke down when the number of objects exceeded cognitive capacity. Thus, impaired behavioral performance coincided with a break-down of Prediction signals. This provides new insights into the neuronal underpinnings of cognitive capacity and how coupling in a distributed working memory network is affected by memory load.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Regional GABA Concentrations Modulate Inter-network Resting-state Functional Connectivity</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Coordinated activity within and differential activity between large-scale neuronal networks such as the default mode network (DMN) and the control network (CN) is a critical feature of brain organization. The CN usually exhibits activations in response to cognitive tasks while the DMN shows deactivations; in addition, activity between the two networks is anti-correlated at rest. To address this issue, we used functional MRI to measure whole-brain BOLD signal during resting-state and task-evoked conditions, and MR spectroscopy (MRS) to quantify GABA and glutamate concentrations, in nodes within the DMN and CN (MPFC and DLPFC, respectively) in 19 healthy individuals at 3 Tesla. We found that GABA concentrations in the MPFC were significantly associated with DMN deactivation during a working memory task and with anti-correlation between DMN and CN at rest and during task performance, while GABA concentrations in the DLPFC weakly modulated DMN–CN anti-correlation in the opposite direction. Highlighting specificity, glutamate played a less significant role related to brain activity. These findings indicate that GABA in the MPFC is potentially involved in orchestrating between-network brain activity at rest and during task performance.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>The physiology of the central nervous system (CNS) is built on a foundation of connection, integration, and the exchange of complex information among brain cells. Emerging evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key players in the intercellular communication that underlies physiological processes such as synaptic plasticity and the maintenance of myelination. Furthermore, upon injury to the CNS, EVs may propagate inflammation across the blood–brain barrier and beyond, and also appear to mediate neuroprotection and modulate regenerative processes.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Dynamic combination of sensory and reward information under time pressure</title>

When making choices, collecting more information is beneficial but comes at the cost of sacrificing time that could be allocated to making other potentially rewarding decisions. To investigate how the brain balances these costs and benefits, we conducted a series of novel experiments in humans and simulated various computational models. Under six levels of time pressure, subjects made decisions either by integrating sensory information over time or by dynamically combining sensory and reward information over time. We found that during sensory integration, time pressure reduced performance as the deadline approached, and choice was more strongly influenced by the most recent sensory evidence. By fitting performance and reaction time with various models we found that our experimental results are more compatible with leaky integration of sensory information with an urgency signal or a decision process based on stochastic transitions between discrete states modulated by an urgency signal. When combining sensory and reward information, subjects spent less time on integration than optimally prescribed when reward decreased slowly over time, and the most recent evidence did not have the maximal influence on choice. The suboptimal pattern of reaction time was partially mitigated in an equivalent control experiment in which sensory integration over time was not required, indicating that the suboptimal response time was influenced by the perception of imperfect sensory integration. Meanwhile, during combination of sensory and reward information, performance did not drop as the deadline approached, and response time was not different between correct and incorrect trials. These results indicate a decision process different from what is involved in the integration of sensory information over time. Together, our results not only reveal limitations in sensory integration over time but also illustrate how these limitations influence dynamic combination of sensory and reward information.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6W0_cn-RZQs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Dynamic cues for whisker-based object localization: An analytical solution to vibration during active whisker touch</title>

Vibrations are important cues for tactile perception across species. Whisker-based sensation in mice is a powerful model system for investigating mechanisms of tactile perception. However, the role vibration plays in whisker-based sensation remains unsettled, in part due to difficulties in modeling the vibration of whiskers. Here, we develop an analytical approach to calculate the vibrations of whiskers striking objects. We use this approach to quantify vibration forces during active whisker touch at a range of locations along the whisker. The frequency and amplitude of vibrations evoked by contact are strongly dependent on the position of contact along the whisker. The magnitude of vibrational shear force and bending moment is comparable to quasi-static forces. The fundamental vibration frequencies are in a detectable range for mechanoreceptor properties and below the maximum spike rates of primary sensory afferents. These results suggest two dynamic cues exist that rodents can use for object localization: vibration frequency and comparison of vibrational to quasi-static force magnitude. These complement the use of quasi-static force angle as a distance cue, particularly for touches close to the follicle, where whiskers are stiff and force angles hardly change during touch.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: From correlation to causation: Estimating effective connectivity from zero-lag covariances of brain signals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006056</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Schiefer, Alexander Niederbühl, Volker Pernice, Carolin Lennartz, Jürgen Hennig, Pierre LeVan, Stefan Rotter&lt;/p&gt;

Knowing brain connectivity is of great importance both in basic research and for clinical applications. We are proposing a method to infer directed connectivity from zero-lag covariances of neuronal activity recorded at multiple sites. This allows us to identify causal relations that are reflected in neuronal population activity. To derive our strategy, we assume a generic linear model of interacting continuous variables, the components of which represent the activity of local neuronal populations. The suggested method for inferring connectivity from recorded signals exploits the fact that the covariance matrix derived from the observed activity contains information about the existence, the direction and the sign of connections. Assuming a sparsely coupled network, we disambiguate the underlying causal structure via &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-minimization, which is known to prefer sparse solutions. In general, this method is suited to infer effective connectivity from resting state data of various types. We show that our method is applicable over a broad range of structural parameters regarding network size and connection probability of the network. We also explored parameters affecting its activity dynamics, like the eigenvalue spectrum. Also, based on the simulation of suitable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes to model BOLD dynamics, we show that with our method it is possible to estimate directed connectivity from zero-lag covariances derived from such signals. In this study, we consider measurement noise and unobserved nodes as additional confounding factors. Furthermore, we investigate the amount of data required for a reliable estimate. Additionally, we apply the proposed method on full-brain resting-state fast fMRI datasets. The resulting network exhibits a tendency for close-by areas being connected as well as inter-hemispheric connections between corresponding areas. In addition, we found that a surprisingly large fraction of more than one third of all identified connections were of inhibitory nature.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OQUjBd7KMBU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Scabies in residential care homes: Modelling, inference and interventions for well-connected population sub-units</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Timothy Kinyanjui, Jo Middleton, Stefan Güttel, Jackie Cassell, Joshua Ross, Thomas House&lt;/p&gt;

In the context of an ageing population, understanding the transmission of infectious diseases such as scabies through well-connected sub-units of the population, such as residential care homes, is particularly important for the design of efficient interventions to mitigate against the effects of those diseases. Here, we present a modelling methodology based on the efficient solution of a large-scale system of linear differential equations that allows statistical calibration of individual-based random models to real data on scabies in residential care homes. In particular, we review and benchmark different numerical methods for the integration of the differential equation system, and then select the most appropriate of these methods to perform inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We test the goodness-of-fit of this model using posterior predictive intervals and propagate forward the resulting parameter uncertainty in a Bayesian framework to consider the economic cost of delayed interventions against scabies, quantifying the benefits of prompt action in the event of detection. We also revisit the previous methodology used to assess the safety of treatments in small population sub-units—in this context ivermectin—and demonstrate that even a very slight relaxation of the implicit assumption of homogeneous death rates significantly increases the plausibility of the hypothesis that ivermectin does not cause excess mortality based upon the data of Barkwell and Shields [1].&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UwFpGqUcNck&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Most cancer cells harbor multiple drivers whose epistasis and interactions with expression context clouds drug and drug combination sensitivity prediction. We constructed a mechanistic computational model that is context-tailored by omics data to capture regulation of stochastic proliferation and death by pan-cancer driver pathways. Simulations and experiments explore how the coordinated dynamics of RAF/MEK/ERK and PI-3K/AKT kinase activities in response to synergistic mitogen or drug combinations control cell fate in a specific cellular context. In this MCF10A cell context, simulations suggest that synergistic ERK and AKT inhibitor-induced death is likely mediated by BIM rather than BAD, which is supported by prior experimental studies. AKT dynamics explain S-phase entry synergy between EGF and insulin, but simulations suggest that stochastic ERK, and not AKT, dynamics seem to drive cell-to-cell proliferation variability, which in simulations is predictable from pre-stimulus fluctuations in C-Raf/B-Raf levels. Simulations suggest MEK alteration negligibly influences transformation, consistent with clinical data. Tailoring the model to an alternate cell expression and mutation context, a glioma cell line, allows prediction of increased sensitivity of cell death to AKT inhibition. Our model mechanistically interprets context-specific landscapes between driver pathways and cell fates, providing a framework for designing more rational cancer combination therapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w6d_RFwOJFE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>A growing body of work is investigating the safety and efficacy of light in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here we discuss the potential of this emerging therapy to improve both motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. We also highlight directions for future basic, translational, and clinical research that are critical for the development of mechanism-based protocols of light therapy in PD.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Continuous Variation within Cell Types of the Nervous System</title>

	<description>The brain is an organ of immense complexity. Next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is becoming increasingly popular in the deconstruction of this complexity into distinct classes of ‘cell types’. Notably, in addition to revealing the organization of this distinct cell-type landscape, the technology has also begun to illustrate that continuous variation can be found within narrowly defined cell types. Here we summarize the evidence for graded transcriptomic heterogeneity being present, widespread, and functionally relevant in the nervous system.</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Measuring and Validating the Levels of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in Human Serum</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/2/ENEURO.0419-17.2018?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) secreted by neurons is a significant component of synaptic plasticity. In humans, it is also present in blood platelets where it accumulates following its biosynthesis in megakaryocytes. BDNF levels are thus readily detectable in human serum and it has been abundantly speculated that they may somehow serve as an indicator of brain function. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty with regard to the range of BDNF levels that can be considered normal, how stable these values are over time and even whether BDNF levels can be reliably measured in serum. Using monoclonal antibodies and a sandwich ELISA, this study reports on BDNF levels in the serum of 259 volunteers with a mean value of 32.69 ± 8.33 ng/ml (SD). The mean value for the same cohort after 12 months was not significantly different (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 226, 32.97 ± 8.36 ng/ml SD, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.19). Power analysis of these values indicates that relatively large cohorts are necessary to identify significant differences, requiring a group size of 60 to detect a 20% change. The levels determined by ELISA could be validated by Western blot analyses using a BDNF monoclonal antibody. While no association was observed with gender, a weak, positive correlation was found with age. The overall conclusions are that BDNF levels can be reliably measured in human serum, that these levels are quite stable over one year, and that comparisons between two populations may only be meaningful if cohorts of sufficient sizes are assembled.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Diffuse activation of interleukin-1 inflammatory cytokine signaling after traumatic brain injury (TBI) elicits progressive neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric dysfunction, and thus represents a potential opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Although IL-1α and IL-1β both activate the common type 1 interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1RI), they manifest distinct injury-specific roles in some models of neurodegeneration. Despite its potential relevance to treating patients with TBI, however, the individual contributions of IL-1α and IL-1β to TBI-pathology have not been previously investigated. To address this need, we applied genetic and pharmacologic approaches in mice to dissect the individual contributions of IL-1α, IL-β, and IL-1RI signaling to the pathophysiology of fluid percussion-mediated TBI, a model of mixed focal and diffuse TBI. IL-1RI ablation conferred a greater protective effect on brain cytokine expression and cognitive function after TBI than did individual IL-1α or IL-1β ablation. This protective effect was recapitulated by treatment with the drug anakinra, a recombinant naturally-occurring IL-1RI antagonist. Our data thus suggest that broad targeting of IL-1RI signaling is more likely to reduce neuroinflammation and preserve cognitive function after TBI than are approaches that individually target IL-1α or IL-1β signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability. Secondary signaling cascades, including neuroinflammation, trigger progressive neuronal injury following TBI. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a major driver of the neuroinflammatory response to brain injury, but the impact of individual IL-1α or IL-1β blockade on TBI outcome had not been evaluated. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we dissected the contributions of IL-1α, IL-β, and IL-1RI to the pathophysiology of fluid percussion-mediated TBI. We show that genetic ablation of IL-1RI conferred the greatest benefit after TBI. Moreover, the beneficial effects were recapitulated by treatment with an IL-1RI antagonist. Given the need for the development of effective therapies that mitigate neurodegeneration after TBI, this is a timely, relevant area of study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sensorimotor Representation of Speech Perception - Cross-Decoding of Place of Articulation Features during Selective Attention to Syllables in 7T fMRI</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Sensorimotor integration, the translation between acoustic signals and motoric programs, may constitute a crucial mechanism for speech. During speech perception, the acoustic-motoric translations include the recruitment of cortical areas for the representation of speech articulatory features, such as place of articulation. Selective attention can shape the processing and performance of speech perception tasks. Whether and where sensorimotor integration takes place during attentive speech perception remains to be explored. Here, we investigate articulatory feature representations of spoken consonant-vowel syllables during two distinct tasks. Fourteen healthy humans attended to either the vowel or the consonant within a syllable in separate delayed-match-to-sample tasks. Single-trial fMRI BOLD responses from perception periods were analyzed using multivariate pattern classification and a searchlight approach to reveal neural activation patterns sensitive to the processing of place of articulation (i.e., bilabial/labiodental vs. alveolar). To isolate place of articulation representation from acoustic covariation, we applied a cross-decoding (generalization) procedure across distinct features of manner of articulation (i.e., stop, fricative, and nasal). We found evidence for the representation of place of articulation across tasks and in both tasks separately: for attention to vowels, generalization maps included bilateral clusters of superior and posterior temporal, insular, and frontal regions; for attention to consonants, generalization maps encompassed clusters in temporoparietal, insular, and frontal regions within the right hemisphere only. Our results specify the cortical representation of place of articulation features generalized across manner of articulation during attentive syllable perception, thus supporting sensorimotor integration during attentive speech perception and demonstrating the value of generalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Speech is supported by sensorimotor integration, a bidirectional translation of its auditory and motoric signals. Whether our brain represents speech as articulatory features during selective attention has not yet been well specified. We focused on the representation of articulatory information of speech during attentive speech perception. For the first time, we applied generalization in classification analysis to counteract the differences in acoustic properties that accompany articulatory information. Participants attended to either the vowels or consonants of syllables, while undergoing fMRI. Our results show that articulatory information is represented in widespread cortical areas during selective attention to the different syllable components, supporting sensorimotor integration during attentive speech perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Susceptibility to Oxidative Stress Is Determined by Genetic Background in Neuronal Cell Cultures</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to a deleterious and multifactorial secondary inflammatory response in the brain. Oxidative stress from the inflammation likely contributes to the brain damage although it is unclear to which extent. A largely unexplored approach is to consider phenotypic regulation of oxidative stress levels. Genetic polymorphism influences inflammation in the central nervous system and it is possible that the antioxidative response differs between phenotypes and affects the severity of the secondary injury. We therefore compared the antioxidative response in inbred rat strains dark agouti (DA) to piebald viral glaxo (PVG). DA has high susceptibility to inflammatory challenges and PVG is protected. Primary neuronal cell cultures were exposed to peroxynitrite (ONOO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;), and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Our findings demonstrated a phenotypic control of the neuronal antioxidative response, specific to manganese O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; dismutase (MnSOD). DA neurons had increased levels of MnSOD, equal levels of peroxiredoxin 5 (PRDX5), decreased oxidative stress markers 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and 4-HNE and decreased neuronal death detected by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release after 24 h, and higher oxidative stress levels by CellROX than PVG after 2 h. It is possible that DA neurons had a phenotypic adaptation to a fiercer inflammatory environment. ONOO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; was confirmed as the most powerful oxidative damage mediator, while 4-HNE caused few oxidative effects. Inducible NO synthase (iNOS) was not induced, suggesting that inflammatory, while not oxidative stimulation was required. These findings indicate that phenotypic antioxidative regulation affects the secondary inflammation, which should be considered in future individualized treatments and when evaluating antioxidative pharmacological interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Common Sense in Choice: The Effect of Sensory Modality on Neural Value Representations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0346-17.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Although it is well established that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) represents value using a common currency across categories of rewards, it is unknown whether the vmPFC represents value irrespective of the sensory modality in which alternatives are presented. In the current study, male and female human subjects completed a decision-making task while their neural activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging. On each trial, subjects chose between a safe alternative and a lottery, which was presented visually or aurally. A univariate conjunction analysis revealed that the anterior portion of the vmPFC tracks subjective value irrespective of the sensory modality. Using a novel cross-modality multivariate classifier, we were able to decode auditory value based on visual trials and vice versa. In addition, we found that the visual and auditory sensory cortices, which were identified using functional localizers, are also sensitive to the value of stimuli, albeit in a modality-specific manner. Whereas both primary and higher-order auditory cortices represented auditory subjective value, only a higher-order visual area represented visual subjective value. These findings expand our understanding of the Common Currency Network of the brain, and shed a new light on the interplay between sensory and value information processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Whether auditory information has the same impact on the value system as visual information is unknown. This is striking, given that we live in a multimodal world, and decision-making relies on evidence from all of our senses. It is well-known that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) represents value in an abstract and common manner, which allows comparison between different options. We examined whether this representation is sensitive to the sensory modality in which options are presented. Using fMRI and a risk-evaluating task, we show that whereas sensory cortices represent value of options in a modality-specific way, the vmPFC represents value irrespective of sensory modality. This brings our understanding of the neural value system closer to choices in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dopaminergic Drug Effects on Probability Weighting during Risky Decision-Making</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0330-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0330-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Dopamine has been associated with risky decision-making, as well as with pathological gambling, a behavioural addiction characterized by excessive risk-taking behaviour. However, the specific mechanisms through which dopamine might act to foster risk-taking and pathological gambling remain elusive. Here we test the hypothesis that this might be achieved, in part, via modulation of subjective probability weighting during decision-making. Human healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 21) and pathological gamblers (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 16) played a decision-making task involving choices between sure monetary options and risky gambles both in the gain and loss domains. Each participant played the task twice, either under placebo or the dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist sulpiride, in a double-blind counter-balanced design. A prospect theory modelling approach was used to estimate subjective probability weighting and sensitivity to monetary outcomes. Consistent with prospect theory, we found that participants presented a distortion in the subjective weighting of probabilities, i.e. they overweighted low probabilities and underweighted moderate to high probabilities, both in the gain and loss domains. Compared with placebo, sulpiride attenuated this distortion in the gain domain. Across drugs, the groups did not differ in their probability weighting, although gamblers consistently underweighted losing probabilities in the placebo condition. Overall, our results reveal that dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonism modulates the subjective weighting of probabilities in the gain domain, in the direction of more objective, economically rational decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Dopamine has been implicated in risky decision-making and gambling addiction, but the exact mechanisms underlying this influence remain partly elusive. Here we tested the hypothesis that dopamine modulates subjective probability weighting, by examining the effect of a dopaminergic drug on risk-taking behavior, both in healthy individuals and pathologic gamblers. We found that selectively blocking dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors diminished the typically observed distortion of winning probabilities, characterized by an overweighting of low probabilities and underweighting of high probabilities. This made participants more linear in their subjective estimation of probabilities and thus more rational in their decision-making behavior. Healthy participants and pathologic gamblers did not differ in their risk-taking behavior, except in the placebo condition in which gamblers consistently underweighted losing probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Excitatory Neuronal Responses of Ca2+ Transients in Interstitial Cells of Cajal in the Small Intestine</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0080-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0080-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) regulate smooth muscle excitability and motility in the gastrointestinal tract. ICC in the deep muscular plexus (ICC-DMP) of the small intestine are aligned closely with varicosities of enteric motor neurons and thought to transduce neural responses. ICC-DMP generate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients that activate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activated Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; channels and generate electrophysiological responses. We tested the hypothesis that excitatory neurotransmitters regulate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in ICC-DMP as a means of regulating intestinal muscles. High-resolution confocal microscopy was used to image Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in ICC-DMP within murine small intestinal muscles with cell-specific expression of GCaMP3. Intrinsic nerves were stimulated by electrical field stimulation (EFS). ICC-DMP exhibited ongoing Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients before stimuli were applied. EFS caused initial suppression of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, followed by escape during sustained stimulation, and large increases in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients after cessation of stimulation. Basal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity and the excitatory phases of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses to EFS were inhibited by atropine and neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1) antagonists, but not by NK2 receptor antagonists. Exogenous ACh and substance P increased Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, atropine and NK1 antagonists decreased Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients. Neurokinins appear to be released spontaneously (tonic excitation) in small intestinal muscles and are the dominant excitatory neurotransmitters. Subcellular regulation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release events in ICC-DMP may be a means by which excitatory neurotransmission organizes intestinal motility patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are innervated by enteric motor neurons and thought to transduce neural responses in GI muscles. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, due to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release from Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; intracellular stores, mediate electrophysiological events in ICC by activation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; channels. Neural responses in ICC in the deep muscular plexus of the small intestine (ICC-DMP) were studied by confocal imaging of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in these cells. Excitatory neural input was due to cholinergic and peptidergic neurotransmitters (acetylcholine and neurokinins), as excitatory effects on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients were blocked by atropine and neurokinin receptor antagonists. Neurokinins are the dominant excitatory regulators of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in ICC-DMP. ICC-DMP are innervated by enteric motor neurons and mediate significant excitatory responses in intestinal muscles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Shared Functions of Perirhinal and Parahippocampal Cortices: Implications for Cognitive Aging</title>

	<description>A predominant view of perirhinal cortex (PRC) and postrhinal/parahippocampal cortex (POR/PHC) function contends that these structures are tuned to represent objects and spatial information, respectively. However, known anatomical connectivity, together with recent electrophysiological, neuroimaging, and lesion data, indicate that both brain areas participate in spatial and nonspatial processing. Instead of content-based organization, the PRC and PHC/POR may participate in two computationally distinct cortical–hippocampal networks: one network that is tuned to process coarse information quickly, forming gist-like representations of scenes/environments, and a second network tuned to process information about the specific sensory details that are necessary for discrimination across sensory modalities.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Hippocampus, Retrosplenial and Parahippocampal Cortices Encode Multicompartment 3D Space in a Hierarchical Manner</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy054</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Humans commonly operate within 3D environments such as multifloor buildings and yet there is a surprising dearth of studies that have examined how these spaces are represented in the brain. Here, we had participants learn the locations of paintings within a virtual multilevel gallery building and then used behavioral tests and fMRI repetition suppression analyses to investigate how this 3D multicompartment space was represented, and whether there was a bias in encoding vertical and horizontal information. We found faster response times for within-room egocentric spatial judgments and behavioral priming effects of visiting the same room, providing evidence for a compartmentalized representation of space. At the neural level, we observed a hierarchical encoding of 3D spatial information, with left anterior hippocampus representing local information within a room, while retrosplenial cortex, parahippocampal cortex, and posterior hippocampus represented room information within the wider building. Of note, both our behavioral and neural findings showed that vertical and horizontal location information was similarly encoded, suggesting an isotropic representation of 3D space even in the context of a multicompartment environment. These findings provide much-needed information about how the human brain supports spatial memory and navigation in buildings with numerous levels and rooms.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Measurements of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), recorded using electroencephalography during different phases of movement, have been fundamental in understanding the neurophysiological changes related to motor control. SEP recordings have also been used to investigate adaptive plasticity changes in somatosensory processing related to active and observational motor learning tasks. Combining noninvasive brain stimulation with SEP recordings and intracranial SEP depth recordings, including recordings from deep brain stimulation electrodes, has been critical in identifying neural areas involved in specific temporal stages of somatosensory processing.</description>
