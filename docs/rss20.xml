	<description>Plastids, the defining organelles of plant cells, undergo physiological and morphological changes to fulfill distinct biological functions. In particular, the differentiation of chloroplasts into chromoplasts results in an enhanced storage capacity for carotenoids with industrial and nutritional value such as beta-carotene (provitamin A). Here, we show that synthetically inducing a...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/Q6NV9Ftk4Og&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>In Arabidopsis thaliana, the METTL3 homolog, mRNA adenosine methylase (MTA) introduces N6-methyladenosine (m6A) into various coding and noncoding RNAs of the plant transcriptome. Here, we show that an MTA-deficient mutant (mta) has decreased levels of microRNAs (miRNAs) but accumulates primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs). Moreover, pri-miRNAs are methylated by MTA, and...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/e6ViIkc7Z2c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria regulates bioenergetics, apoptosis, and Ca2+ signaling. The primary pathway for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), a Ca2+-selective ion channel in the inner mitochondrial membrane. MCU-mediated Ca2+ uptake is driven by the sizable inner-membrane potential generated by the electron-transport chain.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms of infant development are far from understood. Learning about
one's own body is likely a foundation for subsequent development. Here we look
specifically at the problem of how spontaneous touches to the body in early
infancy may give rise to first body models and bootstrap further development
such as reaching competence. Unlike visually elicited reaching, reaching to own
body requires connections of the tactile and motor space only, bypassing
vision. Still, the problems of high dimensionality and redundancy of the motor
system persist. In this work, we present an embodied computational model on a
simulated humanoid robot with artificial sensitive skin on large areas of its
body. The robot should autonomously develop the capacity to reach for every
tactile sensor on its body. To do this efficiently, we employ the computational
framework of intrinsic motivations and variants of goal babbling, as opposed to
motor babbling, that prove to make the exploration process faster and alleviate
the ill-posedness of learning inverse kinematics. Based on our results, we
discuss the next steps in relation to infant studies: what information will be
necessary to further ground this computational model in behavioral data.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Quaternion space has brought several benefits over the traditional Euclidean
space: Quaternions (i) consist of a real and three imaginary components,
encouraging richer representations; (ii) utilize Hamilton product which better
encodes the inter-latent interactions across multiple Quaternion components;
and (iii) result in a model with smaller degrees of freedom and less prone to
overfitting. Unfortunately, most of the current recommender systems rely on
real-valued representations in Euclidean space to model either user's long-term
or short-term interests. In this paper, we fully utilize Quaternion space to
model both user's long-term and short-term preferences. We first propose a
QUaternion-based self-Attentive Long term user Encoding (QUALE) to study the
user's long-term intents. Then, we propose a QUaternion-based self-Attentive
Short term user Encoding (QUASE) to learn the user's short-term interests. To
enhance our models' capability, we propose to fuse QUALE and QUASE into one
model, namely QUALSE, by using a Quaternion-based gating mechanism. We further
develop Quaternion-based Adversarial learning along with the Bayesian
Personalized Ranking (QABPR) to improve our model's robustness. Extensive
experiments on six real-world datasets show that our fused QUALSE model
outperformed 11 state-of-the-art baselines, improving 8.43% at HIT@1 and 10.27%
at NDCG@1 on average compared with the best baseline.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is the most complex object of study we encounter today.
Mapping the neuronal-level connections between the more than 80 billion neurons
in the brain is a hopeless task for science. By the recent advancement of
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we are able to map the macroscopic
connections between about 1000 brain areas. The MRI data acquisition and the
subsequent algorithmic workflow contain several complex steps, where errors can
occur. In the present contribution, we describe and publish 1064 human
connectomes, computed from the public release of the Human Connectome Project.
Each connectome is available in 5 resolutions, with 83, 129, 234, 463, and 1015
anatomically labeled nodes. For error correction, we follow an averaging and
extreme value deleting strategy for each edge and for each connectome. The
resulting 5320 braingraphs can be downloaded from the
\url{https://braingraph.org} site. This dataset makes possible the access to
these graphs for scientists unfamiliar with neuroimaging- and
connectome-related tools: mathematicians, physicists, and engineers can use
their expertize and ideas in the analysis of the connections of the human
brain. Brain scientists also have a robust and large, multi-resolution set for
connectomical studies.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have been proposed over recent
years to create controllers to play multiple video games of different nature
and complexity without revealing the specific mechanics of each of these games
to the AI methods. In recent years, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) employing
rolling horizon mechanisms have achieved extraordinary results in these type of
problems. However, some limitations are present in Rolling Horizon EAs making
it a grand challenge of AI. These limitations include the wasteful mechanism of
creating a population and evolving it over a fraction of a second to propose an
action to be executed by the game agent. Another limitation is to use a scalar
value (fitness value) to direct evolutionary search instead of accounting for a
mechanism that informs us how a particular agent behaves during the rolling
horizon simulation. In this work, we address both of these issues. We introduce
the use of a statistical tree that tackles the latter limitation. Furthermore,
we tackle the former limitation by employing a mechanism that allows us to seed
part of the population using Monte Carlo Tree Search, a method that has
dominated multiple General Video Game AI competitions. We show how the proposed
novel mechanism, called Statistical Tree-based Population Seeding, achieves
better results compared to vanilla Rolling Horizon EAs in a set of 20 games,
including 10 stochastic and 10 deterministic games.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic computing describes the use of VLSI systems to mimic
neuro-biological architectures and is also looked at as a promising alternative
to the traditional von Neumann architecture. Any new computing architecture
would need a system that can perform floating-point arithmetic. In this paper,
we describe a neuromorphic system that performs IEEE 754-compliant
floating-point multiplication. The complex process of multiplication is divided
into smaller sub-tasks performed by components Exponent Adder, Bias Subtractor,
Mantissa Multiplier and Sign OF/UF. We study the effect of the number of
neurons per bit on accuracy and bit error rate, and estimate the optimal number
of neurons needed for each component.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A substantial amount of time and energy has been invested to develop machine
vision using connectionist (neural network) principles. Most of that work has
been inspired by theories advanced by neuroscientists and behaviorists for how
cortical systems store stimulus information. Those theories call for
information flow through connections among several neuron populations, with the
initial connections being random (or at least non-functional). Then the
strength or location of connections are modified through training trials to
achieve an effective output, such as the ability to identify an object. Those
theories ignored the fact that animals that have no cortex, e.g., fish, can
demonstrate visual skills that outpace the best neural network models. Neural
circuits that allow for immediate effective vision and quick learning have been
preprogrammed by hundreds of millions of years of evolution and the visual
skills are available shortly after hatching. Cortical systems may be providing
advanced image processing, but most likely are using design principles that had
been proven effective in simpler systems. The present article provides a brief
overview of retinal and cortical mechanisms for registering shape information,
with the hope that it might contribute to the design of shape-encoding circuits
that more closely match the mechanisms of biological vision.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To avoid disease, humans show far greater contamination sensitivity and
hygienic behaviour compared to our closest living relatives, likely due to our
increased propensity to experience disgust. While contemporary theories argue
disgust is a genetic adaptation, there is surprisingly little evidence to
support this claim. Here, we simulated 100 000 years of evolution in human
hunter-gatherers to test a wide variety of theoretical models. Our results
indicate that natural selection for monogenic or polygenic pathogen-avoidance
traits is plausible. However, the cultural inter-generational transmission of
such traits operated more quickly in realistic scenarios, and continued to work
even when artificially constrained. In the absence of reliable empirical data,
our computational work supports the hypothesis that cultural evolution outpaced
its biological counterpart to select health-improving behaviours that benefited
survival. This study serves not only as evidence of cultural evolution of the
behavioural immune system, but is also an illustration of emerging theories
that paint cognitive mechanisms as socially transmitted rather than
biologically hardwired functions.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural codes, represented as collections of binary strings called codewords,
are used to encode neural activity. A code is called convex if its codewords
are represented as an arrangement of convex open sets in Euclidean space.
Previous work has focused on addressing the question: how can we tell when a
neural code is convex? Giusti and Itskov identified a local obstruction and
proved that convex neural codes have no local obstructions. The converse is
true for codes on up to four neurons, but false in general. Nevertheless, we
prove this converse holds for codes with up to three maximal codewords, and
moreover the minimal embedding dimension of such codes is at most two.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) can automatically design the
architectures of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) using evolutionary computation
algorithms. It has been greatly witnessed by DNN researchers owing to the
promising performance of automatically designing the satisfied DNN
architectures. However, most ENAS algorithms require intensive computational
resource which is not necessarily available to each of the users interested.
Performance predictors are a type of regression models, can assist to
accomplish the search without much computational resource. Despite various
performance predictors have been designed, they employ the same training
protocol to build the regression models: 1) sampling a set of DNNs with
performance as the training dataset, 2) training the model with the mean square
error criterion, and 3) predicting the performance of DNNs newly generated
during the ENAS. In this paper, we point out that the three steps constituting
the training protocol are not reasonable through intuitive and illustrative
examples. Further, we propose a new training protocol to address the issues,
consisting of designing a pair-wise ranking indicator to construct the training
target, proposing to use the logistic regression to fit the training samples,
and developing a differential method to building the training instances. To
verify the effectiveness of the proposed training protocol, four widely used
regression models in the field of machine learning have been chosen to perform
the comparisons on two benchmark datasets. The experimental results of all the
comparisons demonstrate that the proposed protocol can significantly improve
the performance prediction accuracy against the traditional training protocol.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;-Background. Network neuroscience examines the brain as a complex system
represented by a network (or connectome), providing deeper insights into the
brain morphology and function, allowing the identification of atypical brain
connectivity alterations, which can be used as diagnostic markers of
neurological disorders. -Existing Methods. Graph embedding methods which map
data samples (e.g., brain networks) into a low dimensional space have been
widely used to explore the relationship between samples for classification or
prediction tasks. However, the majority of these works are based on modeling
the pair-wise relationships between samples, failing to capture their
higher-order relationships. -New Method. In this paper, inspired by the nascent
field of geometric deep learning, we propose Hypergraph U-Net (HUNet), a novel
data embedding framework leveraging the hypergraph structure to learn
low-dimensional embeddings of data samples while capturing their high-order
relationships. Specifically, we generalize the U-Net architecture, naturally
operating on graphs, to hypergraphs by improving local feature aggregation and
preserving the high-order relationships present in the data. -Results. We
tested our method on small-scale and large-scale heterogeneous brain
connectomic datasets including morphological and functional brain networks of
autistic and demented patients, respectively. -Conclusion. Our HUNet
outperformed state-of-the-art geometric graph and hypergraph data embedding
techniques with a gain of 4-14% in classification accuracy, demonstrating both
scalability and generalizability. HUNet code is available at
https://github.com/basiralab/HUNet.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Low level classification extracts features from the elements, i.e. physical
to use them to train a model for a later classification. High level
classification uses high level features, the existent patterns, relationship
between the data and combines low and high level features for classification.
High Level features can be got from Complex Network created over the data.
Local and global features are used to describe the structure of a Complex
Network, i.e. Average Neighbor Degree, Average Clustering. The present work
proposed a novel feature to describe the architecture of the Network following
a Ant Colony System approach. The experiments shows the advantage of using this
feature because the sensibility with data of different classes.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Time-series forecasting is one of the most active research topics in
predictive analysis. A still open gap in that literature is that statistical
and ensemble learning approaches systematically present lower predictive
performance than deep learning methods as they generally disregard the data
sequence aspect entangled with multivariate data represented in more than one
time series. Conversely, this work presents a novel neural network architecture
for time-series forecasting that combines the power of graph evolution with
deep recurrent learning on distinct data distributions; we named our method
Recurrent Graph Evolution Neural Network (ReGENN). The idea is to infer
multiple multivariate relationships between co-occurring time-series by
assuming that the temporal data depends not only on inner variables and
intra-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from itself) but also on outer
variables and inter-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from
other-selves). An extensive set of experiments was conducted comparing ReGENN
with dozens of ensemble methods and classical statistical ones, showing sound
improvement of up to 64.87% over the competing algorithms. Furthermore, we
present an analysis of the intermediate weights arising from ReGENN, showing
that by looking at inter and intra-temporal relationships simultaneously,
time-series forecasting is majorly improved if paying attention to how multiple
multivariate data synchronously evolve.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Statistical mechanics determines the abundance of different arrangements of
matter depending on cost-benefit balances. Its formalism and phenomenology
percolate throughout biological processes and set limits to effective
computation. Under specific conditions, self-replicating and computationally
complex patterns become favored, yielding life, cognition, and Darwinian
evolution. Neurons and neural circuits sit at a crossroads between statistical
mechanics, computation, and (through their role in cognition) natural
selection. Can we establish a {\em statistical physics} of neural circuits?
Such theory would tell what kinds of brains to expect under set energetic,
evolutionary, and computational conditions. With this big picture in mind, we
focus on the fate of duplicated neural circuits. We look at examples from
central nervous systems, with a stress on computational thresholds that might
prompt this redundancy. We also study a naive cost-benefit balance for
duplicated circuits implementing complex phenotypes. From this we derive {\em
phase diagrams} and (phase-like) transitions between single and duplicated
circuits, which constrain evolutionary paths to complex cognition. Back to the
big picture, similar phase diagrams and transitions might constrain I/O and
internal connectivity patterns of neural circuits at large. The formalism of
statistical mechanics seems a natural framework for thsi worthy line of
research.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;RNNs are popular dynamical models, used for processing sequential data. Prior
theoretical work in understanding the properties of RNNs has focused on models
with additive interactions, where the input to a unit is a weighted sum of the
output of the remaining units in network. However, there is ample evidence that
neurons can have gating - i.e. multiplicative - interactions. Such gating
interactions have significant effects on the collective dynamics of the
network. Furthermore, the best performing RNNs in machine learning have gating
interactions. Thus, gating interactions are beneficial for information
processing and learning tasks. We develop a dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT)
of gating to understand the dynamical regimes produced by gating. Our gated RNN
reduces to the classical RNNs in certain limits and is closely related to
popular gated models in machine learning. We use random matrix theory (RMT) to
analytically characterize the spectrum of the Jacobian and show how gating
produces slow modes and marginal stability. Thus, gating is a potential
mechanism to implement computations involving line attractor dynamics. The
long-time behavior of the gated network is studied using its Lyapunov spectrum,
and the DMFT is used to provide an analytical prediction for the maximum
Lyapunov exponent. We also show that gating gives rise to a novel,
discontinuous transition to chaos, where the proliferation of critical points
is decoupled with the appearance of chaotic dynamics; the nature of this
chaotic state is characterized in detail. Using the DMFT and RMT, we produce
phase diagrams for gated RNN. Finally, we address the gradients by leveraging
the adjoint sensitivity framework to develop a DMFT for the gradients. The
theory developed here sheds light on the rich dynamical behaviour produced by
gating interactions and has implications for architectural choices and learning
dynamics.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10227</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we demonstrate how the Nengo neural modeling and simulation
libraries enable users to quickly develop robotic perception and action neural
networks for simulation on neuromorphic hardware using familiar tools, such as
Keras and Python. We identify four primary challenges in building robust,
embedded neurorobotic systems: 1) developing infrastructure for interfacing
with the environment and sensors; 2) processing task specific sensory signals;
3) generating robust, explainable control signals; and 4) compiling neural
networks to run on target hardware. Nengo helps to address these challenges by:
1) providing the NengoInterfaces library, which defines a simple but powerful
API for users to interact with simulations and hardware; 2) providing the
NengoDL library, which lets users use the Keras and TensorFlow API to develop
Nengo models; 3) implementing the Neural Engineering Framework, which provides
white-box methods for implementing known functions and circuits; and 4)
providing multiple backend libraries, such as NengoLoihi, that enable users to
compile the same model to different hardware. We present two examples using
Nengo to develop neural networks that run on CPUs, GPUs, and Intel's
neuromorphic chip, Loihi, to demonstrate this workflow. The first example is an
end-to-end spiking neural network that controls a rover simulated in Mujoco.
The network integrates a deep convolutional network that processes visual input
from mounted cameras to track a target, and a control system implementing
steering and drive functions to guide the rover to the target. The second
example augments a force-based operational space controller with neural
adaptive control to improve performance during a reaching task using a
real-world Kinova Jaco2 robotic arm. Code and details are provided with the
intent of enabling other researchers to build their own neurorobotic systems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An active area of investigation in the search for quantum advantage is
Quantum Machine Learning. Quantum Machine Learning, and Parameterized Quantum
Circuits in a hybrid quantum-classical setup in particular, could bring
advancements in accuracy by utilizing the high dimensionality of the Hilbert
space as feature space. But is the ability of a quantum circuit to uniformly
address the Hilbert space a good indicator of classification accuracy? In our
work, we use methods and quantifications from prior art to perform a numerical
study in order to evaluate the level of correlation. We find a strong
correlation between the ability of the circuit to uniformly address the Hilbert
space and the achieved classification accuracy for circuits that entail a
single embedding layer followed by 1 or 2 circuit designs. This is based on our
study encompassing 19 circuits in both 1 and 2 layer configuration, evaluated
on 9 datasets of increasing difficulty. Future work will evaluate if this holds
for different circuit designs.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is always a hot and difficult point to improve the accuracy of
convolutional neural network model and speed up its convergence. Based on the
idea of small world network, a random edge adding algorithm is proposed to
improve the performance of convolutional neural network model. This algorithm
takes the convolutional neural network model as a benchmark, and randomizes
backwards and cross-layer connections with probability p to form a new
convolutional neural network model. The proposed idea can optimize the cross
layer connectivity by changing the topological structure of convolutional
neural network, and provide a new idea for the improvement of the model. The
simulation results based on Fashion-MINST and cifar10 data set show that the
model recognition accuracy and training convergence speed are greatly improved
by random edge adding reconstructed models with aprobability p = 0.1.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Geodesic distance on optimally regularized functional connectomes uncovers individual fingerprints. (arXiv:2003.05393v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05393</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05393</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional connectomes (FCs), have been shown to provide a reproducible
individual fingerprint, which has opened the possibility of personalized
medicine for neuro/psychiatric disorders. Thus, developing accurate ways to
compare FCs is essential to establish associations with behavior and/or
cognition at the individual-level. Canonically, FCs are compared using
Pearson\'s correlation coefficient of the entire functional connectivity
profiles. Recently, it has been proposed that the use of geodesic distance is a
more accurate way of comparing functional connectomes, one which reflects the
underlying non-Euclidean geometry of the data. Computing geodesic distance
requires FCs to be positive-definite and hence invertible matrices. As this
requirement depends on the fMRI scanning length and the parcellation used, it
is not always attainable and sometimes a regularization procedure is required.
In the present work, we show that regularization is not only an algebraic
operation for making FCs invertible, but also that an optimal magnitude of
regularization leads to systematically higher fingerprints. We also show
evidence that optimal regularization is dataset-dependent, and varies as a
function of condition, parcellation, scanning length, and the number of frames
used to compute the FCs. We demonstrate that a universally fixed regularization
does not fully uncover the potential of geodesic distance on individual
fingerprinting, and indeed could severely diminish it. Thus, an optimal
regularization must be estimated on each dataset to uncover the most
differentiable across-subject and reproducible within-subject geodesic
distances between FCs. The resulting pairwise geodesic distances at the optimal
regularization level constitute a very reliable quantification of differences
between subjects.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11443</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;For a biological agent operating under environmental pressure, energy
consumption and reaction times are of critical importance. Similarly,
engineered systems also strive for short time-to-solution and low
energy-to-solution characteristics. At the level of neuronal implementation,
this implies achieving the desired results with as few and as early spikes as
possible. In the time-to-first-spike-coding framework, both of these goals are
inherently emerging features of learning. Here, we describe a rigorous
derivation of learning such first-spike times in networks of leaky
integrate-and-fire neurons, relying solely on input and output spike times, and
show how it can implement error backpropagation in hierarchical spiking
networks. Furthermore, we emulate our framework on the BrainScaleS-2
neuromorphic system and demonstrate its capability of harnessing the chip's
speed and energy characteristics. Finally, we examine how our approach
generalizes to other neuromorphic platforms by studying how its performance is
affected by typical distortive effects induced by neuromorphic substrates.

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Quantitative Proteomics Reveals the Beneficial Effects of Low Glucose on Neuronal Cell Survival in an in vitro Ischemic Penumbral Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding proteomic changes in the ischemic penumbra are crucial to rescue those salvageable cells and reduce the damage of an ischemic stroke. Since the penumbra region is dynamic with heterogeneous cells/tissues, tissue sampling from animal models of stroke for the molecular study is a challenge. In this study, cultured hippocampal HT22 cells under hypoxia treatment for 17.5 h with 0.69 mM low glucose (H+LG) could mimic ischemic penumbral cells since they had much higher cell viability and viable cell number compared to hypoxia without glucose (H−G) treatment. To validate established cell-based ischemic penumbral model and understand the beneficial effects of low glucose (LG), quantitative proteomics analysis was performed on H+LG, H−G, and normoxia with normal 22 mM glucose (N+G) treated cells. We identified 427 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) between H−G and N+G and further identified 105 DAPs between H+LG and H−G. Analysis of 105 DAPs revealed that LG promotes cell survival by activating HIF1α to enhance glycolysis; preventing the dysregulations of extracellular matrix remodeling, cell cycle and division, and antioxidant and detoxification; as well as attenuating inflammatory reaction response, protein synthesis and neurotransmission activity. Our results demonstrated that this established cell-based system could mimic penumbral conditions and can be used for molecular studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Structural basis for the reaction cycle of DASS dicarboxylate transporters</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61350</link>
	<description>Citrate, α-ketoglutarate and succinate are TCA cycle intermediates that also play essential roles in metabolic signaling and cellular regulation. These di- and tricarboxylates are imported into the cell by the divalent anion sodium symporter (DASS) family of plasma membrane transporters, which contains both cotransporters and exchangers. While DASS proteins transport substrates via an elevator mechanism, to date structures are only available for a single DASS cotransporter protein in a substrate-bound, inward-facing state. We report multiple cryo-EM and X-ray structures in four different states, including three hitherto unseen states, along with molecular dynamics simulations, of both a cotransporter and an exchanger. Comparison of these outward- and inward-facing structures reveal how the transport domain translates and rotates within the framework of the scaffold domain through the transport cycle. Additionally, we propose that DASS transporters ensure substrate coupling by a charge-compensation mechanism, and by structural changes upon substrate release.</description>

	<title>eLife: Ordered dephosphorylation initiated by the selective proteolysis of cyclin B drives mitotic exit</title>

	<description>APC/C-mediated proteolysis of cyclin B and securin promotes anaphase entry, inactivating CDK1 and permitting chromosome segregation, respectively. Reduction of CDK1 activity relieves inhibition of the CDK1-counteracting phosphatases PP1 and PP2A-B55, allowing wide-spread dephosphorylation of substrates. Meanwhile, continued APC/C activity promotes proteolysis of other mitotic regulators. Together, these activities orchestrate a complex series of events during mitotic exit. However, the relative importance of regulated proteolysis and dephosphorylation in dictating the order and timing of these events remains unclear. Using high temporal-resolution proteomics, we compare the relative extent of proteolysis and protein dephosphorylation. This reveals highly-selective rapid proteolysis of cyclin B, securin and geminin at the metaphase-anaphase transition, followed by slow proteolysis of other substrates. Dephosphorylation requires APC/C-dependent destruction of cyclin B and was resolved into PP1-dependent categories with unique sequence motifs. We conclude that dephosphorylation initiated by selective proteolysis of cyclin B drives the bulk of changes observed during mitotic exit.</description>

	<title>eLife: Behavioural diversity of bonobo prey preference as a potential cultural trait</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59191</link>
	<description>The importance of cultural processes to behavioural diversity in our closest living relatives is central to revealing the evolutionary origins of human culture. However, the bonobo is often overlooked as a candidate model. Further, a prominent critique to many examples of proposed animal cultures is premature exclusion of environmental confounds known to shape behavioural phenotypes. We addressed these gaps by investigating variation in prey preference between neighbouring bonobo groups that associate and overlap space use. We find group preference for duiker or anomalure hunting otherwise unexplained by variation in spatial usage, seasonality, or hunting party size, composition, and cohesion. Our findings demonstrate that group-specific behaviours emerge independently of the local ecology, indicating that hunting techniques in bonobos may be culturally transmitted. The tolerant intergroup relations of bonobos offer an ideal context to explore drivers of behavioural phenotypes, the essential investigations for phylogenetic constructs of the evolutionary origins of culture.</description>

	<title>eLife: Extensive and spatially variable within-cell-type heterogeneity across the basolateral amygdala</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.59003</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59003</link>
	<description>The basolateral amygdala complex (BLA), extensively connected with both local amygdalar nuclei as well as long-range circuits, is involved in a diverse array of functional roles. Understanding the mechanisms of such functional diversity will be greatly informed by understanding the cell-type-specific landscape of the BLA. Here, beginning with single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified both discrete and graded continuous gene-expression differences within the mouse BLA. Via &lt;i&gt;in situ &lt;/i&gt;hybridization, we next mapped this discrete transcriptomic heterogeneity onto a sharp spatial border between the basal and lateral amygdala nuclei, and identified continuous spatial gene-expression gradients within each of these regions. These discrete and continuous spatial transformations of transcriptomic cell-type identity were recapitulated by local morphology as well as long-range connectivity. Thus, BLA excitatory neurons are a highly heterogenous collection of neurons that spatially covary in molecular, cellular, and circuit properties. This heterogeneity likely drives pronounced spatial variation in BLA computation and function.</description>

	<title>eLife: Structural basis for histone variant H3tK27me3 recognition by PHF1 and PHF19</title>

	<description>The PRC2 (Polycomb repressive complex 2) complex is a multi-component histone H3K27 methyltransferase, best known for silencing &lt;i&gt;Hox&lt;/i&gt; genes during embryonic development. The Polycomb-like proteins PHF1, MTF2 and PHF19 are critical components of PRC2 by stimulating its catalytic activity in embryonic stem (ES) cells. The Tudor domains of PHF1/19 have been previously shown to be readers of H3K36me3 &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. However, some other studies suggest that PHF1 and PHF19 co-localize with the H3K27me3 mark, but not H3K36me3 in cells. Here, we provide further evidence that PHF1 co-localizes with H3t in testis, and its Tudor domain preferentially binds to H3tK27me3 over canonical H3K27me3 &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Our complex structures of the Tudor domains of PHF1 and PHF19 with H3tK27me3 shed light on the molecular basis for preferential recognition of H3tK27me3 by PHF1 and PHF19 over canonical H3K27me3, implicating that H3tK27me3 might be a physiological ligand of PHF1/19.</description>

	<description>Vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) drives the vitamin K cycle, activating vitamin K-dependent blood clotting factors. VKOR is also the target of the widely used anticoagulant drug, warfarin. Despite VKOR’s pivotal role in coagulation, its structure and active site remain poorly understood. In addition, VKOR variants can cause vitamin K-dependent clotting factor deficiency or alter warfarin response. Here, we used multiplexed, sequencing-based assays to measure the effects of 2,695 VKOR missense variants on abundance and 697 variants on activity in cultured human cells. The large-scale functional data, along with an evolutionary coupling analysis, supports a four transmembrane domain topology, with variants in transmembrane domains exhibiting strongly deleterious effects on abundance and activity. Functionally constrained regions of the protein define the active site, and we find that, of four conserved cysteines putatively critical for function, only three are absolutely required. Finally, 25% of human VKOR missense variants show reduced abundance or activity, possibly conferring warfarin sensitivity or causing disease.</description>

	<description>Successful fertilization in angiosperms depends on the proper trajectory of pollen tubes through the pistil tissues to reach the ovules. Pollen tubes first grow within the cell wall of the papilla cells, applying pressure to the cell. Mechanical forces are known to play a major role in plant cell shape by controlling the orientation of cortical microtubules (CMTs), which in turn mediate deposition of cellulose microfibrils (CMFs). Here, by combining imaging, genetic and chemical approaches, we show that isotropic reorientation of CMTs and CMFs in aged Col-0 and &lt;i&gt;katanin1-5&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;ktn1-5&lt;/i&gt;) papilla cells is accompanied by a tendency of pollen tubes to coil around the papillae. We show that this coiled phenotype is associated with specific mechanical properties of the cell walls that provide less resistance to pollen tube growth. Our results reveal an unexpected role for KTN1 in pollen tube guidance on the stigma by ensuring mechanical anisotropy of the papilla cell wall.</description>

	<title>eLife: Activation of astrocytes in hippocampus decreases fear memory through adenosine A1 receptors</title>

	<description>Astrocytes respond to and regulate neuronal activity, yet their role in mammalian behavior remains incompletely understood. Especially unclear is whether, and if so how, astrocyte activity regulates contextual fear memory, the dysregulation of which leads to pathological fear-related disorders. We generated &lt;i&gt;GFAP-ChR2-EYFP&lt;/i&gt; rats to allow the specific activation of astrocytes in vivo by optogenetics. We found that after memory acquisition within a temporal window, astrocyte activation disrupted memory consolidation and persistently decreased contextual but not cued fear memory accompanied by reduced fear-related anxiety behavior. In vivo microdialysis experiments showed astrocyte photoactivation increased extracellular ATP and adenosine concentrations. Intracerebral blockade of adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Rs) reversed the attenuation of fear memory. Furthermore, intracerebral or intraperitoneal injection of A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R agonist mimicked the effects of astrocyte activation. Therefore, our findings provide a deeper understanding of the astrocyte-mediated regulation of fear memory, and suggest a new and important therapeutic strategy against pathological fear-related disorders.</description>

	<description>Perception depends on a complex interplay between feedforward and recurrent processing. Yet, while the former has been extensively characterized, the computational organization of the latter remains largely unknown. Here, we use magneto-encephalography to localize, track and decode the feedforward and recurrent processes of reading, as elicited by letters and digits whose level of ambiguity was parametrically manipulated. We first confirm that a feedforward response propagates through the ventral and dorsal pathways within the first 200 ms. The subsequent activity is distributed across temporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices, which sequentially generate five levels of representations culminating in action-specific motor signals. Our decoding analyses reveal that both the content and the timing of these brain responses are best explained by a hierarchy of recurrent neural assemblies, which both maintain and broadcast increasingly rich representations. Together, these results show how recurrent processes generate, over extended time periods, a cascade of decisions that ultimately accounts for subjects' perceptual reports and reaction times.</description>

	<description>The evolutionary forces shaping life history divergence within species are largely unknown. Turquoise killifish display differences in lifespan among wild populations, representing an ideal natural experiment in evolution and diversification of life history. By combining genome sequencing and population genetics, we investigate the evolutionary forces shaping lifespan among wild turquoise killifish populations. We generate an improved reference genome assembly and identify genes under positive and purifying selection, as well as those evolving neutrally. Short-lived populations from the outer margin of the species range have small population size and accumulate deleterious mutations in genes significantly enriched in the WNT signaling pathway, neurodegeneration, cancer and the mTOR pathway. We propose that limited population size due to habitat fragmentation and repeated population bottlenecks, by increasing the genome-wide mutation load, exacerbates the effects of mutation accumulation and cumulatively contribute to the short adult lifespan.</description>

	<title>eLife: Axonal mechanisms mediating γ-aminobutyric acid receptor type A (GABA-A) inhibition of striatal dopamine release</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.55729</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55729</link>
	<description>Axons of dopaminergic neurons innervate the striatum where they contribute to movement and reinforcement learning. Past work has shown that striatal GABA tonically inhibits dopamine release, but whether GABA-A receptors directly modulate transmission or act indirectly through circuit elements is unresolved. Here, we use whole-cell and perforated-patch recordings to test for GABA-A receptors on the main dopaminergic neuron axons and branching processes within the striatum of adult mice. Application of GABA depolarized axons, but also decreased the amplitude of axonal spikes, limited propagation and reduced striatal dopamine release. The mechanism of inhibition involved sodium channel inactivation and shunting. Lastly, we show the positive allosteric modulator diazepam enhanced GABA-A currents on dopaminergic axons and directly inhibited release, but also likely acts by reducing excitation from cholinergic interneurons. Thus, we reveal the mechanisms of GABA-A receptor modulation of dopamine release and provide new insights into the actions of benzodiazepines within the striatum.</description>

	<description>The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a specialized synapse that is the point of connection between motor neurons and skeletal muscle. Although developmental studies have established the importance of cell–cell communication at the NMJ for the integrity and full functionality of this synapse, the contribution of this structure as a primary driver in motor neuron disease pathogenesis remains uncertain. Here, we consider the biology of the NMJ and review emerging lines of investigation that are highlighting the importance of cell–cell interaction at the NMJ in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Computer-guided binding mode identification and affinity improvement of an LRR protein binder without structure determination</title>

Precise binding mode identification and subsequent affinity improvement without structure determination remain a challenge in the development of therapeutic proteins. However, relevant experimental techniques are generally quite costly, and purely computational methods have been unreliable. Here, we show that integrated computational and experimental epitope localization followed by full-atom energy minimization can yield an accurate complex model structure which ultimately enables effective affinity improvement and redesign of binding specificity. As proof-of-concept, we used a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein binder, called a repebody (Rb), that specifically recognizes human IgG&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (hIgG&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). We performed computationally-guided identification of the Rb:hIgG&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; binding mode and leveraged the resulting model to reengineer the Rb so as to significantly increase its binding affinity for hIgG&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; as well as redesign its specificity toward multiple IgGs from other species. Experimental structure determination verified that our Rb:hIgG&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; model closely matched the co-crystal structure. Using a benchmark of other LRR protein complexes, we further demonstrated that the present approach may be broadly applicable to proteins undergoing relatively small conformational changes upon target binding.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Wzv2JsLh9jY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Estimating the risk of species interaction loss in mutualistic communities</title>

Interactions between species generate the functions on which ecosystems and humans depend. However, we lack an understanding of the risk that interaction loss poses to ecological communities. Here, we quantify the risk of interaction loss for 4,330 species interactions from 41 empirical pollination and seed dispersal networks across 6 continents. We estimate risk as a function of interaction vulnerability to extinction (likelihood of loss) and contribution to network feasibility, a measure of how much an interaction helps a community tolerate environmental perturbations. Remarkably, we find that more vulnerable interactions have higher contributions to network feasibility. Furthermore, interactions tend to have more similar vulnerability and contribution to feasibility across networks than expected by chance, suggesting that vulnerability and feasibility contribution may be intrinsic properties of interactions, rather than only a function of ecological context. These results may provide a starting point for prioritising interactions for conservation in species interaction networks in the future.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VUTxJ8X8-Rk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Spastin depletion increases tubulin polyglutamylation and impairs kinesin-mediated neuronal transport, leading to working and associative memory deficits</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by André T. Lopes, Torben J. Hausrat, Frank F. Heisler, Kira V. Gromova, Franco L. Lombino, Timo Fischer, Laura Ruschkies, Petra Breiden, Edda Thies, Irm Hermans-Borgmeyer, Michaela Schweizer, Jürgen R. Schwarz, Christian Lohr, Matthias Kneussel&lt;/p&gt;

Mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule-severing protein spastin (spastic paraplegia 4 [SPG4]) cause hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), associated with neurodegeneration, spasticity, and motor impairment. Complicated forms (complicated HSP [cHSP]) further include cognitive deficits and dementia; however, the etiology and dysfunctional mechanisms of cHSP have remained unknown. Here, we report specific working and associative memory deficits upon spastin depletion in mice. Loss of spastin-mediated severing leads to reduced synapse numbers, accompanied by lower miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequencies. At the subcellular level, mutant neurons are characterized by longer microtubules with increased tubulin polyglutamylation levels. Notably, these conditions reduce kinesin-microtubule binding, impair the processivity of kinesin family protein (KIF) 5, and reduce the delivery of presynaptic vesicles and postsynaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. Rescue experiments confirm the specificity of these results by showing that wild-type spastin, but not the severing-deficient and disease-associated K388R mutant, normalizes the effects at the synaptic, microtubule, and transport levels. In addition, short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated reduction of tubulin polyglutamylation on spastin knockout background normalizes KIF5 transport deficits and attenuates the loss of excitatory synapses. Our data provide a mechanism that connects spastin dysfunction with the regulation of kinesin-mediated cargo transport, synapse integrity, and cognition.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qIyNCUbD91s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Sex Mediates Relationships Between Regional Tau Pathology and Cognitive Decline</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25878?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25878?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this study was to examine sex differences in tau distribution across the brain of older adults, using positron emission tomography (PET), and investigate how these differences might associate with cognitive trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were 343 clinically normal individuals (women, 58%; 73.8 [8.5] years) and 55 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; women, 38%; 76.9 [7.3] years) from the Harvard Aging Brain Study and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We examined &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐Flortaucipir (FTP)‐positron emission tomography (PET) signal across 41 cortical and subcortical regions of interest (ROIs). Linear regression models estimated the effect of sex on FTP‐signal for each ROI after adjusting for age and cohort. We also examined interactions between sex*Aβ‐PET positive / negative (+ / −) and sex*apolipoprotein ε4 (APOEε4) status. Linear mixed models estimated the moderating effect of sex on the relationship between a composite of sex‐differentiated tau ROIs and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women showed significantly higher FTP‐signals than men across multiple regions of the cortical mantle (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.007). β‐amyloid (Aβ)‐moderated sex differences in tau signal were localized to medial and inferio‐lateral temporal regions (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.007); Aβ + women exhibited greater FTP‐signal than other groups. APOEε4‐moderated sex differences in FTP‐signal were only found in the lateral occipital lobe. Women with higher FTP‐signals in composite ROI exhibited faster cognitive decline than men (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tau vulnerability in women is not just limited to the medial temporal lobe and significantly contributed to greater risk of faster cognitive decline. Interactive effects of sex and Aβ were predominantly localized in the temporal lobe, however, sex differences in extra‐temporal tau highlights the possibility of accelerated tau proliferation in women with the onset of clinical symptomatology.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Non‐Motor Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease are Reduced by Nabilone</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25864?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25864?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of nabilone, a synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol analogue, as a treatment for non‐motor symptoms (NMS) in Parkinson's disease (PD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a phase II placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, parallel‐group, enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal trial conducted at the Medical University Innsbruck. A random sample of 47 patients with PD with stable motor disease and disturbing NMS defined by a score of ≥4 points on the Movement Disorder Society ‐ Unified PD Rating Scale‐I (MDS‐UPDRS‐I) underwent open‐label nabilone titration (0.25 mg once daily to 1 mg twice daily, phase I). Responders were randomized 1:1 to continue with nabilone or switch to placebo for 4 weeks (phase II). The primary efficacy criterion was the change of the MDS‐UPDRS‐I between randomization and week 4. Safety was analyzed in all patients who received at least one nabilone dose.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between October 2017 and July 2019, 19 patients received either nabilone (median dose = 0.75 mg) or placebo. At week 4, mean change of the MDS‐UPDRS‐I was 2.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53 to 3.74, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002, effect size = 1.15) in the placebo versus 1.00 (95% CI −0.16 to 2.16, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.280, effect size = 0.42) in the nabilone‐group (difference: 1.63, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.18, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.030, effect size = 0.66). Seventy‐seven percent of patients had adverse events (AEs) during open‐label titration, most of them were transient. In the double‐blind phase, similar proportions of patients in each group had AEs (42% in the placebo group and 32% in the nabilone group). There were no serious AEs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results highlight the potential efficacy of nabilone for patients with PD with disturbing NMS, which appears to be driven by positive effects on anxious mood and night‐time sleep problems.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Possible routes of SARS‐CoV‐2 invasion in brain: In context of neurological symptoms in COVID‐19 patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24717?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24717?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manifestation of neurological symptoms in certain patients of coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) has warranted for their virus‐induced etiogenesis. SARS‐CoV‐2, the causative agent of COVID‐19, belongs to the genus of betacoronaviruses which also includes SARS‐CoV‐1 and MERS‐CoV; causative agents for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, respectively. Studies demonstrating the neural invasion of SARS‐CoV‐2 &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; are still scarce, although such characteristics of certain other betacoronaviruses are well demonstrated in the literature. Based on the recent evidence for the presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 host cell entry receptors in specific components of the human nervous and vascular tissue, a neural (olfactory and/or vagal), and a hematogenous—crossing the blood–brain barrier, routes have been proposed. The neurological symptoms in COVID‐19 may also arise as a consequence of the “cytokine storm” (characteristically present in severe disease) induced neuroinflammation, or co‐morbidities. There is also a possibility that, there may be multiple routes of SARS‐CoV‐2 entry into the brain, or multiple mechanisms can be involved in the pathogenesis of the neurological symptoms. In this review article, we have discussed the possible routes of SARS‐CoV‐2 brain entry based on the emerging evidence for this virus, and that available for other betacoronaviruses in literature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Sensitivity‐specificity of tau and Aβ PET in frontotemporal lobar degeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25893?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25893?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine associations between tau and amyloid‐beta (Aβ) molecular PET and both Alzheimer‐related pathology and 4‐repeat tau pathology in autopsy‐confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty‐four patients had [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]‐Flortaucipir PET and died with FTLD (progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) n = 10, corticobasal degeneration (CBD) n = 10, FTLD‐TDP n = 3 and Pick's disease n = 1). All but one had Pittsburgh Compound‐B (PiB) PET. Braak staging, Aβ plaque and neurofibrillary tangle counts and semi‐quantitative tau lesion scores were performed. Flortaucipir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated in a temporal meta‐region‐of‐interest (ROI), entorhinal cortex and cortical/subcortical regions selected to match the tau lesion analysis. Global PiB SUVR was calculated. Autoradiography was performed in one PSP patient, with digital pathology used to quantify tau burden.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine cases (37.5%) had Aβ plaques. Global PiB SUVR correlated with Aβ plaque count, with 100% specificity 50% sensitivity for diffuse plaques. Twenty‐one (87.5%) had Braak I‐IV. Flortaucipir correlated with neurofibrillary tangle counts in entorhinal cortex, but entorhinal and meta‐ROI SUVR were not elevated in Braak IV or primary age‐related tauopathy. Flortaucipir uptake patterns differed across FTLD pathologies and could separate PSP and CBD. Flortaucipir correlated with tau lesion score in red nucleus and midbrain tegmentum across patients, but not in cortical or basal ganglia regions. Autoradiography demonstrated minimal uptake of flortaucipir, although flortaucipir correlated with quantitative tau burden across regions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular PET shows expected correlations with Alzheimer‐related pathology but lacks sensitivity to detect mild pathology in FTLD. Regional flortaucipir uptake was able to separate CBD and PSP.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Functional Connectivity Decreases with Metabolic Stress in Sickle Cell Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25891?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25891?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children with sickle cell disease experience cognitive deficits even when unaffected by stroke. Using functional connectivity MRI as a potential biomarker of cognitive function, we tested our hypothesis that children with sickle cell disease would have decreased functional connectivity, and that children experiencing the greatest metabolic stress, indicated by elevated oxygen extraction fraction, would have the lowest connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prospectively obtained brain MRIs and cognitive testing in healthy controls and children with sickle cell disease.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyzed data from 60 participants (20 controls, 40 sickle cell disease). There was no difference in global cognition or cognitive subdomains between cohorts. However, we found decreased functional connectivity within the sensory‐motor, lateral sensory‐motor, auditory, salience and subcortical networks in participants with sickle cell disease compared to controls. Further, as white matter oxygen extraction fraction increased, connectivity within the visual (p = 0.008, parameter estimate [95% CI] = ‐0.760 [‐1.297, ‐0.224]), default mode (p = 0.012, parameter estimate [95% CI] = ‐0.417 [‐0.731, ‐0.104]), and cingulo‐opercular (p = 0.009, parameter estimate [95% CI] = ‐0.883 [‐1.517, ‐0.250]) networks decreased.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that there is diminished functional connectivity within these anatomically‐contiguous networks in children with sickle cell disease compared to controls, even when differences are not seen with cognitive testing. Increased white matter oxygen extraction fraction was associated with decreased connectivity in select networks. These data suggest that elevated oxygen extraction fraction and disrupted functional connectivity are potentially pre‐symptomatic neuroimaging biomarkers for cognitive decline in sickle cell disease.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The SNARE regulator Complexin3 is a target of the cone circadian clock</title>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25004?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The SNARE regulator Complexin3 is a target of the cone circadian clock&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d665f76e-4b1c-4cb1-b9db-ba03dd20bf59/cne25004-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complexin3 (CPLX3) is a SNARE regulator at ribbon synapses. Here, we show that the expression of CPLX3 is rhythmic at the synaptic terminal of cone photoreceptors with high values during the day and lower values at night. Silencing the circadian clock specifically in cones eliminates rhythmic expression of the protein in cone pedicles. Rhythmic expression of CPLX3 may modulate the synaptic transmission of cone signals to downstream retinal circuits between day and night.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMAL1 is a core component of the mammalian circadian clockwork. Removal of BMAL1 from the retina significantly affects visual information processing in both rod and cone pathways. To identify potential pathways and/or molecules through which BMAL1 alters signal transmission at the cone pedicle, we performed an RNA‐seq differential expression analysis between cone‐specific &lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt; knockout cones (cone‐&lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) and wild‐type (WT) cones. We found 88 genes differentially expressed. Among these, &lt;i&gt;Complexin3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cplx3&lt;/i&gt;), a SNARE regulator at ribbon synapses, was downregulated fivefold in the mutant cones. The purpose of this work was to determine whether BMAL1 and/or the cone clock controls CPLX3 protein expression at cone pedicles. We found that CPLX3 expression level was decreased twofold in cone‐&lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; cones. Furthermore, CPLX3 expression was downregulated at night compared to the day in WT cones but remained constitutively low in mutant cones both day and night. The transcript and protein expression levels of &lt;i&gt;Cplx4—&lt;/i&gt;the other complexin expressed in cones—were similar in WT and mutant cones; in WT cones, CPLX4 protein level did not change with the time of day. In silico analysis revealed four potential BMAL1:CLOCK binding sites upstream from exon one of &lt;i&gt;Cplx3&lt;/i&gt; and none upstream of exon one of &lt;i&gt;Cplx4&lt;/i&gt;. Our results suggest that CPLX3 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by the cone clock. The modulation of CPLX3 may be a mechanism by which the clock controls the cone synaptic transfer function to second‐order cells and thereby impacts retinal signal processing during the day/night cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce a novel framework to identify perception-action loops (PALOs)
directly from data based on the principles of computational mechanics. Our
approach is based on the notion of causal blanket, which captures sensory and
active variables as dynamical sufficient statistics -- i.e. as the &quot;differences
that make a difference.&quot; Moreover, our theory provides a broadly applicable
procedure to construct PALOs that requires neither a steady-state nor Markovian
dynamics. Using our theory, we show that every bipartite stochastic process has
a causal blanket, but the extent to which this leads to an effective PALO
formulation varies depending on the integrated information of the bipartition.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Immunohistological and Ultrastructural Study of the Inflammatory Response to Perforated Polyimide Cortical Implants: Mechanisms Underlying Deterioration of Electrophysiological Recording Quality</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00926</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The deterioration of field potential (FP) recording quality and yield by in vivo multielectrode arrays (MEA) within days to weeks of implantation severely limits progress in basic and applied brain research. The prevailing hypothesis is that implantation of MEA platforms initiate and perpetuate inflammatory processes which culminate in the formation of scar tissue (the foreign body response, FBR) around the implant. The FBR leads to progressive degradation of the recording qualities by displacing neurons away from the electrode surfaces, increasing the resistance between neurons (current source) and the sensing pads and by reducing the neurons’ excitable membrane properties and functional synaptic connectivity through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Meticulous attempts to causally relate the cellular composition, cell density, and electrical properties of the FBR have failed to unequivocally correlate the deterioration of recording quality with the histological severity of the FBR. Based on confocal and electron microscope analysis of thin sections of polyimide based MEA implants along with the surrounding brain tissue at different points in time after implantation, we propose that abrupt FP amplitude attenuation occurs at the implant/brain-parenchyma junction as a result of high seal resistance insulation formed by adhering microglia to the implant surfaces. In contrast to the prevailing hypothesis, that FP decrease occurs across the encapsulating scar of the implanted MEA, this mechanism potentially explains why no correlations have been found between the dimensions and density of the FBR and the recording quality. Recognizing that the seal resistance formed by adhering-microglia to the implant constitutes a downstream element undermining extracellular FP recordings, suggests that approaches to mitigate the formation of the insulating glial could lead to improved recording quality and yield.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: IL-33 Alleviated Brain Damage via Anti-apoptosis, Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress, and Inflammation After Epilepsy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Interleukin (IL)-33 belongs to a novel chromatin-associated cytokine newly recognized by the IL-1 family, and its specific receptor is the orphan IL-1 receptor (ST2). Cumulative evidence suggests that IL-33 plays a crucial effect on the pathological changes and pathogenesis of central nervous system (CNS) diseases and injuries, such as recurrent neonatal seizures (RNS). However, the specific roles of IL-33 and its related molecular mechanisms in RNS remain confused. In the present study, we investigated the protein expression changes and co-localized cell types of IL-33 or ST2, as well as the effect of IL-33 on RNS-induced neurobehavioral defects, weight loss, and apoptosis. Moreover, an inhibitor of IL-33, anti-IL-33 was performed to further exploited underlying mechanisms. We found that administration of IL-33 up-regulated the expression levels of IL-33 and ST2, and increased the number of its co-localization with Olig-2-positive oligodendrocytes and NeuN-positive neurons at 72 h post-RNS. Noteworthily, RNS-induced neurobehavioral deficits, bodyweight loss, and spatial learning and memory impairment, as well as cell apoptosis, were reversed by IL-33 pretreatment. Additionally, the increase in IL-1β and TNF-α levels, up-regulation of ER stress, as well as a decrease in anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and an increase in pro-apoptotic protein CC-3 induced by RNS are prevented by administration of IL-33. Moreover, IL-33 in combination with Anti-IL-33 significantly inverted the effects of IL-33 or Anti-IL-33 alone on apoptosis, ER stress, and inflammation. Collectively, these data suggest that IL-33 attenuates RNS-induced neurobehavioral disorders, bodyweight loss, and spatial learning and memory deficits, at least in part through mechanisms involved in inhibition of apoptosis, ER stress, and neuro-inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Dystrophin Is Required for the Proper Timing in Retinal Histogenesis: A Thorough Investigation on the mdx Mouse Model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00760</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00760</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal X-linked muscular disease caused by defective expression of the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin (Dp427). Selected autonomic and central neurons, including retinal neurons, express Dp427 and/or dystrophin shorter isoforms. Because of this, DMD patients may also experience different forms of cognitive impairment, neurological and autonomic disorders, and specific visual defects. DMD-related damages to the nervous system are established during development, suggesting a role for all dystrophin isoforms in neural circuit development and differentiation; however, to date, their function in retinogenesis has never been investigated. In this large-scale study, we analyzed whether the lack of Dp427 affects late retinogenesis in the mdx mouse, the most well studied animal model of DMD. Retinal gene expression and layer maturation, as well as neural cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, were evaluated in E18 and/or P0, P5, P10, and adult mice. In mdx mice, expression of Capn3, Id3 (E18-P5), and Dtnb (P5) genes, encoding proteins involved in different aspects of retina development and synaptogenesis (e.g., Calpain 3, DNA-binding protein inhibitor-3, and β-dystrobrevin, respectively), was transiently reduced compared to age-matched wild type mice. Concomitantly, a difference in the time required for the retinal ganglion cell layer to reach appropriate thickness was observed (P0–P5). Immunolabeling for specific cell markers also evidenced a significant dysregulation in the number of GABAergic amacrine cells (P5–P10), a transient decrease in the area immunopositive for the Vesicular Glutamate Transporter 1 (VGluT1) during ribbon synapse maturation (P10) and a reduction in the number of calretinin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) (adults). Finally, the number of proliferating retinal progenitor cells (P5–P10) and apoptotic cells (P10) was reduced. These results support the hypothesis of a role for Dp427 during late retinogenesis different from those proposed in consolidated neural circuits. In particular, Dp427 may be involved in shaping specific steps of retina differentiation. Notably, although most of the above described quantitative alterations recover over time, the number of calretinin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; RGCs is reduced only in the mature retina. This suggests that alterations subtler than the timing of retinal maturation may occur, a hypothesis that demands further in-depth functional studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The understanding of human and non-human microstructural brain alterations in the course of neurodegenerative diseases has substantially improved by the non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Animal models (including disease or knockout models) allow for a variety of experimental manipulations, which are not applicable to humans. Thus, the DTI approach provides a promising tool for cross-species cross-sectional and longitudinal investigations of the neurobiological targets and mechanisms of neurodegeneration. This overview with a systematic review focuses on the principles of DTI analysis as used in studies at the group level in living preclinical models of neurodegeneration. The translational aspect from in-vivo animal models toward (clinical) applications in humans is covered as well as the DTI-based research of the non-human brains' microstructure, the methodological aspects in data processing and analysis, and data interpretation at different abstraction levels. The aim of integrating DTI in multiparametric or multimodal imaging protocols will allow the interrogation of DTI data in terms of directional flow of information and may identify the microstructural underpinnings of neurodegeneration-related patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Perspective: Evolution of Control Variables and Policies for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson’s Disease Using Bidirectional Deep-Brain-Computer Interfaces</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A deep brain stimulation system capable of closed-loop neuromodulation is a type of bidirectional deep brain-computer interface (dBCI), in which neural signals are recorded, decoded, and then used as the input commands for neuromodulation at the same site in the brain. The challenge in assuring successful implementation of bidirectional dBCIs in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is to discover and decode stable, robust and reliable neural inputs that can be tracked during stimulation, and to optimize neurostimulation patterns and parameters (control policies) for motor behaviors at the brain interface, which are customized to the individual. In this perspective, we will outline the work done in our lab regarding the evolution of the discovery of neural and behavioral control variables relevant to PD, the development of a novel personalized dual-threshold control policy relevant to the individual’s therapeutic window and the application of these to investigations of closed-loop STN DBS driven by neural or kinematic inputs, using the first generation of bidirectional dBCIs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Action Real-Time Strategy Gaming Experience Related to Enhanced Capacity of Visual Working Memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00333</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Action real-time strategy gaming (ARSG)—a major genre of action video gaming (AVG)—has both action and strategy elements. ARSG requires attention, visual working memory (VWM), sensorimotor skills, team cooperation, and strategy-making abilities, thus offering promising insights into the learning-induced plasticity. However, it is yet unknown whether the ARSG experience is related to the development of VWM capacity. Using both behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measurements, this study tested whether ARSG experts had larger VWM capacity than non-experts in a change detection task. The behavioral results showed that ARSG experts had higher accuracy and larger VWM capacity than non-experts. In addition, the ERP results revealed that the difference wave of the contralateral delay activity (CDA) component (size 4–size 2) elicited by experts was significantly larger than that of non-experts, suggesting that the VWM capacity was higher in experts than in non-experts. Thus, the findings suggested that prolonged ARSG experience is correlative with the enhancement of VWM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Human Brain Dynamics Reflect the Correctness and Presentation Modality of Physics Concept Memory Retrieval</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human memory retrieval is the core cognitive process of the human brain whenever it is processing the information. Less study has focused on exploring the neural correlates of the memory retrieval of scientific concepts when presented in word and picture modalities. Fewer studies have investigated the differences in the involved brain regions and how the brain dynamics in these regions would associate with the accuracy of the memory retrieval process. Therefore, this study specifically focused on investigating the human brain dynamics of participants when they retrieve physics concepts in word vs. pictorial modalities, and whether electroencephalogram (EEG) activities can predict the correctness of the retrieval of physics concepts. The results indicated that word modality induced a significant stronger right frontal theta augmentation than pictorial modality during the physics concepts retrieval process, whereas the picture modality induced a significantly greater right parietal alpha suppression than the word modality throughout the retrieval process spurred by the physics concept presentations. In addition, greater frontal midline theta augmentation was observed for incorrect responses than the correct responses during retrieve physics concepts. Moreover, the frontal midline theta power has greater negative predictive power for predicting the accuracy of physics concepts retrieval. In summary, the participants were more likely to retrieve physics concepts correctly if a lower amount of theta were allocated during the maintaining period from 2,000 ms through 3,500 ms before making responses. It provides insight for our future application of brain computer interface (BCI) in real-time science learning. This study implies that the lower frontal midline theta power is associated with a lower degree of cognitive control and active maintenance of representations as participants approach a correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Effects of Physical Exercise on Cognition: How Heart Rate Variability Can Predict Cognitive Performances</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00312</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00312</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Investigate and identify the relationship between physical exercise and cognitive performance measured by using different cognitive tests taken from Cambridge Brain Science (CBS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Thirty subjects, divided into two groups (aerobic and effort), undergo twelve cognitive tests from CBS. A comparison between the pre- and post-exercise results in terms of cognitive performance differences is carried out. Regression analysis between Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features and CBS tests results is performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In most CBS tests, there is an improvement, or at least a confirmation, of the subject's cognitive ability, for both groups. Reasoning (80–100%), concentration (80–87%), and planning tests (93–100%) seem to undergo critical positive changes. The regression analysis, performed by using a set of different algorithms, has demonstrated that it is possible, by monitoring the HRV during the exercise, to predict to some extent the cognitive performance, i.e., the CBS tests results. The best performing regression algorithms are Simple Linear (Quade Test—aerobic group: 2.098, effort group: 3.350, both groups: 2.747) and REPTree (Quade Test—aerobic group: 2.955, effort group: 3.315, both groups: 3.121). The statistical analysis has proved that physical activity is statistically useful for the subjects in improving their cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This study has numerically appraised the improvement, the conservation, or the worsening on different aspects of cognition. The found mathematical relationship between physical exercise and cognitive performance suggests that it is possible to predict the beneficial effect of various exercises on executive and attentive control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Impact of Physical Obstacles on the Structural and Effective Connectivity of in silico Neuronal Circuits</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Scaffolds and patterned substrates are among the most successful strategies to dictate the connectivity between neurons in culture. Here, we used numerical simulations to investigate the capacity of physical obstacles placed on a flat substrate to shape structural connectivity, and in turn collective dynamics and effective connectivity, in biologically-realistic neuronal networks. We considered μ-sized obstacles placed in mm-sized networks. Three main obstacle shapes were explored, namely crosses, circles and triangles of isosceles profile. They occupied either a small area fraction of the substrate or populated it entirely in a periodic manner. From the point of view of structure, all obstacles promoted short length-scale connections, shifted the in- and out-degree distributions toward lower values, and increased the modularity of the networks. The capacity of obstacles to shape distinct structural traits depended on their density and the ratio between axonal length and substrate diameter. For high densities, different features were triggered depending on obstacle shape, with crosses trapping axons in their vicinity and triangles funneling axons along the reverse direction of their tip. From the point of view of dynamics, obstacles reduced the capacity of networks to spontaneously activate, with triangles in turn strongly dictating the direction of activity propagation. Effective connectivity networks, inferred using transfer entropy, exhibited distinct modular traits, indicating that the presence of obstacles facilitated the formation of local effective microcircuits. Our study illustrates the potential of physical constraints to shape structural blueprints and remodel collective activity, and may guide investigations aimed at mimicking organizational traits of biological neuronal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Alcohol Use Disorder, Neurodegeneration, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease: Interplay Between Oxidative Stress, Neuroimmune Response and Excitotoxicity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alcohol use disorder (AUD) has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Prolonged excessive alcohol intake contributes to increased production of reactive oxygen species that triggers neuroimmune response and cellular apoptosis and necrosis via lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial, protein or DNA damage. Long term binge alcohol consumption also upregulates glutamate receptors, glucocorticoids and reduces reuptake of glutamate in the central nervous system, resulting in glutamate excitotoxicity, and eventually mitochondrial injury and cell death. In this review, we delineate the following principles in alcohol-induced neurodegeneration: (1) alcohol-induced oxidative stress, (2) neuroimmune response toward increased oxidants and lipopolysaccharide, (3) glutamate excitotoxicity and cell injury, and (4) interplay between oxidative stress, neuroimmune response and excitotoxicity leading to neurodegeneration and (5) potential chronic alcohol intake-induced development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Illuminating and Sniffing Out the Neuromodulatory Roles of Dopamine in the Retina and Olfactory Bulb</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00275</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the central nervous system, dopamine is well-known as the neuromodulator that is involved with regulating reward, addiction, motivation, and fine motor control. Yet, decades of findings are revealing another crucial function of dopamine: modulating sensory systems. Dopamine is endogenous to subsets of neurons in the retina and olfactory bulb (OB), where it sharpens sensory processing of visual and olfactory information. For example, dopamine modulation allows the neural circuity in the retina to transition from processing dim light to daylight and the neural circuity in the OB to regulate odor discrimination and detection. Dopamine accomplishes these tasks through numerous, complex mechanisms in both neural structures. In this review, we provide an overview of the established and emerging research on these mechanisms and describe similarities and differences in dopamine expression and modulation of synaptic transmission in the retinas and OBs of various vertebrate organisms. This includes discussion of dopamine neurons’ morphologies, potential identities, and biophysical properties along with their contributions to circadian rhythms and stimulus-driven synthesis, activation, and release of dopamine. As dysregulation of some of these mechanisms may occur in patients with Parkinson’s disease, these symptoms are also discussed. The exploration and comparison of these two separate dopamine populations shows just how remarkably similar the retina and OB are, even though they are functionally distinct. It also shows that the modulatory properties of dopamine neurons are just as important to vision and olfaction as they are to motor coordination and neuropsychiatric/neurodegenerative conditions, thus, we hope this review encourages further research to elucidate these mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Blood Pressure in Different Dementia Disorders, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Subjective Cognitive Decline</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The aim of the study was to investigate whether blood pressure (BP) differed among people with different dementia diagnoses, mild cognitive impairment, and subjective cognitive decline and whether BP differences were observed across age and sex. Our study population comprised clinical data from 6,236 patients (53.5% women) aged 45–97 years (Mean = 73.9, SD = 9.6) referred to dementia assessment in 42 outpatient clinics across Norway during 2009–2019. Patients with the following diagnoses were included: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Vascular dementia (VaD), mixed AD and VaD, and dementia in Parkinson’s disease/Lewy body disease (PDD/LBD). For all diagnostic groups, SBP increased with age until about 80 years, after which it trended downward, whereas DBP declined after 60 years of age for all diagnostic groups. Patients aged 65 years and younger with SCD had lower SBP compared to AD patients at the same age, but SBP increased rapidly with increasing age, resulting in a substantially higher SBP at 80 + years compared with all other diagnostic groups. No other differences in SBP or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were found among patients with the different dementia diagnosis. Neither SBP nor DBP differed between MCI and AD groups. An interaction between age and gender was found for SBP at younger ages, as women started out with a lower pressure than men did but ended up with higher SBP.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Among 80+ patients, blood pressure did not differ as a function of the various dementia disorders. The SBP for the SCD patients of various age groups differed from all other diagnostic groups, indicating either that internal regulation of BP in older people is a risk factor for dementia or that brain damage causing dementia or MCI may led to changes in blood pressure. Brain aging seems to influence SBP differently in men and women.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gait disturbances are important clinical features of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) that increase the risk of falls and disability. Brain structural alterations and gait disturbances in CSVD patients have been well demonstrated. However, intrinsic resting cerebral function patterns in CSVD patients with gait disorders remain largely unknown. Fifty-eight CSVD patients were enrolled in our studies and categorized into the gait disorder group (CSVD-GD, n = 29) and no-gait disorder group (CSVD-NGD, n = 29) based on a gait examination. Gait was quantitatively assessed with the Timed Up and Go test and the intelligent device for energy expenditure and activity (IDEEA). Functional MRI and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) analyses were employed to explore local intrinsic neural oscillation alterations. Functional connectivity based on fALFF results was calculated to detect the potential changes in remote connectivity. Compared with the CSVD-NGD group, the CSVD-GD group showed decreased fALFF in regions mainly located in the sensorimotor network and frontoparietal network, such as the left supplementary motor area (SMA.L) and the left superior parietal gyrus, and increased fALFF in the right inferior frontal gyrus (orbital part), the left caudate, and the left precuneus. Moreover, the CSVD-GD patients exhibited lower connectivity between the SMA.L and temporal lobe, which was related to gait speed. The fALFF value of the SMA.L was associated with cadence. This study highlights the regional and network interaction abnormalities of the SMA in CSVD patients with gait disturbances. These findings could provide further insight into the neural mechanisms of gait disturbances in CSVD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: INPP5D expression is associated with risk for Alzheimer's disease and induced by plaque-associated microglia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.31.276444v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Background: Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, robust microgliosis, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss. Genome-wide association studies recently highlighted a prominent role for microglia in late-onset AD (LOAD). Specifically, inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase (INPP5D), also known as SHIP1, is selectively expressed in brain microglia and has been reported to be associated with LOAD. Although INPP5D is likely a crucial player in AD pathophysiology, its role in disease onset and progression remains unclear. Methods: We performed differential gene expression analysis to investigate INPP5D expression in LOAD and its association with plaque density and microglial markers using transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) data from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for Alzheimers Disease (AMP-AD) cohort. We also performed quantitative real-time PCR, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence assays to assess INPP5D expression in the 5xFAD amyloid mouse model. Results: Differential gene expression analysis found that INPP5D expression was upregulated in LOAD and positively correlated with amyloid plaque density. In addition, in 5xFAD mice, Inpp5d expression increased as the disease progressed, and selectively in plaque-associated microglia. Increased Inpp5d expression levels in 5xFAD mice were abolished entirely by depleting microglia with the colony-stimulating factor receptor-1 antagonist PLX5622. Conclusions: Our findings show that INPP5D expression increases as AD progresses, predominantly in plaque-associated microglia. Importantly, we provide the first evidence that increased INPP5D expression might be a risk factor in AD, highlighting INPP5D as a potential therapeutic target. Moreover, we have shown that the 5xFAD mouse model is appropriate for studying INPP5D in AD.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Severe childhood and adulthood stress associates with neocortical layer-specific reductions of mature spines in psychiatric disorders</title>

	<description>Severe stress exposure causes the loss of dendritic spines on cortical pyramidal neurons and induces psychiatric-like symptoms in rodent models. These effects are strongest following early-life stress and are most persistent on apical dendrites. However, the long-term impacts and temporal effects of stress exposure on the human brain remain poorly understood. Using a novel postmortem cohort of psychiatric cases with severe stress experienced in childhood, adulthood, or no severe stress, and matched controls, we aimed to determine the impact of stress timing on pyramidal neuron structure in the human orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). We performed Golgi Cox staining and manually measured the morphology and density of over 22,000 dendritic spines on layer-specific pyramidal neuron apical dendrites. We also quantified glucocorticoid receptor mRNA and protein as a marker of stress dysregulation. Both childhood and adulthood stress were associated with large reductions in mature mushroom spine density (up to 56% loss) in both the superficial (II/III) and deeper layers (V) of the OFC. However, childhood stress caused more substantial reductions to both total and mature spines. No difference in glucocorticoid receptor mRNA and protein were seen between groups, although both negatively correlated with total spine density within the whole cohort. These findings indicate that severe stress, especially when experienced during childhood, persistently affects the fine morphological properties of neurons in the human OFC. This may impact on cell connectivity in this brain area, and at least partly explain the social and emotional symptoms that originate in the OFC in psychiatric disorders.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: An arousal gated visual circuit controls pursuit during Drosophila courtship</title>

	<description>Long-lasting internal states, like hunger, aggression, and sexual arousal, pattern ongoing behavior by defining how the sensory world is translated to specific actions that subserve the needs of an animal. Yet how enduring internal states shape sensory processing or behavior has remained unclear. In Drosophila, male flies will perform a lengthy and elaborate courtship ritual, triggered by activation of sexually-dimorphic P1 neurons, in which they faithfully follow and sing to a female. Here, by recording from males as they actively court a fictive 'female' in a virtual environment, we gain insight into how the salience of female visual cues is transformed by a male's internal arousal state to give rise to persistent courtship pursuit. We reveal that the gain of LC10a visual projection neurons is strongly increased during courtship, enhancing their sensitivity to moving targets. A simple network model based on the LC10a circuit accurately predicts a male's tracking of a female over hundreds of seconds, underscoring that LC10a visual signals, once released by P1-mediated arousal, become coupled to motor pathways to deterministically control his visual pursuit. Furthermore, we find that P1 neuron activity correlates with fluctuations in the intensity of a male's pursuit, and that their acute activation is sufficient to boost the gain of the LC10 pathways. Together, these results reveal how alterations in a male's internal arousal state can dynamically modulate the propagation of visual signals through a high-fidelity visuomotor circuit to guide his moment-to-moment performance of courtship.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Corticospinal neurons encode complex motor signals that are broadcast to dichotomous striatal circuits</title>

	<description>Sensorimotor cortex controls movement in part through direct projections to the spinal cord. Here we show that these corticospinal neurons (CSNs) possess axon collaterals that innervate many supraspinal brain regions critical for motor control, most prominently the main input to the basal ganglia, the striatum. Corticospinal neurons that innervate the striatum form more synapses on D1- than D2-striatal projection neurons (SPNs). This biased innervation strategy corresponds to functionally distinct patterns of termination in spinal cord. CSNs are strongly driven during a striatum-dependent sequential forelimb behavior, and often represent high level movement features that are not linearly related to kinematic output. Copies of these activity patterns are relayed in a balanced fashion to both D1 and D2 projection pathways. These results reveal a circuit logic by which motor cortex corticospinal neurons relay both kinematic-related and unrelated signals to distinct striatal and spinal cord pathways, where postsynaptic connectivity ultimately dictates motor specificity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Morphological and biochemical repercussions of Toxoplasma gondii infection in a 3D human brain neurospheres model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.31.274985v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.31.274985v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Toxoplasmosis is caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii that can infect the central nervous system (CNS), promoting neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, neurotransmitter imbalance and behavioral alterations. T. gondii infection is also related to neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. The pathogenicity and inflammatory response in rodents are different to the case of humans, compromising the correlation between the behavioral alterations and physiological modifications observed in the disease. In the present work we used BrainSpheres, a 3D CNS model derived from human pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), to investigate the morphological and biochemical repercussions of T. gondii infection in human neural cells. Methods: We evaluated T. gondii ME49 strain proliferation and cyst formation in both 2D cultured human neural cells and BrainSpheres. Aspects of cell morphology, ultrastructure, viability, gene expression of neural phenotype markers, as well as secretion of inflammatory mediators were evaluated for 2 and 4 weeks post infection in BrainSpheres. Results: T. gondii can infect BrainSpheres, proliferating and inducing cysts formation, neural cell death, alteration in neural gene expression and triggering the release of several inflammatory mediator. Conclusions: BrainSpheres reproduce many aspects of T. gondii infection in human CNS, constituting a useful model to study the neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation mediated by the parasite. In addition, BrainSpheres can be an important tool for better understanding the possible correlation between psychiatric disorders and human CNS infection with T. gondii.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Singing-related reorganization of the song motor circuit is accompanied by a shift in hormonal modulation of song</title>

	<description>Sex hormones are essential modulators of birdsong. Testosterone, and its active androgenic and estrogenic metabolites, 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and estradiol, can re-shape the brain circuits responsible for song learning and production. The differential mechanisms of action of these different hormones during song development and song maintenance are, nonetheless, not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that unlike testosterone, DHT treatment does not induce singing behavior in naive adult female canaries that have never previously produced song. However, in birds with previous testosterone-induced singing experience, DHT alone is enough to promote the re-acquisition of high quality songs, even after months of silence. In addition, we show that the synaptic reorganization that accompanies vocal motor skill development requires more than DHT-induced androgen receptor activation. These results indicate that vocal motor practice will persistently modify the hormone-sensitive brain circuit responsible for song production, suggesting a mechanistic differentiation in the hormone-dependent regulation of the initial vocal motor skill acquisition and later re-acquisition.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Somatosensory Cortex of Macaque Monkeys is Designed for Opposable Thumb</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.31.261115v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The evolution of opposable thumb has enabled fine grasping ability and precision grip, which led to the capacity for fine manipulation of objects and refined tool use. Since tactile inputs to an opposable thumb are often spatially and temporally out of synch with inputs from the fingers, we hypothesized that inputs from the opposable thumb would be processed in an independent module in the primary somatosensory cortex (area 3b). Here we show that in area 3b of macaque monkeys, most neurons in the thumb representation do not respond to tactile stimulation of other digits and receive few intrinsic cortical inputs from other digits. However, neurons in the representations of other digits respond to touch on any of the four digits and are significantly more interconnected in the cortex. The thumb inputs are thus processed in an independent module, whereas there is significantly more inter-digital information exchange between the other digits. This cortical organization reflects behavioral use of the hand with an opposable thumb.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: APOE2 promotes longevity independent of Alzheimer's disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.31.255141v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.31.255141v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Objective: Although apolipoprotein E (APOE) allele associates with longevity, its mechanism is not understood. The protective effects of APOE2 and the deleterious effects of APOE4 on Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk may confound APOE effects on longevity. Methods: We analyzed a large number of subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), and animal models expressing human apoE isoforms in the absence of AD. Results: Clinically, the APOE2 allele was associated with longer lifespan, while APOE4 associated with shorter lifespan, compared to the common APOE3 allele. This effect was also seen irrespective of clinical AD status, and in subjects with little amyloid pathology or after adjustment for AD-related pathologies. In animal studies, apoE2-TR mice also exhibited longer lifespan, while apoE4 showed some trends of shorter lifespan. Notably, old apoE2-TR mice kept activity measured by open field assay, associated with longer lifespan. Evidence of preserved activity in APOE2 carrier was also obtained in clinical records. In animal studies, higher levels of apoE2 in brain and plasma were correlated with activity. Moreover, lower levels of total cholesterol in the brain and higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides in the plasma of apoE2-TR mice were associated with apoE levels and more activity. Interpretation: APOE2 can contribute to longevity independent of AD. Preserved activity would be an early-observable feature of apoE2-mediated longevity, where higher levels of apoE2 and its-associated lipid metabolism might be involved.</description>

	<description>We study a model for a network of synaptically coupled, excitable neurons to identify the role of coupling delays in generating different network behaviors. The network consists of two distinct populations, each of which contains one excitatory-inhibitory neuron pair. The two pairs are coupled via delayed synaptic coupling between the excitatory neurons, while each inhibitory neuron is connected only to the corresponding excitatory neuron in the same population. We show that multiple equilibria can exist depending on the strength of the excitatory coupling between the populations. We conduct linear stability analysis of the equilibria and derive necessary conditions for delay-induced Hopf bifurcation. We show that these can induce two qualitatively different phase-locked behaviors, with the type of behavior determined by the sizes of the coupling delays. Numerical bifurcation analysis and simulations supplement and confirm our analytical results. Our work shows that the resting equilibrium point is unaffected by the coupling, thus the network exhibits bistability between a rest state and an oscillatory state. This may help understand how rhythms spontaneously arise neuronal networks.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Feedback from retinal ganglion cells to the inner retina</title>

	<description>Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are thought to be strictly postsynaptic within the retina. They carry visual signals from the eye to the brain, but do not make chemical synapses onto other retinal neurons. Nevertheless, they form gap junctions with other RGCs and amacrine cells, providing possibilities for RGC signals to feed back into the inner retina. Here we identified such feedback circuitry in the salamander and mouse retinas. First, using biologically inspired circuit models, we found mutual inhibition among RGCs of the same type. We then experimentally determined that this effect is mediated by gap junctions with amacrine cells. Finally, we found that this negative feedback lowers RGC visual response gain without affecting feature selectivity. The principal neurons of the retina therefore participate in a recurrent circuit much as those in other brain areas, not being a mere collector of retinal signals, but are actively involved in visual computations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Trunk Control during Gait: Walking with Wide and Narrow Step Widths Present Distinct Challenges</title>

	<description>The active control of the trunk plays an important role in frontal plane gait stability. We characterized trunk control in response to different step widths using a novel feedback system and examined the different effects of wide and narrow step widths as they each present unique task demands. Twenty healthy young adults walked on a treadmill at 1.25 m/s at five prescribed step widths: 0.33, 1.67, 1, 1.33, 1.67 times preferred step width. Motion capture was used to record trunk kinematics, and surface electromyography was used to record longissimus muscle activation bilaterally. Vector coding was used to analyze coordination between pelvis and thorax segments of the trunk. Results showed that while center of mass only varied across step width in the mediolateral direction, trunk kinematics in all three planes were affected by changes in step width. Angular excursions of the trunk segments increased only with wider widths in the transverse plane. Thorax-pelvis kinematic coordination was affected more by wider widths in transverse plane and by narrower widths in the frontal plane. Peak longissimus activation and bilateral co-activation increased as step widths became narrower. As a control task, walking with varied step widths is not simply a continuum of adjustments from narrow to wide. Rather, narrowing step width and widening step width from the preferred width represent distinct control challenges that are managed in different ways. This study provides foundation for future investigations on the trunk during gait in different populations.</description>

	<description>The mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1) processes tactile sensory information and is the largest neocortex area emphasizing the importance of this sensory modality for rodent behavior. Most of our knowledge regarding information processing in S1 stems from studies of the whisker-related barrel cortex (S1-BC), yet the processing of tactile inputs from the hind-paws is poorly understood. We used in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) of the S1 hind-paw (S1-HP) region of anaesthetized wild type (WT) mice to investigate their evoked sub- and supra-threshold activity, intrinsic properties, and spontaneous activity. Approximately 45% of these L2/3 PNs responded to brief contralateral HP stimulation in a subthreshold manner, ~5% fired action potentials, and ~50% of L2/3 PNs did not respond at all. The evoked subthreshold responses had long onset- (~23 ms) and peak-latencies (~61 ms). The majority (86%) of these L2/3 PNs responded to prolonged (stance-like) HP stimulation with both on- and off-responses. HP stimulation responsive L2/3 PNs had a greater intrinsic excitability compared to non-responsive ones, possibly reflecting differences in their physiological role. Similar to S1-BC, L2/3 PNs displayed up- and down-states, and low spontaneous firing rates (~0.1 Hz). Our findings support a sparse coding scheme of operation for S1-HP L2/3 PNs and highlight both differences and similarities with L2/3 PNs from other somatosensory cortex areas.</description>

	<description>Background: Cervical dystonia is the most common of the adult-onset focal dystonias. Most cases are idiopathic. The current view is that cervical dystonia may be caused by some combination of genetic and environmental factors. Genetic contributions have been studied extensively, but there are few studies of other factors. Objective: To conduct an exploratory metabolomics analysis of cervical dystonia to identify potentially abnormal metabolites or altered biological pathways. Methods: Plasma samples from 100 cases with idiopathic cervical dystonia and 100 controls were compared using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Results: A total of 7,346 metabolic features remained after quality control, and 289 demonstrated significant differences between cases and controls, depending on statistical criteria chosen. Pathway analysis revealed 9 biological processes to be significantly associated at p&amp;lt;0.05, 5 pathways were related to carbohydrate metabolism, 3 pathways were related to lipid metabolism. Conclusion: This is the first large scale metabolomics study for any type of dystonia. The results may provide potential novel insights into the biology of cervical dystonia.</description>

	<description>Lifespan is modulated at distinct levels by multiple factors, including genetic backgrounds, the environment, behavior traits, the metabolic status, and more interestingly, the sensory perceptions. However, the effects of social perception between individuals living in the same space remain less clear. Here, we used the Drosophila model to study the influences of social perception on the lifespan of aged fruit flies. We found the mean lifespan of aged Drosophila is markedly prolonged after being co-housed with young adults of the same gender. Moreover, the changes of lifespan were affected by several experimental contexts: (1) the ratios of aged and young adults co-housed, (2) the chronological ages of two populations, and (3) the integrity of sensory modalities. Together, we hypothesize the chemical/physical stimuli derived from the interacting young adults are capable of interfering with the physiology and behavior of aged flies, ultimately leading to the alteration of lifespan.</description>

	<description>Cognitive control is supported by theta band (4-7Hz) neural oscillations that coordinate distant neural populations for task implementation. Task performance has been shown to depend on theta amplitude but a second critical aspect of theta oscillations, its peak frequency, has mostly been overlooked. Using modelling, behavioral and electrophysiological recordings, we show that theta oscillations adapt to task demands by shifting towards the optimal frequency.</description>

	<description>The visual cortex is organized hierarchically, but extensive recurrent pathways make it challenging to decipher the flow of information with single neuron resolution. Here, we characterize spiking interactions in populations of neurons from six interconnected areas along the visual hierarchy in awake mice. We generated multi-area, directed graphs of neuronal communication and uncovered two spatially-distributed functional modules. One module is positioned to transmit feedforward sensory signals along the hierarchy, while the other receives convergent input and engages in recurrent processing. The modules differ in layer and area distributions, convergence and divergence, and population-level temporal dynamics. These results reveal a neuronal-resolution cortical network topology in which distinct processing modules are interlaced across multiple areas of the cortical hierarchy.</description>

	<description>Cocaine binds to the dopamine transporter (DAT) in the striatum to regulate cocaine reward and seeking behavior. Zinc (Zn2+) also binds to the DAT, but the in vivo relevance of this interaction is unknown. We found that cocaine abuse in humans correlated with low postmortem striatal Zn2+ content. In mice, cocaine decreased striatal vesicular Zn2+ and increased striatal synaptic Zn2+ concentrations and Zn2+ uptake. Striatal synaptic Zn2+ increased cocaine's in vivo potency at the DAT and was required for cocaine-induced DAT upregulation. Finally, genetic or dietary Zn2+ manipulations modulated cocaine locomotor sensitization, conditioned place preference, self-administration, and reinstatement. These findings reveal new insights into cocaine's pharmacological mechanism of action and indicate that Zn2+ can serve as a critical environmentally derived regulator of human cocaine addiction.</description>

	<description>Mice require several days of training to master the water maze, a spatial memory task for rodents. The hippocampus plays a key role in the formation of spatial and episodic memories, a process that involves the activation of immediate-early genes such as cFos. We trained cFos-reporter mice in the water maze, expecting that consistent spatial behavior would be reflected by consistent cFos patterns across training episodes. Even after extensive training, however, different sets of dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells were activated every day. Suppressing activity in the original encoding ensemble helped mice to learn a novel platform position (reversal learning). Our results suggest that even in a constant environment, cFos+ ensembles in the dorsal DG segregate as a function of time, but become partially reactivated when animals try to access memories of past events.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: X-ray mediated scintillation increases synaptic activity via Cerium-doped LSO and Channelrhodopsin-2</title>

	<description>Optogenetics is a widely used tool for studying neural circuits. However, non-invasive methods for light delivery in the brain are needed to avoid physical damage typically caused by intracranial insertion of light guides. An innovative strategy could employ X-ray activation of radioluminescent particles (RLPs) to emit localized light. We previously reported that RLPs composed of cerium doped lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO:Ce), an inorganic scintillator that emits blue light, are biocompatible with neuronal function and synaptic transmission. However, little is known about the consequences of acute X-ray exposure on synaptic function and long-term plasticity. Furthermore, modulation of neuronal or synaptic function by X-ray induced radioluminescence from RLPs has not yet been demonstrated. Here we show that 30 minutes of X-ray exposure at a rate of 0.042 Gy/second caused no change in the strength of basal glutamatergic transmission during extracellular dendritic field recordings in mouse hippocampal slices. Additionally, long-term potentiation (LTP), a robust measure of synaptic integrity, was able to be induced after X-ray exposure and expressed at a magnitude not different from control conditions (absence of X-rays). This is important as synaptic plasticity is critical to learning and memory. Next, we used molecular and electrophysiological approaches to determine if X-ray dependent radioluminescence emitted from RLPs can activate light sensitive proteins. We found that X-ray stimulation of RLPs elevated cAMP levels in HEK293T cells expressing OptoXR, a chimeric opsin receptor that combines the extracellular light-sensitive domain of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) with an intracellular second messenger signaling cascade. This demonstrates that X-ray radioluminescence from LSO:Ce particles can activate OptoXR. Next, we tested whether X-ray activation of the RLPs can enhance synaptic activity in whole-cell recordings from hippocampal neurons expressing ChR2, both in cell culture and acute hippocampal slices. Importantly, X-ray radioluminescence caused an increase in the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in both systems, indicating activation of ChR2 and excitation of neurons. Together, our results show that X-ray activation of LSO:Ce particles can heighten cellular and synaptic function. The combination of LSO:Ce inorganic scintillators and X-rays is therefore a viable method for optogenetics as an alternative to more invasive light delivery methods.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: EEG Artifact to Signal: Predicting Horizontal Gaze Position from SOBI-DANS Identified Ocular Artifact Components</title>

	<description>Ocular artifact in EEG has long been viewed as a problem for interpreting EEG data in basic and applied research. The removal of such artifacts has been an on-going effort over many decades. We have recently introduced a hybrid method combining second-order blind identification (SOBI) with DANS, a novel automatic identification method, to extract components containing specifically signals associated with horizontal and vertical saccadic eye movements (H and V Comps) and found that these components' event-related potentials in response to saccadic eye movement are systematically modulated by movement directions and distances. Here in a case study, taking advantage of signals about gaze positions contained in the ocular artifact components, we introduced a novel concept of EEG-based virtual eye tracking (EVET) and presented its first prototype. Specifically, we determined (1) the amount of data needed for constructing models of horizontal gaze positions; (2) the asymptotic performance levels achieved with such models. We found that for the specific calibration task, 4 blocks of data (4 saccades per target position) are needed for reaching an asymptotic performance with a prediction accuracy of 0.44 and prediction reliability of 1.67. These results demonstrated that it is possible to track horizontal gaze position via EEG alone, ultimately enabling coregistration of eye movement and the neural signals.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Human Olfactory Perception is Sensitive to Temporal Information within a Single Sniff</title>

	<description>A sniff in humans typically lasts 1-2 seconds and is considered to produce a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the chemical environment that also sets the temporal resolution of olfactory perception. To examine whether the temporal order of events within a sniff influences the perceptual &quot;snapshot&quot;, we devised an apparatus that enabled us to phase-lock odor delivery to sniff onset and precisely manipulate onset asynchronies of odorants in humans. Psychophysical testing showed that participants were able to tell apart two odorants presented in the same or different order when the onset asynchrony was as low as 40 milliseconds. The performance improved with longer onset asynchronies and was not based on the molar ratio difference of the two odorants. Meanwhile, they were consistently at chance in reporting which odorant arrived first. These results provide behavioral evidence that human olfaction is sensitive to temporal patterns within a single sniff and indicate that timing of odor-evoked responses in relation to the sniff contributes to the perceived odor quality.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Comparison of transparency and shrinkage of insect brains using novel and traditional clearing methods</title>

	<description>Improvement of imaging quality has the potential to visualize previously unseen building blocks of the brain and is therefore one of the great challenges in neuroscience. Rapid development of new tissue clearing techniques in recent years have attempted to solve imaging compromises in thick brain samples, particularly for high resolution optical microscopy, where the clearing medium needs to match the refractive index of the objective immersion medium. These problems are exacerbated in insect tissue, where numerous (initially air-filled) tracheal tubes branching throughout the brain increase the scattering of light. To date, surprisingly few studies have systematically quantified the benefits of such clearing methods using objective transparency and tissue shrinkage measurements. In this study we compare a traditional and widely used insect clearing medium, methyl salicylate combined with permanent mounting in Permount ('MS/P') with several more recently applied clearing media that offer tunable refractive index (n): 2,2-thiodiethanol (TDE), 'SeeDB2' (in variants SeeDB2S &amp;amp; SeeDB2G matched to oil and glycerol immersion, n=1.52 &amp;amp; 1.47 respectively) and Rapiclear (also with n=1.52 &amp;amp; 1.47). We measured transparency and tissue shrinkage by comparing freshly dissected brains with cleared brains from dipteran flies, with or without addition of vacuum or ethanol pre-treatments (dehydration and rehydration) to evacuate air from the tracheal system. The results show that ethanol pre-treatment is very effective for improving transparency, regardless of the subsequent clearing medium, while vacuum treatment offers little measurable benefit. Ethanol pre-treated SeeDB2G and Rapiclear brains show much less shrinkage than using the traditional MS/P method. Furthermore, these newly developed media offer outstanding transparency compared to TDE and MS/P. Rapiclear protocols were less laborious compared to SeeDB2, but both offer sufficient transparency and refractive index tunability to permit super-resolution imaging of local volumes in whole mount brains from large insects, and even light-sheet microscopy. Although long-term permanency of Rapiclear stored samples remains to be established, our samples still showed good preservation of fluorescence after storage for more than a year at room temperature.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Idiosyncratic Tower of Babel: Individual differences in word meaning representation increase along abstractness</title>

	<description>Humans primarily rely on language to communicate, based on a shared understanding of the basic building blocks of communication: words. However, words also have idiosyncratic aspects of meaning. Do we mean the same things when we use the same words? Classical philosophers disagreed on this point, speculating that words have more similar meanings across individuals if they are either more experiential (John Locke) or more abstract (Bertrand Russell). Here, we empirically characterize the individual variation pattern of 90 words using both behavioral and neuroimaging measures. We show that the magnitude of individual meaning disagreement is a function of how much language or sensory experience a word associates with, and this variation increases with abstractness of a word. Uncovering the cognitive and neural origins of word meaning disagreements across individuals has implications for potential mechanisms to modulate such disagreements.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Representation of Color, Form, and their Conjunctionacross the Human Ventral Visual Pathway</title>

	<description>Despite decades of neuroscience research, our understanding of the relationship between color and form processing in the primate ventral visual pathway remains incomplete. Using fMRI multivoxel pattern analysis, this study examined the coding of color with both a simple form feature (orientation) and a mid-level form feature (curvature) in human early visual areas V1 to V4, posterior and central color regions, and shape areas in ventral and lateral occipito-temporal cortex. With the exception of the central color region (which showed color but not form decoding), successful color and form decoding was found in all other regions examined, even for color and shape regions showing univariate sensitivity to one feature. That said, all regions exhibited significant feature decoding biases, with decoding from color and shape regions largely consistent with their univariate preferences. Color and form are thus represented in neither a completely distributed nor a completely modular manner, but a biased distributed manner. Interestingly, coding of one feature in a brain region was always tolerant to changes in the other feature, indicating relative independence of color and form coding throughout the ventral visual cortex. Although evidence for interactive coding of color and form also existed, the effect was weak and only existed for color and orientation conjunctions in early visual cortex. No evidence for interactive coding of color and curvature was found. The predominant relationship between color and form coding in the human brain appears to be one of anatomical coexistence (in a biased distributed manner), but representational independence.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The Contribution of Brain Structural and Functional Variance in Predicting Age, Sex and Treatment</title>

	<description>Structural and functional neuroimaging have been widely used to track and predict demographic and clinical variables, including treatment outcomes. However, it is often difficult to directly establish and compare the respective weights and contributions of brain structure and function in prediction studies. The present study aimed to directly investigate respective roles of brain structural and functional indices, along with their contributions in the prediction of demographic variables (age/sex) and clinical changes of schizophrenia patients. The present study enrolled 492 healthy people from Southwest University Adult Lifespan Dataset (SALD) for demographic variables analysis and 42 patients with schizophrenia from West China Hospital for treatment analysis. We conducted a model fit test with two variables (one voxel-based structural metric and another voxel-based functional metric) and then performed a variance partitioning on the voxels that can be predicted sufficiently. Permutation tests were applied to compare the contribution difference between each pair of structural and functional measurements. We found that voxel-based structural indices had stronger predictive value for age and sex, while voxel-based functional metrics showed stronger predictive value for treatment. Therefore, through variance partitioning, we could clearly and directly explore and compare the voxel-based structural and functional indices on particular variables. In sum, for long-term change variable (age) and constant biological feature (sex), the voxel-based structural metrics would contribute more than voxel-based functional metrics; but for short-term change variable (schizophrenia treatment), the functional metrics could contribute more.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Inter-subject pattern analysis for multivariate group analysis of functional neuroimaging. A unifying formalization.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.28.272153v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Background and objective: In medical imaging, population studies have to overcome the differences that exist between individuals to identify invariant image features that can be used for diagnosis purposes. In functional neuroimaging, an appealing solution to identify neural coding principles that hold at the population level is inter-subject pattern analysis, i.e. to learn a predictive model on data from multiple subjects and evaluate its generalization performance on new subjects. Although it has gained popularity in recent years, its widespread adoption is still hampered by the blatant lack of a formal definition in the literature. In this paper, we precisely introduce the first principled formalization of inter-subject pattern analysis targeted at multivariate group analysis of functional neuroimaging. Methods: We propose to frame inter-subject pattern analysis as a multi-source transductive transfer question, thus grounding it within several well defined machine learning settings and broadening the spectrum of usable algorithms. We describe two sets of inter-subject brain decoding experiments that use several open datasets: a magneto-encephalography study with 16 subjects and a functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm with 100 subjects. We assess the relevance of our framework by performing model comparisons, where one brain decoding model exploits our formalization while others do not. Results: The first set of experiments demonstrates the superiority of a brain decoder that uses subject-by-subject standardization compared to state of the art models that use other standardization schemes, making the case for the interest of the transductive and the multi-source components of our formalization The second set of experiments quantitatively shows that, even after such transformation, it is more difficult for a brain decoder to generalize to new participants rather than to new data from participants available in the training phase, thus highlighting the transfer gap that needs to be overcome. Conclusion: This paper describes the first formalization of inter-subject pattern analysis as a multi-source transductive transfer learning problem. We demonstrate the added value of this formalization using proof-of-concept experiments on several complementary functional neuroimaging datasets. This work should contribute to popularize inter-subject pattern analysis for functional neuroimaging population studies and pave the road for future methodological innovations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Innate immune signaling and sex differences contribute to neurocognitive impairment, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial rewiring in a mouse model of Gulf War illness</title>

	<description>Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a chronic, multi-symptom disorder affecting approximately 30 percent of the nearly 700,000 veterans of the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Recent studies have revealed that GWI-related chemical (GWIC) exposure promotes immune activation and metabolic rewiring, which correlate with neurocognitive impairments and other symptoms of GWI. However, the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways linking GWIC to inflammation, metabolic alterations, and neurological symptoms remain unclear. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been documented in veterans with GWI and rodent models, and because mitochondria are key immune regulators, we hypothesized that alterations to mitochondria-immune crosstalk could contribute to the development of GWI-related symptoms. Here we show that acute exposure of murine macrophages to GWIC alters mitochondrial respiration and potentiates innate immune signaling and inflammatory cytokine secretion. Using an established mouse model of GWI, we report that neurobehavioral changes, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial protein rewiring are attenuated in mice lacking the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) and NOD-, LRR- or pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) innate immune pathways. Finally, we report sex differences in response to GWIC, with female mice showing more pronounced cognitive impairment, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial protein alterations in the brain compared to male mice. Our results provide novel information on sex differences in this model and suggest that STING and NLRP3 are key mediators of the cognitive impairment, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction observed in GWI.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Estimating the effect of a scanner upgrade on measures of grey matter structure for longitudinal designs</title>

	<description>Longitudinal imaging studies are crucial for advancing the understanding of brain development over the lifespan. Thus, more and more studies acquire imaging data at multiple time points or with long follow-up intervals. In these studies changes to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners often become inevitable which may decrease the reliability of the MRI assessments and introduce biases. We therefore investigated the difference between MRI scanners with subsequent versions (3 Tesla Siemens Verio vs. Skyra fit) on the cortical and subcortical measures of grey matter in 116 healthy, young adults using the well-established longitudinal FreeSurfer stream for T1-weighted brain images. We found excellent between-scanner reliability for cortical and subcortical measures of grey matter structure (intra-class correlation coefficient &amp;gt; 0.8). Yet, paired t-tests revealed statistically significant differences in at least 75% of the regions, with percent differences up to 5%, depending on the outcome measure. Offline correction for gradient distortions only slightly reduced these biases. Further, T1-imaging based quality measures systematically differed between scanners. We conclude that scanner upgrades during a longitudinal study introduce bias in measures of cortical and subcortical grey matter structure. Therefore, before upgrading a MRI scanner during an ongoing study, researchers should prepare to implement an appropriate correction method for these effects.</description>

	<description>Recent advancements in tissue clearing technologies have offered unparalleled opportunities for researchers to explore the whole mouse brain at cellular resolution. With the expansion of this experimental technique, however, a scalable and easy-to-use computational tool is in demand to effectively analyze and integrate whole-brain mapping datasets. To that end, here we present CUBIC-Cloud, a cloud-based framework to quantify, visualize and integrate whole mouse brain data. CUBIC-Cloud is a fully automated system where users can upload their whole-brain data, run analysis and publish the results. We demonstrate the generality of CUBIC-Cloud by a variety of applications. First, we investigated brain-wide distribution of PV, Sst, ChAT, Th and Iba1 expressing cells. Second, A{beta} plaque deposition in AD model mouse brains were quantified. Third, we reconstructed neuronal activity profile under LPS-induced inflammation by c-Fos immunostaining. Last, we show brain-wide connectivity mapping by pseudo-typed Rabies virus. Together, CUBIC-Cloud provides an integrative platform to advance scalable and collaborative whole-brain mapping.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The influence of temporal predictability on express visuomotor responses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.28.269449v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.28.269449v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Volitional visuomotor responses in humans are generally thought to manifest 100ms or more after stimulus onset. Under appropriate conditions, however, much faster target-directed responses can be produced at upper limb and neck muscles. These ''express'' responses have been termed stimulus-locked responses (SLRs) and are proposed to be modulated by visuomotor transformations performed subcortically via the superior colliculus. Unfortunately, for those interested in studying SLRs, these responses have proven difficult to detect consistently across individuals. The recent report of an effective paradigm for generating SLRs in 100% of participants appears to change this. The task required the interception of a moving target that emerged from behind a barrier at a time consistent with the target velocity. Here we aimed to reproduce the efficacy of this paradigm for eliciting SLRs and to test the hypothesis that its effectiveness derives from the predictability of target onset time as opposed to target motion per se. In one experiment, we recorded surface EMG from shoulder muscles as participants made reaches to intercept temporally predictable or unpredictable targets. Consistent with our hypothesis, predictably timed targets produced more frequent and stronger SLRs than unpredictably timed targets. In a second experiment, we compared different temporally predictable stimuli and observed that transiently presented targets produced larger and earlier SLRs than sustained moving targets. Our results suggest that target motion is not critical for facilitating the expression of an SLR and that timing predictability does not rely on extrapolation of a physically plausible motion trajectory. These findings provide support for a mechanism whereby an internal timer, probably located in cerebral cortex, primes the processing of both visual input and motor output within the superior colliculus to produce SLRs</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A Mitochondrial tRNA Mutation Causes Axonal CMT in a Large Venezuelan Family</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25854?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to identify the genetic cause for progressive peripheral nerve disease in a Venezuelan family. Despite the growing list of genes associated with Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease, many patients with axonal forms lack a genetic diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pedigree was constructed, based on family clinical data. Next‐generation sequencing of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was performed for 6 affected family members. Muscle biopsies from 4 family members were used for analysis of muscle histology and ultrastructure, mtDNA sequencing, and RNA quantification. Ultrastructural studies were performed on sensory nerve biopsies from 2 affected family members.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrodiagnostic testing showed a motor and sensory axonal polyneuropathy. Pedigree analysis revealed inheritance only through the maternal line, consistent with mitochondrial transmission. Sequencing of mtDNA identified a mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Val&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;mt‐tRNA&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Val&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;) gene, m.1661A&amp;gt;G, present at nearly 100% heteroplasmy, which disrupts a Watson–Crick base pair in the T‐stem‐loop. Muscle biopsies showed chronic denervation/reinnervation changes, whereas biochemical analysis of electron transport chain (ETC) enzyme activities showed reduction in multiple ETC complexes. Northern blots from skeletal muscle total RNA showed severe reduction in abundance of &lt;i&gt;mt‐tRNA&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Val&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;, and mildly increased &lt;i&gt;mt‐tRNA&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Phe&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;, in subjects compared with unrelated age‐ and sex‐matched controls. Nerve biopsies from 2 affected family members demonstrated ultrastructural mitochondrial abnormalities (hyperplasia, hypertrophy, and crystalline arrays) consistent with a mitochondrial neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identify a previously unreported cause of Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease, a mutation in the &lt;i&gt;mt‐tRNA&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Val&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;, in a Venezuelan family. This work expands the list of CMT‐associated genes from protein‐coding genes to a mitochondrial &lt;i&gt;tRNA&lt;/i&gt; gene. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Bornavirus Encephalitis Shows a Characteristic Magnetic Resonance Phenotype in Humans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25873?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25873?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of diagnosed fatal encephalitis cases in humans caused by the classical Borna disease virus (BoDV‐1) has been increasing, ever since it was proved that BoDV‐1 can cause human infections. However, awareness of this entity is low, and a specific imaging pattern has not yet been identified. We therefore provide the first comprehensive description of the morphology of human BoDV‐1 encephalitis, with histopathological verification of imaging abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an institutional review board‐approved multicenter study, we carried out a retrospective analysis of 55 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of 19 patients with confirmed BoDV‐1 encephalitis. Fifty brain regions were analyzed systematically (T1w, T2w, T2*w, T1w + Gd, and DWI), in order to discern a specific pattern of inflammation. Histopathological analysis of 25 locations in one patient served as correlation for MRI abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baseline imaging, acquired at a mean of 11 ± 10 days after symptom onset, in addition to follow‐up scans of 16 patients, revealed characteristic T2 hyperintensities with a predilection for the head of the caudate nucleus, insula, and cortical spread to the limbic system, whereas the occipital lobes and cerebellar hemispheres were unaffected. This gradient was confirmed by histology. Nine patients (47.4%) developed T1 hyperintensities of the basal ganglia, corresponding to accumulated lipid phagocytes on histology and typical for late‐stage necrosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BoDV‐1 encephalitis shows a distinct pattern of inflammation in both the early and late stages of the disease. Its appearance can mimic sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease on MRI and should be considered a differential diagnosis in the case of atypical clinical presentation.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Circulating Metabolites Differentiate Acute Ischemic Stroke from Stroke Mimics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25859?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25859?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early discrimination of patients with ischemic stroke (IS) from stroke mimics (SMs) poses a diagnostic challenge. The circulating metabolome might reflect pathophysiological events related to acute IS. Here, we investigated the utility of early metabolic changes for differentiating IS from SM.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed untargeted metabolomics on serum samples obtained from patients with IS (N = 508) and SM (N = 349; defined by absence of a diffusion weighted imaging [DWI] positive lesion on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) who presented to the hospital within 24 hours after symptom onset (median time from symptom onset to blood sampling = 3.3 hours; interquartile range [IQR] = 1.6–6.7 hours) and from neurologically normal controls (NCs; N = 112). We compared diagnostic groups in a discovery‐validation approach by applying multivariable linear regression models, machine learning techniques, and propensity score matching. We further performed a targeted look‐up of published metabolite sets.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levels of 41 metabolites were significantly associated with IS compared to NCs. The top metabolites showing the highest value in separating IS from SMs were asymmetrical and symmetrical dimethylarginine, pregnenolone sulfate, and adenosine. Together, these 4 metabolites differentiated patients with IS from SMs with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90 in the replication sample, which was superior to multimodal cranial computed tomography (CT; AUC = 0.80) obtained for routine diagnostics. They were further superior to previously published metabolite sets detected in our samples. All 4 metabolites returned to control levels by day 90.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A set of 4 metabolites with known biological effects relevant to stroke pathophysiology shows unprecedented utility to identify patients with IS upon hospital arrival, thus encouraging further investigation, including multicenter studies. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Microbes face intense competition in the natural world, and so need to wisely allocate their resources to multiple functions, in particular to metabolism. Understanding competition among metabolic strategies that are subject to trade-offs is therefore crucial for deeper insight into the competition, cooperation, and community assembly of microorganisms. In this work, we evaluate competing metabolic strategies within an ecological context by considering not only how the environment influences cell growth, but also how microbes shape their chemical environment. Utilizing chemostat-based resource-competition models, we exhibit a set of intuitive and general procedures for assessing metabolic strategies. Using this framework, we are able to relate and unify multiple metabolic models, and to demonstrate how the fitness landscape of strategies becomes intrinsically dynamic due to species-environment feedback. Such dynamic fitness landscapes produce rich behaviors, and prove to be crucial for ecological and evolutionarily stable coexistence in all the models we examined.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/swn6bAByPBQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Age‐related hearing loss: Why we need to think about sex as a biological variable</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24647?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has long been known that age‐related hearing loss (ARHL) is more common, more severe, and with an earlier onset in men compared to women. Even in the absence of confounding factors such as noise exposure, these sexdifferences in susceptibility to ARHL remain. In the last decade, insight into the pleiotrophic nature by which estrogen signaling can impact multiple signaling mechanisms to mediate downstream changes in gene expression and/or elicit rapid changes in cellular function has rapidly gathered pace, and a role for estrogen signaling in the biological pathways that confer neuroprotection is becoming undeniable. Here I review the evidence why we need to consider sex as a biological variable (SABV) when investigating the etiology of ARHL. Loss of auditory function with aging is frequency‐specific and modulated by SABV. Evidence also suggests that differences in cochlear physiology between women and men are already present from birth. Understanding the molecular basis of these sex differences in ARHL will accelerate the development of precision medicine therapies for ARHL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Evidence for independent peripheral and central age‐related hearing impairment</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Evidence for independent peripheral and central age‐related hearing impairment&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b35a637a-e06f-4730-8095-078c1e9e47a7/jnr24639-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain aspects of central presbycusis such as temporal processing can largely exist independent of peripheral presbycusis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deleterious age‐related changes in the central auditory nervous system have been referred to as central age‐related hearing impairment (ARHI) or central presbycusis. Central ARHI is often assumed to be the consequence of peripheral ARHI. However, it is possible that certain aspects of central ARHI are independent from peripheral ARHI. A confirmation of this possibility could lead to significant improvements in current rehabilitation practices. The major difficulty in addressing this issue arises from confounding factors, such as other age‐related changes in both the cochlea and central non‐auditory brain structures. Because gap detection is a common measure of central auditory temporal processing, and gap detection thresholds are less influenced by changes in other brain functions such as learning and memory, we investigated the potential relationship between age‐related peripheral hearing loss (i.e., audiograms) and age‐related changes in gap detection. Consistent with previous studies, a significant difference was found for gap detection thresholds between young and older adults. However, among older adults, no significant associations were observed between gap detection ability and several other independent variables including the pure tone audiogram average, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale‐Vocabulary score, gender, and age. Statistical analyses showed little or no contributions from these independent variables to gap detection thresholds. Thus, our data indicate that age‐related decline in central temporal processing is largely independent of peripheral ARHI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and aldosterone all demonstrate vital roles in sustaining auditory function through either the maintenance of cochlear neurons, up/down regulation of critical molecules (i.e., IGF‐1, BDNF, etc.), or generation of the endocochlear potential. With disease and/or age, hormone expression begins to decline drastically, which ultimately affects cochlear structures and the integrity of cochlear cells. The following review explores the latest findings as well as realistic outcomes for hormone therapy treatment in the auditory system. This information could serve as a potential guide for patients considering hormone therapy as a medicinal choice to alleviate the signs of onset of presbycusis—age‐related hearing loss. Additional scientific investigations could also be carried out to further enhance recent findings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Ultrastructural defects in stereocilia and tectorial membrane in aging mouse and human cochleae</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Ultrastructural defects in stereocilia and tectorial membrane in aging mouse and human cochleae&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a84d52e8-9bc3-4dc0-aa38-b4d75f4a3d2f/jnr24556-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have described and investigated the pathologies of aging cochlea in both mice and humans to identify where aging pathologies are similar and different between the two. We have identified common pathological changes that are likely to have significant effects on hearing, improving the understanding of age‐related hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aging cochlea is subjected to a number of pathological changes to play a role in the onset of age‐related hearing loss (ARHL). Although ARHL has often been thought of as the result of the loss of hair cells, it is in fact a disorder with a complex etiology, arising from the changes to both the organ of Corti and its supporting structures. In this study, we examine two aging pathologies that have not been studied in detail despite their apparent prevalence; the fusion, elongation, and engulfment of cochlear inner hair cell stereocilia, and the changes that occur to the tectorial membrane (TM), a structure overlying the organ of Corti that modulates its physical properties in response to sound. Our work demonstrates that similar pathological changes occur in these two structures in the aging cochleae of both mice and humans, examines the ultrastructural changes that underlie stereocilial fusion, and identifies the lost TM components that lead to changes in membrane structure. We place these changes into the context of the wider pathology of the aging cochlea, and identify how they may be important in particular for understanding the more subtle hearing pathologies that precede auditory threshold loss in ARHL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24549?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age‐related hearing loss (ARHL) has recently been confirmed as a common complex trait, that is, it is heritable with many genetic variants each contributing a small amount of risk, as well as environmental determinants. Historically, attempts to identify the genetic variants underlying the ARHL have been of limited success, relying on the selection of candidate genes based on the limited knowledge of the pathophysiology of the condition, and linkage studies in samples comprising related individuals. More recently genome‐wide association studies have been performed, but these require very large samples having consistent and reliable phenotyping for hearing loss (HL), and early attempts suffered from lack of reliable replication of their findings. Replicated variants shown associated with ARHL include those lying in genes &lt;i&gt;GRM7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ISG20&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TRIOBP&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; ILDR1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;EYA4.&lt;/i&gt; The availability of large biobanks and the development of collaborative consortia have led to a breakthrough over the last couple of years, and many new genetic variants associated with ARHL are becoming available, through the analysis publicly available bioresources and electronic health records. These findings along with immunohistochemistry and mouse models of HL look set to help disentangle the genetic architecture of ARHL, and highlight the need for standardization of phenotyping methods to facilitate data sharing and collaboration across research networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Differential deletion of GDNF in the auditory system leads to altered sound responsiveness</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24544?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24544?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Differential deletion of GDNF in the auditory system leads to altered sound responsiveness&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8d1a1536-02d5-4d52-b2d2-15e2fa1a663e/jnr24544-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deficiency of GDNF in cochlear hair cells (Atoh1‐Cre) reduces inner hair cell (IHC)/cochlear output, although outer hair cell (OHC) function is normal. Deficiency of GDNF in cochlear neurons (TrkC‐Cre) leads to increased OHC and IHC/auditory nerve responses. Tissue‐specific GDNF expression during development is thus required to maintain normal hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glial‐derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been proposed as a potent neurotrophic factor with the potential to cure neurodegenerative diseases. In the cochlea, GDNF has been detected in auditory neurons and sensory receptor cells and its expression is upregulated upon trauma. Moreover, the application of GDNF in different animal models of deafness has shown its capacity to prevent hearing loss and promoted its future use in therapeutic trials in humans. In the present study we have examined the endogenous requirement of GDNF during auditory development in mice. Using a &lt;i&gt;lacZ&lt;/i&gt; knockin allele we have confirmed the expression of GDNF in the cochlea including its sensory regions during development. Global inactivation of GDNF throughout the hearing system using a &lt;i&gt;Foxg1‐&lt;/i&gt;Cre line causes perinatal lethality but reveals no apparent defects during formation of the cochlea. Using &lt;i&gt;TrkC‐&lt;/i&gt;Cre and &lt;i&gt;Atoh1‐&lt;/i&gt;Cre lines, we were able to generate viable mutants lacking GDNF in auditory neurons or both auditory neurons and sensory hair cells. These mutants show normal frequency‐dependent auditory thresholds. However, mechanoelectrical response properties of outer hair cells (OHCs) in &lt;i&gt;TrkC‐&lt;/i&gt;Cre &lt;i&gt;GDNF&lt;/i&gt; mutants are altered at low thresholds. Furthermore, auditory brainstem wave analysis shows an abnormal increase of wave I. On the other hand, &lt;i&gt;Atoh1‐&lt;/i&gt;Cre &lt;i&gt;GDNF&lt;/i&gt; mutants show normal OHC function but their auditory brainstem wave pattern is reduced at the levels of wave I, III and IV. These results show that GDNF expression during the development is required to maintain functional hearing at different levels of the auditory system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Auditory temporal acuity improves with age in the male mouse auditory thalamus: A role for perineuronal nets?&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0899a52f-7138-4208-a12e-2ceb61da686d/jnr24537-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recordings made from ventral (v) and medial (m) MGB of middle‐aged, normally hearing, CBA/Ca male mice showed improved synchronization to rapidly varying stimuli. Increased precision was associated with localized expression of perineuronal net and axonal coats. This suggests the MGB retains significant capacity for anatomical and electrophysiological plasticity, maximizing efficiency into older age. Created in part with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.BioRender.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;BioRender.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to perceive and interpret environmental sound accurately is conserved across many species and is fundamental for understanding communication via vocalizations. Auditory acuity and temporally controlled neuronal firing underpin this ability. Deterioration in neuronal firing precision likely contributes to poorer hearing performance, yet the role of neural processing by key nuclei in the central auditory pathways is not fully understood. Here, we record from the auditory thalamus (medial geniculate body [MGB]) of young and middle‐aged, normally hearing male CBA/Ca mice. We report changes in temporal processing of auditory stimuli, with neurons recorded from ventral and medial MGB subdivisions of older animals more likely to synchronize to rapid temporally varying stimuli. MGB subdivisions also showed increased probability of neuronal firing and shorter response latencies to clicks in older animals. Histological investigation of neuronal extracellular specializations, perineuronal nets (PNNs) and axonal coats, in the MGB identified greater organization of PNNs around MGB neurons and the presence of axonal coats within older animals. This supports the observation that neural responses recorded from ventral and medial MGB of older mice were more likely to synchronize to temporally varying stimuli presented at faster repetition rates than those recorded from young adult animals. These changes are observed in animals with normal hearing thresholds, confirming that neural processing differs between the MGB subdivisions and such processing is associated with age‐related changes to PNNs. Understanding these age‐related changes and how they occur have important implications for the design of effective therapeutic interventions to improve speech intelligibility into later life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The effects of age and sex on the detection of pure tones by adult CBA/CaJ mice (Mus musculus)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/619505b4-dc08-4f4d-a868-fb3e4813ec71/jnr24496-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operant conditioning and a longitudinal design can be used to trace hearing loss for pure tones in CBA/CaJ mice. Male and female mice exhibit similar hearing sensitivity up to 645 days of age. Later in life, male mice lose hearing at a faster rate than females, paralleling hearing loss in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age‐related hearing loss (ARHL) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a gradual decrease in hearing sensitivity. Previous electrophysiological and behavioral studies have demonstrated that the CBA/CaJ mouse strain is an appropriate model for the late‐onset hearing loss found in humans. However, few studies have characterized hearing in these mice behaviorally using longitudinal methodologies. The goal of this research was to utilize a longitudinal design and operant conditioning procedures with positive reinforcement to construct audiograms and temporal integration functions in aging CBA/CaJ mice. In the first experiment, thresholds were collected for 8, 16, 24, 42, and 64 kHz pure tones in 30 male and 35 female CBA/CaJ mice. Similar to humans, mice had higher thresholds for high frequency tones than for low frequency pure tones across the lifespan. Female mice had better hearing acuity than males after 645 days of age. In the second experiment, temporal integration functions were constructed for 18 male and 18 female mice for 16 and 64 kHz tones varying in duration. Mice showed an increase in thresholds for tones shorter than 200 ms, reaching peak performance at shorter durations than other rodent species. Overall, CBA/CaJ mice experience ARHL for pure tones of different frequencies and durations, making them a good model for studies on hearing loss. These findings highlight the importance of using a wide range of stimuli and a longitudinal design when comparing presbycusis across different species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24439?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presbycusis, or age‐related hearing loss (ARHL), occurs in most mammals with variations in the age of onset, rate of decline, and magnitude of degeneration in the central nervous system and inner ear. The affected cochlear structures include the stria vascularis and its vasculature, spiral ligament, sensory hair cells and auditory neurons. Dysfunction of the stria vascularis results in a reduced endocochlear potential. Without this potential, the cochlear amplification provided by the electro‐motility of the outer hair cells is insufficient, and a high‐frequency hearing‐loss results. Degeneration of the sensory cells, especially the outer hair cells also leads to hearing loss due to lack of amplification. Neuronal degeneration, another hallmark of ARHL, most likely underlies difficulties with speech discrimination, especially in noisy environments. Noise exposure is a major cause of ARHL. It is well‐known to cause sensory cell degeneration, especially the outer hair cells at the high frequency end of the cochlea. Even loud, but not uncomfortable, sound levels can lead to synaptopathy and ultimately neuronal degeneration. Even in the absence of a noisy environment, aged cells degenerate. This pathology most likely results from damage to mitochondria and contributes to degenerative changes in the stria vascularis, hair cells, and neurons. The genetic underpinnings of ARHL are still unknown and most likely involve various combinations of genes. At present, the only effective strategy for reducing ARHL is prevention of noise exposure. If future strategies can improve mitochondrial activity and reduce oxidative damage in old age, these should also bring relief.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pathophysiology of age‐related hearing loss (ARHL), or presbycusis, involves a complex interplay between environmental and genetic factors. The fundamental biomolecular mechanisms of ARHL have been well described, including the roles of membrane transport, reactive oxygen species, cochlear synaptopathy, vascular insults, hormones, and microRNA, to name a few. The genetic basis underlying these mechanisms remains under‐investigated and poorly understood. The emergence of genome‐wide association studies has allowed for the identification of specific groups of genes involved in ARHL. This review highlights recent advances in understanding of the pathogenesis of ARHL, the genetic basis underlying these processes and suggests future directions for research and potential therapeutic avenues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Differential Development of Myelin in Zebra Finch Song Nuclei</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Differential Development of Myelin in Zebra Finch Song Nuclei&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0b3585fe-3dac-4913-8201-414dac92d518/cne25019-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forebrain song nuclei in adult songbirds exhibit distinct myelination patterns, yet little is known about myelin development. We demonstrate different developmental rates and final levels of myelination across five major song nuclei. This differential myelin development could contribute to different aspects of song acquisition and production.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Songbirds learn vocalizations by hearing and practicing songs. As song develops, the tempo becomes faster and more precise. In the songbird brain, discrete nuclei form interconnected myelinated circuits that control song acquisition and production. The myelin sheath increases the speed of action potential propagation by insulating the axons of neurons and by reducing membrane capacitance. As the brain develops, myelin increases in density, but the time course of myelin development across discrete song nuclei has not been systematically studied in a quantitative fashion. We tested the hypothesis that myelination develops differentially across time and song nuclei. We examined myelin development in the brains of the zebra finch (&lt;i&gt;Taeniopygia guttata&lt;/i&gt;) from chick at posthatch day (d) 8 to adult (up to 147 d) in five major song nuclei: HVC (proper name), robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), Area X, lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN) and medial portion of the dorsolateral thalamic nucleus (DLM). All of these nuclei showed an increase in the density of myelination during development but at different rates and to different final degrees. Exponential curve fits revealed that DLM showed earlier myelination than other nuclei, and HVC showed the slowest myelination of song nuclei. Together, these data show differential maturation of myelination in different portions of the song system. Such differential maturation would be well placed to play a role in regulating the development of learned song.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: A Proteomic View on the Differential Phenotype of Schwann Cells derived from Mouse Sensory and Motor nerves</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;A Proteomic View on the Differential Phenotype of Schwann Cells derived from Mouse Sensory and Motor nerves&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f4483233-6164-4a19-8644-d9f99241606b/cne25018-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwann cells were found to have sensory and motor phenotypes and associated with the modality specific promotion of sensory and motor nerve regeneration. To explore the differences between them, we established a workflow to obtain highly purified SCs derived from sensory nerve (SNdSCs) and motor nerve (MNdSCs) from B6; D2‐Tg(s100B‐EGFP)1Wjt/J mice. The SNdSCs and MNdSCs were isolated from dorsal and ventral roots by FACS sorting. The proteome of SNdSCs and MNdSCs was compared by a quantitative proteomic analysis based on iTRAQ labeling and the mouse Schwann proteome was obtained. Several differentially expressed proteins between SNdSCs and MNdSCs were verified.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwann cells (SCs) are myelin‐forming glial cells of the peripheral nervous system. Recent studies suggested that SCs comprise two phenotypes: sensory SCs and motor SCs, which are associated with the modality‐specific promotion of sensory and motor axon growth during peripheral neuronal regeneration. However, the molecular basis of the two phenotypic SCs is unclear. We established a workflow to obtain highly purified SCs derived from sensory nerve (SNdSCs) and motor nerve (MNdSCs) from B6; D2‐Tg(s100B‐EGFP)1Wjt/J mice. Subsequently, a quantitative proteomic analysis based on iTRAQ labeling was performed to compare the proteome of SNdSCs and MNdSCs. A total of 6,567 proteins were identified, of which 63 and 11 proteins were overexpressed in SNdSCs and MNdSCs, respectively. Three of the overexpressed proteins were further validated by Western blot and immunocytochemistry: GMFB and CNPase, which were overexpressed in sensory SNdSCs, and histone H4, which was overexpressed in MNdSCs. The expression pattern of the three proteins was also validated in the dorsal roots and ventral roots. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that proteins highly expressed in SNdSCs are mainly involved in RNA processing and protein synthesis, while those overexpressed in MNdSCs are related to cell proliferation. Real‐time cell analysis confirmed that the proliferation activity of MNdSCs is higher than that of SNdSCs. This study is the first to provide a proteomic view of the differential phenotype of mouse SNdSCs and MNdSCs. The data may serve as a valuable source for the study of the biological characteristics of these two SC phenotypes and their roles in nerve‐specific regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–VTA MC3R neurons are a likely site of interaction between homeostatic and hedonic feeding circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–VTA MC3R neurons send efferent projections to, and receive afferent input from, multiple brain regions involved in feeding, reward, and aversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–Very few POMC and AgRP neurons were labeled by monosynaptic rabies from multiple VTA neuron subtypes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mesolimbic dopamine system is involved in the regulation of multiple behaviors, including feeding, and evidence demonstrates that the melanocortin system can act on the mesolimbic dopamine system to control feeding and other behaviors. The melanocortin‐3 receptor (MC3R) is an important component of the melanocortin system, but its overall role is poorly understood. Because MC3Rs are highly expressed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and are likely to be the key interaction point between the melanocortin and mesolimbic dopamine systems, we set out to identify both the efferent projection patterns of VTA MC3R neurons and the location of the neurons providing afferent input to them. VTA MC3R neurons were broadly connected to neurons across the brain but were strongly connected to a discrete set of brain regions involved in the regulation of feeding, reward, and aversion. Surprisingly, experiments using monosynaptic rabies virus showed that proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti‐related protein (AgRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus made few direct synapses onto VTA MC3R neurons or any of the other major neuronal subtypes in the VTA, despite being extensively labeled by general retrograde tracers injected into the VTA. These results greatly contribute to our understanding of the anatomical interactions between the melanocortin and mesolimbic systems and provide a foundation for future studies of VTA MC3R neurons and the circuits containing them in the control of feeding and other behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we study the connection between the structure and properties of
the so-called free association network of the English language, and the
solution of psycholiguistical Remote Association Tests (RATs). We show that
average hardness of individual RATs is largely determined by the relative
positions of the test words (stimuli and response) on the free association
network. We argue that solution of RATs can be interpreted as a first passage
search problem on a free association network and study a variety of different
search algorithms. We demonstate that in easy RATs (those solved by more than
64% subjects in 15 seconds) there are strong links directly connecting stimuli
and response, and thus an efficient strategy consist in activating these direct
links. In turn, the most efficient mechanism of solving medium and hard RATs
consists of preferentially following what we call &quot;moderately weak&quot;
associations.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper describes the use of neural networks to enhance simulations for
subsequent training of anomaly-detection systems. Simulations can provide edge
conditions for anomaly detection which may be sparse or non-existent in
real-world data. Simulations suffer, however, by producing data that is &quot;too
clean&quot; resulting in anomaly detection systems that cannot transition from
simulated data to actual conditions. Our approach enhances simulations using
neural networks trained on real-world data to create outputs that are more
realistic and variable than traditional simulations.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 pandemic is severely impacting the lives of billions across the
globe. Even after taking massive protective measures like nation-wide
lockdowns, discontinuation of international flight services, rigorous testing
etc., the infection spreading is still growing steadily, causing thousands of
deaths and serious socio-economic crisis. Thus, the identification of the major
factors of this infection spreading dynamics is becoming crucial to minimize
impact and lifetime of COVID-19 and any future pandemic. In this work, a
probabilistic cellular automata based method has been employed to model the
infection dynamics for a significant number of different countries. This study
proposes that for an accurate data-driven modeling of this infection spread,
cellular automata provides an excellent platform, with a sequential genetic
algorithm for efficiently estimating the parameters of the dynamics. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to understand and interpret
COVID-19 data using optimized cellular automata, through genetic algorithm. It
has been demonstrated that the proposed methodology can be flexible and robust
at the same time, and can be used to model the daily active cases, total number
of infected people and total death cases through systematic parameter
estimation. Elaborate analyses for COVID-19 statistics of forty countries from
different continents have been performed, with markedly divergent time
evolution of the infection spreading because of demographic and socioeconomic
factors. The substantial predictive power of this model has been established
with conclusions on the key players in this pandemic dynamics.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Phase-bistability between anticipated and delayed synchronization in neuronal populations. (arXiv:2008.11891v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11891</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Two dynamical systems unidirectionally coupled in a sender-receiver
configuration can synchronize with a nonzero phase-lag. In particular, the
system can exhibit anticipated synchronization (AS), which is characterized by
a negative phase-lag, if the receiver (R) also receives a delayed negative
self-feedback. Recently, AS was shown to occur between cortical-like neuronal
populations in which the self-feedback is mediated by inhibitory synapses. In
this biologically plausible scenario, a transition from the usual delayed
synchronization (DS, with positive phase-lag) to AS can be mediated by the
inhibitory conductances in the receiver population. Here we show that depending
on the relation between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances the
system can also exhibit phase-bistability between anticipated and delayed
synchronization. Furthermore, we show that the amount of noise at the receiver
and the synaptic conductances can mediate the transition from stable
phase-locking to a bistable regime and eventually to a phase-drift (PD). We
suggest that our spiking neuronal populations model could be potentially useful
to study phase-bistability in cortical regions related to bistable perception.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent advancements in machine learning algorithms, especially the
development of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have transformed the landscape of
Artificial Intelligence (AI). With every passing day, deep learning based
methods are applied to solve new problems with exceptional results. The portal
to the real world is the edge. The true impact of AI can only be fully realized
if we can have AI agents continuously interacting with the real world and
solving everyday problems. Unfortunately, high compute and memory requirements
of DNNs acts a huge barrier towards this vision. Today we circumvent this
problem by deploying special purpose inference hardware on the edge while
procuring trained models from the cloud. This approach, however, relies on
constant interaction with the cloud for transmitting all the data, training on
massive GPU clusters, and downloading updated models. This is challenging for
bandwidth, privacy, and constant connectivity concerns that autonomous agents
may exhibit. In this paper we evaluate techniques for enabling adaptive
intelligence on edge devices with zero interaction with any high-end
cloud/server. We build a prototype distributed system of Raspberry Pis
communicating via WiFi running NeuroEvolutionary (NE) learning and inference.
We evaluate the performance of such a collaborative system and detail the
compute/communication characteristics of different arrangements of the system
that trade-off parallelism versus communication. Using insights from our
analysis, we also propose algorithmic modifications to reduce communication by
up to 3.6x during the learning phase to enhance scalability even further and
match performance of higher end computing devices at scale. We believe that
these insights will enable algorithm-hardware co-design efforts for enabling
continuous learning on the edge.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The design of algorithms that generate personalized ranked item lists is a
central topic of research in the field of recommender systems. In the past few
years, in particular, approaches based on deep learning (neural) techniques
have become dominant in the literature. For all of them, substantial progress
over the state-of-the-art is claimed. However, indications exist of certain
problems in today's research practice, e.g., with respect to the choice and
optimization of the baselines used for comparison, raising questions about the
published claims. In order to obtain a better understanding of the actual
progress, we have tried to reproduce recent results in the area of neural
recommendation approaches based on collaborative filtering. The worrying
outcome of the analysis of these recent works-all were published at prestigious
scientific conferences between 2015 and 2018-is that 11 out of the 12
reproducible neural approaches can be outperformed by conceptually simple
methods, e.g., based on the nearest-neighbor heuristics. None of the
computationally complex neural methods was actually consistently better than
already existing learning-based techniques, e.g., using matrix factorization or
linear models. In our analysis, we discuss common issues in today's research
practice, which, despite the many papers that are published on the topic, have
apparently led the field to a certain level of stagnation.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In studies of the visual system as well as in computer vision, the focus is
often on contrast edges. However, the primate visual system contains a large
number of cells that are insensitive to spatial contrast and, instead, respond
to uniform homogeneous illumination of their visual field. The purpose of this
information remains unclear. Here, we propose a mechanism that detects feature
homogeneity in visual areas, based on latency coding and spike time
coincidence, in a purely feed-forward and therefore rapid manner. We
demonstrate how homogeneity information can interact with information on
contrast edges to potentially support rapid image segmentation. Furthermore, we
analyze how neuronal crosstalk (noise) affects the mechanism's performance. We
show that the detrimental effects of crosstalk can be partly mitigated through
delayed feed-forward inhibition that shapes bi-phasic postsynaptic events. The
delay of the feed-forward inhibition allows effectively controlling the size of
the temporal integration window and, thereby, the coincidence threshold. The
proposed model is based on single-spike latency codes in a purely feed-forward
architecture that supports low-latency processing, making it an attractive
scheme of computation in spiking neuronal networks where rapid responses and
low spike counts are desired.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: A Vector Space Model for Neural Network Functions: Inspirations From Similarities Between the Theory of Connectivity and the Logarithmic Time Course of Word Production</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00058</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The present report examines the coinciding results of two study groups each presenting a power-of-two function to describe network structures underlying perceptual processes in one case and word production during verbal fluency tasks in the other. The former is theorized as neural cliques organized according to the function N = 2&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; − 1, whereas the latter assumes word conglomerations thinkable as tuples following the function N = 2&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;. Both theories assume the innate optimization of energy efficiency to cause the specific connectivity structure. The vast resemblance between both formulae motivated the development of a common formulation. This was obtained by using a vector space model, in which the configuration of neural cliques or connected words is represented by a N-dimensional state vector. A further analysis of the model showed that the entire time course of word production could be derived using basically one single minimal transformation-matrix. This again seems in line with the principle of maximum energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Dendritic Spine Plasticity: Function and Mechanisms</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dendritic spines are small protrusions studding neuronal dendrites, first described in 1888 by Ramón y Cajal using his famous Golgi stainings. Around 50 years later the advance of electron microscopy (EM) confirmed Cajal’s intuition that spines constitute the postsynaptic site of most excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain. The finding that spine density decreases between young and adult ages in fixed tissues suggested that spines are dynamic. It is only a decade ago that two-photon microscopy (TPM) has unambiguously proven the dynamic nature of spines, through the repeated imaging of single spines in live animals. Spine dynamics comprise formation, disappearance, and stabilization of spines and are modulated by neuronal activity and developmental age. Here, we review several emerging concepts in the field that start to answer the following key questions: What are the external signals triggering spine dynamics and the molecular mechanisms involved? What is, in return, the role of spine dynamics in circuit-rewiring, learning, and neuropsychiatric disorders?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Dystroglycan Mediates Clustering of Essential GABAergic Components in Cerebellar Purkinje Cells</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Muscle dystrophin–glycoprotein complex (DGC) links the intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. In neurons, dystroglycan and dystrophin, two major components of the DGC, localize in a subset of GABAergic synapses, where their function is unclear. Here we used mouse models to analyze the specific role of the DGC in the organization and function of inhibitory synapses. Loss of full-length dystrophin in mdx mice resulted in a selective depletion of the transmembrane β-dystroglycan isoform from inhibitory post-synaptic sites in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Remarkably, there were no differences in the synaptic distribution of the extracellular α-dystroglycan subunit, of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and neuroligin 2. In contrast, conditional deletion of the dystroglycan gene from Purkinje cells caused a disruption of the DGC and severely impaired post-synaptic clustering of neuroligin 2, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and scaffolding proteins. Accordingly, whole-cell patch-clamp analysis revealed a significant reduction in the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous IPSCs recorded from Purkinje cells. In the long-term, deletion of dystroglycan resulted in a significant decrease of GABAergic innervation of Purkinje cells and caused an impairment of motor learning functions. These results show that dystroglycan is an essential synaptic organizer at GABAergic synapses in Purkinje cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The TOR Pathway at the Neuromuscular Junction: More Than a Metabolic Player?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the chemical synapse connecting motor neurons and skeletal muscle fibers. NMJs allow all voluntary movements, and ensure vital functions like breathing. Changes in the structure and function of NMJs are hallmarks of numerous pathological conditions that affect muscle function including sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the morphological and functional perturbations in the pre- and post-synaptic compartments of the NMJ remain poorly understood. Here, we discuss the role of the metabolic pathway associated to the kinase TOR (Target of Rapamycin) in the development, maintenance and alterations of the NMJ. This is of particular interest as the TOR pathway has been implicated in aging, but its role at the NMJ is still ill-defined. We highlight the respective functions of the two TOR-associated complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, and discuss the role of localized protein synthesis and autophagy regulation in motor neuron terminals and sub-synaptic regions of muscle fibers and their possible effects on NMJ maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Loss of Long-Term Potentiation at Hippocampal Output Synapses in Experimental Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) show severe problems in hippocampus dependent memory consolidation. Memory consolidation strongly depends on an intact dialog between the hippocampus and neocortical structures. Deficits in hippocampal signal transmission are known to provoke disturbances in memory formation. In the present study, we investigate changes of synaptic plasticity at hippocampal output structures in an experimental animal model of TLE. In pilocarpine-treated rats, we found suppressed long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal and parahippocampal regions such as the subiculum and the entorhinal cortex (EC). Subsequently we focused on the subiculum, serving as the major relay station between the hippocampus proper and downstream structures. In control animals, subicular pyramidal cells express different forms of LTP depending on their intrinsic firing pattern. In line with our extracellular recordings, we could show that LTP could only be induced in a minority of subicular pyramidal neurons. We demonstrate that a well-characterized cAMP-dependent signaling pathway involved in presynaptic forms of LTP is perturbed in pilocarpine-treated animals. Our findings suggest that in TLE, disturbances of synaptic plasticity may influence the information flow between the hippocampus and the neocortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Constant Levels of Tau Phosphorylation in the Brain of htau Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Excessive tau phosphorylation is the hallmark of tauopathies. Today’s research thus focusses on the development of drugs targeting this pathological feature. To test new drugs in preclinical studies, animal models are needed that properly mimic this pathological hallmark. The htau mouse is a well-known model expressing human but lacking murine tau, allowing to evaluate the efficacy of tau modifying compounds without interference from murine tau. Htau mice are well-characterized for tau pathology at older age, although it is often not specified on which genetic background analyzed animals were bred. Since it was shown that the genetic background can influence the pathology, we evaluated the phosphorylation status of young and adult htau mice on a C57BL/6J background by analyzing ptau Ser202 and ptau Ser396 levels in the cortex and hippocampus of 3 and 12 month old animals by immunofluorescent labelling. Additionally, we evaluated total tau, ptau Thr231 and ptau Thr181 in the soluble and insoluble brain fraction of 3–15 month old htau mice by immunosorbent assay. Our results show that ptau levels of all analyzed residues and age groups are similar without strong increases over age. These data show that tau is already phosphorylated at the age of 3 months suggesting that phosphorylation starts even earlier. The early start of tau phosphorylation in htau mice enables the use of these mice for efficacy studies already at very young age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The present study aims to investigate intrinsic abnormalities of brain and the effect of antiepileptic treatment on brain activity in Benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS). Twenty-six drug-naïve patients (DNP) and 22 drug-receiving patients (DRP) with BECTS were collected in this study. Static amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (sALFF) and dynamic ALFF (dALFF) were applied to resting-state fMRI data. Functional connectivity (FC) analysis was further performed for affected regions identified by static and dynamic analysis. One-way analysis of variance and post hoc statistical analyses were performed for between-group differences. Abnormal sALFF and dALFF values were correlated with clinical features of patients. Compared with healthy controls (HC), DNP group demonstrated alterations of sALFF and/or dALFF in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), supplementary motor areas (SMA), cerebellum, hippocampus, pallidum and cingulate cortex, in which the values were close to normal in DRP. Notably, sALFF and dALFF showed specific sensitivity in detecting abnormalities in basal ganglia and cerebellum. Additionally, DRP showed additional changes in precuneus, inferior temporal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus and occipital visual cortex. Compared with HC, the DNP showed increased FC in default network and motion-related networks, and the DRP showed decreased FC in default network. The MPFC, hippocampus, SMA, basal ganglia and cerebellum are indicated to be intrinsically affected regions and effective therapeutic targets. And the FC profiles of default and motion-related networks might be potential core indicators for clinical treatment. This study revealed potential neuromodulatory targets and helped understand pathomechanism of BECTS. Static and dynamic analyses should be combined to investigate neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Focus on the Breath: Brain Decoding Reveals Internal States of Attention During Meditation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Meditation practices are often used to cultivate interoception or internally-oriented attention to bodily sensations, which may improve health via cognitive and emotional regulation of bodily signals. However, it remains unclear how meditation impacts internal attention (IA) states due to lack of measurement tools that can objectively assess mental states during meditation practice itself, and produce time estimates of internal focus at individual or group levels. To address these measurement gaps, we tested the feasibility of applying multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to single-subject fMRI data to: (1) learn and recognize internal attentional states relevant for meditation during a directed IA task; and (2) decode or estimate the presence of those IA states during an independent meditation session. Within a mixed sample of experienced meditators and novice controls (N = 16), we first used MVPA to develop single-subject brain classifiers for five modes of attention during an IA task in which subjects were specifically instructed to engage in one of five states [i.e., meditation-related states: breath attention, mind wandering (MW), and self-referential processing, and control states: attention to feet and sounds]. Using standard cross-validation procedures, MVPA classifiers were trained in five of six IA blocks for each subject, and predictive accuracy was tested on the independent sixth block (iterated until all volumes were tested, N = 2,160). Across participants, all five IA states were significantly recognized well above chance (&amp;gt;41% vs. 20% chance). At the individual level, IA states were recognized in most participants (87.5%), suggesting that recognition of IA neural patterns may be generalizable for most participants, particularly experienced meditators. Next, for those who showed accurate IA neural patterns, the originally trained classifiers were applied to a separate meditation run (10-min) to make an inference about the percentage time engaged in each IA state (breath attention, MW, or self-referential processing). Preliminary group-level analyses demonstrated that during meditation practice, participants spent more time attending to breath compared to MW or self-referential processing. This paradigm established the feasibility of using MVPA classifiers to objectively assess mental states during meditation at the participant level, which holds promise for improved measurement of internal attention states cultivated by meditation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Correlates of Group Versus Individual Problem Solving Revealed by fMRI</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Group problem solving is a prototypical complex collective intellectual activity. Psychological research provides compelling evidence that problem solving in groups is both qualitatively and quantitatively different from doing so alone. However, the question of whether individual and collective problem solving involve the same neural substrate has not yet been addressed, mainly due to methodological limitations. In the current study, functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed to compare brain activation when participants solved Raven-like matrix problems in a small group and individually. In the group condition, the participant in the scanner was able to discuss the problem with other team members using a special communication device. In the individual condition, the participant was required to think aloud while solving the problem in the silent presence of the other team members. Greater activation was found in several brain regions during group problem solving, including the medial prefrontal cortex; lateral parietal, cingulate, precuneus and retrosplenial cortices; frontal and temporal poles. These areas have been identified as potential components of the so-called “social brain” on the basis of research using offline judgments of material related to socializing. Therefore, this study demonstrated the actual involvement of these regions in real-time social interactions, such as group problem solving. However, further connectivity analysis revealed that the social brain components are co-activated, but do not increase their coupling during cooperation as would be suggested for a holistic network. We suggest that the social mode of the brain may be described instead as a re-configuration of connectivity between basic networks, and we found decreased connectivity between the language and salience networks in the group compared to the individual condition. A control experiment showed that the findings from the main experiment cannot be entirely accounted for by discourse comprehension. Thus, the study demonstrates affordances provided by the presented new technique for neuroimaging the “group mind,” implementing the single-brain version of the second-person neuroscience approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Transition of Neural Activity From the Chaotic Bipolar-Disorder State to the Periodic Healthy State Using External Feedback Signals</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chronotherapy is a treatment for mood disorders, including major depressive disorder, mania, and bipolar disorder (BD). Neurotransmitters associated with the pathology of mood disorders exhibit circadian rhythms. A functional deficit in the neural circuits related to mood disorders disturbs the circadian rhythm; chronotherapy is an intervention that helps resynchronize the patient's biological clock with the periodic daily cycle, leading to amelioration of symptoms. In previous reports, Hadaeghi et al. proposed a non-linear dynamic model composed of the frontal and sensory cortical neural networks and the hypothalamus to explain the relationship between deficits in neural function in the frontal cortex and the disturbed circadian rhythm/mood transitions in BD (hereinafter referred to as the Hadaeghi model). In this model, neural activity in the frontal and sensory lobes exhibits periodic behavior in the healthy state; while in BD, this neural activity is in a state of chaos-chaos intermittency; this temporal departure from the healthy periodic state disturbs the circadian pacemaker in the hypothalamus. In this study, we propose an intervention based on a feedback method called the “reduced region of orbit” (RRO) method to facilitate the transition of the disturbed frontal cortical neural activity underlying BD to healthy periodic activity. Our simulation was based on the Hadaeghi model. We used an RRO feedback signal based on the return-map structure of the simulated frontal and sensory lobes to induce synchronization with a relatively weak periodic signal corresponding to the healthy condition by applying feedback of appropriate strength. The RRO feedback signal induces chaotic resonance, which facilitates the transition to healthy, periodic frontal neural activity, although this synchronization is restricted to a relatively low frequency of the periodic input signal. Additionally, applying an appropriate strength of the RRO feedback signal lowered the amplitude of the periodic input signal required to induce a synchronous state compared with the periodic signal applied alone. In conclusion, through a chaotic-resonance effect induced by the RRO feedback method, the state of the disturbed frontal neural activity characteristic of BD was transformed into a state close to healthy periodic activity by relatively weak periodic perturbations. Thus, RRO feedback-modulated chronotherapy might be an innovative new type of minimally invasive chronotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Subpopulations of Projection Neurons in the Olfactory Bulb</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.561822</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Generation of neuronal diversity is a biological strategy widely used in the brain to process complex information. The olfactory bulb is the first relay station of olfactory information in the vertebrate central nervous system. In the olfactory bulb, axons of the olfactory sensory neurons form synapses with dendrites of projection neurons that transmit the olfactory information to the olfactory cortex. Historically, the olfactory bulb projection neurons have been classified into two populations, mitral cells and tufted cells. The somata of these cells are distinctly segregated within the layers of the olfactory bulb; the mitral cells are located in the mitral cell layer while the tufted cells are found in the external plexiform layer. Although mitral and tufted cells share many morphological, biophysical, and molecular characteristics, they differ in soma size, projection patterns of their dendrites and axons, and odor responses. In addition, tufted cells are further subclassified based on the relative depth of their somata location in the external plexiform layer. Evidence suggests that different types of tufted cells have distinct cellular properties and play different roles in olfactory information processing. Therefore, mitral and different types of tufted cells are considered as starting points for parallel pathways of olfactory information processing in the brain. Moreover, recent studies suggest that mitral cells also consist of heterogeneous subpopulations with different cellular properties despite the fact that the mitral cell layer is a single-cell layer. In this review, we first compare the morphology of projection neurons in the olfactory bulb of different vertebrate species. Next, we explore the similarities and differences among subpopulations of projection neurons in the rodent olfactory bulb. We also discuss the timing of neurogenesis as a factor for the generation of projection neuron heterogeneity in the olfactory bulb. Knowledge about the subpopulations of olfactory bulb projection neurons will contribute to a better understanding of the complex olfactory information processing in higher brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Immune Factor, TNFα, Disrupts Human Brain Organoid Development Similar to Schizophrenia—Schizophrenia Increases Developmental Vulnerability to TNFα</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00233</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia (SZ) is a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder in which maternal immune activation (MIA) and increased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) may contribute. Previous studies using iPSC-derived cerebral organoids and neuronal cells demonstrated developmental malformation and transcriptional dysregulations, including TNF receptors and their signaling genes, common to SZ patients with diverse genetic backgrounds. In the present study, we examined the significance of the common TNF receptor dysregulations by transiently exposing cerebral organoids from embryonic stem cells (ESC) and from representative control and SZ patient iPSCs to TNF. In control iPSC organoids, TNF produced malformations qualitatively similar in, but generally less pronounced than, the malformations of the SZ iPSC-derived organoids. TNF and SZ alone disrupted subcortical rosettes and dispersed proliferating Ki67&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neural progenitor cells (NPC) from the organoid ventricular zone (VZ) into the cortical zone (CZ). In the CZ, the absence of large ramified pan-Neu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons coincided with loss of myelinated neurites despite increased cortical accumulation of O4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; oligodendrocytes. The number of calretinin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons increased; however, they lacked the preferential parallel orientation to the organoid surface. SZ and SZ+TNF affected fine cortical and subcortical organoid structure by replacing cells with extracellular matrix (ECM)-like fibers The SZ condition increased developmental vulnerability to TNF, leading to more pronounced changes in NPC, pan-Neu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, and interneurons. Both SZ- and TNF-induced malformations were associated with the loss of nuclear (n)FGFR1 form in the CZ and its upregulation in deep IZ regions, while in earlier studies blocking nFGFR1 reproduced cortical malformations observed in SZ. Computational analysis of ChiPseq and RNAseq datasets shows that nFGFR1 directly targets neurogenic, oligodendrogenic, cell migration, and ECM genes, and that the FGFR1-targeted TNF receptor and signaling genes are overexpressed in SZ NPC. Through these changes, the developing brain with the inherited SZ genome dysregulation may suffer increased vulnerability to TNF and thus, MIA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Pilot Investigation: Older Adults With Atrial Fibrillation Demonstrate Greater Brain Leukoaraiosis in Infracortical and Deep Regions Relative to Non-Atrial Fibrillation Peers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00271</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00271</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;This pilot study explored differences in distribution of white matter hyperintensities (called leukoaraiosis; LA) in older adults (mean age = 67 years) with atrial fibrillation (AF) vs. non-AF peers measured by: (1) depth distribution; (2) anterior-posterior distribution; (3) associations between LA and cortical thickness; and (4) presence of lacunae and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Participant data (AF n = 17; non-AF peers n = 17) were acquired with the same magnetic resonance imaging protocols. LA volume was quantified by cortical depth (periventricular, deep, infracortical) and in anterior and posterior regions. Cortical thickness by lobe was assessed relative to LA load.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Relative to non-AF peers, the AF group had twice the total LA volume (AF = 2.1% vs. Non-AF = 0.9%), over 10 times greater infracortical LA (AF = 0.72% vs. Non-AF = 0.07%), and three times greater deep LA (AF = 2.1% vs. Non-AF = 0.6%). Examinations of the extent of LA in anterior vs. posterior regions revealed a trend for more posterior relative to anterior LA. In the entire sample, total LA and infracortical LA were negatively associated with temporal lobe thickness. Only those with AF presented with lacunae or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Aging adults with AF had more total white matter disease than those without AF, particularly near the cortical mantle and deep within the cortex. Total and infracortical white matter disease in the entire sample negatively associated with temporal lobe thickness. Results suggest that those with AF have a distinct pattern of LA relative to those without AF, and that LA severity for all individuals may associate with structural changes in the cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Relationship of Parieto-Occipital Brain Energy Phosphate Metabolism and Cognition Using 31P MRS at 7-Tesla in Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;The human brain has high energy requirements that continuously support healthy neuronal activity and cognition. A disruption in brain energy metabolism (BEM) may contribute to early neuropathological changes such as accumulation of β-amyloid and tau in vulnerable populations. One such population is amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) where some individuals are at risk for developing dementia, i.e. Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent advances in imaging technology are providing new avenues to measure BEM accurately using 31phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS) at ultra-high-field (UHF) magnetic strength 7-Tesla. This study investigates whether a methodology using partial volume-coil 31P MRS at 7T over parieto-occipital lobes can accurately quantify high-energy phosphate and membrane phospholipid metabolites in aMCI. A secondary objective was to explore BEM and membrane phospholipid indices’ correspondence with cognitive performance in domains of executive function (EF), memory, attention, and visuospatial skills in aMCI, a heterogeneous population.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;19 aMCI participants enrolled in the study completed cognitive assessment and 31P MRS scan. BEM indices were measured using three energy indicators: energy reserve (PCr/t-ATP), energy consumption (intracellular_Pi/t-ATP), and metabolic state (PCr/intracellular_Pi) along with regulatory co-factors of BEM-intracellular Mg&lt;sup&gt;2 + &lt;/sup&gt; and pH; whereas the ratio of phosphomonoesters (PMEs) to phosphodiesters (PDEs) – membrane phospholipid indicator.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;31P MRS scan showed thirteen well-resolved peaks with precise quantification of the phosphorus metabolites at UHF. The higher BEM indices were associated with lower cognitive performance of memory [(energy reserve indicator: CVLT p = 0.004), (metabolic state indicator: CVLT p = 0.007)], executive function [(metabolic state indicator: TOSL (p = 0.044)], and attention [(pH: selective auditory task, p = 0.044)]. The finding of an inverse relationship observed in the parieto-occipital lobes suggests an association between neuronal energy markers with cognition in aMCI.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The significant contribution of this preliminary research was to establish the feasibility of utilizing a methodology at UHF to accurately measure high-energy phosphate and membrane phospholipid metabolites in a population with heterogeneous outcomes. This work offers a novel approach for future work to further elucidate early dementia biomarkers or precursors to the downstream accumulation of amyloid and tau using the combination of MRS-PET imaging modalities in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Dissociable control of unconditioned responses and associative fear learning by parabrachial CGRP neurons</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59799</link>
	<description>Parabrachial CGRP neurons receive diverse threat-related signals and contribute to multiple phases of adaptive threat responses in mice, with their inactivation attenuating both unconditioned behavioral responses to somatic pain and fear-memory formation. Because CGRP&lt;sup&gt;PBN&lt;/sup&gt; neurons respond broadly to multi-modal threats, it remains unknown how these distinct adaptive processes are individually engaged. We show that while three partially separable subsets of CGRP&lt;sup&gt;PBN&lt;/sup&gt; neurons broadly collateralize to their respective downstream partners, individual projections accomplish distinct functions: hypothalamic and extended amygdalar projections elicit assorted unconditioned threat responses including autonomic arousal, anxiety, and freezing behavior, while thalamic and basal forebrain projections generate freezing behavior and, unexpectedly, contribute to associative fear learning. Moreover, the unconditioned responses generated by individual projections are complementary, with simultaneous activation of multiple sites driving profound freezing behavior and bradycardia that are not elicited by any individual projection. This semi-parallel, scalable connectivity schema likely contributes to flexible control of threat responses in unpredictable environments.</description>

	<title>eLife: Neural signatures of α2-Adrenergic agonist-induced unconsciousness and awakening by antagonist</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57670</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57670</link>
	<description>How the brain dynamics change during anesthetic-induced altered states of consciousness is not completely understood. The α2-adrenergic agonists are unique. They generate unconsciousness selectively through α2-adrenergic receptors and related circuits. We studied intracortical neuronal dynamics during transitions of loss of consciousness (LOC) with the α2-adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine and return of consciousness (ROC) in a functionally interconnecting somatosensory and ventral premotor network in non-human primates. LOC, ROC and full task performance recovery were all associated with distinct neural changes. The early recovery demonstrated characteristic intermediate dynamics distinguished by sustained high spindle activities. Awakening by the α2-adrenergic antagonist completely eliminated this intermediate state and instantaneously restored awake dynamics and the top task performance while the anesthetic was still being infused. The results suggest that instantaneous functional recovery is possible following anesthetic-induced unconsciousness and the intermediate recovery state is not a necessary path for the brain recovery.</description>

Cell migration through a three-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrix (ECM) underlies important physiological phenomena and is based on a variety of mechanical strategies depending on the cell type and the properties of the ECM. By using computer simulations of the cell’s mid-plane, we investigate two such migration mechanisms—‘push-pull’ (forming a finger-like protrusion, adhering to an ECM node, and pulling the cell body forward) and ‘rear-squeezing’ (pushing the cell body through the ECM by contracting the cell cortex and ECM at the cell rear). We present a computational model that accounts for both elastic deformation and forces of the ECM, an active cell cortex and nucleus, and for hydrodynamic forces and flow of the extracellular fluid, cytoplasm, and nucleoplasm. We find that relations between three mechanical parameters—the cortex’s contractile force, nuclear elasticity, and ECM rigidity—determine the effectiveness of cell migration through the dense ECM. The cell can migrate persistently even if its cortical contraction cannot deform a near-rigid ECM, but then the contraction of the cortex has to be able to sufficiently deform the nucleus. The cell can also migrate even if it fails to deform a stiff nucleus, but then it has to be able to sufficiently deform the ECM. Simulation results show that nuclear stiffness limits the cell migration more than the ECM rigidity. Simulations show the rear-squeezing mechanism of motility results in more robust migration with larger cell displacements than those with the push-pull mechanism over a range of parameter values. Additionally, results show that the rear-squeezing mechanism is aided by hydrodynamics through a pressure gradient.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0LW-rCLTGRs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A repeating triplet-sequence &lt;i&gt;ABA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; of non-overlapping brief tones, &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;, is a valued paradigm for studying auditory stream formation and the cocktail party problem. The stimulus is “heard” either as a galloping pattern (integration) or as two interleaved streams (segregation); the initial percept is typically integration then followed by spontaneous alternations between segregation and integration, each being dominant for a few seconds. The probability of segregation grows over seconds, from near-zero to a steady value, defining the buildup function, BUF. Its stationary level increases with the difference in tone frequencies, &lt;i&gt;DF&lt;/i&gt;, and the BUF rises faster. Percept durations have &lt;i&gt;DF&lt;/i&gt;-dependent means and are gamma-like distributed. Behavioral and computational studies usually characterize triplet streaming either during alternations or during buildup. Here, our experimental design and modeling encompass both. We propose a pseudo-neuromechanistic model that incorporates spiking activity in primary auditory cortex, A1, as input and resolves perception along two network-layers downstream of A1. Our model is straightforward and intuitive. It describes the noisy accumulation of evidence against the current percept which generates switches when reaching a threshold. Accumulation can saturate either above or below threshold; if below, the switching dynamics resemble noise-induced transitions from an attractor state. Our model accounts quantitatively for three key features of data: the BUFs, mean durations, and normalized dominance duration distributions, at various &lt;i&gt;DF&lt;/i&gt; values. It describes perceptual alternations without competition per se, and underscores that treating triplets in the sequence independently and averaging across trials, as implemented in earlier widely cited studies, is inadequate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1vsFHX6bz5M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Oligomeric proteins are central to life. Duplication and divergence of their genes is a key evolutionary driver, also because duplications can yield very different outcomes. Given a homomeric ancestor, duplication can yield two paralogs that form two distinct homomeric complexes, or a heteromeric complex comprising both paralogs. Alternatively, one paralog remains a homomer while the other acquires a new partner. However, so far, conflicting trends have been noted with respect to which fate dominates, primarily because different methods and criteria are being used to assign the interaction status of paralogs. Here, we systematically analyzed all &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; oligomeric complexes that include paralogous proteins. We found that the proportions of homo-hetero duplication fates strongly depend on a variety of factors, yet that nonetheless, rigorous filtering gives a consistent picture. In &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; about 50%, of the paralogous pairs appear to have retained the ancestral homomeric interaction, whereas in &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; only ~10% retained a homomeric state. This difference was also observed when unique complexes were counted instead of paralogous gene pairs. We further show that this difference is accounted for by multiple cases of heteromeric yeast complexes that share common ancestry with homomeric bacterial complexes. Our analysis settles contradicting trends and conflicting previous analyses, and provides a systematic and rigorous pipeline for delineating the fate of duplicated oligomers in any organism for which protein-protein interaction data are available.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MC0alpuNUGM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic challenged universities and other academic institutions to rapidly adapt to urgent and life-threatening situations. It forced most institutions to shut down nearly every aspect of their research and educational enterprises. In doing so, university leaders were thrust into unchartered waters and forced them to make unprecedented decisions. Successes and failures along the way highlighted how the autonomous nature of the American academic research enterprise and skillsets normally required of university leaders were ill-suited to mounting an emergency response. Here, as faculty from medical centers in the United States, we draw lessons from these experiences and apply them as we plan for the next possible COVID-19-induced shutdown as well as other large-scale pandemics and emergencies at universities in the United States and throughout the world.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OVez8-R12xM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Effects of IgLON5 Antibodies on Neuronal Cytoskeleton: A Link between Autoimmunity and Neurodegeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25857?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Anti‐IgLON5 disease is a neurological disorder characterized by autoantibodies against IgLON5 and pathological evidence of neuronal‐specific tau accumulation. Here, we report that patients' IgLON5 IgG, but not other cell‐surface antibodies, disrupt the cytoskeletal organization in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, resulting in dystrophic neurites and axonal swelling. Adsorption of IgLON5 IgG with HEK293 cells expressing IgLON5 abrogated the indicated cytoskeletal changes. These findings, along with an increase of levels of neurofilaments in patients' cerebrospinal fluid, suggest that IgLON5 IgG, unlike other cell‐surface antibodies, disrupts neuronal cytoskeleton maintenance, providing a link between autoimmunity and neurodegeneration.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Mechanisms underlying the enhancement of γ‐aminobutyric acid responses in the external globus pallidus of R6/2 Huntington’s disease model mice</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Mechanisms underlying the enhancement of γ‐aminobutyric acid responses in the external globus pallidus of R6/2 Huntington’s disease model mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/338add39-cd22-49a2-a6d2-91cb48400c6c/jnr24710-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses evoked by selective stimulation of indirect pathway striatal neurons are increased in the external globus pallidus (GPe) of R6/2 mice. Using electrophysiology, optogenetics, immunohistochemistry and Western blots we demonstrate that GABA transporter, GAT‐3 function is reduced. This could explain increased decay time of evoked responses in the GPe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Huntington's disease (HD), the output of striatal indirect pathway medium‐sized spiny neurons (MSNs) is altered in its target region, the external globus pallidus (GPe). In a previous study we demonstrated that selective optogenetic stimulation of indirect pathway MSNs induced prolonged decay time of γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses in GPe neurons. Here we identified the mechanism underlying this alteration. Electrophysiological recordings in slices from symptomatic R6/2 and wildtype (WT) mice were used to evaluate, primarily, the effects of GABA transporter (GAT) antagonists on responses evoked by optogenetic activation of indirect pathway MSNs. In addition, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blots (WBs) were used to examine GAT‐3 expression in HD and WT mice. A GAT‐3 blocker (SNAP5114) increased decay time of GABA responses in WT and HD GPe neurons, but the effect was significantly greater in WT neurons. In contrast, a GAT‐1 antagonist (NO‐711) or a GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist (CGP 54626) produced small increases in decay time but no differential effects between genotypes. IHC and WBs showed reduction of GAT‐3 expression in the GPe of HD mice. Thus, reduced expression or dysfunction of GAT‐3 could underlie alterations of GPe responses to GABA inputs from striatum and could be a target for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: PIK3R2/Pik3r2 activating mutations result in brain overgrowth and EEG changes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25890?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25890?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutations in phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate 3‐kinase (PI3K) complex have been associated with a broad spectrum of brain and organ overgrowth syndromes. For example, mutations in phosphatidylinositol‐3‐kinase regulatory subunit 2 (&lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt;) have been identified in patients with megalencephaly‐polymicrogyria‐polydactyly‐hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome, which includes brain overgrowth. To better understand the pathogenesis of &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; related mutations, we have developed and characterized a murine model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We generated a knock‐in mouse model for the most common human &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; mutation, p.G373R (p.G367R in mice) using CRISPR/Cas9. The mouse phenotypes, including brain size, seizure activity, cortical lamination, cell proliferation/size/density, interneuron migration, and PI3K pathway activation were analyzed using standard methodologies. For patients with &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; mutations, clinical data (OFC and epilepsy) were retrospectively obtained from our clinical records (published/unpublished).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PI3K‐AKT pathway was hyperactivated in these mice, confirming the p.G367R mutation is an activating mutation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Similar to patients with &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; mutations, these mice have enlarged brains. We found cell size to be increased but not cell numbers. The embryonic brain showed mild defects in cortical lamination, although not observed in the mature brain. Furthermore, EEG recordings from mutant mice showed background slowing and rare seizures, again similar to our observations in patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have generated a &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; mouse model that exhibits megalencephaly and EEG changes, both of which overlap with human patients. Our data provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of the human disease caused by PIK3R2 p.G373R mutation. We anticipate this model will be valuable in testing therapeutic options for MPPH patients.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Most of animal and human behavior occurs on time scales much longer than the
response times of individual neurons. In many cases it is plausible that these
long time scales emerge from the recurrent dynamics of electrical activity in
networks of neurons. In linear models, time scales are set by the eigenvalues
of a dynamical matrix whose elements measure the strengths of synaptic
connections between neurons. It is not clear to what extent these matrix
elements need to be tuned in order to generate long time scales; in some cases,
one needs not just a single long time scale but a whole range. Starting from
the simplest case of random symmetric connections, we combine maximum entropy
and random matrix theory methods to construct ensembles of networks, exploring
the constraints required for long time scales to become generic. We argue that
a single long time scale can emerge generically from realistic constraints, but
a full spectrum of slow modes requires more tuning. Langevin dynamics that will
generate patterns of synaptic connections drawn from these ensembles involve a
combination of Hebbian learning and activity-dependent synaptic scaling.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Application-specific optical processors have been considered disruptive
technologies for modern computing that can fundamentally accelerate the
development of artificial intelligence (AI) by offering substantially improved
computing performance. Recent advancements in optical neural network
architectures for neural information processing have been applied to perform
various machine learning tasks. However, the existing architectures have
limited complexity and performance; and each of them requires its own dedicated
design that cannot be reconfigured to switch between different neural network
models for different applications after deployment. Here, we propose an
optoelectronic reconfigurable computing paradigm by constructing a diffractive
processing unit (DPU) that can efficiently support different neural networks
and achieve a high model complexity with millions of neurons. It allocates
almost all of its computational operations optically and achieves extremely
high speed of data modulation and large-scale network parameter updating by
dynamically programming optical modulators and photodetectors. We demonstrated
the reconfiguration of the DPU to implement various diffractive feedforward and
recurrent neural networks and developed a novel adaptive training approach to
circumvent the system imperfections. We applied the trained networks for
high-speed classifying of handwritten digit images and human action videos over
benchmark datasets, and the experimental results revealed a comparable
classification accuracy to the electronic computing approaches. Furthermore,
our prototype system built with off-the-shelf optoelectronic components
surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art graphics processing units (GPUs)
by several times on computing speed and more than an order of magnitude on
system energy efficiency.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: A Critical LRRK at the Synapse? The Neurobiological Function and Pathophysiological Dysfunction of LRRK2</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00153</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since the discovery of LRRK2 mutations causal to Parkinson’s disease (PD) in the early 2000s, the LRRK2 protein has been implicated in a plethora of cellular processes in which pathogenesis could occur, yet its physiological function remains elusive. The development of genetic models of LRRK2 PD has helped identify the etiological and pathophysiological underpinnings of the disease, and may identify early points of intervention. An important role for LRRK2 in synaptic function has emerged in recent years, which links LRRK2 to other genetic forms of PD, most notably those caused by mutations in the synaptic protein α-synuclein. This point of convergence may provide useful clues as to what drives dysfunction in the basal ganglia circuitry and eventual death of substantia nigra (SN) neurons. Here, we discuss the evolution and current state of the literature placing LRRK2 at the synapse, through the lens of knock-out, overexpression, and knock-in animal models. We hope that a deeper understanding of LRRK2 neurobiology, at the synapse and beyond, will aid the eventual development of neuroprotective interventions for PD, and the advancement of useful treatments in the interim.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: AAV-Delivered Tulp1 Supplementation Therapy Targeting Photoreceptors Provides Minimal Benefit in Tulp1−/− Retinas</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00891</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With marketing approval of the first ocular gene therapy, and other gene therapies in clinical trial, treatments for inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) have become a reality. Biallelic mutations in the tubby like protein 1 gene (TULP1) are causative of IRDs in humans; a mouse knock-out model (Tulp1−/−) is characterized by a similar disease phenotype. We developed a Tulp1 supplementation therapy for Tulp1−/− mice. Utilizing subretinal AAV2/5 delivery at postnatal day (p)2–3 and rhodopsin-kinase promoter (GRK1P) we targeted Tulp1 to photoreceptor cells exploring three doses, 2.2E9, 3.7E8, and 1.2E8 vgs. Tulp1 mRNA and TULP1 protein were assessed by RT-qPCR, western blot and immunocytochemistry, and visual function by electroretinography. Our results indicate that TULP1 was expressed in photoreceptors; achieved levels of Tulp1 mRNA and protein were similar to wild type levels at p20. However, the thickness of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) did not improve in treated Tulp1−/− mice. There was a small and transient electroretinography benefit in the treated retinas at 4 weeks of age (not observed by 6 weeks) when using 3.7E8 vg dose. Dark-adapted mixed rod and cone a- and b-wave amplitudes were 24.3 ± 13.5 μV and 52.2 ± 31.7 μV in treated Tulp1−/− mice, which were significantly different (p &amp;lt; 0.001, t-test), from those detected in untreated eyes (7.1 ± 7.0 μV and 9.4 ± 15.1 μV, respectively). Our results indicate that Tulp1 supplementation in photoreceptors may not be sufficient to provide robust benefit in Tulp1−/− mice. As such, further studies are required to fine tune the Tulp1 supplementation therapy, which, in principle, should rescue the Tulp1−/− phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: T Cell Responses to Neural Autoantigens Are Similar in Alzheimer’s Disease Patients and Age-Matched Healthy Controls</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a chronic multifactorial and complex neurodegenerative disorder is a leading cause of dementia. Recently, neuroinflammation has been hypothesized as a contributing factor to AD pathogenesis. The role of adaptive immune responses against neuronal antigens, which can either confer protection or induce damage in AD, has not been fully characterized. Here, we measured T cell responses to several potential antigens of neural origin including amyloid precursor protein (APP), amyloid beta (Aβ), tau, α-synuclein, and transactive response DNA binding protein (TDP-43) in patients with AD and age-matched healthy controls (HC). Antigen-specific T cell reactivity was detected for all tested antigens, and response to tau-derived epitopes was particularly strong, but no significant differences between individuals with AD and age-matched HC were identified. We also did not observe any correlation between the antigen-specific T cell responses and clinical variables including age, gender, years since diagnosis and cognitive score. Additionally, further characterization did not reveal any differences in the relative frequency of major Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) subsets, or in the expression of genes between AD patients and HC. These observations have not identified a key role of neuronal antigen-specific T cell responses in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Effects of Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Sleep Time and Efficiency</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00357</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00357</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A single session of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to increase arousal in healthy participants for up to 24 h post-stimulation. However, little is known about the effects of tDCS on subsequent sleep in this population. Based on previous clinical studies, we hypothesized that anodal stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) would produce higher arousal with decreased sleep time and stimulation to the primary motor cortex (M1) would have the converse effect. Thirty-six active duty military were randomized into one of three groups (n = 12/group); active anodal tDCS over the lDLPFC, active anodal tDCS over left M1, or sham tDCS. Participants answered questionnaires 3 times a day and wore a wrist activity monitor (WAM) to measure sleep time and efficiency for 3 weeks. On weeks 2 and 3 (order counterbalance), participants received stimulation at 1800 h before 26 h of sustained wakefulness testing (sleep deprived) and at 1800 h without sleep deprivation (non-sleep deprived). There were no significant effects for the non-sleep deprived portion of testing. For the sleep deprived portion of testing, there were main effects of group and night on sleep time. The DLPFC group slept less than the other groups on the second and third night following stimulation. There is no negative effect on mood or sleep quality from a single dose of tDCS when participants have normal sleep patterns (i.e., non-sleep deprived portion of testing). The results suggest that stimulation may result in faster recovery from fatigue caused by acute periods of sleep deprivation, as their recovery sleep periods were less.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Association Between Amygdala Subfield-Related Functional Connectivity and Stigma Reduction 12 Months After Social Contacts: A Functional Neuroimaging Study in a Subgroup of a Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00356</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00356</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social contact is one of the best methods for reducing stigma, and the effect may be associated with emotional response and social cognition. The amygdala is a key region of these functions and can be divided into three subregions, each of which has a different function and connectivity. We investigated whether the amygdala subregion-related functional connectivity is associated with the effect of anti-stigma interventions on reducing mental health-related stigma in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) over 12 months. Healthy young adults [n = 77, age, mean (SD) = 21.23 (0.94) years; male, n = 48], who were subsampled from an RCT (n = 259) investigating the effect of anti-stigma interventions, using filmed social contacts (FSC) or internet self-learning (INS), on reducing stigma, underwent 10 min resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging between the trial registration and 12 months follow-up. The extent of stigma was assessed at the baseline, post-intervention and 12 month follow-up surveys, using the Japanese-language version of the Social Distance Scale (SDSJ), to assess negative emotional attitude toward people with schizophrenia. We compared associations between amygdala subregion-related functional connectivity and changes in the SDSJ scores for 12 months across the control, INS, and FSC groups. Associations between the change in stigma for 12 months and the superficial (SF) subregion of the amygdala-related connectivity in the intracalcarine cortex [(x, y, z) = (−8, −66, 12), z = 4.21, P&lt;sub&gt;FWE–corrected&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0003, cluster size = 192] differed across groups. The post hoc analysis showed that the SF–intracalcarine cortex connectivity was negatively correlated with the change in stigma only in the FSC group. The current results indicate that greater SF–intracalcarine cortex connectivity is associated with a better response to the FSC interventions, suggesting that biological variability could underlie the long-term effect of anti-stigma interventions on stigma in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Immediate Effects of Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Postural Stability Using Computerized Dynamic Posturography in People With Chronic Post-stroke Hemiparesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00341</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00341</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Postural stability is commonly decreased in individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis due to multisystemic deficits. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive method to modulate cortical excitability, inducing neuroplastic changes to the targeted cortical areas and has been suggested to potentially improve motor functions in individuals with neurological impairments. The purpose of this double-blinded, sham-controlled study was to examine the acute effects of anodal tDCS over the lesioned motor cortex leg area with concurrent limits of stability training on postural control in individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis. Ten individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis received either anodal or sham tDCS stimulation over the lesioned leg region of the motor cortex while undergoing 20 min of postural training. The type of stimulation to receive during the first session was pseudorandomized, and the two sessions were separated by 14 days. Before and immediately after 20 min of tDCS, the 10 m walk test, the Berg Balance Scale, and dynamic posturography assessments were performed. After a single session of anodal tDCS with concurrent postural training, we observed no changes in clinical measures of balance and walking, assessed using the Berg Balance Scale and 10 m walk test. For dynamic posturography assessments, participants demonstrated improvements in adaptation responses to toes-up and toes-down perturbations, regardless of the type of tDCS received. Additionally, improved performance in the shifting center of gravity was observed during anodal tDCS. Taken together, these preliminary findings suggest that tDCS can potentially be used as a feasible approach be incorporated into the rehabilitation of chronic post-stroke individuals with issues related to postural control and fear of falling, and that multiple sessions of tDCS stimulation may be needed to improve functional measures of postural control and walking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper explores in parallel the underlying mechanisms in human perception of biological motion and the best approaches for automatic classification of gait. The experiments tested three different learning paradigms, namely, biological, biomimetic, and non-biomimetic models for gender identification from human gait. Psychophysical experiments with twenty-one observers were conducted along with computational experiments without applying any gender specific modifications to the models or the stimuli. Results demonstrate the utilization of a generic memory based learning system in humans for gait perception, thus reducing ambiguity between two opposing learning systems proposed for biological motion perception. Results also support the biomimetic nature of memory based artificial neural networks (ANN) in their ability to emulate biological neural networks, as opposed to non-biomimetic models. In addition, the comparison between biological and computational learning approaches establishes a memory based biomimetic model as the best candidate for a generic artificial gait classifier (83% accuracy, p &amp;lt; 0.001), compared to human observers (66%, p &amp;lt; 0.005) or non-biomimetic models (83%, p &amp;lt; 0.001) while adhering to human-like sensitivity to gender identification, promising potential for application of the model in any given non-gender based gait perception objective with superhuman performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Neurophysiological Responses of Concussive Impacts: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Studies</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aim: This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated neurophysiological responses using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) following a concussion or sub-concussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A systematic searching of relevant databases for peer-reviewed literature quantifying motor evoked potentials from TMS between 1999 and 2019 was performed. A meta-analysis quantified pooled data for measures including motor threshold, motor latency, and motor evoked potential amplitude and for inhibitory measures such as cortical silent period duration, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Fifteen articles met the inclusion criteria. The studies were arbitrarily classified into the groups, based on time post-concussion, “acute” (subjects 0–3 months post-injury, n = 8) and “post-acute” (3 months−2 years post-concussion, n = 7). A TMS quality of study checklist rated studies from moderate to high in methodological quality; however, the risk of bias analysis found that the included studies were categorised as high risk of bias, particularly for a lack of allocation concealment and blinding of participants in the methodologies. A meta-analysis showed no differences in excitability measures, apart from a decreased motor threshold that was observed in the concussed group (SMD −0.28, 95% CI −0.51 to −0.04; P = 0.02) for the post-acute time frame. Conversely, all inhibitory measures showed differences between groups. Cortical silent period duration was found to be significantly increased in the acute (SMD 1.19, 95% CI 0.58–1.81; P &amp;lt; 0.001) and post-acute (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.12–0.98; P = 0.01) time frames. The SICI (SMD −1.15, 95% CI −1.95 to −0.34; P = 0.005) and LICI (SMD −1.95, 95% CI −3.04 to −0.85; P = 0.005) ratios were reduced, inferring increased inhibition, for the post-acute time frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that inhibitory pathways are affected in the acute period post-concussion. However, persistent alterations in cortical excitability remain, with increased intracortical inhibition. While TMS should be considered as a reliable technique to measure the functional integrity of the central nervous system, the high risk of bias and heterogeneity in data suggest that future studies should aim to incorporate standardised methodological techniques, particularly with threshold determination and stimulus intervals for paired-pulse measures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Inflamed Brain in Schizophrenia: The Convergence of Genetic and Environmental Risk Factors That Lead to Uncontrolled Neuroinflammation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is a disorder with a heterogeneous etiology involving complex interplay between genetic and environmental risk factors. The immune system is now known to play vital roles in nervous system function and pathology through regulating neuronal and glial development, synaptic plasticity, and behavior. In this regard, the immune system is positioned as a common link between the seemingly diverse genetic and environmental risk factors for schizophrenia. Synthesizing information about how the immune-brain axis is affected by multiple factors and how these factors might interact in schizophrenia is necessary to better understand the pathogenesis of this disease. Such knowledge will aid in the development of more translatable animal models that may lead to effective therapeutic interventions. Here, we provide an overview of the genetic risk factors for schizophrenia that modulate immune function. We also explore environmental factors for schizophrenia including exposure to pollution, gut dysbiosis, maternal immune activation and early-life stress, and how the consequences of these risk factors are linked to microglial function and dysfunction. We also propose that morphological and signaling deficits of the blood-brain barrier, as observed in some individuals with schizophrenia, can act as a gateway between peripheral and central nervous system inflammation, thus affecting microglia in their essential functions. Finally, we describe the diverse roles that microglia play in response to neuroinflammation and their impact on brain development and homeostasis, as well as schizophrenia pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: A Primer on Constructing Plasticity Phenotypes to Classify Experience-Dependent Development of the Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00245</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many neural mechanisms regulate experience-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex (V1), and new techniques for quantifying large numbers of proteins or genes are transforming how plasticity is studied into the era of big data. With those large data sets comes the challenge of extracting biologically meaningful results about visual plasticity from data-driven analytical methods designed for high-dimensional data. In other areas of neuroscience, high-information content methodologies are revealing more subtle aspects of neural development and individual variations that give rise to a richer picture of brain disorders. We have developed an approach for studying V1 plasticity that takes advantage of the known functions of many synaptic proteins for regulating visual plasticity. We use that knowledge to rebrand protein measurements into plasticity features and combine those into a plasticity phenotype. Here, we provide a primer for analyzing experience-dependent plasticity in V1 using example R code to identify high-dimensional changes in a group of proteins. We describe using PCA to classify high-dimensional plasticity features and use them to construct a plasticity phenotype. In the examples, we show how to use this analytical framework to study and compare experience-dependent development and plasticity of V1 and apply the plasticity phenotype to translational research questions. We include an R package “PlasticityPhenotypes” that aggregates the coding packages and custom code written in RStudio to construct and analyze plasticity phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Secreted Chaperones in Neurodegeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00268</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, is a combination of cellular processes that govern protein quality control, namely, protein translation, folding, processing, and degradation. Disruptions in these processes can lead to protein misfolding and aggregation. Proteostatic disruption can lead to cellular changes such as endoplasmic reticulum or oxidative stress; organelle dysfunction; and, if continued, to cell death. A majority of neurodegenerative diseases involve the pathologic aggregation of proteins that subverts normal neuronal function. While prior reviews of neuronal proteostasis in neurodegenerative processes have focused on cytoplasmic chaperones, there is increasing evidence that chaperones secreted both by neurons and other brain cells in the extracellular – including transsynaptic – space play important roles in neuronal proteostasis. In this review, we will introduce various secreted chaperones involved in neurodegeneration. We begin with clusterin and discuss its identification in various protein aggregates, and the use of increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clusterin as a potential biomarker and as a potential therapeutic. Our next secreted chaperone is progranulin; polymorphisms in this gene represent a known genetic risk factor for frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and progranulin overexpression has been found to be effective in reducing Alzheimer’s- and Parkinson’s-like neurodegenerative phenotypes in mouse models. We move on to BRICHOS domain-containing proteins, a family of proteins containing highly potent anti-amyloidogenic activity; we summarize studies describing the biochemical mechanisms by which recombinant BRICHOS protein might serve as a therapeutic agent. The next section of the review is devoted to the secreted chaperones 7B2 and proSAAS, small neuronal proteins which are packaged together with neuropeptides and released during synaptic activity. Since proteins can be secreted by both classical secretory and non-classical mechanisms, we also review the small heat shock proteins (sHsps) that can be secreted from the cytoplasm to the extracellular environment and provide evidence for their involvement in extracellular proteostasis and neuroprotection. Our goal in this review focusing on extracellular chaperones in neurodegenerative disease is to summarize the most recent literature relating to neurodegeneration for each secreted chaperone; to identify any common mechanisms; and to point out areas of similarity as well as differences between the secreted chaperones identified to date.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mechanisms of Pathogenic Tau and Aβ Protein Spreading in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00265</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00265</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is pathologically defined by extracellular accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides generated by the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), strings of hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins accumulating inside neurons known as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuronal loss. The association between the two hallmarks and cognitive decline has been known since the beginning of the 20th century when the first description of the disease was carried out by Alois Alzheimer. Today, more than 40 million people worldwide are affected by AD that represents the most common cause of dementia and there is still no effective treatment available to cure the disease. In general, the aggregation of Aβ is considered an essential trigger in AD pathogenesis that gives rise to NFTs, neuronal dysfunction and dementia. During the process leading to AD, tau and Aβ first misfold and form aggregates in one brain region, from where they spread to interconnected areas of the brain thereby inducing its gradual morphological and functional deterioration. In this mini-review article, we present an overview of the current literature on the spreading mechanisms of Aβ and tau pathology in AD since a more profound understanding is necessary to design therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing or halting disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Orderly assembly underpinning built-in asymmetry in the yeast centrosome duplication cycle requires cyclin-dependent kinase</title>

	<description>Asymmetric astral microtubule organization drives the polarized orientation of the &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae &lt;/i&gt;mitotic spindle and primes the invariant inheritance of the old spindle pole body (SPB, the yeast centrosome) by the bud. This model has anticipated analogous centrosome asymmetries featured in self-renewing stem cell divisions. We previously implicated Spc72, the cytoplasmic receptor for the gamma-tubulin nucleation complex, as the most upstream determinant linking SPB age, functional asymmetry and fate. Here we used structured illumination microscopy and biochemical analysis to explore the asymmetric landscape of nucleation sites inherently built into the spindle pathway and under the control of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). We show that CDK enforces Spc72 asymmetric docking by phosphorylating Nud1/centriolin. Furthermore, CDK-imposed order in the construction of the new SPB promotes the correct balance of nucleation sites between the nuclear and cytoplasmic faces of the SPB. Together these contributions by CDK inherently link correct SPB morphogenesis, age and fate.</description>

	<title>eLife: A cross-kingdom conserved ER-phagy receptor maintains endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis during stress</title>

	<description>Eukaryotes have evolved various quality control mechanisms to promote proteostasis in the ER. Selective removal of certain ER domains via autophagy (termed as ER-phagy) has emerged as a major quality control mechanism. However, the degree to which ER-phagy is employed by other branches of ER-quality control remains largely elusive. Here, we identify a cytosolic protein, C53, that is specifically recruited to autophagosomes during ER-stress, in both plant and mammalian cells. C53 interacts with ATG8 via a distinct binding epitope, featuring a shuffled ATG8 interacting motif (sAIM). C53 senses proteotoxic stress in the ER lumen by forming a tripartite receptor complex with the ER-associated ufmylation ligase UFL1 and its membrane adaptor DDRGK1. The C53/UFL1/DDRGK1 receptor complex is activated by stalled ribosomes and induces the degradation of internal or passenger proteins in the ER. Consistently, the C53 receptor complex and ufmylation mutants are highly susceptible to ER stress. Thus, C53 forms an ancient quality control pathway that bridges selective autophagy with ribosome-associated quality control in the ER.</description>

	<title>eLife: An essential role for MEF2C in the cortical response to loss of sleep in mice</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58331</link>
	<description>Neuronal activity and gene expression in response to the loss of sleep can provide a window into the enigma of sleep function. Sleep loss is associated with brain differential gene expression, an increase in pyramidal cell mEPSC frequency and amplitude, and a characteristic rebound and resolution of slow wave sleep-slow wave activity (SWS-SWA). However, the molecular mechanism(s) mediating the sleep loss response are not well understood. We show that sleep-loss regulates MEF2C phosphorylation, a key mechanism regulating MEF2C transcriptional activity, and that MEF2C function in postnatal excitatory forebrain neurons is required for the biological events in response to sleep loss in C57BL/6J mice. These include altered gene expression, the increase and recovery of synaptic strength, and the rebound and resolution of SWS-SWA, which implicate MEF2C as an essential regulator of sleep function.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56086</link>
	<description>The presence and identity of neural progenitors in the enteric nervous system (ENS) of vertebrates is a matter of intense debate. Here we demonstrate that the non-neuronal ENS cell compartment of teleosts shares molecular and morphological characteristics with mammalian enteric glia but cannot be identified by the expression of canonical glia markers. However, unlike their mammalian counterparts, which are generally quiescent and do not undergo neuronal differentiation during homeostasis, we show that a relatively high proportion of zebrafish enteric glia proliferate under physiological conditions giving rise to progeny that differentiate into enteric neurons. We also provide evidence that, similar to brain neural stem cells, the activation and neuronal differentiation of enteric glia are regulated by Notch signalling. Our experiments reveal remarkable similarities between enteric glia and brain neural stem cells in teleosts and open new possibilities for use of mammalian enteric glia as a potential source of neurons to restore the activity of intestinal neural circuits compromised by injury or disease.</description>

	<title>eLife: A broad mutational target explains a fast rate of phenotypic evolution</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54928</link>
	<description>The rapid evolution of a trait in a group of organisms can be explained by the sustained action of natural selection or by a high mutational variance, i.e. the propensity to change under spontaneous mutation. The causes for a high mutational variance are still elusive. In some cases, fast evolution depends on the high mutation rate of one or few loci with short tandem repeats. Here, we report on the fastest evolving cell fate among vulva precursor cells in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis&lt;/i&gt; nematodes, that of P3.p. We identify and validate causal mutations underlying P3.p's high mutational variance. We find that these positions do not present any characteristics of a high mutation rate, are scattered across the genome and the corresponding genes belong to distinct biological pathways. Our data indicate that a broad mutational target size is the cause of the high mutational variance and of the corresponding fast phenotypic evolutionary rate.</description>

	<title>eLife: Cortical RORβ is required for layer 4 transcriptional identity and barrel integrity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.52370</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/52370</link>
	<description>Retinoic Acid-Related Orphan Receptor Beta (RORβ) is a transcription factor (TF) and marker of layer 4 (L4) neurons, which are distinctive both in transcriptional identity and the ability to form aggregates such as barrels in rodent somatosensory cortex. However, the relationship between transcriptional identity and L4 cytoarchitecture is largely unknown. We find RORβ is required in the cortex for L4 aggregation into barrels and thalamocortical afferent (TCA) segregation. Interestingly, barrel organization also degrades with age in wildtype mice. Loss of RORβ delays excitatory input and disrupts gene expression and chromatin accessibility, with down-regulation of L4 and up-regulation of L5 genes, suggesting a disruption in cellular specification. Expression and binding site accessibility change for many other TFs, including closure of neurodevelopmental TF binding sites and increased expression and binding capacity of activity-regulated TFs. Lastly, a putative target of RORβ, &lt;i&gt;Thsd7a&lt;/i&gt;, is down-regulated without RORβ, and &lt;i&gt;Thsd7a&lt;/i&gt; knock-out alone disrupts TCA organization in adult barrels.</description>

	<description>Human brain development is influenced by early-life experiences, particularly during sensitive periods, with impact on cognitive and emotional outcomes. Understanding how the timing and nature of such experiences (including adversity, trauma, and enrichment) govern their influence on brain organization is crucial for harnessing key environmental factors early in life to enhance brain development. Here we synthesize findings from human and animal studies focusing on sensitive periods and their regional and circuit specificity and highlight the challenge and power of such cross-species approaches in informing the ‘next steps’ to optimize cognitive and emotional health in developing children.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by John R. Casey, Michael J. Follows&lt;/p&gt;

Microbes acclimate to changes in substrate availability by altering the number of transporters on the cell surface, however there is some disagreement on just how. We revisit the physics of substrate uptake and consider the steady-state scenario whereby cells have acclimated to maximize fitness. Flux balance analysis of a stoichiometric model of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; was used in conjunction with quantitative proteomics data and molecular modeling of membrane transporters to reconcile these opposing views. An emergent feature of the proposed model is a critical substrate concentration &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;*, which delineates two rate limits. At concentrations above &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;*, transporter abundance can be regulated to maintain uptake rates as demanded by maximal growth rates, whereas below &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;*, uptake rates are strictly diffusion limited. In certain scenarios, the proposed model can take on a qualitatively different shape from the familiar hyperbolic kinetics curves, instead resembling the long-forgotten Blackman kinetics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Bm1t2IRj0pU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Humans’ propensity to acquire literacy relates to several factors, including the ability to understand speech in noise (SiN). Still, the nature of the relation between reading and SiN perception abilities remains poorly understood. Here, we dissect the interplay between (1) reading abilities, (2) classical behavioral predictors of reading (phonological awareness, phonological memory, and rapid automatized naming), and (3) electrophysiological markers of SiN perception in 99 elementary school children (26 with dyslexia). We demonstrate that, in typical readers, cortical representation of the phrasal content of SiN relates to the degree of development of the lexical (but not sublexical) reading strategy. In contrast, classical behavioral predictors of reading abilities and the ability to benefit from visual speech to represent the syllabic content of SiN account for global reading performance (i.e., speed and accuracy of lexical and sublexical reading). In individuals with dyslexia, we found preserved integration of visual speech information to optimize processing of syntactic information but not to sustain acoustic/phonemic processing. Finally, within children with dyslexia, measures of cortical representation of the phrasal content of SiN were negatively related to reading speed and positively related to the compromise between reading precision and reading speed, potentially owing to compensatory attentional mechanisms. These results clarify the nature of the relation between SiN perception and reading abilities in typical child readers and children with dyslexia and identify novel electrophysiological markers of emergent literacy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GrlGEmn0lpk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Thyroid Hormone and Neural Stem Cells: Repair Potential Following Brain and Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00875</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00875</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by chronic neuronal and/or glial cell loss, while traumatic injury is often accompanied by the acute loss of both. Multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mammalian brain spontaneously proliferate, forming neuronal and glial progenitors that migrate toward lesion sites upon injury. However, they fail to replace neurons and glial cells due to molecular inhibition and the lack of pro-regenerative cues. A major challenge in regenerative biology therefore is to unveil signaling pathways that could override molecular brakes and boost endogenous repair. In physiological conditions, thyroid hormone (TH) acts on NSC commitment in the subventricular zone, and the subgranular zone, the two largest NSC niches in mammals, including humans. Here, we discuss whether TH could have beneficial actions in various pathological contexts too, by evaluating recent data obtained in mammalian models of multiple sclerosis (MS; loss of oligodendroglial cells), Alzheimer’s disease (loss of neuronal cells), stroke and spinal cord injury (neuroglial cell loss). So far, TH has shown promising effects as a stimulator of remyelination in MS models, while its role in NSC-mediated repair in other diseases remains elusive. Disentangling the spatiotemporal aspects of the injury-driven repair response as well as the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which TH acts, could unveil new ways to further exploit its pro-regenerative potential, while TH (ant)agonists with cell type-specific action could provide safer and more target-directed approaches that translate easier to clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Oxidative Stress Marker Aberrations in Multiple Sclerosis: A Meta-Analysis Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00823</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress has been suggested to play a key role in multiple sclerosis (MS), but clinical data on oxidative stress markers in MS patients were inconsistent. This study sought to quantitatively summarize the data of oxidative stress markers in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with MS in the literature. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed and Web of Science and included studies if they provided data on the concentrations of oxidative stress markers in the peripheral blood and CSF of MS patients and healthy control (HC) subjects. The systematic search resulted in the inclusion of 31 studies with 2,001 MS patients and 2,212 HC subjects for meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-analysis demonstrated that patients with MS had significantly increased concentrations of blood oxidative stress markers compared with HC subjects for malondialdehyde (MDA; Hedges' g, 2.252; 95% CI, 1.080 to 3.424; p &amp;lt; 0.001) and lipid hydroperoxide by tert-butyl hydroperoxide-initiated chemiluminescence (CL-LOOH; Hedges' g, 0.383; 95% CI, 0.065 to 0.702; p = 0.018). In contrast, concentrations of albumin (Hedges' g, −1.036; CI, −1.679 to −0.394; p = 0.002) were significantly decreased in MS patients when compared with those in HC subjects. However, the other analyzed blood oxidative stress markers did not show significant differences between cases and controls. Furthermore, this meta-analysis showed significant association between CSF MDA and MS (Hedges' g, 3.275; 95% CI, 0.859 to 5.691; p = 0.008). Taken together, our results revealed increased blood and CSF MDA and decreased blood albumin levels in patients with MS, strengthening the clinical evidence of increased oxidative stress in MS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Disrupted Rich Club Organization of Hemispheric White Matter Networks in Bipolar Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00039</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging studies suggest disrupted connections of the brain white matter (WM) network in bipolar disorder (BD). A group of highly interconnected high-density structures, termed the ‘rich club,’ represents an important network for brain functioning. Recent works have revealed abnormal rich club organization in brain networks in BD. However, little is known regarding changes in the rich club organization of the hemispheric WM network in BD. Forty-nine BD patients and fifty-five age- and sex-matched normal controls (NCs) underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Graph theory approaches were applied to quantify group-specific rich club organization and nodal degree of hemispheric WM networks. We demonstrated that rich club organization of hemispheric WM networks in BD was disrupted, with disrupted feeder and local connections among hub and peripheral regions located in the default mode network (DMN) and the control execution network (CEN). In addition, BD patients showed abnormal asymmetry in the feeder and local connections, involving the hub and peripheral regions associated with emotion regulation and visuospatial functions. Moreover, the clinical symptoms of BD showed a significant correlation with the aberrant asymmetry in the regional degree of peripheral regions. These findings reveal that BD is closely associated with disrupted feeder and local connections but no alteration in rich-club connections in the rich club organization of hemispheric WM networks and provide novel insight into the changes of brain functions in BD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Subthreshold Electrical Noise Applied to the Plantar Foot Enhances Lower-Limb Cutaneous Reflex Generation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00351</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00351</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reflex responses generated by cutaneous mechanoreceptors of the plantar foot are important for the maintenance of balance during postural tasks and gait. With aging, reflex generation, particularly from fast adapting type I receptors, is reduced, which likely contributes to impaired postural stability in this population. Therefore, improving reflex generation from these receptors may serve as a tool to improve balance performance. A mechanism to enhance reflexes may lie in the phenomenon of stochastic resonance, whereby the addition of certain intensities and frequencies of noise stimuli improves the performance of a system. This study was conducted to determine whether tactile noise stimuli could improve cutaneous reflex generation. In 12 healthy young adults, we evoked cutaneous reflex responses using a 0–50 Hz Gaussian noise vibration applied to the plantar heel. Concurrently, we applied one of six subthreshold intensities of electrical tactile noise to the plantar heel [0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% or 100% (threshold)] and were able to analyze data from 0%, 20% and 40% trials. Across participants, it was found that the addition of a 20% perceptual threshold (PT) noise resulted in enhanced reflex responses when analyzed in both the time and frequency domains. These data provide evidence that cutaneous reflex generation can be enhanced via a stochastic resonance effect and that 20% PT is the optimal intensity of noise to do so. Therefore, the addition of noise stimuli may be a valuable clinical intervention to improve reflex responses associated with postural balance in populations with impairments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Links Between the Neurobiology of Oxytocin and Human Musicality</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human species possesses two complementary, yet distinct, universal communication systems—language and music. Functional imaging studies have revealed that some core elements of these two systems are processed in closely related brain regions, but there are also clear differences in brain circuitry that likely underlie differences in functionality. Music affects many aspects of human behavior, especially in encouraging prosocial interactions and promoting trust and cooperation within groups of culturally compatible but not necessarily genetically related individuals. Music, presumably via its impact on the limbic system, is also rewarding and motivating, and music can facilitate aspects of learning and memory. In this review these special characteristics of music are considered in light of recent research on the neuroscience of the peptide oxytocin, a hormone that has both peripheral and central actions, that plays a role in many complex human behaviors, and whose expression has recently been reported to be affected by music-related activities. I will first briefly discuss what is currently known about the peptide’s physiological actions on neurons and its interactions with other neuromodulator systems, then summarize recent advances in our knowledge of the distribution of oxytocin and its receptor (OXTR) in the human brain. Next, the complex links between oxytocin and various social behaviors in humans are considered. First, how endogenous oxytocin levels relate to individual personality traits, and then how exogenous, intranasal application of oxytocin affects behaviors such as trust, empathy, reciprocity, group conformity, anxiety, and overall social decision making under different environmental conditions. It is argued that many of these characteristics of oxytocin biology closely mirror the diverse effects that music has on human cognition and emotion, providing a link to the important role music has played throughout human evolutionary history and helping to explain why music remains a special prosocial human asset. Finally, it is suggested that there is a potential synergy in combining oxytocin- and music-based strategies to improve general health and aid in the treatment of various neurological dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Association Between Interictal High-Frequency Oscillations and Slow Wave in Refractory Focal Epilepsy With Good Surgical Outcome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00335</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00335</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have been proposed as a promising biomarker of the epileptogenic zone (EZ). But accurate delineation of EZ based on HFOs is still challenging. Our study compared HFOs from EZ and non-EZ on the basis of their associations with interictal slow waves, aiming at exploring a new way to localize EZ. Nineteen medically intractable epilepsy patients with good surgical outcome were included. Five minute interictal intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) epochs of slow-wave sleep were randomly selected; then ripples (80–200 Hz), fast ripples (FRs; 200–500 Hz), and slow waves (0.1–4 Hz) were automatically analyzed. The EZ and non-EZ were identified by resection range during the surgeries. We found that both ripples and FRs superimposed more frequently on slow waves in EZ than in non-EZ (P &amp;lt; 0.01). Although ripples preferred to occur on the down state of slow waves in both two groups, ripples in EZ tended to be closer to the down-state peak of slow wave than in non-EZ (-174 vs. -231 ms, P = 0.008). As for FR, no statistical difference was found between the two groups (P = 0.430). Additionally, slow wave-containing ripples in EZ had a steeper slope (1.7 vs. 1.5 μV/ms, P &amp;lt; 0.001) and wider distribution ratio (32.3 vs. 30.1%, P &amp;lt; 0.001) than those in the non-EZ. But for slow wave-containing FR, only a steeper slope (1.7 vs. 1.4 μV/ms, P &amp;lt; 0.001) was observed. Our study innovatively compared the different features of association between HFOs and slow wave in EZ and non-EZ from refractory focal epilepsy with good surgical outcome, proposing a new method to localize EZ and facilitating the surgical plan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Why Brain Criticality Is Clinically Relevant: A Scoping Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00054</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The past 25 years have seen a strong increase in the number of publications related to criticality in different areas of neuroscience. The potential of criticality to explain various brain properties, including optimal information processing, has made it an increasingly exciting area of investigation for neuroscientists. Recent reviews on this topic, sometimes termed brain criticality, make brief mention of clinical applications of these findings to several neurological disorders such as epilepsy, neurodegenerative disease, and neonatal hypoxia. Other clinicallyrelevant domains – including anesthesia, sleep medicine, developmental-behavioral pediatrics, and psychiatry – are seldom discussed in review papers of brain criticality. Thorough assessments of these application areas and their relevance for clinicians have also yet to be published. In this scoping review, studies of brain criticality involving human data of all ages are evaluated for their current and future clinical relevance. To make the results of these studies understandable to a more clinical audience, a review of the key concepts behind criticality (e.g., phase transitions, long-range temporal correlation, self-organized criticality, power laws, branching processes) precedes the discussion of human clinical studies. Open questions and forthcoming areas of investigation are also considered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Kainate Receptor Subunit GluK2 Interacts With KCC2 to Promote Maturation of Dendritic Spines</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00252</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00252</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Kainate receptors (KAR) play a crucial role in the plasticity and functional maturation of glutamatergic synapses. However, how they regulate structural plasticity of dendritic spines is not known. The GluK2 subunit was recently shown to coexist in a functional complex with the neuronal K-Cl cotransporter KCC2. Apart from having a crucial role in the maturation of GABAergic transmission, KCC2 has a morphogenic role in the maturation of dendritic spines. Here, we show that in vivo local inactivation of GluK2 expression in CA3 hippocampal neurons induces altered morphology of dendritic spines and reduction in mEPSC frequency. GluK2 deficiency also resulted in a strong change in the subcellular distribution of KCC2 as well as a smaller somatodendritic gradient in the reversal potential of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. Strikingly, the aberrant morphology of dendritic spines in GluK2-deficient CA3 pyramidal neurons was restored by overexpression of KCC2. GluK2 silencing in hippocampal neurons significantly reduced the expression of 4.1N and functional form of the actin filament severing protein cofilin. Consistently, assessment of actin dynamics using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of β-actin showed a significant increase in the stability of F-actin filaments in dendritic spines. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that GluK2-KCC2 interaction plays an important role in the structural maturation of dendritic spines. This also provides novel insights into the connection between KAR dysfunction, structural plasticity, and developmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Related Regional Network Covariance of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Gray Matter in the Rat</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00267</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Healthy human aging has been associated with brain atrophy in prefrontal and selective temporal regions, but reductions in other brain areas have been observed. We previously found regional covariance patterns of gray matter with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in healthy humans and rhesus macaques, using multivariate network Scaled Subprofile Model (SSM) analysis and voxel-based morphometry (VBM), supporting aging effects including in prefrontal and temporal cortices. This approach has yet to be applied to neuroimaging in rodent models of aging. We investigated 7.0T MRI gray matter covariance in 10 young and 10 aged adult male Fischer 344 rats to identify, using SSM VBM, the age-related regional network gray matter covariance pattern in the rodent. SSM VBM identified a regional pattern that distinguished young from aged rats, characterized by reductions in prefrontal, temporal association/perirhinal, and cerebellar areas with relative increases in somatosensory, thalamic, midbrain, and hippocampal regions. Greater expression of the age-related MRI gray matter pattern was associated with poorer spatial learning in the age groups combined. Aging in the rat is characterized by a regional network pattern of gray matter reductions corresponding to aging effects previously observed in humans and non-human primates. SSM MRI network analyses can advance translational aging neuroscience research, extending from human to small animal models, with potential for evaluating mechanisms and interventions for cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Predictive Value of Odor Identification for Incident Dementia: The Shanghai Aging Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00266</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00266</link>
	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to evaluate the value of odors in the olfactory identification (OI) test and other known risk factors for predicting incident dementia in the prospective Shanghai Aging Study.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;At baseline, OI was assessed using the Sniffin’ Sticks Screening Test 12, which contains 12 different odors. Cognition assessment and consensus diagnosis were conducted at both baseline and follow-up to identify incident dementia. Four different multivariable logistic regression (MLR) models were used for predicting incident dementia. In the no-odor model, only demographics, lifestyle, and medical history variables were included. In the single-odor model, we further added one single odor to the first model. In the full model, all 12 odors were included. In the stepwise model, the variables were selected using a bidirectional stepwise selection method. The predictive abilities of these models were evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The permutation importance method was used to evaluate the relative importance of different odors and other known risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Seventy-five (8%) incident dementia cases were diagnosed during 4.9 years of follow-up among 947 participants. The full and the stepwise MLR model (AUC = 0.916 and 0.914, respectively) have better predictive abilities compared with those of the no- or single-odor models. The five most important variables are Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, age, peppermint detection, coronary artery disease, and height in the full model, and MMSE, age, peppermint detection, stroke, and education in the stepwise model. The combination of only the top five variables in the stepwise model (AUC = 0.901 and sensitivity = 0.880) has as a good a predictive ability as other models.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The ability to smell peppermint might be one of the useful indicators for predicting dementia. Combining peppermint detection with MMSE, age, education, and history of stroke may have sensitive and robust predictive value for dementia in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Factors Associated With the Occurrence and Evolution of Recent Small Subcortical Infarcts (RSSIs) in Different Locations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00264</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00264</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent small subcortical infarcts (RSSIs) can occur in different brain regions. Distinct etiologies might be involved for RSSIs in different locations and could further affect RSSI cavitation and functional outcomes. In this study, we aim to analyze the baseline clinical and imaging characteristics associated with the occurrence and cavitation of RSSIs in different locations. We retrospectively include patients who presented with RSSIs from a database for cerebral small vessel disease. Detailed information, including demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data, were collected. We identify baseline RSSIs on diffusion-weighted images and divide them into brainstem, subcortical white matter, and basal ganglia region groups. Cavitation is evaluated on follow-up T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Statistical analysis is performed to determine factors associated with the occurrence and cavitation of RSSIs in different locations. We find that patients with brainstem RSSIs have a higher proportion of diabetes (64.1%) compared to patients with subcortical white matter (27.3%, P &amp;lt; 0.001) and basal ganglia region RSSIs (35.2%, P = 0.006) and have higher levels of HbA1c (7.20%) compared to patients with subcortical white matter (6.10%, P = 0.001) and basal ganglia region RSSIs (6.20%, P = 0.003). In addition, patients with brainstem RSSIs have higher NIHSS scores than patients with subcortical white matter RSSIs (2 vs 0, P = 0.001). Patients with subcortical white matter RSSIs have higher a white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden compared to patients with basal ganglia region RSSIs (21.64 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; vs 11.10 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, P = 0.004). Follow-up analysis demonstrates that basal ganglia region RSSIs are less likely to cavitate than subcortical white matter RSSIs (61.4% vs 83.6%, P = 0.010), and contacting with WMH is associated with the cavitation of subcortical white matter RSSIs (OR: 101.760, P = 0.003). Our study demonstrates that RSSIs in different locations are associated with different clinical and imaging characteristics. Furthermore, cavitation of RSSIs might be affected by local lesion features and the surrounding environment rather than general demographic and clinical factors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: CISD2 Attenuates Inflammation and Regulates Microglia Polarization in EOC Microglial Cells—As a Potential Therapeutic Target for Neurodegenerative Dementia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00260</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00260</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Accumulating evidence has demonstrated a significant association between microglia-driven inflammation in the brain and neurodegenerative dementia. We previously showed a significant decline in CISD2 expression in mice models with advanced age. Moreover, we observed that the knockdown of CISD2 led to remarkable inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in neural cells. In the present study, we investigated whether CISD2 attenuation influences anti-inflammatory effects and M1-M2 polarization in microglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: The knockdown of CISD2 expression by siRNA (siCISD2) in EOC microglial cells was performed to mimic the age-driven decline of CISD2 expression. The extent of the inflammatory reaction, polarization in the M1/M2 spectrum, and NFκB activation were verified in EOC microglial cells exhibiting CISD2 deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In the cellular model of microglia, loss of CISD2 function mediated by siCISD2 exhibited a significant augmentation of proinflammatory signaling, as well as reduced expression levels of Arg-1, Ym1, IL-10, and BCL2. Attenuation of CISD2 expression led to a decrease in the proportion of the M2 phenotype of microglia (compared to M1). Enhanced DNA-binding activity of the NFκB p65 subunit was confirmed in cells transfected with siCISD2, as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report examining the following phenomena: (1) anti-inflammatory effects of CISD2 in microglia via NFκB regulation; and (2) microglial CISD2 assistance in the restoration of M2 microglia phenotype. The anti-inflammatory effects of CISD2 in microglia eventually augment anti-apoptotic effects, which provides a rationale for the development of potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases and neurodegenerative dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This review aimed to systematically summarize the possible neural correlates of cognitive reserve thus giving an insight into prospective biomarkers for the concept. A total of 44 studies were analyzed following PRISMA guidelines and four studies were included in the further analysis. The results indicated a relationship between P3b waveform and cognitive reserve, while more ambiguous outcomes were found when conducting resting-state EEG. This review indicates the first steps into assessing CR using physiological measures; however, more research is needed for deeper understanding of its underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: PARP1 inhibitors trigger innate immunity via PARP1 trapping-induced DNA damage response</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60637</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60637</link>
	<description>It is being increasingly appreciated that the immunomodulatory functions of PARP inhibitors (PARPi) underlie their clinical activities in various &lt;i&gt;BRCA&lt;/i&gt;-mutated tumors. PARPi possess both PARP1 inhibition and PARP1 trapping activities. The relative contribution of these two mechanisms toward PARPi-induced innate immune signaling, however, is poorly understood. We find that the presence of the PARP1 protein with uncompromised DNA-binding activities is required for PARPi-induced innate immune response. The activation of cGAS-STING signaling induced by various PARPi closely depends on their PARP1 trapping activities. Finally, we show that a small molecule PARP1 degrader blocks the enzymatic activity of PARP1 without eliciting PARP1 trapping or cGAS-STING activation. Our findings thus identify PARP1 trapping as a major contributor of the immunomodulatory functions of PARPi. Although PARPi-induced innate immunity is highly desirable in human malignancies, the ability of “non-trapping” PARP1 degraders to avoid the activation of innate immune response could be useful in non-oncological diseases.</description>

	<title>eLife: Cryo-EM analysis of PIP2 regulation in mammalian GIRK channels</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60552</link>
	<description>G protein-gated inward rectifier potassium (GIRK) channels are regulated by G proteins and PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Here using cryo-EM single particle analysis we describe the equilibrium ensemble of structures of neuronal GIRK2 as a function of the C8-PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration. We find that PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shifts the equilibrium between two distinguishable structures of neuronal GIRK (GIRK2), extended and docked, towards the docked form. In the docked form the cytoplasmic domain, to which G&lt;sub&gt;βγ&lt;/sub&gt; binds, becomes accessible to the cytoplasmic membrane surface where G&lt;sub&gt;βγ&lt;/sub&gt; resides. Furthermore, PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binding reshapes the G&lt;sub&gt;βγ&lt;/sub&gt; binding surface on the cytoplasmic domain, preparing it to receive G&lt;sub&gt;βγ&lt;/sub&gt;. We find that cardiac GIRK (GIRK1/4) can also exist in both extended and docked conformations. These findings lead us to conclude that PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; influences GIRK channels in a structurally similar manner to Kir2.2 channels. In Kir2.2 channels, the PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced conformational changes open the pore. In GIRK channels, they prepare the channel for activation by G&lt;sub&gt;βγ&lt;/sub&gt;.</description>

	<title>eLife: Puromycin reactivity does not accurately localize translation at the subcellular level</title>

	<description>Puromycin is a tyrosyl-tRNA mimic that blocks translation by labeling and releasing elongating polypeptide chains from translating ribosomes. Puromycin has been used in molecular biology research for decades as a translation inhibitor. The development of puromycin antibodies and derivatized puromycin analogs has enabled the quantification of active translation in bulk and single-cell assays. More recently, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; puromycylation assays have become popular tools for localizing translating ribosomes in cells. These assays often use elongation inhibitors to purportedly inhibit the release of puromycin-labeled nascent peptides from ribosomes. Using &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiments in various eukaryotic systems, we demonstrate that, even in the presence of elongation inhibitors, puromycylated peptides are released and diffuse away from ribosomes. Puromycylation assays reveal subcellular sites, such as nuclei, where puromycylated peptides accumulate post-release and which do not necessarily coincide with sites of active translation. Our findings urge caution when interpreting puromycylation assays &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

	<description>Puromycin is an amino-acyl transfer RNA analog widely employed in studies of protein synthesis. Since puromycin is covalently incorporated into nascent polypeptide chains, anti-puromycin immunofluorescence enables visualization of nascent protein synthesis. A common assumption in studies of local messenger RNA translation is that the anti-puromycin staining of puromycylated nascent polypeptides in fixed cells accurately reports on their original site of translation, particularly when ribosomes are stalled with elongation inhibitors prior to puromycin treatment. However, when we attempted to implement a proximity ligation assay to detect ribosome-puromycin complexes, we found no evidence to support this assumption. We further demonstrated, using biochemical assays and live cell imaging of nascent polypeptides in mammalian cells, that puromycylated nascent polypeptides rapidly dissociate from ribosomes even in the presence of elongation inhibitors. Our results suggest that attempts to define precise subcellular translation sites using anti-puromycin immunostaining may be confounded by release of puromycylated nascent polypeptide chains prior to fixation.</description>

	<description>Yeast cells undergoing the diauxic response show a striking upstream shift in poly(A) site utilization, with increased use of ORF-proximal poly(A) sites resulting in shorter 3' mRNA isoforms for most genes. This altered poly(A) pattern is extremely similar to that observed in cells containing Pol II derivatives with slow elongation rates. Conversely, cells containing derivatives with fast elongation rates show a subtle downstream shift in poly(A) sites. Polyadenylation patterns of many genes are sensitive to both fast and slow elongation rates, and a global shift of poly(A) utilization is strongly linked to increased purine content of sequences flanking poly(A) sites. Pol II processivity is impaired in diauxic cells, but strains with reduced processivity and normal Pol II elongation rates have normal polyadenylation profiles. Thus, Pol II elongation speed is important for poly(A) site selection and for regulating poly(A) patterns in response to environmental conditions.</description>

	<description>Schistosomiasis is a debilitating parasitic disease infecting hundreds of millions of people. Schistosomes use aquatic snails as intermediate hosts. A promising avenue for disease control involves leveraging innate host mechanisms to reduce snail vectorial capacity. In a genome-wide association study of &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;glabrata&lt;/i&gt; snails, we identify genomic region PTC2 which exhibits the largest known correlation with susceptibility to parasite infection (&amp;gt;15-fold effect). Using new genome assemblies with substantially higher contiguity than the &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria&lt;/i&gt; reference genome, we show that PTC2 haplotypes are exceptionally divergent in structure and sequence. This variation includes multi-kilobase indels containing entire genes, and orthologs for which most amino acid residues are polymorphic. RNA-Seq annotation reveals that most of these genes encode single-pass transmembrane proteins, as seen in another resistance region in the same species. Such groups of hyperdiverse snail proteins may mediate host-parasite interaction at the cell surface, offering promising targets for blocking the transmission of schistosomiasis.</description>

	<title>eLife: The nucleosome DNA entry-exit site is important for transcription termination and prevention of pervasive transcription</title>

	<description>Compared to other stages in the RNA polymerase II transcription cycle, the role of chromatin in transcription termination is poorly understood. We performed a genetic screen in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; to identify histone mutants that exhibit transcriptional readthrough of terminators. Amino acid substitutions identified by the screen map to the nucleosome DNA entry-exit site. The strongest H3 mutants revealed widespread genomic changes, including increased sense-strand transcription upstream and downstream of genes, increased antisense transcription overlapping gene bodies, and reduced nucleosome occupancy particularly at the 3’ ends of genes. Replacement of the native sequence downstream of a gene with a sequence that increases nucleosome occupancy in vivo reduced readthrough transcription and suppressed the effect of a DNA entry-exit site substitution. Our results suggest that nucleosomes can facilitate termination by serving as a barrier to transcription and highlight the importance of the DNA entry-exit site in broadly maintaining the integrity of the transcriptome.</description>

	<title>eLife: Arginine methylation of SHANK2 by PRMT7 promotes human breast cancer metastasis through activating endosomal FAK signalling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57617</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57617</link>
	<description>Arginine methyltransferase PRMT7 is associated with human breast cancer metastasis. Endosomal FAK signalling is critical for cancer cell migration. Here we identified the pivotal roles of PRMT7 in promoting endosomal FAK signalling activation during breast cancer metastasis. PRMT7 exerted its functions through binding to scaffold protein SHANK2 and catalyzing di-methylation of SHANK2 at R240. SHANK2 R240 methylation exposed ANK domain by disrupting its SPN-ANK domain blockade, promoting in co-accumulation of dynamin2, talin, FAK, cortactin with SHANK2 on endosomes. In addition, SHANK2 R240 methylation activated endosomal FAK/cortactin signals in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, all the levels of PRMT7, methylated SHANK2, FAK Y397 phosphorylation and cortactin Y421 phosphorylation were correlated with aggressive clinical breast cancer tissues. These findings characterize the PRMT7-dependent SHANK2 methylation as a key player in mediating endosomal FAK signals activation, also point to the value of SHANK2 R240 methylation as a target for breast cancer metastasis.</description>

Phenotypic variation in the copy number of gene products expressed by cells or tissues has been the focus of intense investigation. To what extent the observed differences in cellular expression levels are persistent or transient is an intriguing question. Here, we develop a quantitative framework that resolves the expression variation into stable and unstable components. The difference between the expression means in two cohorts isolated from any cell population is shown to converge to an asymptotic value, with a characteristic time, &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;, that measures the timescale of the unstable dynamics. The asymptotic difference in the means, relative to the initial value, measures the stable proportion of the original population variance R α 2. Empowered by this insight, we analysed the T-cell receptor (TCR) expression variation in CD4 T cells. About 70% of TCR expression variance is stable in a diverse polyclonal population, while over 80% of the variance in an isogenic TCR transgenic population is volatile. In both populations the TCR levels fluctuate with a characteristic time of 32 hours. This systematic characterisation of the expression variation dynamics, relying on time series of cohorts’ means, can be combined with technologies that measure gene or protein expression in single cells or in bulk.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BAblQzdt3Fo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Firing rate homeostasis counteracts changes in stability of recurrent neural networks caused by synapse loss in Alzheimer’s disease</title>

The impairment of cognitive function in Alzheimer’s disease is clearly correlated to synapse loss. However, the mechanisms underlying this correlation are only poorly understood. Here, we investigate how the loss of excitatory synapses in sparsely connected random networks of spiking excitatory and inhibitory neurons alters their dynamical characteristics. Beyond the effects on the activity statistics, we find that the loss of excitatory synapses on excitatory neurons reduces the network’s sensitivity to small perturbations. This decrease in sensitivity can be considered as an indication of a reduction of computational capacity. A full recovery of the network’s dynamical characteristics and sensitivity can be achieved by firing rate homeostasis, here implemented by an up-scaling of the remaining excitatory-excitatory synapses. Mean-field analysis reveals that the stability of the linearised network dynamics is, in good approximation, uniquely determined by the firing rate, and thereby explains why firing rate homeostasis preserves not only the firing rate but also the network’s sensitivity to small perturbations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jQqBQvPlo5c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Women with bacterial vaginosis (BV), an imbalance of the vaginal microbiome, are more likely to be colonized by potential pathogens such as &lt;i&gt;Fusobacterium nucleatum&lt;/i&gt;, a bacterium linked with intrauterine infection and preterm birth. However, the conditions and mechanisms supporting pathogen colonization during vaginal dysbiosis remain obscure. We demonstrate that sialidase activity, a diagnostic feature of BV, promoted &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; foraging and growth on mammalian sialoglycans, a nutrient resource that was otherwise inaccessible because of the lack of endogenous &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; sialidase. In mice with sialidase-producing vaginal microbiotas, mutant &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; unable to consume sialic acids was impaired in vaginal colonization. These experiments in mice also led to the discovery that &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; may also “give back” to the community by reinforcing sialidase activity, a biochemical feature of human dysbiosis. Using human vaginal bacterial communities, we show that &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; supported robust outgrowth of &lt;i&gt;Gardnerella vaginalis&lt;/i&gt;, a major sialidase producer and one of the most abundant organisms in BV. These results illustrate that mutually beneficial relationships between vaginal bacteria support pathogen colonization and may help maintain features of dysbiosis. These findings challenge the simplistic dogma that the mere absence of “healthy” lactobacilli is the sole mechanism that creates a permissive environment for pathogens during vaginal dysbiosis. Given the ubiquity of &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; in the human mouth, these studies also suggest a possible mechanism underlying links between vaginal dysbiosis and oral sex.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7TBR4CibSDA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Investigation of the effect of dietary intake of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on trauma‐induced white matter injury with quantitative diffusion MRI in mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2d7aa8ec-dc06-465e-8a0d-e739f24745ec/jnr24705-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated potential neuroprotective effects of dietary omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on white matter damage following closed‐head injury in mice. While injured animals exhibited reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the optic tract and brachium compared to the uninjured animals, there was no evidence of neuroprotection from dietary omega‐3 PUFAs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies suggest that long‐term supplementation and dietary intake of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may have neuroprotective effects following brain injury. The objective of this study was to investigate potential neuroprotective effects of omega‐3 PUFAs on white matter following closed‐head trauma. The closed‐head injury model of engineered rotational acceleration (CHIMERA) produces a reproducible injury in the optic tract and brachium of the superior colliculus in mice. Damage is detectable using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, particularly fractional anisotropy (FA), with sensitivity comparable to histology. We acquired &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 38) and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 41) DTI data in mice divided into sham and CHIMERA groups with two dietary groups: one deficient in omega‐3 PUFAs and one adequate in omega‐3 PUFAs. We examined injury effects (reduction in FA) and neuroprotection (FA reduction modulated by diet) in the optic tract and brachium. We verified that diet did not affect FA in sham animals. In injured animals, we found significantly reduced FA in the optic tract and brachium (~10% reduction, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and Bayes factor analysis showed strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. However, Bayes factor analysis showed substantial evidence to accept the null hypothesis of no diet‐related FA differences in injured animals in the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; samples. Our results indicate no neuroprotective effect from adequate dietary omega‐3 PUFA intake on white matter damage following traumatic brain injury. Since damage from CHIMERA mainly affects white matter, our results do not necessarily contradict previous findings showing omega‐3 PUFA‐mediated neuroprotection in gray matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neurochemical phenotype of growth hormone‐responsive cells in the mouse paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ed9ca66c-0b1b-48f9-8f3d-c1ed766bef6c/cne25017-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the capacity of a systemic growth hormone (GH) injection to induce STAT5 phosphorylation in the mouse brain, we identified several neurochemically distinct neuronal populations in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus that are directly responsive to GH, including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)‐, somatostatin (SST)‐, thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH)‐ and corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH)‐producing neurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple neuroendocrine, autonomic and behavioral responses are regulated by the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH). Previous studies have shown that PVH neurons express the growth hormone (GH) receptor (GHR), although the role of GH signaling on PVH neurons is still unknown. Given the great heterogeneity of cell types located in the PVH, we performed a detailed analysis of the neurochemical identity of GH‐responsive cells to understand the possible physiological importance of GH action on PVH neurons. GH‐responsive cells were detected via the phosphorylated form of the signal transducer and activator of transcription‐5 (pSTAT5) in adult male mice that received an intraperitoneal GH injection. Approximately 51% of GH‐responsive cells in the PVH co‐localized with the vesicular glutamate transporter 2. Rare co‐localizations between pSTAT5 and vesicular GABA transporter or vasopressin were observed, whereas approximately 20% and 38% of oxytocin and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) cells, respectively, were responsive to GH in the PVH. Approximately 55%, 35% and 63% of somatostatin, thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH) and corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH) neurons expressed GH‐induced pSTAT5, respectively. Additionally, 8%, 49% and 75% of neuroendocrine TH, TRH and CRH neurons, and 67%, 32% and 74% of non‐neuroendocrine TH, TRH and CRH neurons were responsive to GH in the PVH of Fluoro‐Gold‐injected mice. Our findings suggest that GH action on PVH neurons is involved in the regulation of the thyroid, somatotropic and adrenal endocrine axes, possibly influencing homeostatic and stress responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Evaluating lipid‐lowering drug targets for Parkinson’s disease prevention with Mendelian randomization</title>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25880?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Long‐term exposure to lipid‐lowering drugs might affect Parkinson’s disease (PD) risk. We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses where genetic variants indexed expected effects of modulating lipid‐lowering drug targets on PD. Statin exposure was not predicted to increase PD risk, although results were not precise enough to support benefits for prevention clearly (odds ratio: 0.83; 95% confidence interval: 0.65, 1.07). Other target results were null, except for variants indicating Apolipoprotein‐A5 or Apolipoprotein‐C3 inhibition might confer protection. These findings suggest peripheral lipid variation may not have a prominent role in PD etiology, but some related drug targets could influence PD via alternate pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Neural anatomy of echinoid early juveniles and comparison of nervous system organization in echinoderms</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neural anatomy of echinoid early juveniles and comparison of nervous system organization in echinoderms&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1ab9ab09-4f90-4a8c-96d5-ef7053f05a54/cne25012-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole mount immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used on juveniles of three echinoderm species to characterize their neuroanatomy. Detailed comparisons confirmed the conservation, among the three species, of a tripartite neuroanatomical organization and revealed similar innervation patterns at the level of the appendages (i.e. the podia and the spines).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The echinoderms are a phylum of marine deuterostomes characterized by the pentaradial (five fold) symmetry of their adult bodies. Due to this unusual body plan, adult echinoderms have long been excluded from comparative analyses aimed at understanding the origin and evolution of deuterostome nervous systems. Here, we investigated the neural anatomy of early juveniles of members of three of the five echinoderm classes: the echinoid &lt;i&gt;Paracentrotus lividus&lt;/i&gt;, the asteroid &lt;i&gt;Patiria miniata&lt;/i&gt;, and the holothuroid &lt;i&gt;Parastichopus parvimensis&lt;/i&gt;. Using whole mount immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, we found that the nervous system of echinoid early juveniles is composed of three main structures: a basiepidermal nerve plexus, five radial nerve cords connected by a circumoral nerve ring, and peripheral nerves innervating the appendages. Our whole mount preparations further allowed us to obtain thorough descriptions of these structures and of several innervation patterns, in particular at the level of the appendages. Detailed comparisons of the echinoid juvenile nervous system with those of asteroid and holothuroid juveniles moreover supported a general conservation of the main neural structures in all three species. Our results sustain the hypotheses of previous work for the existence of two neural units in echinoderms: one consisting of the basiepidermal nerve plexus to process sensory stimuli locally, and one composed of the radial nerve cords and the peripheral nerves constituting a centralized control system. This study provides the basis of more in‐depth comparisons of the echinoderm adult nervous system with those of other animals, in particular hemichordates and chordates, to address the long‐standing controversies about deuterostome nervous system evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Photoreceptor morphology and anatomy, including their density distribution and orientation were studied in the skate &lt;i&gt;Leucoraja erinacea&lt;/i&gt;. In addition to a dorsal visual streak, which is typical in elasmobranchs, photoreceptors were noticeably tilted, a finding that has to date not received much attention. Skate &lt;i&gt;L. erinacea&lt;/i&gt; (left), and image of a whole‐mounted retina showing retinal photoreceptors (right).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying retinal specializations offers insights into eye functionality and visual ecology. Using light microscopic techniques, including retinal whole‐mounts, we investigated photoreceptor densities in the retina of the skate &lt;i&gt;Leucoraja erinacea.&lt;/i&gt; We show that photoreceptors are not sized or oriented in the same way, and that they are not evenly distributed across the retina. There was a dorsally located horizontal visual streak with increased photoreceptor density, with additional local maxima in which densities were highest. Photoreceptors were longest and thinnest inside this visual streak, becoming shorter and thicker toward the periphery and toward the ventral retina. Furthermore, in the peripheral retinal parts, photoreceptors (particularly the outer segments) were noticeably tilted with respect to the retinal long axis. In order to understand how photoreceptors are tilted inside the eye, we used computerized tomography (CT) and micro‐CT, to obtain geometrical dimensions of the whole skate eye. These CT/micro‐CT data provided us with the outlines of the skate eye and the location of the retina and this enabled us to reconstruct how photoreceptors tilt in an intact eye. Findings were analyzed relative to previously published ganglion cell distributions in this species, showing a posteriorly located retinal area with photoreceptor:ganglion cell convergence as low as 39:1. Some peripheral areas showed ratios as high as 391:1. We frame our findings in terms of the animal’s anatomy: body and eye shape, specifically the location of the tapetum, as well as the visual demands associated with lifestyle and habitat type. A speculative function in polarization sensitivity is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;A natural endocast of an early Miocene odontocete and its implications in cetacean brain evolution&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1b4bc0cf-6228-403c-88fe-e30c82ac858e/cne25015-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 19‐to‐16 million year old natural endocast of an odontocete whale is described and compared. The exceptional preservation allowed the identification of major neural and vascular characters opening a window into the cetacean brain evolution. The encephalization quotient and other statistical analyses revealed that this endocast belonged to a scarcely encephalized, early‐diverging toothed whale and helped in interpreting a number of morphological changes in odontocete brain evolution.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural endocast MGPT‐PU 13873 is described and analyzed in order to interpret its taxonomic affinities and its potential significance on our understanding of cetacean brain evolution. The endocast is from the early Miocene of Piedmont (between &lt;i&gt;c.&lt;/i&gt; 19 and 16 million years ago), Northwestern Italy, and shows a number of plesiomorphic characters. These include: scarcely rounded cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum exposed in dorsal view with little superimposition by the cerebral hemispheres, short temporal lobe and long sylvian fissure. The distance between the hypophysis and the rostral pons is particularly high, as it was determined by the calculus of the hypothalamus quotient, suggesting that the development of a deep interpeduncular fossa was not as advanced as in living odontocetes. The encephalization quotient of MGPT‐PU 13873 is &lt;i&gt;c.&lt;/i&gt; 1.81, therefore this specimen shows an encephalization quotient in line with other fossil whales of the same geological age (early Miocene). Comparative analysis shows that there is a critical lack of data from the late Miocene and Pliocene that prevents us to fully understand the recent evolution of the EQ diversity in whales. Moreover, the past diversity of brain size and shape in mysticetes is virtually unknown. All these observations point to the need of additional efforts to uncover evolutionary patterns and processes on cetacean brain evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Structure and Functions of Sidekicks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00139</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00139</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) molecules play pivotal roles in cell communication. The Sidekick (Sdk) gene, first described in Drosophila, encodes the single-pass transmembrane protein, Sdk, which is one of the largest among IgSF membrane proteins. Sdk first appeared in multicellular animals during the Precambrian age and later evolved to Sdk1 and Sdk2 in vertebrates by gene duplication. In flies, a single Sdk is involved in positioning photoreceptor neurons and their axons in the visual system and is responsible for dynamically rearranging cell shapes by strictly populating tricellular adherens junctions in epithelia. In vertebrates, Sdk1 and Sdk2 are expressed by unique sets of cell types and distinctively participate in the formation and/or maintenance of neural circuits in the retina, indicating that they are determinants of synaptic specificity. These functions are mediated by specific homophilic binding of their ectodomains and by intracellular association with PDZ scaffold proteins. Recent human genetic studies as well as animal experiments implicate that Sdk genes may influence various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, and depression. The gigantic Sdk1 gene is susceptible to erratic gene rearrangements or mutations in both somatic and germ-line cells, potentially contributing to neurological disorders and some types of cancers. This review summarizes what is known about the structure and roles of Sdks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer MRI Evaluation on the Long-Term Effects of Pulsed Focused Ultrasound and Microbubbles Blood Brain Barrier Opening in the Rat</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Blood-brain barrier opening (BBBO) with pulsed Focused Ultrasound (pFUS) and microbubbles (MB) has received increasing interest as a method for neurotherapeutics of the central nervous system. In general, conventional MRI [i.e., T2w, T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;w, gadolinium (Gd) enhanced T1w] is used to monitor the effects of pFUS+MB on BBBO and/or assess whether sonication results in parenchymal damage. This study employed multimodal MRI techniques and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-Fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to evaluate the effects of single and multiple weekly pFUS+MB sessions on morphology and glucose utilization levels in the rat cortex and hippocampus. pFUS was performed with 0.548 MHz transducer with a slow infusion over 1 min of Optison&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; (5–8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; MB) in nine focal points in cortex and four in hippocampus. During pFUS+MB treatment, Gd-T1w was performed at 3 T to confirm BBBO, along with subsequent T2w, T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;w, DTI and glucose CEST (glucoCEST)-weighted imaging by high field 9.4 T and compared with FDG-PET and immunohistochemistry. Animals receiving a single pFUS+MB exhibited minimal hypointense voxels on T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;w. Brains receiving multiple pFUS+MB treatments demonstrated persistent T2w and T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; abnormalities associated with changes in DTI and glucoCEST when compared to contralateral parenchyma. Decreased glucoCEST contrast was substantiated by FDG-PET in cortex following multiple sonications. Immunohistochemistry showed significantly dilated vessels and decreased neuronal glucose transporter (GLUT3) expression in sonicated cortex and hippocampus without changes in neuronal counts. These results suggest the importance to standardize MRI protocols in concert with advanced imaging techniques when evaluating long term effects of pFUS+MB BBBO in clinical trials for neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Olfaction is in addition to touch the most ancient of our senses, developing already in the womb it decays progressively from 65 years of age with a more pronounced impairment associated with dementia. Despite its clinical relevance and testing accessibility, smell remains an overlooked biomarker, which is rarely used by neurologists in the early screening phase. In this perspective article, we outline the reasons underlying the lack of awareness for this sense. In an attempt to put olfaction forward as an early biomarker for pathological brain aging, we draw a comparison with vision and hearing, regarded as more relevant for general health. This perspective article wants to encourage further studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms responsible for the early smell dysfunction in individuals a decade or more before the onset of cognitive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodynamic Utility Toolbox for Magnetoencephalo- and Electroencephalography (NUTMEG) is an open-source MATLAB-based toolbox for the analysis and reconstruction of magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography data in source space. NUTMEG includes a variety of options for the user in data import, preprocessing, source reconstruction, and functional connectivity. A group analysis toolbox allows the user to run a variety of inferential statistics on their data in an easy-to-use GUI-driven format. Importantly, NUTMEG features an interactive five-dimensional data visualization platform. A key feature of NUTMEG is the availability of a large menu of interference cancelation and source reconstruction algorithms. Each NUTMEG operation acts as a stand-alone MATLAB function, allowing the package to be easily adaptable and scripted for the more advanced user for interoperability with other software toolboxes. Therefore, NUTMEG enables a wide range of users access to a complete “sensor-to- source-statistics” analysis pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Trait Respect Is Linked to Reduced Gray Matter Volume in the Anterior Temporal Lobe</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Respect is a positive other-oriented social emotion upon the recognition of excellence in others. We previously reported that respect-related brain activity in the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL). Since brain activity and structure are often involved in common cognitive functions, we investigated the morphological properties of the left ATL using voxel-based morphometry analysis. We found an association of trait respect with reduced gray matter volume (GMV) in part of the left ATL. Moreover, since the ATL is involved in general conceptual knowledge, we investigated the relationships between other social emotions with similar properties as respect and the GMV of the left ATL. We observed an association of reduced GMV with empathic concern, which is an other-oriented and affective aspect of trait empathy. Our findings indicated an association of the left ATL with other-oriented and affective aspect of social emotions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Activation of Functional Brain Networks in Children With Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures</title>

	<description>Objectives&lt;p&gt;Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) have been hypothesized to emerge in the context of neural networks instability. To explore this hypothesis in children, we applied a graph theory approach to examine connectivity in neural networks in the resting-state EEG in 35 children with PNES, 31 children with other functional neurological symptoms (but no PNES), and 75 healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The networks were extracted from Laplacian-transformed time series by a coherence connectivity estimation method.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Children with PNES (vs. controls) showed widespread changes in network metrics: increased global efficiency (gamma and beta bands), increased local efficiency (gamma band), and increased modularity (gamma and alpha bands). Compared to controls, they also had higher levels of autonomic arousal (e.g., lower heart variability); more anxiety, depression, and stress on the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales; and more adverse childhood experiences on the Early Life Stress Questionnaire. Increases in network metrics correlated with arousal. Children with other functional neurological symptoms (but no PNES) showed scattered and less pronounced changes in network metrics.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The results indicate that children with PNES present with increased activation of neural networks coupled with increased physiological arousal. While this shift in functional organization may confer a short-term adaptive advantage—one that facilitates neural communication and the child’s capacity to respond self-protectively in the face of stressful life events—it may also have a significant biological cost. It may predispose the child’s neural networks to periods of instability—presenting clinically as PNES—when the neural networks are faced with perturbations in energy flow or with additional demands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Physiological and Behavioral Factors in Musicians’ Performance Tempo</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Musicians display individual differences in their spontaneous performance rates (tempo) for simple melodies, but the factors responsible are unknown. Previous research suggests that musical tempo modulates listeners’ cardiovascular activity. We report an investigation of musicians’ melody performances measured over a 12-h day and subsequent changes in the musicians’ physiological activity. Skilled pianists completed four testing sessions in a single day as cardiac activity was recorded during an initial 5 min of baseline rest and during performances of familiar and unfamiliar melodies. Results indicated slower tempi for familiar and unfamiliar melodies at early testing times. Performance rates at 09 h were predicted by differences in participants’ alertness and musical training; these differences were not explained by sleep patterns, chronotype, or cardiac activity. Individual differences in pianists’ performance tempo were consistent across testing sessions: participants with a faster tempo at 09 h maintained a faster tempo at later testing sessions. Cardiac measures at early testing times indicated increased heart rates and more predictable cardiac dynamics during music performance than baseline rest, and during performances of unfamiliar melodies than familiar melodies. These findings provide the first evidence of cardiac dynamics that are unique to music performance contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Rac1 Impairs Forgetting-Induced Cellular Plasticity in Mushroom Body Output Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Active memory forgetting is a well-regulated biological process thought to be adaptive and to allow proper cognitive functions. Recent efforts have elucidated several molecular players involved in the regulation of olfactory forgetting in Drosophila, including the small G protein Rac1, the dopamine receptor DAMB, and the scaffold protein Scribble. Similarly, we recently reported that dopaminergic neurons mediate both learning- and forgetting-induced plasticity in the mushroom body output neuron MBON-γ2α′1. Two open questions remain: how does forgetting affect plasticity in other, highly plastic, mushroom body compartments and how do genes that regulate forgetting affect this cellular plasticity? Here, we show that forgetting reverses short-term synaptic depression induced by aversive conditioning in the highly plastic mushroom body output neuron MBON-γ1pedc&amp;gt;α/β. In addition, our results indicate that genetic tampering with normal forgetting by inhibition of small G protein Rac1 impairs restoration of depressed odor responses to learned odor by intrinsic forgetting through time passing and forgetting induced acutely by shock stimulation after conditioning or reversal learning.

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Cell signaling model for arterial mechanobiology</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Linda Irons, Jay D. Humphrey&lt;/p&gt;

Arterial growth and remodeling at the tissue level is driven by mechanobiological processes at cellular and sub-cellular levels. Although it is widely accepted that cells seek to promote tissue homeostasis in response to biochemical and biomechanical cues—such as increased wall stress in hypertension—the ways by which these cues translate into tissue maintenance, adaptation, or maladaptation are far from understood. In this paper, we present a logic-based computational model for cell signaling within the arterial wall, aiming to predict changes in extracellular matrix turnover and cell phenotype in response to pressure-induced wall stress, flow-induced wall shear stress, and exogenous sources of angiotensin II, with particular interest in mouse models of hypertension. We simulate a number of experiments from the literature at both the cell and tissue level, involving single or combined inputs, and achieve high qualitative agreement in most cases. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of this modeling approach for simulating alterations (in this case knockdowns) of individual nodes within the signaling network. Continued modeling of cellular signaling will enable improved mechanistic understanding of arterial growth and remodeling in health and disease, and will be crucial when considering potential pharmacological interventions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4OLENivxTvA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A novel single-cell based method for breast cancer prognosis</title>

Breast cancer prognosis is challenging due to the heterogeneity of the disease. Various computational methods using bulk RNA-seq data have been proposed for breast cancer prognosis. However, these methods suffer from limited performances or ambiguous biological relevance, as a result of the neglect of intra-tumor heterogeneity. Recently, single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged for studying tumor heterogeneity at cellular levels. In this paper, we propose a novel method, &lt;i&gt;scPrognosis&lt;/i&gt;, to improve breast cancer prognosis with scRNA-seq data. &lt;i&gt;scPrognosis&lt;/i&gt; uses the scRNA-seq data of the biological process Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). It firstly infers the EMT pseudotime and a dynamic gene co-expression network, then uses an integrative model to select genes important in EMT based on their expression variation and differentiation in different stages of EMT, and their roles in the dynamic gene co-expression network. To validate and apply the selected signatures to breast cancer prognosis, we use them as the features to build a prediction model with bulk RNA-seq data. The experimental results show that &lt;i&gt;scPrognosis&lt;/i&gt; outperforms other benchmark breast cancer prognosis methods that use bulk RNA-seq data. Moreover, the dynamic changes in the expression of the selected signature genes in EMT may provide clues to the link between EMT and clinical outcomes of breast cancer. &lt;i&gt;scPrognosis&lt;/i&gt; will also be useful when applied to scRNA-seq datasets of different biological processes other than EMT.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/H_btbruXGNk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Choosing fast and simply: Construction of preferences by starlings through parallel option valuation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000841</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/CMiBQ8bKMe8/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Tiago Monteiro, Marco Vasconcelos, Alex Kacelnik&lt;/p&gt;

The integration of normative and descriptive analyses of decision processes in humans struggles with the fact that measuring preferences by different procedures yields different rankings and that humans appear irrationally impulsive (namely, show maladaptive preference for immediacy). Failure of procedure invariance has led to the widespread hypothesis that preferences are constructed “on the spot” by cognitive evaluations performed at choice time, implying that choices should take extra time in order to perform the necessary comparisons. We examine this issue in experiments with starlings (&lt;i&gt;Sturnus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt;) and show that integrating normative and descriptive arguments is possible and may help reinterpreting human decision results. Our main findings are that (1) ranking alternatives through direct rating (response time) accurately predicts preference in choice, overcoming failures of procedure invariance; (2) preference is not constructed at choice time nor does it involve extra time (we show that the opposite is true); and (3) starlings’ choices are not irrationally impulsive but are instead directly interpretable in terms of profitability ranking. Like all nonhuman research, our protocols examine decisions by experience rather than by description, and hence support the conjecture that irrationalities that prevail in research with humans may not be observed in decisions by experience protocols.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CMiBQ8bKMe8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Metabolic excretion associated with nutrient–growth dysregulation promotes the rapid evolution of an overt metabolic defect</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Robin Green, Sonal, Lin Wang, Samuel F. M. Hart, Wenyun Lu, David Skelding, Justin C. Burton, Hanbing Mi, Aric Capel, Hung Alex Chen, Aaron Lin, Arvind R. Subramaniam, Joshua D. Rabinowitz, Wenying Shou&lt;/p&gt;

In eukaryotes, conserved mechanisms ensure that cell growth is coordinated with nutrient availability. Overactive growth during nutrient limitation (“nutrient–growth dysregulation”) can lead to rapid cell death. Here, we demonstrate that cells can adapt to nutrient–growth dysregulation by evolving major metabolic defects. Specifically, when yeast lysine-auxotrophic mutant &lt;i&gt;lys&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; encountered lysine limitation, an evolutionarily novel stress, cells suffered nutrient–growth dysregulation. A subpopulation repeatedly evolved to lose the ability to synthesize organosulfurs (&lt;i&gt;lys&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;orgS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). Organosulfurs, mainly reduced glutathione (GSH) and GSH conjugates, were released by &lt;i&gt;lys&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; cells during lysine limitation when growth was dysregulated, but not during glucose limitation when growth was regulated. Limiting organosulfurs conferred a frequency-dependent fitness advantage to &lt;i&gt;lys&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;orgS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; by eliciting a proper slow growth program, including autophagy. Thus, nutrient–growth dysregulation is associated with rapid organosulfur release, which enables the selection of organosulfur auxotrophy to better tune cell growth to the metabolic environment. We speculate that evolutionarily novel stresses can trigger atypical release of certain metabolites, setting the stage for the evolution of new ecological interactions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jxdMs7q_oR0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: The history of long‐term potentiation as a memory mechanism: Controversies, confirmation, and some lessons to remember</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23213?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of long‐term potentiation (LTP) provided the first, direct evidence for long‐lasting synaptic plasticity in the living brain. Consequently, LTP was proposed to serve as a mechanism for information storage among neurons, thus providing the basis for the behavioral and psychological phenomena of learning and long‐term memory formation. However, for several decades, the LTP‐memory hypothesis remained highly controversial, with inconsistent and contradictory evidence providing a barrier to its general acceptance. This review summarizes the history of these early debates, challenges, and experimental strategies (successful and unsuccessful) to establish a link between LTP and memory. Together, the empirical evidence, gathered over a period of about four decades, strongly suggests that LTP serves as one of the mechanisms affording learning and memory storage in neuronal circuits. Notably, this body of work also offers some important lessons that apply to the broader fields of behavioral and cognitive neuroscience. As such, the history of LTP as a learning mechanism provides valuable insights to neuroscientists exploring the relations between brain and psychological states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Differential propagation of ripples along the proximodistal and septotemporal axes of dorsal CA1 of rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23211?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23211?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functional connectivity of the hippocampus with its primary cortical input, the entorhinal cortex, is organized topographically. In area CA1 of the hippocampus, this leads to different functional gradients along the proximodistal and septotemporal axes of spatial/sensory responsivity and spatial resolution respectively. CA1 ripples, a network phenomenon, allow us to test whether the hippocampal neural network shows corresponding gradients in functional connectivity along the two axes. We studied the occurrence and propagation of ripples across the entire proximodistal axis along with a comparable spatial range of the septotemporal axis of dorsal CA1. We observed that ripples could occur at any location, and their amplitudes were independent of the tetrode location along the proximodistal and septotemporal axes. When a ripple was detected on a particular tetrode (“reference tetrode”), however, the probability of cooccurrence of ripples and ripple amplitude observed on the other tetrodes decreased as a function of distance from the reference tetrode. This reduction was greater along the proximodistal axis than the septotemporal axis. Furthermore, we found that ripples propagate primarily along the proximodistal axis. Thus, over a spatial scale of ∼1.5 mm, the network is anisotropic along the two axes, complementing the topographically organized cortico‐hippocampal connections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Toll‐like receptor 4 differentially regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis in an age‐ and sex‐dependent manner</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23209?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23209?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) is primarily responsible for initiating an immune response following pathogen recognition. However, TLR4 is also expressed on neural progenitor cells and has been reported to regulate hippocampal neurogenesis as young male TLR4 knockout mice show increases in cell proliferation and doublecortin positive cells. Whether these effects occur in both sexes and are sustained with normal aging is currently unknown. The present study evaluated whether TLR4 deficiency alters adult hippocampal neurogenesis in young (3–4 months) and aged (18–20 months), male and female, TLR4 deficient (TLR4−/−; B6.B10ScN‐Tlr4lps‐del/JthJ) and wild type (WT) mice. Additionally, neurogenesis within the dorsal and the ventral hippocampal subdivisions was evaluated to determine if TLR4 has differential effects across the hippocampus. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered to quantify new cell survival as well as cell differentiation. Ki‐67 was measured to evaluate cell proliferation. Results show that young TLR4−/− females had higher rates of proliferation and neuronal differentiation in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus relative to WT females. Young TLR4−/− males show elevated proliferation and neuronal differentiation mainly in the ventral hippocampus. While young TLR4−/− mice show enhanced neurogenesis compared to young WT mice, the increase was not apparent in the aged TLR4−/− mice. Both aged WT and TLR4−/− mice showed a decrease in proliferation, new cell survival, and neuronal differentiation compared to young WT and TLR4−/− mice. The data collectively indicate that TLR4 regulates hippocampal neurogenesis in young adults, but that these effects are region‐specific in males and that females show broader changes in neurogenesis throughout the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

One debate revolves around the extent to which the ventral hippocampus contributes to spatial navigation and learning. Here, separate small subtotal lesions of dorsal hippocampus or ventral hippocampus alone (destroying 18.9 and 28.5% of total hippocampal volume, respectively) spared reference memory acquisition in the water maze. By contrast, combining the two subtotal lesions significantly reduced the rate of acquisition across days. This constitutes evidence for synergistic integration between dorsal and ventral hippocampus in mice. Evidence that ventral hippocampus contributes to spatial/navigation learning also emerged early on during the retention probe test as search preference was reduced in mice with ventral lesions alone or combined lesions. The small ventral lesions also led to anxiolysis in the elevated plus maze and over‐generalization of the conditioned freezing response to a neutral context. Similar effects of comparable magnitudes were seen in mice with combined lesions, suggesting that they were largely due to the small ventral damage. By contrast, small dorsal lesions were uniquely associated with a severe spatial working memory deficit in the water maze. Taken together, both dorsal and ventral poles of the hippocampus contribute to efficient spatial navigation in mice: While the integrity of dorsal hippocampus is necessary for spatial working memory, the acquisition and retrieval of spatial reference memory are modulated by the ventral hippocampus. Although the impairments following ventral damage (alone or in combination with dorsal damage) were less substantial, a wider spectrum of spatial learning, including context conditioning, was implicated. Our results encourage the search for integrative mechanism between dorsal and ventral hippocampus in spatial learning. Candidate neural substrates may include dorsoventral longitudinal connections and reciprocal modulation via overlapping polysynaptic networks beyond hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Hippocampal‐striatal functional connectivity supports processing of temporal expectations from associative memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23205?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus and dorsal striatum are both associated with temporal processing, but they are thought to play distinct roles. The hippocampus has been reported to contribute to storing temporal structure of events in memory, whereas the striatum contributes to temporal motor preparation and reward anticipation. Here, we asked whether the striatum cooperates with the hippocampus in processing the temporal context of memorized visual associations. In our task, participants were trained to implicitly form temporal expectations for one of two possible time intervals associated to specific cue‐target associations, and subsequently were scanned using ultra‐high‐field 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging. During scanning, learned temporal expectations could be violated when the pairs were presented at either the associated or not‐associated time intervals. When temporal expectations were met during testing trials, activity in left and right hippocampal subfields and right putamen decreased, compared to when temporal expectations were not met. Further, psycho‐physiological interactions showed that functional connectivity between left hippocampal subfields and caudate decreased when temporal expectations were not met. Our results indicate that the hippocampus and striatum cooperate to process implicit temporal expectation from mnemonic associations. Our findings provide further support for a hippocampal‐striatal network in temporal associative processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Ventral hippocampus inactivation enhances the extinction of active avoidance responses in the presence of safety signals but leaves discrete trial operant active avoidance performance intact</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23202?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23202?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition of active avoidance (AA) behavior is typically aided by the presence of two signals—the warning signal, which predicts the future occurrence of an aversive event (e.g., shocks), and the safety signal, which is presented upon successful avoidance of oncoming shocks. While the warning signal could be conceived to act as a Pavlovian fear cue, and is likely mediated by brain areas that underlie Pavlovian fear cue conditioning, the neural substrates underlying safety signaling are less clear, largely due to the unavailability of AA tasks that are devoid of an explicit warning signal. The present study sought to investigate the role of the ventral hippocampus (VH) in safety signaled AA performance acquired without an explicit warning signal, using a novel discrete trial paradigm. Adult male Long Evans rats were divided into two groups and trained to acquire AA responses with, or without a safety signal. Analysis of the acquisition and stable state performance data revealed that the availability of a safety signal alone did not improve the acquisition or performance of AA responses. Furthermore, post‐training, reversible VH inactivation did not impact stable state avoidance behavior. However, extinction of avoidance responses was facilitated in the group trained with a safety signal, and this effect was further potentiated by VH inactivation. Additional elevated plus maze (EPM), light–dark box, and locomotor tests demonstrated that VH inactivation reduced anxiety without affecting locomotor activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of VH in the extinction of persistent pathological avoidance behavior when safety is signaled.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Null mutations of this gene on one copy of chromosome 5 in humans are associated with intellectual disability and seizures. Mice with deletion of one copy of the gene have similar problems and their cortical neurons show enlarged dendritic spines (shown here) with reduced expression of potassium channels, thus predisposing to hyperexcitability which can be normalized with lithium treatment.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Synaptic Loss in Multiple Sclerosis Spinal Cord</title>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25835?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered primarily a result of axonal loss. However, correlation with spinal cord cross‐sectional area—a predictor of disability—is poor, questioning the unique role of axonal loss. We investigated the degree of synaptic loss in postmortem spinal cords (18 chronic MS, 8 healthy controls) using immunohistochemistry for synaptophysin and synapsin. Substantial (58–96%) loss of synapses throughout the spinal cord was detected, along with moderate (47%) loss of anterior horn neurons, notably in demyelinating MS lesions. We conclude that synaptic loss is significant in chronic MS, likely contributing to disability accrual. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:619–625&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Glycine Receptor Autoantibodies Impair Receptor Function and Induce Motor Dysfunction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25832?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25832?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impairment of glycinergic neurotransmission leads to complex movement and behavioral disorders. Patients harboring glycine receptor autoantibodies suffer from stiff‐person syndrome or its severe variant progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Enhanced receptor internalization was proposed as the common molecular mechanism upon autoantibody binding. Although functional impairment of glycine receptors following autoantibody binding has recently been investigated, it is still incompletely understood.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cell‐based assay was used for positive sample evaluation. Glycine receptor function was assessed by electrophysiological recordings and radioligand binding assays. The in vivo passive transfer of patient autoantibodies was done using the zebrafish animal model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycine receptor function as assessed by glycine dose–response curves showed significantly decreased glycine potency in the presence of patient sera. Upon binding of autoantibodies from 2 patients, a decreased fraction of desensitized receptors was observed, whereas closing of the ion channel remained fast. The glycine receptor N‐terminal residues &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;A to &lt;sup&gt;62&lt;/sup&gt;G were mapped as a common epitope of glycine receptor autoantibodies. An in vivo transfer into the zebrafish animal model generated a phenotype with disturbed escape behavior accompanied by a reduced number of glycine receptor clusters in the spinal cord of affected animals.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autoantibodies against the extracellular domain mediate alterations of glycine receptor physiology. Moreover, our in vivo data demonstrate that the autoantibodies are a direct cause of the disease, because the transfer of human glycine receptor autoantibodies to zebrafish larvae generated impaired escape behavior in the animal model compatible with abnormal startle response in stiff‐person syndrome or progressive encephalitis with rigidity and myoclonus patients.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: NMDAR Antibodies Alter Dopamine Receptors and Cause Psychotic Behavior in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25829?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25829?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim was to demonstrate that antibodies from patients with anti‐&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;‐methyl‐&lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis alter the levels of dopamine 1 receptor (D1R) and dopamine 2 receptor (D2R) and cause psychotic‐like features in mice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultured rat hippocampal neurons were treated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis or controls, and the effects on clusters of D1R and D2R were quantified. In vivo studies included 71 C57BL/6J mice that were chronically infused with CSF from patients or controls through ventricular catheters connected to subcutaneous osmotic pumps. Prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startling reflex (PPI; a marker of psychotic‐like behavior), memory, locomotor activity, and the density of cell‐surface and synaptic D1R, D2R, and NMDAR clusters were examined at different time points using reported techniques.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cultured neurons, CSF from patients, but not from controls, caused a significant decrease of cell‐surface D1R and an increase of D2R clusters. In mice, CSF from patients caused a significant decrease of synaptic and total cell‐surface D1R clusters and an increase of D2R clusters associated with a decrease of PPI. These effects were accompanied by memory impairment and a reduction of surface NMDARs, as reported in this model. The psychotic‐like features, memory impairment, and changes in levels of D1R, D2R, and NMDAR progressively improved several days after the infusion of CSF from patients stopped.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to memory deficits and reduction of NMDARs, CSF antibodies from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis cause reversible psychotic‐like features accompanied by changes (D1R decrease, D2R increase) in cell‐surface dopamine receptor clusters.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Haploinsufficiency of Cyfip2 Causes Lithium‐Responsive Prefrontal Dysfunction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25827?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25827?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic variants of the cytoplasmic FMR1‐interacting protein 2 (&lt;i&gt;CYFIP2&lt;/i&gt;) encoding an actin‐regulatory protein are associated with brain disorders, including intellectual disability and epilepsy. However, specific in vivo neuronal defects and potential treatments for &lt;i&gt;CYFIP2&lt;/i&gt;‐associated brain disorders remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized &lt;i&gt;Cyfip2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous (&lt;i&gt;Cyfip2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt;) mice to understand their neurobehavioral phenotypes and the underlying pathological mechanisms. Furthermore, we examined a potential treatment for such phenotypes of the &lt;i&gt;Cyfip2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;+/−&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mice and specified a neuronal function mediating its efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed behavioral analyses of &lt;i&gt;Cyfip2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice. We combined molecular, ultrastructural, and in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological analyses of &lt;i&gt;Cyfip2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; prefrontal neurons. We also selectively reduced CYFIP2 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice with virus injections.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult &lt;i&gt;Cyfip2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited lithium‐responsive abnormal behaviors. We found increased filamentous actin, enlarged dendritic spines, and enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission and excitability in the adult &lt;i&gt;Cyfip2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; PFC that was restricted to layer 5 (L5) neurons. Consistently, adult &lt;i&gt;Cyfip2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed increased seizure susceptibility and auditory steady‐state responses from the cortical electroencephalographic recordings. Among the identified prefrontal defects, lithium selectively normalized the hyperexcitability of &lt;i&gt;Cyfip2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; L5 neurons. RNA sequencing revealed reduced expression of potassium channel genes in the adult &lt;i&gt;Cyfip2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; PFC. Virus‐mediated reduction of CYFIP2 in the PFC was sufficient to induce L5 hyperexcitability and lithium‐responsive abnormal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that L5‐specific prefrontal dysfunction, especially hyperexcitability, underlies both the pathophysiology and the lithium‐mediated amelioration of neurobehavioral phenotypes in adult &lt;i&gt;Cyfip2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice, which can be implicated in &lt;i&gt;CYFIP2&lt;/i&gt;‐associated brain disorders. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:526–543&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Brain Insulin Signaling, Alzheimer Disease Pathology, and Cognitive Function</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25826?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25826?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine associations of molecular markers of brain insulin signaling with Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognition among older persons with or without diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This clinical–pathologic study was derived from a community‐based cohort study, the Religious Orders Study. We studied 150 individuals (mean age at death =87 years, 48% women): 75 with and 75 without diabetes (matched by sex on age at death and education). Using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, and ex vivo stimulation of brain tissue with insulin, we assessed insulin signaling in the postmortem middle frontal gyrus cortex. Postmortem data documented AD neuropathology. Clinical evaluations documented cognitive function proximate to death, based on 17 neuropsychological tests. In adjusted regression analyses, we examined associations of brain insulin signaling with diabetes, AD, and level of cognition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain insulin receptor substrate‐1 (IRS1) phosphorylation (pS&lt;sup&gt;307&lt;/sup&gt;IRS1/total IRS1) and serine/threonine‐protein kinase (AKT) phosphorylation (pT&lt;sup&gt;308&lt;/sup&gt;AKT1/total AKT1) were similar in persons with or without diabetes. AKT phosphorylation was associated with the global AD pathology score (&lt;i&gt;p =&lt;/i&gt; 0.001). In contrast, IRS1 phosphorylation was not associated with AD (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.536). No other associations of insulin signaling were found with the global AD score, including when using the ex vivo brain insulin stimulation method. In secondary analyses, normalized pT&lt;sup&gt;308&lt;/sup&gt;AKT1 was positively correlated with both the amyloid burden and tau tangle density, and no other associations of brain insulin signaling with neuropathology were observed. Moreover, normalized pT&lt;sup&gt;308&lt;/sup&gt;AKT1 was associated with a lower level of global cognitive function (estimate = −0.212, standard error = 0.097; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.031).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain AKT phosphorylation, a critical node in the signaling of insulin and other growth factors, is associated with AD neuropathology and lower cognitive function. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:513–525&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Alpha‐Synuclein Oligomers and Neurofilament Light Chain in Spinal Fluid Differentiate Multiple System Atrophy from Lewy Body Synucleinopathies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25824?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25824?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the role of alpha‐synuclein (αSyn) oligomers and neurofilament light chain (NFL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as markers of early multiple system atrophy (MSA) and to contrast findings with Lewy body synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a discovery cohort of well‐characterized early MSA patients (n = 24) and matched healthy controls (CON, n = 14), we utilized enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay to measure NFL and protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) to detect αSyn oligomers in CSF. We confirmed findings in a separate prospectively enrolled cohort of patients with early MSA (n = 38), Parkinson disease (PD, n = 16), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n = 13), and CON subjects (n = 15).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discovery cohort, NFL was markedly elevated in MSA patients, with perfect separation from CON. αSyn‐PMCA was nonreactive in all CON, whereas all MSA samples were positive. In the confirmatory cohort, NFL again perfectly separated MSA from CON, and was significantly lower in PD and DLB compared to MSA. PMCA was again nonreactive in all CON, and positive in all but 2 MSA cases. All PD and all but 2 DLB samples were also positive for αSyn aggregates but with markedly different reaction kinetics from MSA; aggregation occurred later, but maximum fluorescence was higher, allowing for perfect separation of reactive samples between MSA and Lewy body synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFL and αSyn oligomers in CSF faithfully differentiate early MSA not only from CON but also from Lewy body synucleinopathies. The findings support the role of these markers as diagnostic biomarkers, and have important implications for understanding pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the synucleinopathies.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Drug‐Responsive Inhomogeneous Cortical Modulation by Direct Current Stimulation</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cathodal direct current stimulation (cDCS) induces long‐term depression (LTD)‐like reduction of cortical excitability (DCS‐LTD), which has been tested in the treatment of epilepsy with modest effects. In part, this may be due to variable cortical neuron orientation relative to the electric field. We tested, in vivo and in vitro, whether DCS‐LTD occurs throughout the cortical thickness, and if not, then whether drug–DCS pairing can enhance the uniformity of the cortical response and the cDCS antiepileptic effect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cDCS‐mediated changes in cortical excitability were measured in vitro in mouse motor cortex (M1) and in human postoperative neocortex, in vivo in mouse somatosensory cortex (S1), and in a mouse kainic acid (KA)‐seizure model. Contributions of N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate–type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) to cDCS‐mediated plasticity were tested with application of NMDAR blockers (memantine/D‐AP5).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cDCS reliably induced DCS‐LTD in superficial cortical layers, and a long‐term potentiation (LTP)‐like enhancement (DCS‐LTP) was recorded in deep cortical layers. Immunostaining confirmed layer‐specific increase of phospho‐S6 ribosomal protein in mouse M1. Similar nonuniform cDCS aftereffects on cortical excitability were also found in human neocortex in vitro and in S1 of alert mice in vivo. Application of memantine/D‐AP5 either produced a more uniform DCS‐LTD throughout the cortical thickness or at least abolished DCS‐LTP. Moreover, a combination of memantine and cDCS suppressed KA‐induced seizures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cDCS aftereffects are not uniform throughout cortical layers, which may explain the incomplete cDCS clinical efficacy. NMDAR antagonists may augment cDCS efficacy in epilepsy and other disorders where regional depression of cortical excitability is desirable. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:489–502&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Classification of Facial Expressions for Intended Display of Emotions Using Brain–Computer Interfaces</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25821?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Facial expressions are important for intentional display of emotions in social interaction. For people with severe paralysis, the ability to display emotions intentionally can be impaired. Current brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) allow for linguistic communication but are cumbersome for expressing emotions. Here, we investigated the feasibility of a BCI to display emotions by decoding facial expressions. We used electrocorticographic recordings from the sensorimotor cortex of people with refractory epilepsy and classified five facial expressions, based on neural activity. The mean classification accuracy was 72%. This approach could be a promising avenue for development of BCI‐based solutions for fast communication of emotions.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Vision Therapy: Ocular Motor Training in Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25820?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25820?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vision therapy in the form of ocular motor training is increasingly used to treat visual complaints, particularly in the setting of persistent symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). In this review, we discuss the rationale behind this intervention and the evidence for its utility. Although the efficacy of exercises for primary convergence insufficiency is plausible and supported by data, there is not yet strong evidence of benefit for the post‐traumatic variant. It is not established that abnormalities in fixation, pursuit, and saccades in mTBI are the cause of post‐concussive symptoms, or that these abnormalities arise from ocular motor damage rather than being secondary effects of cognitive problems with attention or executive control. The few studies to date have significant methodological weaknesses. More substantial evidence is required before vision therapy can be accepted as a useful tool in the rehabilitation of patients with brain trauma. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:453–461&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Cannabinoid receptor Type 1 densities reflect social organization in Microtus</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Cannabinoid receptor Type 1 densities reflect social organization in Microtus&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2d5b4470-11a2-48d7-b505-3336e7946362/cne24996-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Validation of [3H] CP‐55,940 for autoradiography of endocannabinoid receptors in prairie vole brains. Three adjacent sections of brain tissue were incubated with [3H] CP‐55,940 with or without an unlabeled receptor competitor. Coincubation of the radioligand with the CB2 blocker (HU308) had no discernible impact on binding in the hippocampus but increased binding in the prefrontal cortex relative to control. Coincubation of the radioligand with the CB1 blocker (AM251) significantly decreased signal in both regions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across many species, endocannabinoids play an important role in regulating social play, reward, and anxiety. These processes are mediated through at least two distinct cannabinoid receptors (CB), CB1 and CB2. CB1 expression is found in appreciable densities across regions of the brain that integrate memory with socio‐spatial information; many of these regions have been directly linked to the neurobiology of pair bonding in monogamous species. Using receptor autoradiography, we provide the first distributional map of CB1 within the brains of closely related monogamous prairie voles and promiscuous meadow voles, and compare receptor densities across sexes and species in limbic regions. We observe CB1‐specific signal using [3H] CP‐55,940 and [3H] SR141716A, though the latter exhibited a lower signal to noise ratio. We confirmed the presence of CB2 in prairie vole spleen tissue using [3H] CP‐55,940. However, we found no evidence of CB2 in the brain using either [3H] CP‐55,940 or [3H] A‐836,339. The overall distribution of putative CB1 in the brain was similar across vole species and followed the pattern of CB1 expression observed in other species—high intensity binding within the telencephalon, moderate binding within the diencephalon, and mild binding within the mesencephalon and metencephalon (aside from the cerebellar cortex). However, we found profound differences in CB1 densities across species, with prairie voles having higher CB1 binding in regions implicated in social attachment and spatial memory (e.g., periaqueductal gray, hippocampus). These findings suggest that CB1 densities, but not distribution, correlate with the social systems of vole species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: The function of medial temporal lobe and posterior middle temporal gyrus in forming creative associations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23253?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23253?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the function of the hippocampus and adjacent medial temporal lobe (MTL) areas in forming associations is generally recognized, how MTL contributes to form creative associations that could result in novel and appropriate functions or meanings remains unclear. In this study, we compared highly creative combinations (HCCs) of two objects (e.g., that of “lifejacket” and “distress signal device”) that resulted in genuine innovative designs comprising additionally unprecedented functions (the “1 + 1 &amp;gt; 2” effects) with the lowly creative combinations (LCCs, e.g., the combination of “set‐top box” and “jewelry box”) that resulted in nothing more than simple “1 + 1 = 2” effects. The event‐related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study found that during the “early binding phase,” when the combinations of the two objects were initially encoded, the right parahippocampus was more intensively activated during the encoding of HCC relative to LCC trials. However, during the “late integration phase,” when participants finally formed a holistic mental representation of new products based on the two‐object combinations, both HCCs and LCCs were found to be associated with significantly increased hippocampal and parahippocampal activation relative to the baseline condition, but at a similar level. In this “late integration phase,” the functional areas appeared to be more intensively activated in HCCs relative to LCCs located in the posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), the area known to mediate category‐related processing. Consistently, our supplementary behavioral study found that, relative to LCCs, HCCs had a higher possibility of resulting in some new conceptual expansions that differed from each of the original two objects that constituted the combinations. These findings indicate that the formation of creative combinations not only require MTL‐based novel association‐formation, but also pMTG‐based novel concept‐expansion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: The ratio of posterior–anterior medial temporal lobe volumes predicts source memory performance in healthy young adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23251?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23251?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A functional gradient has been proposed across the medial temporal lobes (MTL) such that the anterior MTL is thought to support processing of individual items (e.g., item memory and complex object perception), whereas the posterior MTL is thought to support item‐context retrieval (e.g., source memory). Whereas functional imaging studies have provided evidence supporting this anatomical organization, results from structural analyses remain inconclusive. The current study examined the relationship between volume of MTL regions of interest (ROIs), and performance on a source memory task and a fine‐grain complex object perception task, in healthy young adults (mean age = 21.5, range = 18–29). Using a semiautomated procedure, we segmented the parahippocampal and perirhinal cortices (PHC, PRC), posteromedial and anterolateral entorhinal cortices (pmERC, alERC), and posterior and anterior hippocampus (postHC, antHC) on high‐resolution T2‐weighted MRIs. Regional volumes were computed as proportions of intracranial volume, and as posterior–anterior volumetric ratios (PHC:PRC, pmERC:alERC, postHC:antHC). Partial‐least squares regressions were applied to predict source and item memory, and perceptual discrimination accuracy, based on ROI and ratio volumes. In our ROI regressions, we found that postHC volume was positively correlated with a latent factor predicting source memory, and PRC and antHC volumes were negatively correlated to this latent factor. In our ratio regressions, we observed an effect relating the posterior–anterior distribution of gray matter across the MTL with source memory. Our results demonstrate differential associations between anterior and posterior MTL and source memory performance. Findings from this study highlight the importance of considering patterns of structure–behavior associations in the neurobiology of episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Intracortical Circuits in the Contralesional Primary Motor Cortex in Patients With Chronic Stroke After Botulinum Toxin Type A Injection: Case Studies</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spasticity and motor recovery are both related to neural plasticity after stroke. A balance of activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) in both hemispheres is essential for functional recovery. In this study, we assessed the intracortical inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in the contralesional M1 area in four patients with severe upper limb spasticity after chronic stroke and treated with botulinum toxin-A (BoNT-A) injection and 12 weeks of upper limb rehabilitation. There was little to no change in the level of spasticity post-injection, and only one participant experienced a small improvement in arm function. All reported improvements in quality of life. However, the levels of intracortical inhibition and facilitation in the contralesional hemisphere were different at baseline for all four participants, and there was no clear pattern in the response to the intervention. Further investigation is needed to understand how BoNT-A injections affect inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in the contralesional hemisphere, the severity of spasticity, and functional improvement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Genetic and functional analysis of a Pacific hagfish opioid system&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7dfef525-3be2-417b-99f1-07738f913fb0/jnr24682-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cartoon depicting evolution of endogenous opioid systems. Our findings in this paper show the identification of an authentic mammalian‐like endogenous opioid system in the Pacific Hagfish with no evidence for opioid systems in invertebrate genomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actions of endogenous opioids and nociceptin/orphanin FQ are mediated by four homologous G protein‐coupled receptors that constitute the opioid receptor family. However, little is known about opioid systems in cyclostomes (living jawless fish) and how opioid systems might have evolved from invertebrates. Here, we leveraged de novo transcriptome and low‐coverage whole‐genome assembly in the Pacific hagfish (&lt;i&gt;Eptatretus stoutii&lt;/i&gt;) to identify and characterize the first full‐length coding sequence for a functional opioid receptor in a cyclostome. Additionally, we define two novel endogenous opioid precursors in this species that predict several novel opioid peptides. Bioinformatic analysis shows no closely related opioid receptor genes in invertebrates with regard either to the genomic organization or to conserved opioid receptor‐specific sequences that are common in all vertebrates. Furthermore, no proteins analogous to vertebrate opioid precursors could be identified by genomic searches despite previous claims of protein or RNA‐derived sequences in several invertebrate species. The presence of an expressed orthologous receptor and opioid precursors in the Pacific hagfish confirms that a functional opioid system was likely present in the common ancestor of all extant vertebrates some 550 million years ago, earlier than all previous authenticated accounts. We discuss the premise that the cyclostome and vertebrate opioid systems evolved from invertebrate systems concerned with antimicrobial defense and speculate that the high concentrations of opioid precursors in tissues such as the testes, gut, and activated immune cells are key remnants of this evolutionary role.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum is a neurodegenerative disease due to mutations in TUBB4A. Auditory evoked potentials are abnormal in this disease. Human mutation D249N impairs central function. A302T‐mutant &lt;i&gt;taiep&lt;/i&gt; rats presents longer latencies in central waves. Both mutations severely impair the central hearing pathway by progressive central white matter degeneration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (H‐ABC) is a neurodegenerative disease due to mutations in TUBB4A. Patients suffer from extrapyramidal movements, spasticity, ataxia, and cognitive deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging features are hypomyelination and atrophy of the striatum and cerebellum. A correlation between the mutations and their cellular, tissue and organic effects is largely missing. The effects of these mutations on sensory functions have not been described so far. We have previously reported a rat carrying a TUBB4A (A302T) mutation and sharing most of the clinical and radiological signs with H‐ABC patients. Here, for the first time, we did a comparative study of the hearing function in an H‐ABC patient and in this mutant model. By analyzing hearing function, we found that there are no significant differences in the auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds between mutant rats and WT controls. Nevertheless, ABRs show longer latencies in central waves (II–IV) that in some cases disappear when compared to WT. The patient also shows abnormal AEPs presenting only Waves I and II. Distortion product of otoacoustic emissions and immunohistochemistry in the rat show that the peripheral hearing function and morphology of the organ of Corti are normal. We conclude that the tubulin mutation severely impairs the central hearing pathway most probably by progressive central white matter degeneration. Hearing function might be affected in a significant fraction of patients with H‐ABC; therefore, screening for auditory function should be done on patients with tubulinopathies to evaluate hearing support therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Management strategies for control of vector-borne diseases, for example Zika or dengue, include using larvicide and/or adulticide, either through large-scale application by truck or plane or through door-to-door efforts that require obtaining permission to access private property and spray yards. The efficacy of the latter strategy is highly dependent on the compliance of local residents. Here we develop a model for vector-borne disease transmission between mosquitoes and humans in a neighborhood setting, considering a network of houses connected via nearest-neighbor mosquito movement. We incorporate large-scale application of adulticide via aerial spraying through a uniform increase in vector death rates in all sites, and door-to-door application of larval source reduction and adulticide through a decrease in vector emergence rates and an increase in vector death rates in compliant sites only, where control efficacies are directly connected to real-world experimentally measurable control parameters, application frequencies, and control costs. To develop mechanistic insight into the influence of vector motion and compliance clustering on disease controllability, we determine the the basic reproduction number &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for the system, provide analytic results for the extreme cases of no mosquito movement, infinite hopping rates, and utilize degenerate perturbation theory for the case of slow but non-zero hopping rates. We then determine the application frequencies required for each strategy (alone and combined) in order to reduce &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to unity, along with the associated costs. Cost-optimal strategies are found to depend strongly on mosquito hopping rates, levels of door-to-door compliance, and spatial clustering of compliant houses, and can include aerial spray alone, door-to-door treatment alone, or a combination of both. The optimization scheme developed here provides a flexible tool for disease management planners which translates modeling results into actionable control advice adaptable to system-specific details.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5-4Cq1nPXDU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Template-based mapping of dynamic motifs in tissue morphogenesis</title>

Tissue morphogenesis relies on repeated use of dynamic behaviors at the levels of intracellular structures, individual cells, and cell groups. Rapidly accumulating live imaging datasets make it increasingly important to formalize and automate the task of mapping recurrent dynamic behaviors (motifs), as it is done in speech recognition and other data mining applications. Here, we present a “template-based search” approach for accurate mapping of sub- to multi-cellular morphogenetic motifs using a time series data mining framework. We formulated the task of motif mapping as a subsequence matching problem and solved it using dynamic time warping, while relying on high throughput graph-theoretic algorithms for efficient exploration of the search space. This formulation allows our algorithm to accurately identify the complete duration of each instance and automatically label different stages throughout its progress, such as cell cycle phases during cell division. To illustrate our approach, we mapped cell intercalations during germband extension in the early &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryo. Our framework enabled statistical analysis of intercalary cell behaviors in wild-type and mutant embryos, comparison of temporal dynamics in contracting and growing junctions in different genotypes, and the identification of a novel mode of iterative cell intercalation. Our formulation of tissue morphogenesis using time series opens new avenues for systematic decomposition of tissue morphogenesis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TK83tSWZtVg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Simulating flow induced migration in vascular remodelling</title>

Shear stress induces directed endothelial cell (EC) migration in blood vessels leading to vessel diameter increase and induction of vascular maturation. Other factors, such as EC elongation and interaction between ECs and non-vascular areas are also important. Computational models have previously been used to study collective cell migration. These models can be used to predict EC migration and its effect on vascular remodelling during embryogenesis. We combined live time-lapse imaging of the remodelling vasculature of the quail embryo yolk sac with flow quantification using a combination of micro-Particle Image Velocimetry and computational fluid dynamics. We then used the flow and remodelling data to inform a model of EC migration during remodelling. To obtain the relation between shear stress and velocity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; for EC cells, we developed a flow chamber to assess how confluent sheets of ECs migrate in response to shear stress. Using these data as an input, we developed a multiphase, self-propelled particles (SPP) model where individual agents are driven to migrate based on the level of shear stress while maintaining appropriate spatial relationship to nearby agents. These agents elongate, interact with each other, and with avascular agents at each time-step of the model. We compared predicted vascular shape to real vascular shape after 4 hours from our time-lapse movies and performed sensitivity analysis on the various model parameters. Our model shows that shear stress has the largest effect on the remodelling process. Importantly, however, elongation played an especially important part in remodelling. This model provides a powerful tool to study the input of different biological processes on remodelling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jh8yMFKwZnU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Genomic epidemiology can provide a unique, real-time understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns. Yet the potential for genomic analyses to guide local policy and community-based behavioral decisions is limited because they are often oriented towards specially trained scientists and conducted on a national or global scale. Here, we propose a new paradigm: Phylogenetic analyses performed on a local level (municipal, county, or state), with results communicated in a clear, timely, and actionable manner to strengthen public health responses. We believe that presenting results rapidly, and tailored to a non-expert audience, can serve as a template for effective public health response to COVID-19 and other emerging viral diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QU8piv4kS-E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

High levels of the amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide have been shown to disrupt neuronal function and induce hyperexcitability, but it is unclear what effects Aβ-associated hyperexcitability may have on tauopathy pathogenesis or propagation in vivo. Using a novel transgenic mouse line to model the impact of human APP (hAPP)/Aβ accumulation on tauopathy in the entorhinal cortex–hippocampal (EC-HIPP) network, we demonstrate that hAPP overexpression aggravates EC-Tau aggregation and accelerates pathological tau spread into the hippocampus. In vivo recordings revealed a strong role for hAPP/Aβ, but not tau, in the emergence of EC neuronal hyperactivity and impaired theta rhythmicity. Chronic chemogenetic attenuation of EC neuronal hyperactivity led to reduced hAPP/Aβ accumulation and reduced pathological tau spread into downstream hippocampus. These data strongly support the hypothesis that in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Aβ-associated hyperactivity accelerates the progression of pathological tau along vulnerable neuronal circuits, and demonstrates the utility of chronic, neuromodulatory approaches in ameliorating AD pathology in vivo.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/72Wsaso3B-M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There are a pressing and unmet need for effective therapies for freezing of gait (FOG) and other neurological gait disorders. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of a midbrain target known as the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) was proposed as a potential treatment based on its postulated involvement in locomotor control as part of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR). However, DBS trials fell short of expectations, leading many clinicians to abandon this strategy. Here, we discuss the potential reasons for this failure and review recent clinical data along with preclinical optogenetics evidence to argue that another nearby nucleus, the cuneiform nucleus (CnF), may be a superior target.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or any other dementia subtype. The renaissance in psychedelic research in recent years, in particular studies involving psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), coupled with anecdotal reports of cognitive benefits from micro-dosing, suggests that they may have a therapeutic role in a range of psychiatric and neurological conditions due to their potential to stimulate neurogenesis, provoke neuroplastic changes and reduce neuroinflammation. This inevitably makes them interesting candidates for therapeutics in dementia. This mini-review will look at the basic science and current clinical evidence for the role of psychedelics in treating dementia, especially early AD, with a particular focus on micro-dosing of the classical psychedelics LSD and psilocybin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: MicroRNAs in Alzheimer’s Disease: Function and Potential Applications as Diagnostic Biomarkers</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Although the incidence of AD is high, the rates of diagnosis and treatment are relatively low. Moreover, effective means for the diagnosis and treatment of AD are still lacking. MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are non-coding RNAs that play regulatory roles by targeting mRNAs. The expression of miRNAs is conserved, temporal, and tissue-specific. Impairment of microRNA function is closely related to AD pathogenesis, including the beta-amyloid and tau hallmarks of AD, and there is evidence that the expression of some microRNAs differs significantly between healthy people and AD patients. These properties of miRNAs endow them with potential diagnostic and therapeutic value in the treatment of this debilitating disease. This review provides comprehensive information about the regulatory function of miRNAs in AD, as well as potential applications as diagnostic biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Tau-Mediated Dysregulation of Neuroplasticity and Glial Plasticity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The inability of individual neurons to compensate for aging-related damage leads to a gradual loss of functional plasticity in the brain accompanied by progressive impairment in learning and memory. Whereas this loss in neuroplasticity is gradual during normal aging, in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), this loss is accelerated dramatically, leading to the incapacitation of patients within a decade of onset of cognitive symptoms. The mechanisms that underlie this accelerated loss of neuroplasticity in AD are still not completely understood. While the progressively increasing proteinopathy burden, such as amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles, definitely contribute directly to a neuron’s functional demise, the role of non-neuronal cells in controlling neuroplasticity is slowly being recognized as another major factor. These non-neuronal cells include astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, which through regulating brain homeostasis, structural stability, and trophic support, play a key role in maintaining normal functioning and resilience of the neuronal network. It is believed that chronic signaling from these cells affects the homeostatic network of neuronal and non-neuronal cells to an extent to destabilize this harmonious milieu in neurodegenerative diseases like AD. Here, we will examine the experimental evidence regarding the direct and indirect pathways through which astrocytes and microglia can alter brain plasticity in AD, specifically as they relate to the development and progression of tauopathy. In this review article, we describe the concepts of neuroplasticity and glial plasticity in healthy aging, delineate possible mechanisms underlying tau-induced plasticity dysfunction, and discuss current clinical trials as well as future disease-modifying approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: The Contribution of Plasma and Brain Vitamin C on Age and Gender-Related Cognitive Differences: A Mini-Review of the Literature</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00047</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00047</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is increasing evidence that sex differences in the brain may contribute to gender-related behavioral differences, including cognitive function. Literature has revealed gender dimorphisms in cognitive function between males and females. Additionally, several risk factors associated with cognitive decline depend on chronological age. It is well recognized that the process of aging is associated with a decline in cognitive ability and brain function. Various explanations may account for these gender-related cognitive differences and age-associated cognitive changes. Recent investigations have highlighted the importance of vitamin C in maintaining brain health and its association with cognitive function in both cognitively intact and impaired cohorts. The present review explores previous literature that has evaluated differences in plasma/brain vitamin C between genders and during aging. It then assesses whether these age and gender-related differences may affect the relationship between plasma/brain vitamin C and cognition. The purpose of this review was to examine the evidence for a link between plasma/brain vitamin C and cognition and the impact of gender and age on this relationship. Epidemiological studies have frequently shown higher vitamin C plasma concentrations in women. Similarly, aging has been systematically associated with reductions in plasma vitamin C levels. A range of animal studies has demonstrated potential gender and age-related differences in vitamin C brain distribution and utilization. The reviewed literature suggests that gender differences in plasma and brain vitamin C may potentially contribute to differences in gender-associated cognitive ability, particularly while females are pre-menopausal. Additionally, we can propose that age-associated differences in plasma and brain vitamin C may be potentially linked to age-associated cognitive differences, with older cohorts appearing more vulnerable to experience declines in plasma vitamin C concentrations alongside compromised vitamin C brain regulation. This review encourages future investigations to take into account both gender and age when assessing the link between plasma vitamin C concentrations and cognitive function. Further large scale investigations are required to assess whether differences in cognitive function between genders and age groups may be causally attributed to plasma vitamin C status and brain distribution and utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Progression of Fetal Brain Lesions in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00899</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a multisystem autosomal dominant genetic disorder due to loss of function of TSC1/TSC2 resulting in increased mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling. In the brain, TSC is characterized by the formation of specific lesions that include subependymal and white matter nodules and cortical tubers. Cells that constitute TSC lesions are mainly Giant cells and dysmorphic neurons and astrocytes, but normal cells also populate the tubers. Although considered as a developmental disorder, the histopathological features of brain lesions have been described in only a limited number of fetal cases, providing little information on how these lesions develop. In this report we characterized the development of TSC lesions in 14 fetal brains ranging from 19 gestational weeks (GW) to term and 2 postnatal cases. The study focused on the telencephalon at the level of the caudothalamic notch. Our data indicate that subcortical lesions, forming within and at the vicinity of germinative zones, are the first alterations (already detected in 19GW brains), characterized by the presence of numerous dysmorphic astrocytes and Giant, balloon-like, cells. Our data show that cortical tuber formation is a long process that initiates with the presence of dysmorphic astrocytes (by 19–21GW), progress with the apparition of Giant cells (by 24GW) and mature with the appearance of dysmorphic neurons by the end of gestation (by 36GW). Furthermore, the typical tuberal aspect of cortical lesions is only reached when bundles of neurofilament positive extensions delineate the bottom of the cortical lesion (by 36GW). In addition, our study reveals the presence of Giant cells and dysmorphic neurons immunopositive for interneuron markers such as calbindin and parvalbumin, suggesting that TSC lesions would be mosaic lesions generated from different classes of progenitors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Ophthalmic Manifestations and Genetics of the Polyglutamine Autosomal Dominant Spinocerebellar Ataxias: A Review</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a part of the cerebellar neurodegenerative disease group that is diverse in genetics and phenotypes. It usually shows autosomal dominant inheritance. SCAs, always together with the cerebellar degeneration, may exhibit clinical deficits in brainstem or eye, especially retina or optic nerve. Interestingly, autosomal dominant SCAs share a common genetic mechanism; the length of the glutamine chain is abnormally expanded due to the increase in the cytosine–adenine–guanine (CAG) repeats of the disease causing gene. Studies have suggested that the mutant ataxin induces alteration of protein conformation and abnormal aggregation resulting in nuclear inclusions, and causes cellular loss of photoreceptors through a toxic effect. As a result, these pathologic changes induce a downregulation of genes involved in the phototransduction, development, and differentiation of photoreceptors such as CRX, one of the photoreceptor transcription factors. However, the exact mechanism of neuronal degeneration by mutant ataxin restricted to only certain type of neuronal cell including cerebellar Purkinje neurons and photoreceptor is still unclear. The most common SCAs are types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17 which contain about 80% of autosomal dominant SCA cases. Various aspects of eye movement abnormalities are evident depending on the degree of cerebellar and brainstem degeneration in SCAs. In addition, certain types of SCAs such as SCA7 are characterized by both cerebellar ataxia and visual loss mainly due to retinal degeneration. The severity of the retinopathy can vary from occult macular photoreceptor disruption to extensive retinal atrophy and is correlated with the number of CAG repeats. The value of using optical coherence tomography in conjunction with electrodiagnostic and genetic testing is emphasized as the combination of these tests can provide critical information regarding the etiology, morphological evaluation, and functional significances. Therefore, ophthalmologists need to recognize and differentiate SCAs in order to properly diagnose and evaluate the disease. In this review, we have described and discussed SCAs showing ophthalmic abnormalities with particular attention to their ophthalmic features, neurodegenerative mechanisms, genetics, and future perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether introducing gamification in BCI rehabilitation of the upper limbs of post-stroke patients has a positive impact on their experience without altering their efficacy in creating motor mental images (MI).&lt;/p&gt;Design&lt;p&gt;A game was designed purposely adapted to the pace and goals of an established BCI-rehabilitation protocol. Rehabilitation was based on a double feedback: functional electrostimulation and animation of a virtual avatar of the patient’s limbs. The game introduced a narrative on top of this visual feedback with an external goal to achieve (protecting bits of cheese from a rat character). A pilot study was performed with 10 patients and a control group of six volunteers. Two rehabilitation sessions were done, each made up of one stage of calibration and two training stages, some stages with the game and others without. The accuracy of the classification computed was taken as a measure to compare the efficacy of MI. Users’ opinions were gathered through a questionnaire. No potentially identifiable human images or data are presented in this study.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The gamified rehabilitation presented in the pilot study does not impact on the efficacy of MI, but it improves users experience making it more fun.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These preliminary results are encouraging to continue investigating how game narratives can be introduced in BCI rehabilitation to make it more gratifying and engaging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Direct-Current Stimulation Modulates Functional Activity and Integration in Idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00873</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00873</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder and is suggested to be caused by central nervous system abnormalities. Non-invasive transcutaneous spinal direct-current stimulation (tsDCS) was recently used for RLS therapy. However, the neurophysiological basis of tsDCS treatment is still unknown. In this study, we explored the neural basis of tsDCS in 15 RLS patients and 20 gender- and age-matched healthy controls using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We calculated the whole-brain voxel-wise fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and weighted degree centrality (DC) to characterize the intrinsic functional activities and the local and global functional integration. We found that tsDCS can effectively improve the sleep and RLS symptoms in RLS patients. Moreover, after tsDCS therapy, the RLS patients showed decreased fALFF in the right anterior insula/temporal pole, decreased ReHo in the supplementary motor area, increased weighted DC in the left primary visual cortex, and decreased weighted DC in the right posterior cerebellum. The changed patterns were consistent with that found between RLS patients and healthy controls. The weighted DC in the left primary visual cortex after treatment and the fALFF in the right anterior insula/temporal pole before treatment were significantly and marginally correlated with sleep and RLS symptom scores, respectively. These results revealed that tsDCS can normalize the functional patterns of RLS patients and is an effective way for RLS therapy. Our findings provide the neurophysiological basis for tsDCS treatment and may facilitate understanding the neuropathology of RLS and directing other neuromodulation treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Comparison of Activation Patterns in Mirror Neurons and the Swallowing Network During Action Observation and Execution: A Task-Based fMRI Study</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Observation of a goal-directed motor action can excite the respective mirror neurons, and this is the theoretical basis for action observation (AO) as a novel tool for functional recovery during stroke rehabilitation. To explore the therapeutic potential of AO for dysphagia, we conducted a task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to identify the brain areas activated during observation and execution of swallowing in healthy participants.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty-nine healthy volunteers viewed the following stimuli during fMRI scanning: an action-video of swallowing (condition 1, defined as AO), a neutral image with a Chinese word for “watching” (condition 2), and a neutral image with a Chinese word for “swallowing” (condition 3). Action execution (AE) was defined as condition 3 minus condition 2. One-sample t-tests were performed to define the brain regions activated during AO and AE.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Many brain regions were activated during AO, including the middle temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, pre- and postcentral gyrus, supplementary motor area, hippocampus, brainstem, and pons. AE resulted in activation of motor areas as well as other brain areas, including the inferior parietal lobule, vermis, middle frontal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus. Two brain areas, BA6 and BA21, were activated with both AO and AE.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The left supplementary motor area (BA6) and left middle temporal gyrus (BA21), which contains mirror neurons, were activated in both AO and AE of swallowing. In this study, AO activated mirror neurons and the swallowing network in healthy participants, supporting its potential value in the treatment of dysphagia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Entorhinal and Transentorhinal Atrophy in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00804</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00804</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study examines the atrophy patterns in the entorhinal and transentorhinal cortices of subjects that converted from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment. The regions were manually segmented from 3T MRI, then corrected for variability in boundary definition over time using an automated approach called longitudinal diffeomorphometry. Cortical thickness was calculated by deforming the gray matter-white matter boundary surface to the pial surface using an approach called normal geodesic flow. The surface was parcellated based on four atlases using large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping. Average cortical thickness was calculated for (1) manually-defined entorhinal cortex, and (2) manually-defined transentorhinal cortex. Group-wise difference analysis was applied to determine where atrophy occurred, and change point analysis was applied to determine when atrophy started to occur. The results showed that by the time a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment is made, the transentorhinal cortex and entorhinal cortex was up to 0.6 mm thinner than a control with normal cognition. A change point in atrophy rate was detected in the transentorhinal cortex 9–14 years prior to a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, and in the entorhinal cortex 8–11 years prior. The findings are consistent with autopsy findings that demonstrate neuronal changes in the transentorhinal cortex before the entorhinal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Macular degeneration (MD) is one of the most frequent causes of visual deficit, resulting in alterations affecting not only the retina but also the entire visual pathway up to the brain areas. This would seem related not just to signal deprivation but also to a compensatory neuronal reorganization, having significant implications in terms of potential rehabilitation of the patient and therapeutic perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;This paper aimed to outline, by analyzing the existing literature, the current understanding of brain structural and functional changes detected with neuroimaging techniques in subjects affected by juvenile and age-related maculopathy.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Articles using various typologies of central nervous system (CNS) imaging in at least six patients affected by juvenile or age-related maculopathy were considered. A total of 142 were initially screened. Non-pertinent articles and duplicates were rejected. Finally, 19 articles, including 649 patients, were identified.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In these sources, both structural and functional modifications were found in MD subjects’ CNS. Changes in visual cortex gray matter volume were observed in both age-related MD (AMD) and juvenile MD (JMD); in particular, an involvement of not only its posterior part but also the anterior one suggests further causes besides an input-deprivation mechanism only. White matter degeneration was also found, more severe in JMD than in AMD. Moreover, functional analysis revealed differences in cortical activation patterns between MD and controls, suggesting neuronal circuit reorganization. Interestingly, attention and oculomotor training allowed better visual performances and correlated to a stronger cortical activation, even of the area normally receiving inputs from lesioned macula.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;In MD, structural and functional changes in cerebral circuits and visual pathway can happen, involving both cerebral volume and activation patterns. These modifications, possibly due to neuronal plasticity (already observed and described for several brain areas), can allow patients to compensate for macular damage and gives therapeutic perspectives which could be achievable through an association between oculomotor training and biochemical stimulation of neuronal plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Nutil: A Pre- and Post-processing Toolbox for Histological Rodent Brain Section Images</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00037</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00037</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;With recent technological advances in microscopy and image acquisition of tissue sections, further developments of tools are required for viewing, transforming, and analyzing the ever-increasing amounts of high-resolution data produced. In the field of neuroscience, histological images of whole rodent brain sections are commonly used for investigating brain connections as well as cellular and molecular organization in the normal and diseased brain, but present a problem for the typical neuroscientist with no or limited programming experience in terms of the pre- and post-processing steps needed for analysis. To meet this need we have designed Nutil, an open access and stand-alone executable software that enables automated transformations, post-processing, and analyses of 2D section images using multi-core processing (OpenMP). The software is written in C++ for efficiency, and provides the user with a clean and easy graphical user interface for specifying the input and output parameters. Nutil currently contains four separate tools: (1) A transformation toolchain named “Transform” that allows for rotation, mirroring and scaling, resizing, and renaming of very large tiled tiff images. (2) “TiffCreator” enables the generation of tiled TIFF images from other image formats such as PNG and JPEG. (3) A “Resize” tool completes the preprocessing toolset and allows downscaling of PNG and JPEG images with output in PNG format. (4) The fourth tool is a post-processing method called “Quantifier” that enables the quantification of segmented objects in the context of regions defined by brain atlas maps generated with the QuickNII software based on a 3D reference atlas (mouse or rat). The output consists of a set of report files, point cloud coordinate files for visualization in reference atlas space, and reference atlas images superimposed with color-coded objects. The Nutil software is made available by the Human Brain Project (https://www.humanbrainproject.eu) at https://www.nitrc.org/projects/nutil/.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Long-Term Musical Training Alters Auditory Cortical Activity to the Frequency Change</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00329</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The ability to detect frequency variation is a fundamental skill necessary for speech perception. It is known that musical expertise is associated with a range of auditory perceptual skills, including discriminating frequency change, which suggests the neural encoding of spectral features can be enhanced by musical training. In this study, we measured auditory cortical responses to frequency change in musicians to examine the relationships between N1/P2 responses and behavioral performance/musical training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Behavioral and electrophysiological data were obtained from professional musicians and age-matched non-musician participants. Behavioral data included frequency discrimination detection thresholds for no threshold-equalizing noise (TEN), +5, 0, and −5 signal-to-noise ratio settings. Auditory-evoked responses were measured using a 64-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) system in response to frequency changes in ongoing pure tones consisting of 250 and 4,000 Hz, and the magnitudes of frequency change were 10%, 25% or 50% from the base frequencies. N1 and P2 amplitudes and latencies as well as dipole source activation in the left and right hemispheres were measured for each condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared to the non-musician group, behavioral thresholds in the musician group were lower for frequency discrimination in quiet conditions only. The scalp-recorded N1 amplitudes were modulated as a function of frequency change. P2 amplitudes in the musician group were larger than in the non-musician group. Dipole source analysis showed that P2 dipole activity to frequency changes was lateralized to the right hemisphere, with greater activity in the musician group regardless of the hemisphere side. Additionally, N1 amplitudes to frequency changes were positively related to behavioral thresholds for frequency discrimination while enhanced P2 amplitudes were associated with a longer duration of musical training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that auditory cortical potentials evoked by frequency change are related to behavioral thresholds for frequency discrimination in musicians. Larger P2 amplitudes in musicians compared to non-musicians reflects musical training-induced neural plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Many pieces of research have focused on pain within individuals, but little attention has been paid to whether pain can change an individual’s empathic ability and affect social relationships. The purpose of this study is to explore how chronic low back pain changes empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty-four chronic low back pain patients and 22 healthy controls were recruited. We set up an experimental pain-exposed model for each healthy subject. All subjects received a painful-empathic magnetic resonance scan. After the scan, all subjects rated the pain intensity and multiple empathy-related indicators. The clinical assessment scale was the 20-item Basic Empathy Scale in Adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: The chronic low back pain patients reported lower scores on the total scores of BES-A, the subscale scores of emotional disconnection and cognitive empathy, and the discomfort rating. The fMRI results in the chronic low back pain patients showed that there were multiple abnormal brain pathways centered on the anterior insula. The DTI results in the chronic low back pain patients showed that there were reduced fractional anisotropy values in the corpus callosum, bilateral anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), right posterior thalamic radiation (PTR), right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and left anterior corona radiate (ACR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our study found that patients with chronic low back pain have impaired empathy ability. The abnormal functional connectivity of multiple brain networks, multiple damaged white matter tracts, and the lower behavioral scores in chronic low back pain patients supported our findings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glia, a non-excitable cell type once considered merely as the connective tissue between neurons, is nowadays acknowledged for its essential contribution to multiple physiological processes including learning, memory formation, excitability, synaptic plasticity, ion homeostasis, and energy metabolism. Moreover, as glia are key players in the brain immune system and provide structural and nutritional support for neurons, they are intimately involved in multiple neurological disorders. Recent advances have demonstrated that glial cells, specifically microglia and astroglia, are involved in several neurodegenerative diseases including Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). While there is compelling evidence for glial modulation of synaptic formation and regulation that affect neuronal signal processing and activity, in this manuscript we will review recent findings on neuronal activity that affect glial function, specifically during neurodegenerative disorders. We will discuss the nature of each glial malfunction, its specificity to each disorder, overall contribution to the disease progression and assess its potential as a future therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: NLRP3 Is Involved in the Maintenance of Cerebral Pericytes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00276</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pericytes play a central role in regulating the structure and function of capillaries in the brain. However, molecular mechanisms that drive pericyte proliferation and differentiation are unclear. In our study, we immunostained NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3)-deficient and wild-type littermate mice and observed that NLRP3 deficiency reduced platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ)-positive pericytes and collagen type IV immunoreactive vasculature in the brain. In Western blot analysis, PDGFRβ and CD13 proteins in isolated cerebral microvessels from the NLRP3-deficient mouse brain were decreased. We further treated cultured pericytes with NLRP3 inhibitor, MCC950, and demonstrated that NLRP3 inhibition attenuated cell proliferation but did not induce apoptosis. NLRP3 inhibition also decreased protein levels of PDGFRβ and CD13 in cultured pericytes. On the contrary, treatments with IL-1β, the major product of NLRP3-contained inflammasome, increased protein levels of PDGFRβ, and CD13 in cultured cells. The alteration of PDGFRβ and CD13 protein levels were correlated with the phosphorylation of AKT. Inhibition of AKT reduced both protein markers and abolished the effect of IL-1β activation in cultured pericytes. Thus, NLRP3 activation might be essential to maintain pericytes in the healthy brain through phosphorylating AKT. The potential adverse effects on the cerebral vascular pericytes should be considered in clinical therapies with NLRP3 inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Expression and Function of GABA Receptors in Myelinating Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00256</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Myelin facilitates the fast transmission of nerve impulses and provides metabolic support to axons. Differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and Schwann cell (SC) precursors is critical for myelination during development and myelin repair in demyelinating disorders. Myelination is tightly controlled by neuron-glia communication and requires the participation of a wide repertoire of signals, including neurotransmitters such as glutamate, ATP, adenosine, or γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) and it is also present in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The composition and function of GABA receptors (GABARs) are well studied in neurons, while their nature and role in glial cells are still incipient. Recent studies demonstrate that GABA-mediated signaling mechanisms play relevant roles in OPC and SC precursor development and function, and stand out the implication of GABARs in oligodendrocyte (OL) and SC maturation and myelination. In this review, we highlight the evidence supporting the novel role of GABA with an emphasis on the molecular identity of the receptors expressed in these glial cells and the possible signaling pathways involved in their actions. GABAergic signaling in myelinating cells may have potential implications for developing novel reparative therapies in demyelinating diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Dissociated Pmch and Cre Expression in Lactating Pmch-Cre BAC Transgenic Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) system plays a role in many physiological processes including reproduction and lactation. However, research regarding the function of MCH on different aspects of the reproductive function lags, due in part to a lack of validated genetic models with which to interrogate the system. This is particularly true in the case of female reproduction, as the anatomy and function of the MCH system is not well-characterized in the female mouse. We set out to determine whether the commercially available Pmch-Cre transgenic mouse line is a viable model to study the role of MCH neurons in distinct female reproductive states. We found that Pmch is transiently expressed in several nuclei of the rostral forebrain at the end of lactation. This includes the medial subdivision of the medial preoptic nucleus, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the ventral subdivision of the lateral septum, the anterodorsal preoptic nucleus and the anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus. The Pmch expression in these sites, however, does not reliably induce Cre expression in the Pmch-Cre (BAC) transgenic mouse, making this line an inadequate model with which to study the role of MCH in behavioral and/or neuroendocrine adaptations of lactation. We also contribute to the general knowledge of the anatomy of the murine MCH system by showing that lactation-induced Pmch expression in the rostral forebrain is mostly observed in GABAergic (VGAT) neurons, in contrast to the typical MCH neurons of the tuberal and posterior hypothalamus which are glutamatergic (VGLUT2).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Neurite Branching Regulated by Neuronal Cell Surface Molecules in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The high synaptic density in the nervous system results from the ability of neurites to branch. Neuronal cell surface molecules play central roles during neurite branch formation. The underlying mechanisms of surface molecule activity have often been elucidated using invertebrates with simple nervous systems. Here, we review recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of neurite branching in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We discuss how cell surface receptor complexes link to and modulate actin dynamics to regulate dendritic and axonal branch formation. The mechanisms of neurite branching are often coupled with other neural circuit developmental processes, such as synapse formation and axon guidance, via the same cell-cell surface molecular interactions. We also cover ectopic and sex-specific neurite branching in C. elegans in an attempt to illustrate the importance of these studies in contributing to our understanding of conserved cell surface molecule regulation of neurite branch formation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Asymmetry in the Cytoarchitecture of the Area 44 Homolog of the Brain of the Chimpanzee Pan troglodytes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The evolution of the brain in apes and man followed a joint pathway stemming from common ancestors 5–10 million years ago. However, although apparently sharing similar organization and neurochemical properties, association areas of the isocortex remain one of the cornerstones of what sets humans aside from other primates. Brodmann’s area 44, the area of Broca, is known for its implication in speech, and thus indirectly is a key mark of human uniqueness. This latero-caudal part of the frontal lobe shows a marked functional asymmetry in humans, and takes part in other complex functions, including learning and imitation, tool use, music and contains the mirror neuron system (MNS). Since the main features in the cytoarchitecture of Broca’s area remains relatively constant in hominids, including in our closest relative, the chimpanzee Pan troglodytes, investigations on the finer structure, cellular organization, connectivity and eventual asymmetry of area 44 have a direct bearing on the understanding of the neural mechanisms at the base of our language. The semi-automated image analysis technology that we employed in the current study showed that the structure of the cortical layers of the chimpanzee contains elements of asymmetry that are discussed in relation to the corresponding human areas and the putative resulting disparity of function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: The Melanocortin System in Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar L.) and Its Role in Appetite Control</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00048</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00048</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The melanocortin system is a key neuroendocrine network involved in the control of food intake and energy homeostasis in vertebrates. Within the hypothalamus, the system comprises two main distinct neuronal cell populations that express the neuropeptides proopiomelanocortin (POMC; anorexigenic) or agouti-related protein (AGRP; orexigenic). Both bind to the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) in higher order neurons that control both food intake and energy expenditure. This system is relatively well-conserved among vertebrates. However, in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), the salmonid-specific fourth round whole-genome duplication led to the presence of several paralog genes which might result in divergent functions of the duplicated genes. In the current study, we report the first comprehensive comparative identification and characterization of Mc4r and extend the knowledge of Pomc and Agrp in appetite control in Atlantic salmon. In silico analysis revealed multiple paralogs for mc4r (a1, a2, b1, and b2) in the Atlantic salmon genome and confirmed the paralogs previously described for pomc (a1, a2, and b) and agrp (1 and 2). All Mc4r paralogs are relatively well-conserved with the human homolog, sharing at least 63% amino acid sequence identity. We analyzed the mRNA expression of mc4r, pomc, and agrp genes in eight brain regions of Atlantic salmon post-smolt under two feeding states: normally fed and fasted for 4 days. The mc4ra2 and b1 mRNAs were predominantly and equally abundant in the hypothalamus and telencephalon, the mc4rb2 in the hypothalamus, and a1 in the telencephalon. All pomc genes were highly expressed in the pituitary, followed by the hypothalamus and saccus vasculosus. The agrp genes showed a completely different expression pattern from each other, with prevalent expression of the agrp1 in the hypothalamus and agrp2 in the telencephalon. Fasting did not induce any significant changes in the mRNA level of mc4r, agrp, or pomc paralogs in the hypothalamus or in other highly expressed regions between fed and fasted states. The identification and wide distribution of multiple paralogs of mc4r, pomc, and agrp in Atlantic salmon brain provide new insights and give rise to new questions of the melanocortin system in the appetite regulation in Atlantic salmon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: α-Lipoic Acid Maintains Brain Glucose Metabolism via BDNF/TrkB/HIF-1α Signaling Pathway in P301S Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The microtubule-associated protein tau is closely correlated with hypometabolism in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). α-lipoic acid (LA), which is a naturally occurring cofactor in mitochondrial, has been shown to have properties that can inhibit the tau pathology and neuronal damage in our previous research. However, if LA affects glucose metabolism when it reverses tau pathology remains unclear, especially concerning the potential mechanism. Therefore, we make a further study using the P301S mouse model (a tauopathy and AD mouse model which overexpressing fibrillary tau) to gain a clear idea of the aforementioned problems. Here, we found chronic LA administration significantly increased glucose availability by elevating glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3), GLUT4, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein and mRNA level, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein level in P301S mouse brains. Meanwhile, we found that LA also promoted glycolysis by directly upregulating hexokinase (HK) activity, indirectly by increasing proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) and DNA repair enzymes (OGG1/2 and MTH1). Further, we found the underlying mechanism of restored glucose metabolism might involve in the activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tyrosine Kinase receptor B (TrkB)/hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) signaling pathway by LA treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Antenatal Hypoxia Accelerates the Onset of Alzheimer’s Disease Pathology in 5xFAD Mouse Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder associated with cognitive impairment and later dementia among the elderly. Mounting evidence shows that adverse maternal environments during the fetal development increase the risk of diseases later in life including neurological disorders, and suggests an early origin in the development of AD-related dementia (ADRD) in utero. In the present study, we investigated the impact of antenatal hypoxia and fetal stress on the initiation of AD-related pathology in offspring of 5xFAD mice. We showed that fetal hypoxia significantly reduced brain and body weight in the fetal and the early postnatal period, which recovered in young adult mice. Using spontaneous Y-maze, novel object recognition (NOR), and open field (OF) tasks, we found that antenatal hypoxia exacerbated cognitive decline in offspring of 5xFAD compared with normoxia control. Of interest, fetal hypoxia did not alter intraneuronal soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomer accumulation in the cortex and hippocampus in 5xFAD mouse offspring, indicating that antenatal hypoxia increased the vulnerability of the brain to synaptotoxic Aβ in the disease onset later in life. Consistent with the early occurrence of cognitive decline, we found synapse loss but not neuronal death in the cerebral cortex in 5xFAD but not wild-type (WT) offspring exposed to antenatal hypoxia. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that antenatal hypoxia significantly increased microglial number and activation, and reactive astrogliosis in the cerebral cortex in WT offspring. Moreover, antenatal hypoxia resulted in an exacerbated increase of microgliosis and astrogliosis in the early stage of AD in 5xFAD offspring. Together, our study reveals a causative link between fetal stress and the accelerated onset of AD-related pathology, and provides mechanistic insights into the developmental origin of aging-related neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Chronic Periodontitis and Alzheimer Disease: A Putative Link of Serum Proteins Identification by 2D-DIGE Proteomics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00248</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00248</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence indicates Chronic Periodontitis (CP) is a comorbidity of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is the most common form of age-related dementia, and for the latter, effective diagnostic and treatment strategies are lacking. Although inflammation is present in both diseases, the exact mechanisms and cross-links between CP and AD are poorly understood; and a direct association between the two has not been reported. This study aimed to identify a direct serum proteins link between AD and CP. Two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis was employed to analyze serum samples from 12 CP patients and 12 age-matched controls. Furthermore, to determine the molecular link between CP and AD, neuroblastoma SK-N-SH APPwt cells were treated with 1 μg/ml of lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g-LPS). Ten differentially expressed proteins were identified in CP patients. Among them, nine proteins were up-regulated, and one protein was down-regulated. Of the 10 differentially expressed proteins, five proteins were reportedly involved in the pathology of AD: Cofilin-2, Cathepsin B, Clusterin, Triosephosphate isomerase, and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 (ITI-H4). Western blotting indicated significantly higher expression of Cofilin-2, Cathepsin B, and Clusterin and lower expression of ITI-H4 in the CP group than in the Control group. The serum concentration of Cathepsin B has a good correlation with MMSE scores. Moreover, the protein level of Cathepsin B (but not that of ADAM10 and BACE1) increased significantly along with a prominent increase in Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; and Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; in the cell lysates of P.g-LPS-treated SK-N-SH APPwt cells. Cathepsin B inhibition resulted in a sharp decrease in Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; and Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; in the cell lysates. Furthermore, TNF-α was one of the most important inflammatory cytokines for the P.g-LPS-induced Cathepsin B upregulation in SK-N-SH APPwt cells. These results show that CP and AD share an association, while Cathepsin B could be a key link between the two diseases. The discovery of the identical serum proteins provides a potential mechanism underlying the increased risk of AD in CP patients, which could be critical for elucidating the pathophysiology of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Sensory neurons are activated by physical and chemical stimuli, eliciting sensations such as temperature, touch, pain, and itch. From an evolutionary perspective, sensing danger is essential for organismal survival. Upon infection and injury, immune cells respond to pathogen/damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/DAMPs) through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and produce inflammatory mediators that activate sensory neurons through neuro–immune interactions.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Tumor vascular status controls oxygen delivery facilitated by infused polymerized hemoglobins with varying oxygen affinity</title>

Oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) delivery facilitated by hemoglobin (Hb)-based O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; carriers (HBOCs) is a promising strategy to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapeutics for treatment of solid tumors. However, the heterogeneous vascular structures present within tumors complicates evaluating the oxygenation potential of HBOCs within the tumor microenvironment. To account for spatial variations in the vasculature and tumor tissue that occur during tumor growth, we used a computational model to develop artificial tumor constructs. With these simulated tumors, we performed a polymerized human hemoglobin (hHb) (PolyhHb) enhanced oxygenation simulation accounting for differences in the physiologic characteristics of human and mouse blood. The results from this model were used to determine the potential effectiveness of different treatment options including a top load (low volume) and exchange (large volume) infusion of a tense quaternary state (T-State) PolyhHb, relaxed quaternary state (R-State) PolyhHb, and a non O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; carrying control. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed correlations between the different regimes of effectiveness within the different simulated dosage options. In general, we found that infusion of T-State PolyhHb is more likely to decrease tissue hypoxia and modulate the metabolic rate of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption. Though the developed models are not a definitive descriptor of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; carrier interaction in tumor capillary networks, we accounted for factors such as non-uniform vascular density and permeability that limit the applicability of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; carriers during infusion. Finally, we have used these validated computational models to establish potential benchmarks to guide tumor treatment during translation of PolyhHb mediated therapies into clinical applications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/62H5xwpG7gw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Epithelial sheets define organ architecture during development. Here, we employed an iterative multiscale computational modeling and quantitative experimental approach to decouple direct and indirect effects of actomyosin-generated forces, nuclear positioning, extracellular matrix, and cell-cell adhesion in shaping &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; wing imaginal discs. Basally generated actomyosin forces generate epithelial bending of the wing disc pouch. Surprisingly, acute pharmacological inhibition of ROCK-driven actomyosin contractility does not impact the maintenance of tissue height or curved shape. Computational simulations show that ECM tautness provides only a minor contribution to modulating tissue shape. Instead, passive ECM pre-strain serves to maintain the shape independent from actomyosin contractility. These results provide general insight into how the subcellular forces are generated and maintained within individual cells to induce tissue curvature. Thus, the results suggest an important design principle of separable contributions from ECM prestrain and actomyosin tension during epithelial organogenesis and homeostasis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LhJdXPmSWBs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Early exposure to broadly neutralizing antibodies may trigger a dynamical switch from progressive disease to lasting control of SHIV infection</title>

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-1 infection is life-long. Stopping therapy typically leads to the reignition of infection and progressive disease. In a major breakthrough, recent studies have shown that early initiation of ART can lead to sustained post-treatment control of viremia, raising hopes of long-term HIV-1 remission. ART, however, elicits post-treatment control in a small fraction of individuals treated. Strikingly, passive immunization with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) of HIV-1 early in infection was found recently to elicit long-term control in a majority of SHIV-infected macaques, suggesting that HIV-1 remission may be more widely achievable. The mechanisms underlying the control elicited by bNAb therapy, however, remain unclear. Untreated infection typically leads to progressive disease. We hypothesized that viremic control represents an alternative but rarely realized outcome of the infection and that early bNAb therapy triggers a dynamical switch to this outcome. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a model of viral dynamics with bNAb therapy and applied it to analyse clinical data. The model fit quantitatively the complex longitudinal viral load data from macaques that achieved lasting control. The model predicted, consistently with our hypothesis, that the underlying system exhibited bistability, indicating two potential outcomes of infection. The first had high viremia, weak cytotoxic effector responses, and high effector exhaustion, marking progressive disease. The second had low viremia, strong effector responses, and low effector exhaustion, indicating lasting viremic control. Further, model predictions suggest that early bNAb therapy elicited lasting control via pleiotropic effects. bNAb therapy lowers viremia, which would also limit immune exhaustion. Simultaneously, it can improve effector stimulation via cross-presentation. Consequently, viremia may resurge post-therapy, but would encounter a primed effector population and eventually get controlled. ART suppresses viremia but does not enhance effector stimulation, explaining its limited ability to elicit post-treatment control relative to bNAb therapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rgRAYva8jdg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Klf5 down-regulation induces vascular senescence through eIF5a depletion and mitochondrial fission</title>

Although dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics has been linked to cellular senescence, which contributes to advanced age-related disorders, it is unclear how Krüppel-like factor 5 (Klf5), an essential transcriptional factor of cardiovascular remodeling, mediates the link between mitochondrial dynamics and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) senescence. Here, we show that Klf5 down-regulation in VSMCs is correlated with rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), an age-related vascular disease. Mice lacking Klf5 in VSMCs exacerbate vascular senescence and progression of angiotensin II (Ang II)–induced AAA by facilitating reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Klf5 knockdown enhances, while Klf5 overexpression suppresses mitochondrial fission. Mechanistically, Klf5 activates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5a (eIF5a) transcription through binding to the promoter of eIF5a, which in turn preserves mitochondrial integrity by interacting with mitofusin 1 (Mfn1). Accordingly, decreased expression of eIF5a elicited by Klf5 down-regulation leads to mitochondrial fission and excessive ROS production. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission decreases ROS production and VSMC senescence. Our studies provide a potential therapeutic target for age-related vascular disorders.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oIAVlUnNIbk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Female reproductive state is associated with changes in distinct arginine vasotocin cell types in the preoptic area of Astatotilapia burtoni</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Female reproductive state is associated with changes in distinct arginine vasotocin cell types in the preoptic area of Astatotilapia burtoni&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/149916bc-f3f5-4185-a3b7-50dcfc1f9f0d/cne24995-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used multiple methods for examining the arginine vasotocin (AVT) system in female African cichlid fish &lt;i&gt;Astatotilapia burtoni&lt;/i&gt;. AVT‐ir cell size varied with female reproductive state in a cell type‐dependent manner. Ovulated females had larger magnocellular and gigantocelluar cells than brooding females, and gigantocellular AVT‐ir cell size correlated with the number of days brooding. Overall, our data indicate that AVT neurons change across the reproductive cycle in female fishes, similar to that seen in males.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonapeptides play a crucial role in mediating reproduction, aggression, and parental care across taxa. In fishes, &lt;i&gt;arginine vasotocin&lt;/i&gt; (AVT) expression is related to social and/or reproductive status in most male fishes studied to date, and is linked to territorial defense, paternal care, and courtship. Despite a plethora of studies examining AVT in male fishes, relatively little is known about how AVT expression varies with female reproductive state or its role in female social behaviors. We used multiple methods for examining the AVT system in female African cichlid fish &lt;i&gt;Astatotilapia burtoni&lt;/i&gt;, including immunohistochemistry for AVT, in situ hybridization for &lt;i&gt;avt&lt;/i&gt;‐mRNA, and quantitative PCR. Ovulated and mouthbrooding females had similar numbers of parvocellular, magnocellular, and gigantocellular AVT cells in the preoptic area. However, ovulated females had larger magnocellular and gigantocellular cells compared to mouthbrooding females, and gigantocellular AVT cell size correlated with the number of days brooding, such that late‐stage brooding females had larger AVT cells than mid‐stage brooding females. In addition, we found that ventral hypothalamic cells were more prominent in females compared to males, and were larger in mouthbrooding compared to ovulated females, suggesting a role in maternal care. Together, these data indicate that AVT neurons change across the reproductive cycle in female fishes, similar to that seen in males. These data on females complement studies in male &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burtoni&lt;/i&gt;, providing a comprehensive picture of the regulation and potential function of different AVT cell types in reproduction and social behaviors in both sexes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Hebbian and non‐Hebbian timing‐dependent plasticity in the hippocampal CA3 region</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23252?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23252?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing between synaptic inputs has been proposed to play a role in the induction of plastic changes that enable neural circuits to store information. In the case of spike timing‐dependent plasticity (STDP), this relates to the interval between a synaptic input and a postsynaptic spike, thus providing a conceptual link to the Hebb learning rule. Experiments have documented STDP in many synapses and brain regions, and computational models have tested its utility in many neural network functions. However, questions remain about whether timing plays a role in plasticity during natural activity, and whether it can function in information storage. The present study used imaging with voltage sensitive dye to investigate the effectiveness of input timing in the plasticity of responses in the CA3 region of hippocampal slices. Plasticity was induced by sequential dual‐site stimulation at 10 ms intervals of either synaptic inputs and cell bodies (synaptic–somatic induction) or of two sets of synaptic inputs (synaptic–synaptic induction). Both protocols potentiated responses, with greater potentiation of responses to the first stimulation of the sequence than the second. Neither of these protocols induced depression. Synaptic–somatic stimulation was much more effective than synaptic–synaptic stimulation in evoking somatic action potentials, but both protocols potentiated responses equally well. This suggests that sequential dual‐site stimulation can potentiate equally well with very different degrees of somatic action potential firing. With synaptic–somatic induction, potentiation was focused at the sites of stimulation. In contrast, with synaptic–synaptic induction, the distribution of potentiation varied greatly. Changes in the spatial distribution of responses indicated that sequential dual‐site stimulation functions poorly in the storage of activity patterns. These results suggest that in the hippocampal CA3 region, timed sequential activation of two inputs is less effective than theta bursts, both in the induction of LTP and in the storage of information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Beyond barrier functions: Roles of pericytes in homeostasis and regulation of neuroinflammation</title>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24715?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pericytes are contractile cells that extend along the vasculature to mediate key homeostatic functions of endothelial barriers within the body. In the central nervous system (CNS), pericytes are important contributors to the structure and function of the neurovascular unit, which includes endothelial cells, astrocytes and neurons. The understanding of pericytes has been marred by an inability to accurately distinguish pericytes from other stromal cells with similar expression of identifying markers. Evidence is now growing in favor of pericytes being actively involved in both CNS homeostasis and pathology of neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and Alzheimer's disease among others. In this review, we discuss the current understanding on the characterization of pericytes, their roles in maintaining the integrity of the blood–brain barrier, and their contributions to neuroinflammation and neurorepair. Owing to its plethora of surface receptors, pericytes respond to inflammatory mediators such as CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein‐1) and tumor necrosis factor‐α, in turn secreting CCL2, nitric oxide, and several cytokines. Pericytes can therefore act as promoters of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Much like professional phagocytes, pericytes also have the ability to clear up cellular debris and macromolecular plaques. Moreover, pericytes promote the activities of CNS glia, including in maturation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells for myelination. Conversely, pericytes can impair regenerative processes by contributing to scar formation. A better characterization of CNS pericytes and their functions would bode well for therapeutics aimed at alleviating their undesirable properties and enhancing their benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neuroanatomical and neurophysiological mechanisms of acoustic and weakly electric signaling in synodontid catfish&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e9ea53d4-c376-499b-b881-446be88ca968/cne24920-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synodontid catfishes use an Elastic Spring Apparatus, including protractor muscles, to produce electric discharges or sounds. Anatomical characterization, together with motoneuron patch‐clamp recordings and protractor muscle EMGs suggest that adaptive changes in peripheral and central characters underlie the transition from an ancestral sound to a derived electric discharge producing system.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To what extent do modifications in the nervous system and peripheral effectors contribute to novel behaviors? Using a combination of morphometric analysis, neuroanatomical tract‐tracing, and intracellular neuronal recording, we address this question in a sound‐producing and a weakly electric species of synodontid catfish, &lt;i&gt;Synodontis grandiops&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Synodontis nigriventris&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. The same peripheral mechanism, a bilateral pair of protractor muscles associated with vertebral processes (elastic spring mechanism), is involved in both signaling systems. Although there were dramatic species differences in several morphometric measures, electromyograms provided strong evidence that simultaneous activation of paired protractor muscles accounts for an individual sound and electric discharge pulse. While the general architecture of the neural network and the intrinsic properties of the motoneuron population driving each target was largely similar, differences could contribute to species‐specific patterns in electromyograms and the associated pulse repetition rate of sounds and electric discharges. Together, the results suggest that adaptive changes in both peripheral and central characters underlie the transition from an ancestral sound to a derived electric discharge producing system, and thus the evolution of a novel communication channel among synodontid catfish. Similarities with characters in other sonic and weakly electric teleost fish provide a striking example of convergent evolution in functional adaptations underlying the evolution of the two signaling systems among distantly related taxa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In 1882, the Italian morphologist Giuseppe Bellonci correctly observed that crustaceans possess mushroom bodies, a finding only recently becoming substantiated: here the title page of his paper and a lithograph in it.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1882, the Italian embryologist Giuseppe Bellonci introduced a nomenclature for structures in the stomatopod crustacean &lt;i&gt;Squilla mantis&lt;/i&gt; that he claimed correspond to insect mushroom bodies, today recognized as cardinal centers that in insects mediate associative memory. The use of Bellonci's terminology has, through a series of misunderstandings and entrenched opinions, led to contesting views regarding whether centers in crustacean and insect brains that occupy corresponding locations and receive comparable multisensory inputs are homologous or homoplasic. The following describes the fate of terms used to denote sensory association neuropils in crustacean species and relates how those terms were deployed in the 1920s and 1930s by the Swedish neuroanatomist Bertil Hanström to claim homology in insects and crustaceans. Yet the same terminology has been repurposed by subsequent researchers to promote the very opposite view: that mushroom bodies are a derived trait of hexapods and that equivalent centers in crustaceans evolved independently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;
3 weeks of fluoxetine injection at dose of 5 mg/(kg·d) significantly improved the depressive‐like behavior in depressed model rats.
The oligodendrocytes of the CA1, CA3, and DG fields of hippocampus were significantly decreased after 7 weeks of CUS stimulations.
3 weeks of fluoxetine injection reversed the CUS‐induced decrease of the oligodendrocytes in the CA1 and CA3 fields of hippocampus.



&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression is a mental illness which is harmful seriously to the society. This study investigated the effects of fluoxetine on the CNPase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; oligodendrocytes in hippocampus of the depressed rats to explore the new target structure of antidepressants. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were used to build chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) depressed model of rats. Then, the depressed rats were divided into the CUS standard group and the CUS + fluoxetine (CUS/FLX) group. The CUS/FLX group was treated with fluoxetine at dose of 5 mg/(kg·d) from the fifth week to seventh week. After 7 weeks CUS intervention, the sucrose preference of the CUS standard group was significantly lower than that of the control group and the CUS/FLX group. The stereological results showed that the total number of the CNPase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the CA1, CA3, and DG subfield of the hippocampus in the CUS standard group were significantly decreased, when compared with the CNPase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the control group. However, the total number of the CNPase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the CA1 and CA3 subfield of the hippocampus in the CUS standard group was significantly decreased when it compared with CNPase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the CUS/FLX group. Therefore, fluoxetine might prevent the loss of CNPase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; oligodendrocytes in CA1 and CA3 subfields of hippocampus of the depressed rats. The oligodendrocytes in hippocampus may play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. The current result might provide structural basis for the future studies that search for new antidepressant strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The sensory peripheral nervous system in the tail of a cephalochordate studied by serial blockface scanning electron microscopy</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The sensory peripheral nervous system in the tail of a cephalochordate studied by serial blockface scanning electron microscopy&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e6502deb-73c5-41e4-931a-3bed9a18cd3a/cne24913-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephalochordates (amphioxus or lancelets) are basal in the phylum Chiordata and can exemplify the relatively simple developmental and anatomical starting conditions likely to have evolved into more complex vertebrate features. Here we use serial blockface scanning electron microscopy to reconstruct the sensory peripheral nervous system in the tail of a lancelet. The nerves (glial cell/neurite complexes) branch within the dermis and then exit to the epidermis to associate with the perikarya of two kinds of ciliated sensory neurons. The results indicate that cephalochordate neuroglia have an intramedullary origin. Moreover, we suggest that the peripheral nerves in the dermis are, at least in part, comparable to Rohon‐Beard cells of vertebrates, whereas, in contrast, the placode‐ and neural crest‐derived peripheral neurons of vertebrates are evolutionary novelties that appear to have supplanted the epidermal sensory receptors of cephalochordates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serial blockface scanning electron microscopy (SBSEM) is used to describe the sensory peripheral nervous system (PNS) in the tail of a cephalochordate, &lt;i&gt;Asymmetron lucayanum&lt;/i&gt;. The reconstructed region extends from the tail tip to the origin of the most posterior peripheral nerves from the dorsal nerve cord. As peripheral nerves ramify within the dermis, all the nuclei along their course belong to glial cells. Invaginations in the glial cell cytoplasm house the neurites, an association reminiscent of the nonmyelinated Schwann cells of vertebrates. Peripheral nerves pass from the dermis to the epidermis via small fenestrae in the sub‐epidermal collagen fibril layer; most nerves exit abruptly, but a few run obliquely within the collagen fibril layer for many micrometers before exiting. Within the epidermis, each nerve begins ramifying repeatedly, but the branches are too small to be followed to their tips with SBSEM at low magnification (previous studies on other cephalochordates indicate that the branches end freely or in association with epidermal sensory cells). In &lt;i&gt;Asymmetron&lt;/i&gt;, two morphological kinds of sensory cells are scattered in the epidermis, usually singly, but sometimes in pairs, evidently the recent progeny of a single precursor cell. The discussion considers the evolution of the sensory PNS in the phylum Chordata. In cephalochordates, Retzius bipolar neurons with intramedullary perikarya likely correspond to the Rohon‐Beard cells of vertebrates. However, extramedullary neurons originating from ventral epidermis in cephalochordates (and presumably in ancestral chordates) contrast with vertebrate sensory neurons, which arise from placodes and neural crest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors are composed of five subunits arranged around a central chloride channel. The different subunits originate from different genes or gene families. In the mammalian brain, they generally consist of two α‐, two β‐ and one γ‐ or δ‐subunit. The subunit organization crucially determines the physiological and pharmacological properties of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. Here we investigated the distribution of 10 different GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunits in the forebrain of rhesus monkeys. We observed highly heterogeneous distribution patterns of the individual subunits indicating a high number of heterogeneously assembled GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. Their distribution was, however, less distinct in the monkey than in rodents.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors are composed of five subunits arranged around a central chloride channel. Their subunits originate from different genes or gene families. The majority of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the mammalian brain consist of two α‐, two β‐ and one γ‐ or δ‐subunit. This subunit organization crucially determines the physiological and pharmacological properties of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the distribution of 10 GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunits (α1, α2, α3, α4, α5, β1, β2, β3, γ2, and δ) in the fore brain of three female rhesus monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;). Within the cerebral cortex, subunits α1, α5, β2, β3, and γ2 were found in all layers, α2, α3, and β1 were more concentrated in the inner and outer layers. The caudate/putamen was rich in α1, α2, α5, all three β‐subunits, γ2, and δ. Subunits α3 and α5 were more concentrated in the caudate than in the putamen. In contrast, α1, α2, β1, β2, γ2, and δ were highest in the pallidum. Most dorsal thalamic nuclei contained subunits α1, α2, α4, β2, β3, and γ2, whereas α1, α3, β1, and γ2 were most abundant in the reticular nucleus. Within the amygdala, subunits α1, α2, α5, β1, β3, γ2, and δ were concentrated in the cortical nucleus, whereas in the lateral and basolateral amygdala α1, α2, α5, β1, β3, and δ, and in the central amygdala α1, α2, β3, and γ2 were most abundant. Interestingly, subunit α3‐IR outlined the intercalated nuclei of the amygdala. In the hippocampus, subunits α1, α2, α5, β2, β3, γ2, and δ were highly expressed in the dentate molecular layer, whereas α1, α2, α3, α5, β1, β2, β3, and γ2 were concentrated in sector CA1 and the subiculum. The distribution of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunits in the rhesus monkey was highly heterogeneous indicating a high number of differently assembled receptors. In most areas investigated, notably in the striatum/pallidum, amygdaloid nuclei and in the hippocampus it was more diverse than in the rat and mouse indicating a more heterogeneous and less defined receptor assembly in the monkey than in rodent brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Majority of cerebrospinal fluid‐contacting neurons in the spinal cord of C57Bl/6N mice is present in ectopic position unlike in other studied experimental mice strains and mammalian species&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e977db9e-8dde-4d2d-8026-c4a42b4d7899/cne24909-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast with other vertebrate species, vast majority of CSF‐cNs in the spinal cord of C57Bl/6N mice is located in ectopic distal ventral position. Our data indicate that missense mutations in Crb1 and Cyfip2 are responsible for aberrant morphology and ectopic position of CSF‐cNs in C57Bl/6N mice.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerebrospinal fluid contacting neurons (CSF‐cNs) represent a specific class of neurons located in close vicinity of brain ventricles and central canal. In contrast with knowledge gained from other vertebrate species, we found that vast majority of CSF‐cNs in the spinal cord of C57Bl/6N mice is located in ectopic distal ventral position. However, we found that small number of ectopic CSF‐cNs is present also in spinal cord of other investigated experimental mice strains (C57Bl/6J, Balb/C) and mammalian species (Wistar rats, New Zealand White rabbits). Similarly, as the proximal populations, ectopic CSF‐cNs retain PKD2L1‐immunoreactivity and synaptic contacts with other neurons. On the other side, they show rather multipolar morphology lacking thick dendrite contacting central canal lumen. Ectopic CSF‐cNs in the spinal cord of C57Bl/6N mice emerge during whole period devoted to production of CSF‐cNs and reach their ventral destinations during first postnatal weeks. In order to identify major gene, whose impairment could trigger translocation of CSF‐cNs outside the central canal area, we took advantage of close consanguinity of C57Bl/6J substrain with normal CSF‐cN distribution and C57Bl/6N substrain with majority of CSF‐cNs in ectopic position. Employing in silico analyses, we ranked polymorphisms in C57Bl/6N substrain and selected genes &lt;i&gt;Crb1, Cyfip2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Adamts12&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Herpud2&lt;/i&gt; as the most probable candidates, whose product dysfunction might be responsible for the ectopic distribution of CSF‐cNs. Furthermore, segregation analysis of F2 progeny of parental C57Bl/6N and Balb/C mice revealed that polymorphic loci of &lt;i&gt;Crb1 &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Cyfip2&lt;/i&gt; underlie the ectopic position of CSF‐cNs in the spinal cord of C57Bl/6N mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Distribution of aromatase in the brain of the African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni: Aromatase expression, but not estrogen receptors, varies with female reproductive‐state&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4a37dbfd-7425-433d-b17a-aef1abdf78f2/cne24908-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aromatase b&lt;/i&gt;, the gene encoding the aromatase enzyme that synthesizes estrogens, is found primarily in GFAP‐expressing radial glial cells along the ventricles throughout the brain of female African cichlid fish &lt;i&gt;Astatotilapia burtoni&lt;/i&gt;. Transcript levels of &lt;i&gt;aromb&lt;/i&gt; in microdissected brain regions are greater in gravid compared to mouth brooding and recovering females, but levels of estrogen receptors do not change. Brain‐derived estradiol in females may serve important and conserved roles in reproductive‐state plasticity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estrogen synthesis and signaling in the brains of vertebrates has pleotropic effects ranging from neurogenesis to modulation of behaviors. The majority of studies on brain‐derived estrogens focus on males, but estrogenic signaling in females likely plays important roles in regulation of reproductive cycling and social behaviors. We used females of the mouth brooding African cichlid fish, &lt;i&gt;Astatotilapia burtoni&lt;/i&gt;, to test for reproductive state‐dependent changes in estrogenic signaling capacity within microdissected brain nuclei that are important for social behaviors. Expression levels of the rate‐limiting enzyme aromatase, but not estrogen receptors, measured by qPCR changes across the reproductive cycle. Gravid females that are close to spawning had higher aromatase levels in all brain regions compared to females with lower reproductive potential. This brain aromatase expression was positively correlated with circulating estradiol levels and ovarian readiness. Using chromogenic in situ hybridization we localized aromatase‐expressing cells to ependymal regions bordering the ventricles from the forebrain to the hindbrain, and observed more abundant staining in gravid compared to mouth brooding females in most regions. Staining was most prominent in subpallial telencephalic regions, and diencephalic regions of the preoptic area, thalamus, and hypothalamus, but was also observed in sensory and sensorimotor areas of the midbrain and hindbrain. Aromatase expression was observed in radial glial cells, revealed by co‐localization with the glial marker GFAP and absence of co‐localization with the neuronal marker HuC/D. Collectively these results support the idea that brain‐derived estradiol in females may serve important functions in reproductive state‐dependent physiological and behavioral processes across vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Understanding the Pathophysiological Actions of Tau Oligomers: A Critical Review of Current Electrophysiological Approaches</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00155</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tau is a predominantly neuronal protein that is normally bound to microtubules, where it acts to modulate neuronal and axonal stability. In humans, pathological forms of tau are implicated in a range of diseases that are collectively known as tauopathies. Kinases and phosphatases are responsible for maintaining the correct balance of tau phosphorylation to enable axons to be both stable and labile enough to function properly. In the early stages of tauopathies, this balance is interrupted leading to dissociation of tau from microtubules. This leaves microtubules prone to damage and phosphorylated tau prone to aggregation. Initially, phosphorylated tau forms oligomers, then fibrils, and ultimately neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). It is widely accepted that the initial soluble oligomeric forms of tau are probably the most pathologically relevant species but there is relatively little quantitative information to explain exactly what their toxic effects are at the individual neuron level. Electrophysiology provides a valuable tool to help uncover the mechanisms of action of tau oligomers on synaptic transmission within single neurons. Understanding the concentration-, time-, and neuronal compartment-dependent actions of soluble tau oligomers on neuronal and synaptic properties are essential to understanding how best to counteract its effects and to develop effective treatment strategies. Here, we briefly discuss the standard approaches used to elucidate these actions, focusing on the advantages and shortcomings of the experimental procedures. Subsequently, we will describe a new approach that addresses specific challenges with the current methods, thus allowing real-time toxicity evaluation at the single-neuron level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Activation of Type 4 Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Regulates Proliferation and Neuronal Differentiation in a Cultured Rat Retinal Progenitor Cell Through the Suppression of the cAMP/PTEN/AKT Pathway</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00141</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) remain in the eye throughout life and can be characterized by their ability for self-renewal as well as their specialization into different cell types. A recent study has suggested that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) participate in the processes of multiple types of stem cells. Therefore, clarifying the functions of different subtypes of mGluRs in RPCs may provide a novel treatment strategy for regulating the proliferation and differentiation of endogenous RPCs after retinal degeneration. In this study, we observed that mGluR4 was functionally expressed in RPCs, with an effect on cell viability and intracellular cAMP concentration. The activation of mGluR4 by VU0155041 (VU, mGluR4 positive allosteric selective modulator) reduced the number of BrdU&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Pax6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; double-positive cells and Cyclin D1 expression levels while increasing the number of neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (Tuj1)- and Doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells. The knockdown of mGluR4 by target-specific siRNA abolished the effects of VU on RPC proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Further investigation demonstrated that mGluR4 activation inhibited AKT phosphorylation and up-regulated PTEN protein expression. Moreover, the VU0155041-induced inhibition of proliferation and enhancement of neuronal differentiation in RPCs were significantly hampered by Forskolin (adenylyl cyclase activator) and VO-OHpic trihydrate (PTEN inhibitor). In contrast, the effect of LY294002 (a highly selective Akt inhibitor) on proliferation and differentiation was similar to that of VU. These results indicate that mGluR4 activation can suppress proliferation and promote the neural differentiation of cultured rat RPCs through the cAMP/PTEN/AKT pathway. Our research lays the foundation for further pharmacological work exploring a novel potential therapy for several retinal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Neurophysiological and Genetic Findings in Patients With Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy</title>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive procedure, stimulates the cortex evaluating the central motor pathways. The response is called motor evoked potential (MEP). Polyphasia results when the response crosses the baseline more than twice (zero crossing). Recent research shows MEP polyphasia in patients with generalized genetic epilepsy (GGE) and their first-degree relatives compared with controls. Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME), a GGE type, is not well studied regarding polyphasia. In our study, we assessed polyphasia appearance probability with TMS in JME patients, their healthy first-degree relatives and controls. Two genetic approaches were applied to uncover genetic association with polyphasia.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;20 JME patients, 23 first-degree relatives and 30 controls underwent TMS, obtaining 10–15 MEPs per participant. We evaluated MEP mean number of phases, proportion of MEP trials displaying polyphasia for each subject and variability between groups. Participants underwent whole exome sequencing (WES) via trio-based analysis and two-case scenario. Extensive bioinformatics analysis was applied.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We identified increased polyphasia in patients (85%) and relatives (70%) compared to controls (47%) and significantly higher mean number of zero crossings (i.e., occurrence of phases) (patients 1.49, relatives 1.46, controls 1.22; p &amp;lt; 0.05). Trio-based analysis revealed a candidate polymorphism, p.Glu270del,in SYT14 (Synaptotagmin 14), in JME patients and their relatives presenting polyphasia. Sanger sequencing analysis in remaining participants showed no significant association. In two-case scenario, a machine learning approach was applied in variants identified from odds ratio analysis and risk prediction scores were obtained for polyphasia. The results revealed 61 variants of which none was associated with polyphasia. Risk prediction scores indeed showed lower probability for non-polyphasic subjects on having polyphasia and higher probability for polyphasic subjects on having polyphasia.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Polyphasia was present in JME patients and relatives in contrast to controls. Although no known clinical symptoms are linked to polyphasia this neurophysiological phenomenon is likely due to common cerebral electrophysiological abnormality. We did not discover direct association between genetic variants obtained and polyphasia. It is likely these genetic traits alone cannot provoke polyphasia, however, this predisposition combined with disturbed brain-electrical activity and tendency to generate seizures may increase the risk of developing polyphasia, mainly in patients and relatives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Novel Therapeutic Approaches for the Treatment of Retinal Degenerative Diseases: Focus on CRISPR/Cas-Based Gene Editing</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inherited retinal diseases encompass a highly heterogenous group of disorders caused by a wide range of genetic variants and with diverse clinical symptoms that converge in the common trait of retinal degeneration. Indeed, mutations in over 270 genes have been associated with some form of retinal degenerative phenotype. Given the immune privileged status of the eye, cell replacement and gene augmentation therapies have been envisioned. While some of these approaches, such as delivery of genes through recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors, have been successfully tested in clinical trials, not all patients will benefit from current advancements due to their underlying genotype or phenotypic traits. Gene editing arises as an alternative therapeutic strategy seeking to correct mutations at the endogenous locus and rescue normal gene expression. Hence, gene editing technologies can in principle be tailored for treating retinal degeneration. Here we provide an overview of the different gene editing strategies that are being developed to overcome the challenges imposed by the post-mitotic nature of retinal cell types. We further discuss their advantages and drawbacks as well as the hurdles for their implementation in treating retinal diseases, which include the broad range of mutations and, in some instances, the size of the affected genes. Although therapeutic gene editing is at an early stage of development, it has the potential of enriching the portfolio of personalized molecular medicines directed at treating genetic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: EEG Changes in Time and Time-Frequency Domain During Movement Preparation and Execution in Stroke Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00827</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study investigated electroencephalogram (EEG) changes during movement preparation and execution in stroke patients. EEG-based event-related potential (ERP) technology was used to measure brain activity changes. Seventeen stroke patients participated in this study and completed ERP tests that were designed to measure EEG changes during unilateral upper limb movements in preparation and execution stages, with Instruction Response Movement (IRM) and Cued Instruction Response Movement (CIRM) paradigms. EEG data were analyzed using motor potential (MP) in the time domain and the mu-rhythm and beta frequency band response mean value (R-means) in the time–frequency domain. In IRM, the MP amplitude at Cz was higher during hemiplegic arm movement than during unaffected arm movement. MP latency was shorter at Cz and the contralesional motor cortex during hemiplegic arm movement in CIRM compared to IRM. No significant differences were found in R-means among locations, between movement sides in both ERP tests. This study presents the brain activity changes in the time and time–frequency domains in stroke patients during movement preparation and execution and supports the contralesional compensation and adjacent-region compensation mechanism of post-stroke brain reconstruction. These findings may contribute to future rehabilitation research about neuroplasticity and technology development such as the brain–computer interface.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Mitochondrial Function in Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia: Deficits in SPG7 but Not SPAST Patient-Derived Stem Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00820</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in SPG7 and SPAST are common causes of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). While some SPG7 mutations cause paraplegin deficiency, other SPG7 mutations cause increased paraplegin expression. Mitochondrial function has been studied in models that are paraplegin-deficient (human, mouse, and Drosophila models with large exonic deletions, null mutations, or knockout models) but not in models of mutations that express paraplegin. Here, we evaluated mitochondrial function in olfactory neurosphere-derived cells, derived from patients with a variety of SPG7 mutations that express paraplegin and compared them to cells derived from healthy controls and HSP patients with SPAST mutations, as a disease control. We quantified paraplegin expression and an extensive range of mitochondrial morphology measures (fragmentation, interconnectivity, and mass), mitochondrial function measures (membrane potential, oxidative phosphorylation, and oxidative stress), and cell proliferation. Compared to control cells, SPG7 patient cells had increased paraplegin expression, fragmented mitochondria with low interconnectivity, reduced mitochondrial mass, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced oxidative phosphorylation, reduced ATP content, increased mitochondrial oxidative stress, and reduced cellular proliferation. Mitochondrial dysfunction was specific to SPG7 patient cells and not present in SPAST patient cells, which displayed mitochondrial functions similar to control cells. The mitochondrial dysfunction observed here in SPG7 patient cells that express paraplegin was similar to the dysfunction reported in cell models without paraplegin expression. The p.A510V mutation was common to all patients and was the likely species associated with increased expression, albeit seemingly non-functional. The lack of a mitochondrial phenotype in SPAST patient cells indicates genotype-specific mechanisms of disease in these HSP patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Development and Reorganization of Orientation Representation in the Cat Visual Cortex: Experience-Dependent Synaptic Rewiring in Early Life</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00041</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00041</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;To date, numerous mathematical models have been proposed on the basis of some types of Hebbian synaptic learning to account for the activity-dependent development of orientation maps as well as neuronal orientation selectivity. These models successfully reproduced orientation map-like spatial patterns. Nevertheless, we still have questions: (1) How does synaptic rewiring occur in the visual cortex during the formation of orderly orientation maps in early life? (2) How does visual experience contribute to the maturation of orientation selectivity of visual cortical neurons and reorganize orientation maps? (3) How does the sensitive period for orientation plasticity end? In this study, we performed animal experiments and mathematical modeling to understand the mechanisms underlying synaptic rewiring for experience-dependent formation and reorganization of orientation maps. At first, we visualized orientation maps from the intrinsic signal optical imaging in area 17 of kittens reared under single-orientation exposure through cylindrical-lens-fitted goggles. The experiments revealed that the degree of expansion of cortical domains representing the experienced orientation depends on the age at which the single-orientation exposure starts. As a result, we obtained the sensitive period profile for orientation plasticity. Next, we refined our previously proposed mathematical model for the activity-dependent self-organization of thalamo-cortical inputs on the assumption that rewiring is caused by the competitive interactions among transient synaptic contacts on the same dendritic spine. Although various kinds of molecules have been reported to be involved in such interactions, we attempt to build a mathematical model to describe synaptic rewiring focusing on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its related molecules. Performing computer simulations based on the refined model, we successfully reproduced orientation maps reorganized in kittens reared under single-orientation exposure as well as normal visual experience. We also reproduced the experimentally obtained sensitive period profile for orientation plasticity. The excellent agreement between experimental observations and theoretical reproductions suggests that the BDNF-induced competitive interaction among synaptic contacts from different axons on the same spine is an important factor for the experience-dependent formation and reorganization of orientation selectivity and orientation maps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: To investigate the long-term effects on cognition and brain function after installing treadmill workstations in offices for 13 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Eighty healthy overweight or obese office workers aged 40–67 years were individually randomized to an intervention group, receiving a treadmill workstation and encouraging emails, or to a control group, continuing to work as usual. Effects on cognitive function, hippocampal volume, prefrontal cortex (PFC) thickness, and circulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were analyzed. Further, mediation analyses between changes in walking time and light-intensity physical activity (LPA) on changes in BDNF and hippocampal volume between baseline and 13 months, and multivariate analyses of the baseline data with percentage sitting time as the response variable, were performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: No group by time interactions were observed for any of the outcomes. In the mediation analyses, positive associations between changes in walking time and LPA on changes in hippocampal volume were observed, although not mediated by changes in BDNF levels. In the multivariate analyses, a negative association between percentage sitting time and hippocampal volume was observed, however only among those older than 51 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Although no group by time interactions were observed, our analyses suggest that increased walking and LPA may have positive effects on hippocampal volume and that sedentary behavior is associated with brain structures of importance for memory functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trial Registration: www.ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01997970.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dynamic Responses of Microglia in Animal Models of Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00269</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglia play an essential role in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis, as well as responding to injury and disease. Most neurological disorders feature microglial activation, a process whereby microglia undergo profound morphological and transcriptional changes aimed at containing CNS damage and promoting repair, but often resulting in overt inflammation that sustains and propagates the neurodegenerative process. This is especially evident in multiple sclerosis (MS), were microglial activation and microglia-driven neuroinflammation are considered key events in the onset, progression, and resolution of the disease. Our understanding of microglial functions in MS has widened exponentially in the last decade by way of new tools and markers to discriminate microglia from other myeloid populations. Consequently, the complex functional and phenotypical diversity of microglia can now be appreciated. This, in combination with a variety of animal models that mimic specific features and processes of MS, has contributed to filling the gap of knowledge in the cascade of events underlying MS pathophysiology. The purpose of this review is to present the most up to date knowledge of the dynamic responses of microglia in the commonly used animal models of MS, specifically the immune-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, and the chemically-induced cuprizone and lysolecithin models. Elucidating the spectrum of microglial functions in these models, from detrimental to protective, is essential to identify emerging targets for therapy and guide drug discovery efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Use of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells as a Model for Developmental Eye Disorders</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Approximately one-third of childhood blindness is attributed to developmental eye disorders, of which 80% have a genetic cause. Eye morphogenesis is tightly regulated by a highly conserved network of transcription factors when disrupted by genetic mutations can result in severe ocular malformation. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are an attractive tool to study early eye development as they are more physiologically relevant than animal models, can be patient-specific and their use does not elicit the ethical concerns associated with human embryonic stem cells. The generation of self-organizing hiPSC-derived optic cups is a major advancement to understanding mechanisms of ocular development and disease. Their development in vitro has been found to mirror that of the human eye and these early organoids have been used to effectively model microphthalmia caused by a VSX2 variant. hiPSC-derived optic cups, retina, and cornea organoids are powerful tools for future modeling of disease phenotypes and will enable a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of many other developmental eye disorders. These models will also provide an effective platform for identifying molecular therapeutic targets and for future clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Role of Cold-Sensitive Ion Channels in Peripheral Thermosensation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00262</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00262</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The detection of ambient cold is critical for mammals, who use this information to avoid tissue damage by cold and to maintain stable body temperature. The transduction of information about the environmental cold is mediated by cold-sensitive ion channels expressed in peripheral sensory nerve endings in the skin. Most transduction mechanisms for detecting temperature changes identified to date depend on transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels. Mild cooling is detected by the menthol-sensitive TRPM8 ion channel, but how painful cold is detected remains unclear. The TRPA1 ion channel, which is activated by cold in expression systems, seemed to provide an answer to this question, but whether TRPA1 is activated by cold in neurons and contributes to the sensation of cold pain continues to be a matter of debate. Recent advances have been made in this area of investigation with the identification of several potential cold-sensitive ion channels in thermosensory neurons, including two-pore domain potassium channels (K2P), GluK2 glutamate receptors, and CNGA3 cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels. This mini-review gives a brief overview of the way by which ion channels contribute to cold sensation, discusses the controversy around the cold-sensitivity of TRPA1, and provides an assessment of some recently-proposed novel cold-transduction mechanisms. Evidence for another unidentified cold-transduction mechanism is also presented.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To identify the novel projections received by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting nucleus from the subcortex and limbic system to understand the biological functions of the nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The cholera toxin subunit B (CB), a retrograde tracer, was injected into the CSF-contacting nucleus in Sprague–Dawley rats. After 7–10 days, the surviving rats were perfused, and the whole brain and spinal cord were sliced for CB immunofluorescence detection. The CB-positive neurons in the subcortex and limbic system were observed under a fluorescence microscope, followed by 3D reconstructed with the imaris software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: CB-positive neurons were found in the basal forebrain, septum, periventricular organs, preoptic area, and amygdaloid structures. Five functional areas including 46 sub-regions sent projections to the CSF-contacting nucleus. However, the projections had different densities, ranging from sparse to moderate, to dense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: According to the projections from the subcortex and limbic system, we hypothesize that the CSF-contacting nucleus participates in emotion, cognition, homeostasis regulation, visceral activity, pain, and addiction. In this study, we illustrate the novel projections from the subcortex and limbic system to the CSF-contacting nucleus, which underlies the diverse and complicated circuits of the nucleus in body regulations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Quality of life (QoL) was worse in Parkinson’s disease patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) or dementia (PDD) than PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC). The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the potential heterogeneous determinants of QoL in PD patients with different cognitive statuses.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We recruited 600 PD patients, including 185 PD-NC patients, 336 PD-MCI patients and 79 PDD patients, in this cross-sectional study. All patients completed the QoL assessment by the 39-item Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), as well as clinical evaluations and neuropsychological tests. The determinants of the QoL were analyzed by multiple stepwise regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;QoL was more impaired across the three groups (PD-NC &amp;lt; PD-MCI &amp;lt; PDD). The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) score, Geriatric Depression Rating Scale (GDS) score and daily levodopa equivalent dose (LED) were independent variables of PDQ-39 in PD-NC patients. The GDS score, disease duration, UPDRS-III score, Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS) and sex were independent variables of PDQ-39 in PD-MCI patients. The GDS score and disease duration were independent variables of PDQ-39 in PDD patients.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The determinants of QoL in PD-NC, PD-MCI and PDD patients were heterogeneous. Motor function was considered to be the most crucial determinant for QoL in PD-NC, while depression was indicated to be the most vital determinant for PD-MCI and PDD. For QoL improvement, clinicians might need to focus more on motor function in PD-NC patients and on depression in PD-MCI and PDD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In 1907, Alois Alzheimer observed, as he quoted, development of “numerous fibers” and “adipose saccules” in the brain of his diseased patient Auguste Deter. The neurodegenerative disease became known as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. AD normally develops with aging and is mostly initiated because of the imbalance between the formation and clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ). Formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of hyperphosphorylated tau is another hallmark of AD. Neuroinflammation plays a significant role in the development and pathology of AD. This chapter explores the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia in case of AD. Mitochondrial oxidative stress in microglia has been linked to the development of AD. Elevated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential through various mechanisms have been observed in AD. Aβ interacts with microglial receptors, such as triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), activating downstream pathways causing mitochondrial damage and aggravating inflammation and cytotoxicity. Fibrillar Aβ activates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase in microglia leading to elevated induction of mitochondrial ROS which further causes neurotoxicity. Elevated ROS in microglia causes activation of inflammatory and cell death pathways. Production of ATP, regulation of mitochondrial health, autophagy, and mitophagy in microglia play significant roles in the AD pathology. Understanding microglial physiology and mitochondrial dysfunction will enable better therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
